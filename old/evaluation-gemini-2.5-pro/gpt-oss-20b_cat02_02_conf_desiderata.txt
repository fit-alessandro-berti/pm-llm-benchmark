7.0/10.0

**Grading Rationale:**

The answer is exceptionally well-structured, clear, and demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the difference between normative rules and desiderata. The use of tables, summaries, and actionable recommendations is excellent. For the most part, the analysis is accurate and insightful.

However, the grading instructions require hypercritical evaluation and a significant penalty for any inaccuracies. The answer contains a clear and undeniable factual error:

*   **Incorrect Calculation:** In the "Desideratum-level deviations" table for **Case 3**, the answer states that the time between *Application Received* (`Jan 12 09:00`) and *Credit Check* (`Jan 14 10:00`) is ">72 h". This is incorrect. The actual duration is 49 hours (2 days and 1 hour). While this is still a violation of the " 24 h" desideratum, stating it as over 72 hours is a significant misrepresentation of the data.

This type of calculation error, while not altering the final conclusion that a deviation occurred, is a notable flaw in an otherwise precise analysis. Under the strict grading rubric, an answer cannot be considered "nearly flawless" with such a mistake. The rest of the answer is of a 9.5-10.0 quality, but this error forces a substantial reduction in the score.
