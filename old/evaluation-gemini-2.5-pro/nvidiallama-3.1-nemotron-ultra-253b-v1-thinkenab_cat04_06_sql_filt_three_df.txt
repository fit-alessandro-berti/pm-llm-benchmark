**Evaluation:**

The provided query is largely correct and demonstrates a good understanding of SQL, window functions, and sequence analysis. It correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to establish event order within cases and then self-joins to identify the specific three-event sequence. The time condition and final exclusion logic are also correctly implemented.

However, the prompt asks for evaluation with "utmost strictness" and to be "hypercritical," where "even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score."

**Strengths:**
1.  **Correct Sequence Identification:** The use of `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn` combined with `e2.rn = e1.rn + 1` and `e3.rn = e2.rn + 1` correctly identifies events in direct succession as per the linearized order defined by `timestamp`.
2.  **Correct Activity Check:** The `WHERE` clause correctly filters for the specified activities in `e1`, `e2`, and `e3`.
3.  **Correct Time Condition:** `(e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY` accurately checks the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' (e2) and 'Confirm Order' (e3) events. The DuckDB interval syntax is correct.
4.  **Correct Case Exclusion:** The `SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id` in `problematic_cases` and the final `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` correctly identify and exclude all events from cases meeting the criteria.
5.  **Handles "at least columns":** Using `SELECT *` in `row_numbers` and the final `SELECT` ensures all original columns are preserved for non-excluded events.

**Minor Issues (leading to deduction from a perfect score under "hypercritical" grading):**

1.  **Verbosity/Complexity for Fixed Sequence:** For identifying a fixed short sequence (current event, next event, next-next event), using `LEAD()` window functions twice would be a more direct, concise, and often more readable approach in modern SQL.
    ```sql
    -- Alternative using LEAD
    WITH EventDetails AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_2,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_2
        FROM event_log
    ),
    ProblematicCases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM EventDetails
        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND next_activity_1 = 'Create Order'
          AND next_activity_2 = 'Confirm Order'
          AND (next_timestamp_2 - next_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
    )
    -- ... rest of the query remains the same
    ```
    While the `ROW_NUMBER()` and self-join approach is powerful and generalizable for more complex patterns, for this specific problem, it's more verbose (three references to `row_numbers` CTE, two explicit joins) than the `LEAD` function approach which would typically involve one CTE and no explicit self-joins. In a "hypercritical" evaluation, not choosing the most straightforward idiomatic SQL for a common task like this can be seen as a minor inelegance.

2.  **Potential Non-Determinism with Timestamp Ties:** If multiple events within the same `case_id` can have the exact same `timestamp`, the `ROW_NUMBER()` function will still assign unique, sequential numbers, but the order among these tied-timestamp events might be non-deterministic (unless DuckDB has a consistent implicit tie-breaker, or if other columns were added to `ORDER BY`). If such non-determinism affects whether the target sequence is formed, the query might yield inconsistent results on identical datasets if internal row ordering changes. While this is often a data issue, a "hypercritical" review might expect a note on this or a more robust tie-breaking mechanism if the data could present this ambiguity (e.g., if an `event_id` column exists and could be used as a tie-breaker). The prompt does not provide for such a tie-breaker, so the solution is reasonable given the input, but the implication of potential timestamp ties is a subtle point.

These are minor points. The query is functionally correct and robust for most common interpretations and data scenarios. However, adhering to the "hypercritical" standard, the slight verbosity compared to a `LEAD`-based solution for this specific pattern and the unaddressed theoretical non-determinism with timestamp ties prevent a perfect score. The solution is very good, but not "flawless" in the absolute sense of elegance and handling all theoretical data subtleties without comment.
