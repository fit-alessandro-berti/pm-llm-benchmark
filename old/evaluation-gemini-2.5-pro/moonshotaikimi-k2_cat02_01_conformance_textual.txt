**Grade: 7.0/10.0**

**Evaluation Rationale:**

The answer correctly identifies which cases are compliant and which are not. The explanations provided for the violations are clear, well-structured in a table, and correctly reference the normative description. However, the evaluation was conducted under a "hypercritical" standard, and the answer contains a significant analytical omission and a minor inconsistency, which warrant a substantial deduction from a perfect score.

**Strengths:**

*   **Correct Classification:** The answer correctly classifies all five cases as either compliant or non-compliant.
*   **Clear Violation Identification:** For each non-compliant case, the answer identifies a valid and explicit violation of the rules stated in the normative description.
*   **Good Structure and Clarity:** The use of a markdown table is highly effective. The explanations are concise, and the use of bolding and quotations enhances readability and directly links the findings to the source text.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **Incomplete Analysis of Case 3 (Major Flaw):** The answer identifies that Case 3 violates the rule "no shipping after cancellation." While this is correct, it misses a more fundamental violation that occurs earlier in the case. The normative description presents two mutually exclusive paths following "Check inventory":
    *   If inventory is sufficient: proceed to "Authorize payment."
    *   If inventory is insufficient: proceed to "Cancel order."
    Case 3 executes **both** "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order," which violates this core branching logic. The process authorizes payment as if it intends to fulfill the order, and then cancels it. The provided answer fails to identify or explain this structural deviation, presenting an incomplete picture of why Case 3 is non-compliant. The prompt asks to explain the "violations" (plural), and a key one was missed.

2.  **Inconsistent Spelling (Minor Flaw):** The answer uses the spelling "Authori**s**e payment" in the explanation for Case 2. The source text (both the normative description and the event log) consistently uses "Authori**z**e payment." Under a hypercritical review, this inconsistency demonstrates a lack of meticulous attention to detail.

**Conclusion:**

The answer provides a good high-level analysis but lacks the depth and precision required for a top score. The failure to identify the primary logical contradiction in Case 3 is a significant analytical weakness. While the identified violations are correct, the analysis is not exhaustive. Therefore, according to the strict grading criteria, the score is substantially reduced.
