8.5

**Assumptions:**

1.  Each row in the `Order Lines` table represents a distinct "Item Picked" event.
2.  Each row in the `Delivery` table results in two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
3.  `carrier_id` acts as the resource for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events.
4.  `picker_id`, `sales_person_id`, and `billing_person_id` are the resources for "Item Picked", "Order Created", and "Invoice Issued" events, respectively.
5.  Resource names are mapped using the `Resources` table.
6.  No specific resource could be identified for "Payment Received" events from the provided data; the Resource column is left blank for these.
7.  The provided data for `order_id` 1004 does not include delivery or invoice information. Therefore, related events ("Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", "Payment Received") are absent for this case in the log.
8.  The "Other Attributes" column includes relevant context like `item_id` for picking, `invoice_id` for invoicing/payments, `payment_method` for payments, and `delivery_id` for delivery events.
