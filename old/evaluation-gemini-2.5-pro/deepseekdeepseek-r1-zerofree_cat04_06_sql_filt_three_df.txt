**7.5/10.0**

**Critique:**

1.  **Core Logic Correctness:** The query correctly identifies the core logic required by the prompt. It uses window functions (`LEAD`) appropriately to find the subsequent two events within each case, ordered by timestamp. It correctly checks for the specific activity sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'). It accurately calculates the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events (`next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp`) and applies the `> INTERVAL 5 DAY` condition. Finally, it correctly uses this information to identify the `case_id`s to be excluded and filters the original `event_log` using `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)`.

2.  **Handling of "Direct Succession":** The use of `LEAD(..., 1)` and `LEAD(..., 2)` perfectly captures the requirement for "direct succession" – meaning no other recorded event for the same case occurs between the three specified activities according to the timestamp ordering.

3.  **Potential Non-Determinism (Major Issue under Strict Grading):** The `OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)` clause does not specify a tie-breaker. If multiple events within the same `case_id` share the exact same `timestamp`, the ordering of those events is not guaranteed, and the `LEAD` function might return different results across different query executions or database versions. This non-determinism could lead to inconsistency in identifying the sequence, potentially including or excluding cases incorrectly depending on the arbitrary order chosen by the engine for tied timestamps. A robust solution should include a deterministic tie-breaker in the `ORDER BY` clause (e.g., `ORDER BY timestamp, unique_event_id` if such a column existed). Since the prompt implies other columns *might* exist ("at least the following columns"), failing to account for potential ties is a significant oversight under hypercritical evaluation.

4.  **Use of `NOT IN` vs. `NOT EXISTS` (Minor Issue):** The query uses `WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)`. While functionally correct *if* `case_id` is guaranteed to be non-NULL in both the `event_log` table and the `cases_to_exclude` CTE, the `NOT EXISTS` pattern is generally considered safer and sometimes more performant in SQL. `NOT IN` behaves unexpectedly if the subquery returns any `NULL` values (the entire `NOT IN` condition evaluates to `UNKNOWN`). While `case_id` is unlikely to be NULL, relying on this assumption without certainty is a minor weakness. Using `WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM cases_to_exclude cte WHERE cte.case_id = e.case_id)` would be more robust.

5.  **Clarity and Structure:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `ordered_events` and `cases_to_exclude` significantly improves the readability and maintainability of the query. The steps are logically separated.

6.  **Syntax:** The syntax used (`LEAD`, `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, timestamp subtraction) is valid and appropriate for DuckDB and standard SQL.

**Summary:**

The query successfully implements the requested logic using appropriate SQL features. However, the failure to ensure deterministic ordering in the presence of potential timestamp ties is a notable flaw when judged with "utmost strictness". The use of `NOT IN` instead of the generally safer `NOT EXISTS` is a secondary, minor point. Therefore, despite getting the main logic right, these issues prevent a top score under the harsh grading criteria specified.
