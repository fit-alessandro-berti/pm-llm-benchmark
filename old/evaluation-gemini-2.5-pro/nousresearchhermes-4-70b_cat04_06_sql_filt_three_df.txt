### Evaluation Justification

The provided answer is flawless. It correctly and efficiently solves all parts of the prompt using a clear, well-structured, and idiomatic SQL query.

1.  **Correctness of Logic:**
    *   **Direct Succession:** The use of `LEAD(activity, 1)` and `LEAD(activity, 2)` is the most direct and correct way to check for a sequence of three immediately consecutive events within a partitioned group (`case_id`). This perfectly satisfies the "no other event... in between" requirement.
    *   **Timing Condition:** The query correctly calculates the time elapsed between the second and third events in the sequence (`next_ts2 - next_ts1`) and applies the `> INTERVAL '5 days'` filter. This is precise and accurate.
    *   **Exclusion Logic:** The final `SELECT ... WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` correctly filters out *all* events belonging to any case that was identified as problematic, fulfilling the main requirement of the prompt.

2.  **Code Quality and Structure:**
    *   **Readability:** The use of two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with descriptive names (`with_leads`, `problem_sequences`) makes the query's logic exceptionally easy to follow. Each CTE handles a distinct logical step.
    *   **Efficiency:** Using window functions is generally the most performant approach for this type of sequential analysis, far superior to alternatives like multiple self-joins. The solution is well-optimized for a columnar engine like DuckDB.
    *   **Completeness:** The query addresses every single constraint and requirement laid out in the prompt without any ambiguity or shortcuts.

3.  **Absence of Flaws:**
    *   There are no syntax errors or logical inaccuracies.
    *   It correctly handles cases that might have the sequence multiple times (the case is correctly identified and excluded once).
    *   It correctly handles cases that have part of the sequence or the activities in a different order.
    *   The final selection `SELECT * FROM event_log` ensures all original columns are returned for the non-excluded cases, as requested.

This solution is a textbook example of how to solve this complex sequential pattern analysis problem in modern SQL. It is robust, efficient, and perfectly aligned with the prompt's requirements.
