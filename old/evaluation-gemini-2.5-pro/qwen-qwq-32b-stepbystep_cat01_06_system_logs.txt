**Explanation of Logic:**

1.  **Case Identification:**
    *   The `Case ID` is derived primarily from the `Window` title associated with each event in the raw log. This assumes that user work is typically centered around specific documents, emails, or application windows.
    *   Each unique window title (e.g., "Document1.docx", "Email - Inbox", "Report_Draft.pdf", "Budget_2024.xlsx", "Quarterly_Report.docx") represents a distinct process instance or case.
    *   Events related to interactions within a specific window are grouped under that window's Case ID.
    *   Crucially, `SWITCH` events, which signify a transition *away* from a window, are assigned to the Case ID of the *source* window (`FromWindow`). This reflects the action of leaving that specific case context. The subsequent events occurring in the destination window (`ToWindow`) belong to the destination window's case.

2.  **Activity Naming:**
    *   Raw actions (FOCUS, TYPING, CLICK, etc.) were translated into more descriptive, higher-level activity names suitable for process analysis.
    *   `FOCUS` events were interpreted based on context: the first FOCUS on a window is mapped to "Open Document" (or "Open Spreadsheet"), signifying the start of work in that case. Subsequent FOCUS events on the same window (like the one for `Quarterly_Report.docx` at 09:07:15) are mapped to "Resume Work".
    *   `TYPING` is generally mapped to "Edit Content" for documents/spreadsheets and "Compose Response" for email replies.
    *   `CLICK` events in the email client were mapped based on the specific `Action` detail provided (e.g., "Open Email", "Reply to Email", "Send Email").
    *   `SAVE`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT`, and `CLOSE` were mapped to corresponding intuitive activities like "Save Document", "Review Email/Report", "Annotate Report", and "Close Document".
    *   `SWITCH` events were named descriptively based on the destination application type (e.g., "Switch to Email", "Switch to PDF", "Switch to Document").

This approach aims to create a coherent event log where each case traces the user's interaction with a specific work item (document, email thread, report, spreadsheet), including the explicit actions taken within that context and the points where the user switched context to another task. The addition of `App` and `Window Title` as attributes provides further context for analysis.
