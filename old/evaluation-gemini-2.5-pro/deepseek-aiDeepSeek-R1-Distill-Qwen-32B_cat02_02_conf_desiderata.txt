**9.0 / 10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Normative Rule Violations (Case 2):**
    *   (+) Correctly identifies Case 2 as violating normative rules.
    *   (+) Accurately pinpoints the two specific violations: incorrect sequence (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and unauthorized action (Finalize Documentation after rejection). This section is accurate and complete.

2.  **Desiderata Failures (Case 3):**
    *   (+) Correctly identifies Case 3 as failing desiderata.
    *   (+) Accurately lists the three failures: delayed Credit Check, delayed Inform Applicant, and missing Follow-up Call.
    *   (-) Minor Imprecision: Stating Inform Applicant occurred "48 hours after the loan was approved" is slightly less precise than saying "more than 48 hours after" or "outside the recommended 48-hour window". The actual delay was over 51 hours. While the point that it violated the desideratum is correct, the phrasing could be more exact under hypercritical review.

3.  **Justifications and Interpretations:**
    *   (+) Provides plausible and relevant interpretations for the deviations in both Case 2 and Case 3.
    *   (+) Uses appropriate cautious language ("might have," "could be") reflecting that these are interpretations.
    *   (+) The summary correctly distinguishes between the nature of the issues in Case 2 (rule violations) and Case 3 (best practice failures).

**Overall:**

*   The answer successfully addresses all parts of the prompt.
*   It demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between normative rules and desiderata.
*   The identification of specific violations and failures is accurate.
*   The justifications are logical and well-phrased.

**Reason for Deduction (Hypercritical):**

*   The minor imprecision in describing the timing failure for "Inform Applicant" in Case 3 prevents a perfect score under the strict evaluation criteria. While functionally correct in identifying the failure, the phrasing could be slightly sharper.

The answer is very strong, accurate, and well-structured, but the slight imprecision in wording under hypercritical scrutiny leads to a minor deduction from a perfect score.
