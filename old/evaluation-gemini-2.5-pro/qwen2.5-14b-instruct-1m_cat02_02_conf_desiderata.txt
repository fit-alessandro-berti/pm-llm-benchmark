**4.0/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

1.  **Accuracy of Normative Violations:**
    *   **Case 2 (RA before CC):** Correctly identified. However, the answer states "Credit Check at 08:20, Risk Assessment at 08:00". The event log shows Risk Assessment at 08:20 and Credit Check at 09:00. While the conclusion (RA occurred before CC) is correct, citing incorrect timestamps from the provided data is a significant accuracy flaw under strict evaluation. (-1.5 points)
    *   **Case 2 (FD after Rejection):** Correctly identified and explained. (+0 points)
    *   **Missed Normative Violation (Case 2):** The answer fails to identify that the 'Inform Applicant' activity is completely missing in Case 2. According to the normative sequence (Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...), skipping this required step is a normative violation. This is a major omission. (-2.5 points)
    *   **Case 1 & 3:** Correctly implies these have no normative violations by omitting them. (+0 points)

2.  **Accuracy of Desiderata Failures:**
    *   **Case 3 (Delayed CC):** Correctly identified and explained. (+0 points)
    *   **Case 3 (Delayed IA):** Correctly identified and explained. (+0 points)
    *   **Case 3 (Missing Follow-up Call):** Correctly identified. (+0 points)
    *   **Missed Desiderata Failures (Case 1 & 2):** The answer fails to mention that the optional 'Follow-up Call' was also missed in Case 1 and Case 2 (as it wasn't logged before 'Close Case'). The prompt asks "which cases fail", implying all relevant cases should be listed. (-1.0 points)

3.  **Clarity and Explanation:**
    *   The explanations for the identified violations/failures are generally clear and reference the rules/desiderata. (+0 points)
    *   The structure separates normative and desiderata well. (+0 points)
    *   The repeated heading "Case 2:" under normative violations is slightly redundant but not a major flaw. (-0 points)

4.  **Interpretations/Justifications:**
    *   Provides plausible, albeit standard, justifications (error, oversight, workload, system issues). (+0 points)
    *   Suggests potential remedies, which adds some value. (+0 points)
    *   The justification for "Credit Check After Risk Assessment" acknowledges non-compliance but the phrasing about a "potential workaround" being reviewed post-assessment is slightly speculative and doesn't fully excuse the initial error. It correctly lands on procedural error/oversight. (-0.5 points)

5.  **Overall Strictness:** Applying hypercritical grading: The incorrect timestamp citation shows a lack of careful reading. Missing a required normative step ('Inform Applicant' in Case 2) is a critical failure in process analysis. Missing the desiderata failures in Cases 1 and 2 demonstrates incomplete analysis. These issues substantially lower the score from a potential high mark.

**Summary of Deductions:**
- Incorrect Timestamps (Accuracy): -1.5
- Missed Normative Violation (Completeness/Accuracy): -2.5
- Missed Desiderata Violations (Completeness): -1.0
- Minor Justification Phrasing (Clarity): -0.5
- **Total Deductions:** -5.5 points from 10.0 -> 4.5. Rounding down slightly due to the severity of missing a normative violation and the explicit instruction for hypercritical evaluation.

**Final Grade: 4.0**
