### Evaluation Justification:

The provided solution is flawless. It correctly interprets the prompt and delivers a query that is not only accurate but also exemplifies best practices in SQL for clarity and readability.

1.  **Correctness:** The query's logic is perfectly sound. It correctly uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first identify the `case_id`s that meet the criteria (6 or fewer events) and then joins this set back to the original table to retrieve the complete event data for only those cases. This two-step process is a standard and robust way to solve this type of filtering problem.

2.  **Readability and Structure:** The use of a CTE (`WITH valid_cases AS ...`) makes the query exceptionally readable. It logically separates the problem into two distinct parts: identifying the valid cases and then selecting their data. This is often preferred over a more nested subquery in the `WHERE` clause for complex logic.

3.  **Completeness:** The query is complete and includes a thoughtful `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` clause. While not explicitly required by the prompt, this is a highly practical addition for process analysis, as it ensures the events within each case are returned in chronological order. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem's context.

4.  **Efficiency:** For a modern analytical database like DuckDB, this CTE and JOIN approach is highly efficient. The query planner can optimize the execution effectively.

In summary, the answer is a model solution. It is accurate, efficient, well-structured, and easy to understand. There are no logical flaws or inaccuracies to penalize.

### Solution Provided:
```sql
WITH valid_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN valid_cases v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```
