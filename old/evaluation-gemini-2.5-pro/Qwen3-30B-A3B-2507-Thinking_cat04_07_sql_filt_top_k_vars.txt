10.0

**Grading Rationale:**

The provided solution is flawless and represents a textbook-perfect answer to the prompt.

*   **Correctness (10/10):** The query is logically sound and correctly implements all four requirements of the prompt.
    1.  **Sequence Extraction:** It correctly uses `ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` which is the idiomatic and most accurate way to generate an ordered sequence per case in DuckDB.
    2.  **Variant Grouping & Counting:** It correctly groups by the generated array (`activity_sequence`) to identify unique variants and then counts their frequency.
    3.  **Top K Selection:** It correctly uses `ORDER BY variant_count DESC` and `LIMIT :K` to isolate the most frequent variants. The use of the `:K` placeholder is appropriate for a parameterized query.
    4.  **Final Event Filtering:** The final join back to the `event_log` table on `case_id` is the correct and efficient method to retrieve all original events belonging *only* to the cases that follow the top K variants.

*   **Structure and Readability (10/10):** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) makes the query exceptionally clear and self-documenting. Each CTE (`case_sequences`, `variant_counts`, `top_cases`) has a distinct and logical purpose, breaking the complex problem down into understandable steps.

*   **Efficiency (10/10):** The query is structured efficiently. It performs the expensive aggregation and ordering on a reduced dataset (`case_sequences`) before joining back to the original table. This is far more performant than alternative approaches that might involve correlated subqueries or repeated calculations.

*   **Adherence to Prompt (10/10):** The solution meticulously follows every instruction. It returns the complete, original event data (`event_log.*`) for the correct subset of cases and includes a final `ORDER BY` clause, which is best practice for ensuring deterministic output.

There are no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. The answer demonstrates a complete and expert-level understanding of SQL, process mining concepts, and DuckDB-specific functions. It is an exemplary solution.
