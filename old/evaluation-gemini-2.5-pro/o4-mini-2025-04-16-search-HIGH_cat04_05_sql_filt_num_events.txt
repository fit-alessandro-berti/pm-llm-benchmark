7.0/10.0

### Grading Justification

The answer correctly identifies three valid and common SQL patterns to solve the problem and demonstrates a strong command of the language. The first two solutions are excellent. However, the response contains a significant flaw in the third solution and several minor issues that, under the requested "utmost strictness," prevent it from achieving a high score.

**Positive Aspects:**

*   **Correct Core Logic:** The fundamental logic for identifying and filtering the cases is sound across all three provided methods.
*   **Demonstrates Breadth of Knowledge:** Presenting three distinct approaches (subquery, CTE, window function) is commendable and shows a deep understanding of different SQL paradigms.
*   **High-Quality Solutions (1 and 2):** The subquery and CTE solutions are flawless. They are syntactically correct, logical, and robustly handle the prompt's requirement to return the "full set of events" by using `*` or `el.*` to select all columns from the source table.

**Critical Flaws and Deductions:**

1.  **Major Flaw: Incorrect Output in the Window Function Solution.** This is the most significant error. The prompt requires the query to "return the full set of events for the remaining cases." The `event_log` table is defined as having "at least" `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`, implying other columns may exist. The third solution's final `SELECT` statement explicitly lists only these three columns (`SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp`). If any other columns are present in the table, this query will fail to return them, thus failing to meet the core output requirement of the prompt. This is a critical failure of correctness.

2.  **Inaccurate Claim of Equivalence.** The answer opens by stating it will provide "three equivalent ways" to solve the problem. Due to the column-selection issue noted above, the third solution is *not* equivalent to the first two in its output schema. This framing is misleading and factually incorrect. A flawless answer would either make all solutions truly equivalent (e.g., by using `SELECT * EXCLUDE (event_count)` in the third query) or qualify the differences.

3.  **Lack of Precision in Explanations.** The bulleted explanations for all three solutions are imprecise. They state the condition is "count 6" or "total is 6," omitting the crucial "less than or equal to" (`<=`) part of the condition. While the SQL code itself is correct, the accompanying text is ambiguous and technically inaccurate. This repeated lack of polish detracts from the overall quality and clarity of the answer.

**Conclusion:**

While the answer provides two perfect solutions, it is presented as a package of three "equivalent" methods. The failure of the third method to meet the prompt's output specification is a major flaw. When combined with the misleading claim of equivalence and a consistent lack of precision in the explanations, the answer cannot be considered "nearly flawless." The score of 7.0 acknowledges the strong foundation and the correctness of the first two approaches while penalizing the significant logical error and lack of polish as required by the strict grading criteria.
