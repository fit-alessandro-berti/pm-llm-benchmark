9.5/10.0

### Evaluation Breakdown

This is an excellent, well-structured, and logically flawless query. It correctly addresses every requirement of the prompt with exceptional clarity. The score is near-perfect, with a minor deduction made only under the specified "hypercritical" lens, reflecting a choice of implementation pattern rather than any actual error.

---

### Positive Aspects (Why the score is very high)

1.  **Logical Correctness:** The query is 100% correct. It accurately identifies the cases to be excluded by correctly implementing the sequence and timing conditions.
    -   The `ROW_NUMBER()` function correctly establishes a per-case event order.
    -   The triple `JOIN` on consecutive row numbers (`rn`, `rn+1`, `rn+2`) is a perfect implementation of the "direct succession" requirement.
    -   The time difference calculation and comparison (`> INTERVAL 5 DAY`) is syntactically correct for DuckDB and logically sound.
    -   The final filtering step using `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` correctly excludes all events from the identified "bad cases".

2.  **Clarity and Readability:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) is exemplary. The query is broken down into logical, easy-to-follow steps (`ordered`, `triples`, `bad_cases`), making the complex logic trivial to understand and debug.

3.  **Robustness:** The query includes a secondary sort key (`activity`) in the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function (`ORDER BY "timestamp", activity`). This is a mark of a high-quality query, as it ensures a deterministic ordering even if two events in the same case have the exact same timestamp, preventing potential ambiguity.

4.  **Completeness:** The final output adheres perfectly to the prompt, selecting all columns (`e.*`) from the original table for the correct set of cases and including a final `ORDER BY` clause for deterministic results.

### Hypercritical Analysis (Why the score is not a perfect 10.0)

The prompt requires evaluation with "utmost strictness" and penalizing even "minor issues." From this hypercritical perspective, there is one area where the query could be improved, which relates to performance and modern SQL idiom.

1.  **Implementation Pattern (Self-Join vs. Window Functions):**
    The query uses three self-joins on the `ordered` CTE to find the sequence. While this is logically perfect and very explicit, the more modern and typically more performant approach for sequence analysis is to use window functions like `LEAD()`.

    An alternative, potentially more optimized implementation would look like this:

    ```sql
    WITH bad_cases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                activity,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER w AS next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER w AS next_next_activity,
                LEAD("timestamp", 1) OVER w AS next_timestamp,
                LEAD("timestamp", 2) OVER w AS next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
            WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY "timestamp", activity)
        )
        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
          AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
          AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)
    ORDER BY case_id, "timestamp", activity;
    ```

    This `LEAD()` approach scans the data only once, which is generally more efficient than the multiple joins. While the provided solution is not incorrect, it is not the most performant or idiomatic pattern for this specific task in modern SQL. This constitutes a "minor issue" under the harsh grading criteria, preventing a perfect score.

### Conclusion

The submitted query is outstanding. It is logically sound, perfectly readable, and robust. It would pass any functional test with flying colors. The single point of criticism is not a logical flaw but a choice of a less-optimized (though still valid) implementation pattern. Therefore, it earns a very high score of **9.5**, reflecting its near-flawless quality.
