**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness:** The query correctly identifies cases with 6 or fewer events (`event_count <= 6`) and returns all events (`SELECT * FROM event_log`) belonging only to those cases using a `WHERE case_id IN (...)` clause. The logic fulfills the prompt's requirements.
2.  **Structure and Clarity:** The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) `case_counts` and `valid_cases` makes the query structured and relatively easy to understand. The first CTE calculates counts per case, the second identifies the valid cases based on the count, and the final SELECT retrieves the relevant events.
3.  **Efficiency and Redundancy:** The primary flaw is the use of `SELECT DISTINCT case_id` within the `valid_cases` CTE. Since the `case_counts` CTE is derived from `GROUP BY case_id`, the `case_id` column in `case_counts` is already unique. Therefore, the `DISTINCT` keyword is redundant and adds an unnecessary operation, indicating a slight lack of precision or optimization.
4.  **Alternative Approaches:** While the provided CTE + `IN` subquery approach is valid, alternative approaches exist that might be considered more efficient or idiomatic in some SQL dialects/optimizers (though not strictly required by the prompt):
    *   Using a `JOIN` instead of `IN`: `SELECT el.* FROM event_log el JOIN case_counts cc ON el.case_id = cc.case_id WHERE cc.event_count <= 6;` (after defining `case_counts`). This avoids the redundant `DISTINCT` naturally.
    *   Using a window function: `SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log) WHERE event_count <= 6;`. This often performs well as it can calculate counts and filter in fewer logical steps.
5.  **Strictness Criterion:** The prompt explicitly requests hypercritical evaluation where even minor issues lead to significantly lower scores. The redundant `DISTINCT` constitutes such a minor issue – it doesn't break functionality but represents suboptimal query writing.

**Conclusion:** The query is functionally correct but contains a minor redundancy (`DISTINCT`) that prevents it from being considered flawless or optimally efficient. Under the strict grading criteria, this redundancy warrants a notable deduction.
