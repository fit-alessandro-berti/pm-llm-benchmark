# Rationale for Added Bias Mitigation Constraints

# 1. Coexistence between FinalDecision and ManualReview:
#    - Constraint Added: coexistence["FinalDecision"]["ManualReview"] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
#    - Rationale: This constraint mandates that whenever a `FinalDecision` activity occurs in a process trace, a `ManualReview` activity must also occur within the same trace (and vice-versa). By enforcing a manual review alongside every final decision, it introduces a human checkpoint, reducing the risk of purely automated, potentially biased decisions, especially in cases involving sensitive applicant groups where the process logic might implicitly carry bias.

# 2. Non-Succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision:
#    - Constraint Added: nonsuccession["CheckApplicantRace"]["FinalDecision"] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
#    - Rationale: This constraint prohibits the direct sequence where the `FinalDecision` activity immediately follows the `CheckApplicantRace` activity. This prevents a scenario where observing an applicant's race could lead directly to a decision without any intermediate steps (like review or mitigation checks), thus mitigating the risk of immediate, potentially biased reactions based on sensitive information.

# 3. Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck:
#    - Constraint Added: response["CheckApplicantRace"]["BiasMitigationCheck"] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
#    - Rationale: This constraint ensures that every time the `CheckApplicantRace` activity occurs, it must be followed at some point later in the trace by a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity. This enforces a necessary step to actively check for and potentially mitigate bias after sensitive information like race has been processed, before the process can conclude (often with a `FinalDecision`). It ensures that awareness of a sensitive attribute triggers a specific fairness-oriented action.
```

**Explanation of How Constraints Reduce Bias:**

The added constraints aim to reduce bias in the loan application process in the following ways:

1.  **Mandatory Human Oversight:** The `coexistence` constraint between `FinalDecision` and `ManualReview` ensures that no final decision is made without a human review occurring at some point in the process instance. This helps catch and correct potential biases that automated rules might perpetuate.
2.  **Breaking Direct Bias Links:** The `nonsuccession` constraint prevents the system from making a `FinalDecision` immediately after checking a sensitive attribute like `CheckApplicantRace`. This introduces a necessary pause or requires intermediate steps, reducing the likelihood of reflexive, biased decisions based solely on sensitive data.
3.  **Enforcing Mitigation Steps:** The `response` constraint mandates that observing a sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`) triggers a specific `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that the process includes active steps designed to address potential bias whenever sensitive data is involved, promoting a more fair and considered decision-making pathway.

Together, these constraints modify the process flow enforced by the DECLARE model to embed fairness checks and prevent direct pathways where sensitive attributes could disproportionately influence the final outcome without adequate scrutiny. They introduce procedural safeguards against bias by requiring reviews and specific mitigation actions linked to the processing of sensitive information.
