8.0/10.0

### Evaluation Justification

The answer successfully provides a Python dictionary in the correct format, populated with plausible estimations for a complex supply chain process. It correctly identifies and includes both directly connected and non-consecutive activity pairs, fulfilling a key requirement of the prompt. The accompanying notes and in-line comments that explain the rationale and convert seconds to more intuitive units (days, hours) are excellent additions that demonstrate a strong understanding of the task.

However, when evaluated with "utmost strictness," two primary flaws prevent a higher score:

1.  **Inconsistent Statistical Logic for Standard Deviations:** The main weakness lies in the lack of a coherent, underlying model for estimating the standard deviations of non-consecutive pairs.
    *   For some pairs, like `('OP', 'CA')` and `('WS', 'AS')`, the provided standard deviation is very close to the value one would get by assuming the intermediate steps are independent events (i.e., the resulting standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the variances: `sqrt(stdev_1^2 + stdev_2^2 + ...)`).
    *   For other pairs, like `('SS', 'RC')` and `('SS', 'DT')`, the provided standard deviation is significantly larger than what this calculation would yield.
    *   While in a real-world process, delays between steps can be correlated (which would increase variance), the answer does not state this assumption or provide any rationale for why some pairs exhibit this behavior and others do not. This inconsistency makes the estimation process for the standard deviations appear arbitrary and undermines the logical integrity of the model as a whole. A flawless answer would either apply a consistent statistical methodology or explicitly justify the differing assumptions.

2.  **Minor Structural Redundancy:** The activity pair `('DT', 'AS')` is listed in both the "Directly connected pairs" section and the "Non-consecutive pairs" section. This is redundant and slightly clutters the final output. While a minor issue, it indicates a lack of final polish.

In summary, the answer is very strong in its structure, plausibility, and fulfillment of the primary request. However, the logical inconsistency in the derivation of the statistical values is a significant flaw under hypercritical review.
