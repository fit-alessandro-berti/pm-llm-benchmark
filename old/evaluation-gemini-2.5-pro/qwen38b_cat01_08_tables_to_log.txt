**Assumptions Made:**

1.  **Case Identifier**: `order_id` is used as the unique Case ID for each process instance.
2.  **Event Granularity**:
    *   "Item Picked" events are generated for each line item in the `Order Lines` table, reflecting individual picking actions.
    *   "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events are generated for each entry in the `Delivery` table, with distinct timestamps for dispatch and arrival.
3.  **Resource Mapping**: Resource IDs (e.g., `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`) are mapped to "Resource Name (Role)" using the `Resources` table. For "Payment Received" events, no direct resource is available in the `Payments` table, so it's marked as "(No resource)".
4.  **Attribute Inclusion**:
    *   "Other Attributes" are included as a comma-separated string of `key=value` pairs.
    *   For "Item Picked" events, attributes are enriched with `item_description` and `item_category` from the `Products` table.
    *   Resource IDs (like `sales_person_id`) are not repeated in "Other Attributes" if they are already used to populate the "Resource/Actor" column.
5.  **Data Completeness**: Events are generated only if corresponding data exists in the tables. For example, if an `order_id` does not have entries in the `Delivery` or `Invoice` tables (e.g., `order_id` 1004 in the provided data), then "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", or "Payment Received" events are not created for that order.
6.  **Chronological Order**: All events within each case are sorted by their `Timestamp`.
