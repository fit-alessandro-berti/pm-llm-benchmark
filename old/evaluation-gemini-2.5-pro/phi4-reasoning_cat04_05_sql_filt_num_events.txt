8.5

The provided answer offers two correct and efficient DuckDB SQL queries to solve the problem. Both the CTE approach and the subquery-in-WHERE-clause approach accurately filter cases with more than six events and return all events for the remaining cases. The SQL logic is sound, uses appropriate clauses (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`/`IN`), and correctly selects all columns (`el.*` or `*`) for the resulting events.

Points for strict evaluation:
1.  **Correctness of SQL:** Both provided SQL queries are entirely correct and directly address all requirements of the prompt. They would execute correctly in DuckDB and produce the desired output.
2.  **Clarity and Explanation:** The explanation for the CTE-based solution is clear and accurate. The alternative solution is also standard and its logic is analogous.
3.  **Adherence to "a DuckDB SQL query":**
    *   The prompt asks to "craft a DuckDB SQL query" (singular). The answer provides "one correct solution" and then "An alternative approach," effectively giving two queries. While both are correct, providing more than one when "a query" is requested can be seen as a minor deviation if strict singularity is implied.
    *   The answer includes explanatory text and formatting separators (`-----------------------------------------------------------`) around the SQL code blocks. If the expectation was for the output to be *only* the SQL query string itself (e.g., for direct execution or automated parsing), then this additional text makes the answer non-compliant with such an implicit requirement.

Under a hypercritical lens, while the SQL *logic* is flawless, the overall response format and multiplicity of solutions can be considered minor issues:
*   The provision of two queries instead of one, though helpful, deviates from the singular "a query."
*   The inclusion of explanations and separators means the response is not *just* the SQL query code.

Given the instruction "Even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score," and aiming for "nearly flawless" for a very high score:
*   The SQL craftsmanship itself is 10/10.
*   The presentation/adherence to the implicit expectation of a single, clean query as the *entire* response is where the minor issues lie.

A score of 8.5 reflects that the core task (crafting correct SQL) was perfectly achieved, but the overall response has minor deviations from an ideal, strictly interpreted deliverable of "a single SQL query string." The issues are not with the correctness or quality of the SQL itself, but with the framing and multiplicity in the response.
