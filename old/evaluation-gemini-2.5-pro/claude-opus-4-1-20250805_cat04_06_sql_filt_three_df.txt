9.2/10.0

### Evaluation

This is an excellent and highly competent answer that correctly solves the problem. The logic is sound, the structure is clear, and it addresses all requirements of the prompt. However, under the instruction to be hypercritical, there are minor aspects related to implementation choice and query elegance that prevent it from being a perfect 10.0.

---

### Strengths

*   **Logical Correctness:** The core logic is flawless. It correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to establish order, self-joins to enforce direct succession, and a series of CTEs to filter down to the exact set of cases to be excluded. The final exclusion of the entire case is also handled correctly.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The use of well-named CTEs (`ordered_events`, `sequence_matches`, `cases_to_exclude`) makes the query's purpose and flow exceptionally easy to follow. The accompanying explanation is also clear and accurate.
*   **Completeness:** The query successfully fulfills every single requirement of the prompt, including the final `ORDER BY` clause for a well-structured output.

### Hypercritical Weaknesses

While the query is functionally perfect, the following points are considered from a perspective of optimal implementation and SQL elegance:

1.  **Implementation Pattern Choice:** The solution uses a `ROW_NUMBER()` and multi-self-join pattern. For sequence analysis in modern analytical databases like DuckDB, a more idiomatic and often more performant approach is to use window functions like `LAG()` or `LEAD()`. A `LEAD()`-based solution could identify the sequence and retrieve the necessary timestamps in a single pass over the data, avoiding potentially expensive multiple self-joins. While the provided solution is a classic and valid pattern, it's not necessarily the most efficient or advanced for the specified database system.

2.  **Redundant `DISTINCT` Clause:** The `DISTINCT` in the `sequence_matches` CTE (`SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id, ...`) is superfluous. The join conditions on the unique row numbers (`e2.rn = e1.rn + 1`, `e3.rn = e2.rn + 1`) already guarantee that each found sequence instance will produce a unique row. A query optimizer would likely remove the redundant `DISTINCT` operation, but its presence in the code indicates a slight lack of precision.

3.  **Sub-optimal Exclusion Subquery:** The `cases_to_exclude` CTE correctly identifies the `case_id`s. However, if a single case contains the specified sequence and time condition multiple times, its `case_id` will appear multiple times in the result of this CTE. While `WHERE case_id NOT IN (...)` handles this correctly, it is more idiomatic and a micro-optimization to ensure the subquery's result set is unique by using `SELECT DISTINCT case_id`.

### Conclusion

The solution is robust, correct, and clearly written. The identified weaknesses are not logical flaws or errors but rather opportunities for refinement that an expert SQL practitioner would likely implement for better performance and elegance. The answer demonstrates a very strong understanding of SQL, falling just shy of a perfect score due to the choice of a slightly less optimal pattern and other minor stylistic points.
