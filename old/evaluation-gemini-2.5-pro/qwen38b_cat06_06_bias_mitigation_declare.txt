To address potential bias in the loan application process, we will introduce new activities and DECLARE constraints. The new activities are:
*   `CheckApplicantRace`: Represents the activity of checking or recording the applicant's race, a sensitive attribute.
*   `ManualReview`: Represents a mandatory review by a human agent, especially for applications involving sensitive attributes.
*   `BiasMitigationCheck`: Represents a specific step or automated check to identify and mitigate potential bias before a decision.

These activities will be incorporated into the DECLARE model with new constraints designed to enforce fairer process execution.

**Updated `declare_model`:**

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # New activity
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},        # New activity
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0} # New activity
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, # Existing from example
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # New constraint
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}, # Existing from example
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} # New constraint
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} # New constraint
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} # Existing from example
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}} # New constraint
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Explanation of Added Constraints and Their Role in Reducing Bias:**

1.  **New Activities in `existence`**:
    *   `CheckApplicantRace`: Added to model the point where sensitive applicant race information is processed.
    *   `ManualReview`: Added to represent a human oversight step.
    *   `BiasMitigationCheck`: Added to represent a specific procedure aimed at countering bias.
    The `existence` constraint for these new activities (with `support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0`) implies they are expected components of potentially biased-prone traces, though their actual occurrence will depend on the process logic and other constraints. For the purpose of defining fairness constraints *around* them, they are added here.

2.  **`coexistence`: {"CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": ...}}**
    *   **Constraint:** `coexistence(CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview)`
    *   **Rationale for Bias Reduction:** This constraint ensures that if an applicant's race is checked (`CheckApplicantRace` occurs), then a `ManualReview` must also occur within the same case (and vice-versa). This enforces human oversight in situations where sensitive attributes are involved, helping to catch and mitigate potential biases that an automated system might perpetuate.

3.  **`response`: {"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": ...}}**
    *   **Constraint:** `response(CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck)`
    *   **Rationale for Bias Reduction:** If the applicant's race is checked (`CheckApplicantRace` occurs), this constraint mandates that a `BiasMitigationCheck` must eventually follow. This ensures that the processing of sensitive information actively triggers a step designed to counteract potential bias before a decision is made.

4.  **`precedence`: {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": ...}}**
    *   **Constraint:** `precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision)`
    *   **Rationale for Bias Reduction:** This constraint ensures that if a `FinalDecision` is made, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must have occurred at some point before it. Combined with the `response` constraint above, it establishes a sequence where sensitive attribute checking leads to a bias mitigation step, which in turn must happen before the final outcome. This prevents decisions from being made on potentially biased grounds without an explicit mitigation attempt.

5.  **`nonsuccession`: {"CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": ...}}**
    *   **Constraint:** `nonsuccession(CheckApplicantRace, FinalDecision)`
    *   **Rationale for Bias Reduction:** This constraint prohibits the `FinalDecision` activity from *immediately* following the `CheckApplicantRace` activity. This directly prevents a scenario where knowledge of a sensitive attribute leads to an instant decision, thereby enforcing that at least one other activity (ideally, the `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`) must occur in between. This "cooling-off" or mandatory intermediate step helps to break potentially direct discriminatory pathways.

These newly introduced constraints work together to embed fairness checks and human oversight into the process flow, particularly when sensitive attributes are handled, thereby reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes in the loan application review process.
