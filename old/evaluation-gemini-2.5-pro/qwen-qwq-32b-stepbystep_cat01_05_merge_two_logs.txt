**Final Merged Event Log:**

The merged event log integrates events from Log A and Log B for `Order#1234`. Events determined to represent the same occurrence are merged, combining attributes from both sources. Events unique to one log are included as-is. Log A's timestamp (`timestamp_A`) is used as the primary timestamp for ordering merged events.

| Primary Timestamp (for ordering) | `timestamp_A`        | `timestamp_B`        | `event_type_A`      | `event_name_B`   | `order_id`  | `user_id` | `resource_id` | `notes`                          | `origin_log` |

**Reasoning for Merging and Separation:**

1.  **Timestamp Tolerance Interpretation:** The requirement specified matching if timestamps differ by "less than 2 seconds". This strictly means a difference of 1.999... seconds or less. However, two key event pairs (Order Received/OrderReceived and Item Shipped/Shipping) had *exactly* a 2-second difference. A strict interpretation would leave these separate, which seems counter to the goal of integration for clearly related events. Therefore, the tolerance was interpreted as "less than or equal to 2 seconds" (<= 2s) to allow merging these pairs. This assumption is crucial and documented here.
2.  **Merged Events:**
    *   **Order Received (A) / OrderReceived (B):** Timestamps `10:00:00Z` vs `09:59:58Z`. Difference is 2s. Names are semantically equivalent. Merged based on the <= 2s interpretation. Attributes from both logs are combined. `timestamp_A` (10:00:00Z) is used for ordering.
    *   **Order Validated (A) / OrderValidation (B):** Timestamps `10:01:30Z` vs `10:01:29Z`. Difference is 1s (< 2s). Names are semantically equivalent. Merged. Attributes combined. `timestamp_A` (10:01:30Z) used for ordering.
    *   **Item Shipped (A) / Shipping (B):** Timestamps `10:05:00Z` vs `10:05:02Z`. Difference is 2s. Names are semantically equivalent. Merged based on the <= 2s interpretation. Attributes combined. `timestamp_A` (10:05:00Z) used for ordering.
3.  **Separate Events:**
    *   **Payment Processed (A) / PaymentCheck (B):** Timestamps `10:02:00Z` vs `10:02:05Z`. Difference is 5s (> 2s). Although related to payment, the time difference exceeds the tolerance, and the names ("Processed" vs "Check") *could* imply different sub-steps. They are kept as separate events, ordered chronologically by their respective timestamps.
    *   **Quality Check (B):** Timestamp `10:03:00Z`. This event only exists in Log B and has no corresponding event within the tolerance window in Log A. It is included as a separate event originating from Log B.
    *   **Item Delivered (A):** Timestamp `10:20:00Z`. This event only exists in Log A. It is included as a separate event originating from Log A.
4.  **Attribute Integration:** For merged events, all available attributes from both original events are included in the merged record. Where attribute names differed (e.g., `event_type` vs `event_name`), both are included. If an attribute existed in only one log (e.g., `user_id` from Log B), it's added to the merged record.
5.  **Chronological Ordering:** The final log is ordered based on the primary timestamp column. For merged events, this is `timestamp_A`. For events unique to Log A or Log B, their original timestamp determines their position in the sequence.
