### Explanation

**Case Identification Logic:**
- **Case Definition:** Each case represents a distinct user task, typically centered around a specific document or a focused activity in an application.
- **Document-based Cases:** Interactions with `Quarterly_Report.docx` (Case QR), `Document1.docx` (Case D1), `Report_Draft.pdf` (Case Report1), and `Budget_2024.xlsx` (Case Budget1) were treated as separate cases. A case includes all activities performed on that document, even if interrupted and resumed later.
- **Task-based Cases:** The sequence of actions for handling an email (`Email - Inbox`) was grouped into a single case (Email1), starting from the switch to the email client until the email was sent.
- **Case ID Assignment:** Case IDs were derived from the primary document/task identifier (e.g., QR for Quarterly Report, D1 for Document1, Email1 for the first email task).

**Activity Naming Logic:**
- **Standardization:** Raw actions were translated into more descriptive, standardized activity names.
- **FOCUS:** Mapped to "Open Document" if it's the first focus on a document in a case, or "Resume Editing" if the user returns to a document.
- **TYPING:** Contextualized as "Edit Document" (for Word), "Compose Email" (for email client), or "Edit Spreadsheet" (for Excel).
- **SAVE/CLOSE:** Directly translated to "Save Document/Spreadsheet" and "Close Document."
- **SWITCH:** Interpreted as the initiation or resumption of a task. For example, a SWITCH to an email client became "Start Email Task." A SWITCH back to a document became "Resume Editing." This ensures the SWITCH event itself is part of the case it transitions into.
- **CLICK:** Mapped to specific actions like "Open Email," "Start Reply," or "Send Email" based on the action attribute.
- **SCROLL/HIGHLIGHT:** Retained as "Review Email/PDF" and "Highlight Section" to reflect user interaction with content.

**Design Choices:**
- **Inclusion of All Events:** All events from the raw log, including `SWITCH` events, were transformed and included in the event log, as per instructions.
- **Coherent Narrative:** The logic aimed to create a narrative where each case tells a story of a user's work session on a particular task, allowing for interruptions and task switching.
- **Temporal Context:** Timestamps were preserved. The sequence of events within and across cases reflects the user's workflow over time.
- **Additional Attributes:** Relevant original attributes (e.g., `App`, `Window`, `Keys`, `Action`) were included to provide rich contextual information for analysis without cluttering the primary activity name. The `FromApp` and `ToApp` attributes for `SWITCH` events are also preserved in the `Additional Attributes` column when relevant.
