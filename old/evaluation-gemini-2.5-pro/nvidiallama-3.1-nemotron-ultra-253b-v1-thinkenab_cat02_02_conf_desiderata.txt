**6.0/10.0**

**Evaluation:**

The answer is well-structured and clearly presents its findings. It correctly identifies normative compliance for Cases 1 and 3, and correctly identifies all desiderata violations for Cases 1 and 3 (with a minor point on precision for Case 3's timing description). The interpretations provided are generally reasonable.

However, there are significant inaccuracies concerning Case 2, which, under "hypercritical" grading, substantially impact the score:

**Major Issues:**
1.  **Missed Normative Violation (Case 2):** The answer fails to identify that the "Inform Applicant" activity was skipped in Case 2. According to the normative process description ("Sequence: ...Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...") and "What is Not Allowed" ("Skipping activities in the required sequence"), this is a clear normative violation. This is a critical omission.
    *   The answer identified two normative violations for Case 2 (Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize Documentation after rejection), both of which are correct. However, missing the third violation is a significant flaw.

2.  **Incorrect Desiderata Assessment (Case 2):** The answer states, "Case 2 has no desiderata violations to note (its issues are purely normative breaches)." This is incorrect.
    *   Case 2 is missing the "Follow-up Call," which is a desideratum violation. The presence of normative breaches does not negate the possibility of also having desiderata violations for other aspects or recommended steps.

**Minor Issues:**
1.  **Precision in Desiderata Description (Case 3):** For Case 3, "Inform Applicant delayed beyond 48 hours (2 days after decision)" is slightly imprecise. The actual delay is 51 hours (2 days and 3 hours). While "delayed beyond 48 hours" is correct, the parenthetical simplification could be more exact. This is a very minor point but relevant under hypercritical evaluation.

**Strengths:**
*   Clear, structured presentation.
*   Correct identification of normative compliance for Cases 1 and 3.
*   Correct identification of most violations that were noted.
*   Mostly accurate identification of desiderata for Cases 1 and 3.
*   Reasonable interpretations in Part 3 for the identified issues.

**Conclusion:**
The failure to identify a key normative violation (skipped activity) and the incorrect statement regarding desiderata for Case 2 are substantial errors. Given the instruction to be "hypercritical" and that "even minor issues should result in a significantly lower score," these inaccuracies prevent a high score. While much of the analysis is correct, the flaws in analyzing Case 2 are critical.
