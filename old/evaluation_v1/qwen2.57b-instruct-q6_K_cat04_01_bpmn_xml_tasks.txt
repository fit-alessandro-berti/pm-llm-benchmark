**9.0**

The answer provides most of the tasks listed in the BPMN 2.0 XML accurately and uses clear formatting. However, it misses one task:

- **reinitiate request** – Task with ID `id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db`

Apart from this omission, the response is correct and well-structured. Including the missing task would have merited a perfect score.
