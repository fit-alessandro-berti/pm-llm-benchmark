**9.5**

This answer performs most of the task well, as it accurately lists the tasks from the provided BPMN XML and includes both task names and their respective IDs. 

However, there is a minor typo on the very first item, where "idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a **better**3-d430cf587b6b" incorrectly includes the word "better". This seems to be an artifact and should simply be "idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b". Fixing this typo would warrant a perfect 10.0 grade.
