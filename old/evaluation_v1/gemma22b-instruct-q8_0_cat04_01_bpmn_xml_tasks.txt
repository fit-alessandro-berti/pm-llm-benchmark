**7.5** 

The answer correctly lists seven out of eight distinct tasks from the provided BPMN XML. However, the task "**examine thoroughly**" is missing from the list. This omission slightly reduces the score, as completeness is essential when identifying all tasks in a given process model.

Improvements could be made by including "**examine thoroughly**" in the task list for a more comprehensive answer.
