**9.0**

The answer correctly lists the tasks present in the provided BPMN 2.0 XML process model, including task names and their corresponding IDs. However, the grade is not a perfect 10 because a minor addition, such as mentioning the source XML elements (e.g., `<bpmn:task>`), could have added more clarity to the answer.
