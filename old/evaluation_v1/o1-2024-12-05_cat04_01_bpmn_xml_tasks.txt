The answer is nearly perfect. It correctly lists all tasks as defined by the `<bpmn:task>` elements in the provided BPMN 2.0 XML document. The tasks' names are accurately identified and presented in a clear, itemized format. 

However, the response could be slightly improved by mentioning the approach used to extract the task names for greater clarity and transparency. For example: "The task names were extracted from the `name` attribute within the `<bpmn:task>` elements." This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the source data.
