The answer effectively identifies the tasks from the provided BPMN 2.0 XML by accurately extracting all the `<bpmn:task>` elements and correctly listing their names and IDs. The tasks are presented in a clear and easy-to-read format, demonstrating a good understanding of the XML structure.

However, the grade is not a perfect 10 because the response could be slightly improved by including additional context, such as explaining the significance of the task IDs or how these tasks relate to the overall BPMN model. For example, a brief note on the roles or flow direction of the tasks might have enhanced the completeness of the response. Nonetheless, the core requirement of listing the tasks is competently addressed.
