The answer is comprehensive, well-structured, and effectively addresses the question. It explains how event abstraction can improve the readability and manageability of complex process models, offering detailed examples and actionable strategies across multiple dimensions such as simplification, communication, and scalability. The concepts of aggregation, generalization, hierarchical views, and alignment with business goals are particularly well-articulated and relevant to the topic. Moreover, it proposes practical implementation steps to operationalize event abstraction, adding depth and usability to the discussion.

One minor limitation is that the answer could briefly touch on potential challenges or trade-offs (e.g., the risk of oversimplification or the effort required to define abstraction rules). Addressing such considerations would make the response more balanced and complete. Nevertheless, the overall quality and depth warrant a high grade.
