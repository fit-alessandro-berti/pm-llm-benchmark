### Evaluation Rationale
This SQL query is highly effective and logically sound for the task, correctly using a subquery to identify qualifying `case_id`s (those with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`) and then joining back to retrieve all events (`e.*`) for those cases only. This ensures the output excludes events from cases with >6 events while preserving the full event set for valid cases, aligning precisely with the prompt's requirements. The use of an inner `JOIN` is appropriate and efficient in DuckDB (or standard SQL), avoiding unnecessary self-references or complex window functions.

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Core Logic Flawlessness**: The subquery accurately filters `case_id`s based on event count, and the outer query retrieves the complete rows without duplication or loss. No inaccuracies in grouping, aggregation, or filtering.
- **Completeness**: `SELECT e.*` captures all columns (including `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and any others), fulfilling the "full set of events" requirement.
- **Clarity and Readability**: Aliases (`e` and `c`) are used effectively; the explanation provided is concise, accurate, and directly ties to the query's mechanics.
- **DuckDB Compatibility**: Standard SQL syntax works seamlessly in DuckDB; no vendor-specific issues.

**Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens):**
- **Unnecessary ORDER BY Clause (-0.5)**: The prompt does not require or imply any sorting (e.g., no mention of ordered output for analysis or presentation). While `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` is harmless, logical for event logs, and doesn't alter correctness, it introduces extraneous code that could slightly impact performance in very large datasets (minor query overhead). Under strict evaluation, this is a small but avoidable addition—ideal queries should stick exactly to specified needs without unprompted enhancements.
- No other issues: No syntax errors, logical flaws, unclarities, or inefficiencies (e.g., no redundant scans beyond the necessary two-table access pattern). The query is concise and scalable.

Overall, this is nearly flawless—exceptional for a benchmark response—but the extra clause prevents a perfect 10.0. In a real-world context, it would perform excellently.
