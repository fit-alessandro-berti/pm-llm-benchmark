### Evaluation Rationale
The answer is exceptionally strong in structure, clarity, and depth, directly addressing the question's requirements: identifying Group B as biased, detailing manifestation through explicit mechanisms (boost, thresholds) with precise data-driven evidence (e.g., the comparative table is spot-on and illuminating), and exploring implications comprehensively (meritocracy, disparate treatment/impact, systemic issues, legal/organizational risks). It correctly interprets the logs' key difference (association boost in Group B) while acknowledging confounding factors like LocalResident status without derailing the focus. The conclusion ties everything back to algorithmic fairness principles effectively.

However, under utmost strictness, two minor but notable flaws prevent a perfect score:
- **Inaccuracy in threshold calculation**: The statement "12-point effective gap (58 vs. 70 required)" is logically flawed and factually imprecise. Data shows the hiring line at ~65 (P001/P003=65 hired; 60 not hired in both groups), not 70, making the raw gap closer to 7 points (58 vs. 65) and effective post-boost ~2 points. This introduces unnecessary confusion, even if the broader point about differential thresholds holds.
- **Awkward comparison in implications**: Claiming U003 is "hired over potentially more skilled non-members (e.g., P003's Skill=82 vs. U003's Skill=75)" is misleading, as P003 was also hired (no direct competition or rejection implied). It weakens the meritocracy argument slightly by implying a non-existent override.

These are small issues in an otherwise hyper-precise, evidence-based response, warranting only a modest deduction from flawlessness. No major unclarities, repetitions, or omissions.
