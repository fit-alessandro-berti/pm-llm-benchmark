### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating deep understanding of DECLARE constraints, business process logic, and database querying. It fully addresses all three tasks with clear structure, comprehensive coverage, and practical depth. Anomalies are identified with precise explanations of contradictions (e.g., the core impossibility of E under existence(C) + noncoexistence(E,C)) and broader issues (e.g., missing orderings, weak enforcement), directly tying to the intended flow. Hypotheses are varied, plausible, and aligned with the prompt's examples while adding insightful extensions like mining errors. Verification strategies are exemplary: SQL queries are syntactically correct for PostgreSQL, efficiently use CTEs and aggregations, provide quantifiable metrics (counts/ratios), and target specific anomalies (e.g., coexistence violations, ordering checks) while incorporating schema elements like `resource` for adjuster linkage. They go beyond basics to suggest model refinements, enhancing utility.

Hypercritical deductions (total -0.5): 
- Minor logical imprecision in interpreting `responded_existence(E  A)`: The answer describes it as requiring A "somewhere in the trace (before or after)," but standard DECLARE semantics typically mandate A *after* each E (as a response). This allows invalid traces like E followed only by pre-E A in explanation, slightly undermining the anomaly critique on ordering—though the broader point about lacking precedence is correctly emphasized.
- Trivial unclarity: The 3.2 ratio computes coexistence over *all* claims rather than closed claims, which could mildly skew interpretation if many claims are open; however, the query itself is sound and the intent clear.
- No major inaccuracies, omissions, or flaws; no inclusion of prompt hints. This is nearly flawless under strict scrutiny.
