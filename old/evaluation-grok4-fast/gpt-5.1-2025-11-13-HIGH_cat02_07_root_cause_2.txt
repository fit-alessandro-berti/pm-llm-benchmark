### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating a thorough, data-driven analysis that directly addresses all task elements with clear structure, evidence-based insights, and actionable recommendations. It excels in quantifying durations, correlating attributes logically, and proposing mitigations tied to observed patterns. However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor issues prevent a perfect score: slight inaccuracies in duration approximations (e.g., Case 2004's 1 hour 25 minutes rounded to "1.4 hours" without precision; Case 2002's "~26 hours" is exact but labeled "1.1 days" which understates the full span slightly), a few unclarities in phrasing (e.g., "between Evaluate first Request and first second Request" is awkwardly worded and could specify timestamps more explicitly for reproducibility), and a logical overreach in attributing "adjuster behavior" (e.g., "discovering missing information piecemeal") as a primary cause without direct evidence from the log—it's a reasonable inference but presented as near-certainty rather than hypothesis. These are small flaws but, per instructions, warrant a deduction from perfection. The response remains highly accurate, logical, and comprehensive, far exceeding basic expectations.
