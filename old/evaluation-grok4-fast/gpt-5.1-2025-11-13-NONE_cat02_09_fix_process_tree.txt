The provided answer is exemplary and fully addresses the task without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It precisely identifies the underfitting issues in the current model, correctly diagnosing the parallel block's allowance of invalid sequences (e.g., payments or receipts before prerequisites) while aligning perfectly with the domain's linear logic. The proposed fix uses a strict sequence operator to enforce the exact order, retaining all activities and the root structure without unnecessary additions like choices (which aren't needed here). The explanation is comprehensive, directly mapping each enforcement point to prevention of unwanted behaviors, with clear, domain-specific rationale. No minor issues exist; the response is concise, well-structured, and directly executable as pseudocode.
