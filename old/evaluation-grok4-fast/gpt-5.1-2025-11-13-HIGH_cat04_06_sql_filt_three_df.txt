The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact consecutive sequence of activities per case, ordered by timestamp, ensuring no intervening events. The time condition accurately computes the interval between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps in that sequence (>5 days via DuckDB-compatible interval syntax). The exclusion logic via NOT EXISTS properly filters out all events from "bad" cases while retaining all events from qualifying cases. The final ORDER BY ensures chronological ordering per case, and the use of DISTINCT in the CTE avoids redundant case_ids. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; assumptions about timestamp ordering align with the prompt, and quoting handles potential keyword issues safely.
