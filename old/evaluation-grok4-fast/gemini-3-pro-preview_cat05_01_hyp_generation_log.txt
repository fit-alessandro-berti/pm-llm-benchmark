### Evaluation Rationale
This prompt is well-structured overall, providing a clear role, schema, happy path, and task breakdown that effectively encourages the target LLM to engage in anomaly detection, hypothesis generation, and SQL query proposal. It uses the provided data accurately (e.g., summarizing cases without fabricating details) and specifies a logical output format, which aids in testing the LLM's analytical skills. The emphasis on generalizing to the full dataset (not just specific cases) is a strength, promoting broader pattern detection.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several flaws prevent a higher score:

- **Provision of Hints and Guidance (Major Flaw, -2.0 deduction):** The underlying requirement explicitly states the prompt should encourage the LLM "without any hints or guidance provided here." This prompt violates this by embedding direct cues. In Task 1, it specifies "specific deviations, such as skipped steps, out-of-order activities, or logical impossibilities (e.g., shipping before confirming)," which telegraphs a key anomaly (present in Cases 1002 and 1003) rather than letting the LLM discover it organically. In Task 2, the bullet-point "possibilities such as" (e.g., "Maverick Buying," bypassing controls, retrospective recording, order_type influence) provides leading hypotheses, biasing the LLM toward certain explanations instead of free-form reasoning. In Task 3, the "Example requirement" bullets (e.g., "shipping happens before credit checks," joining resources for skipping steps, high-value orders) are overt hints on query ideas, undermining the test of independent SQL formulation. These elements make the prompt more of a scaffold than a pure test, reducing its rigor.

- **Incomplete Data Representation (Minor Flaw, -0.5 deduction):** The sample data snippets are abbreviated (e.g., omitting timestamps, resources, and additional_info for most events), which is efficient but risks the LLM missing nuances like resource departments or credit scores that could inform anomalies (e.g., Finance handling shipments). While not inaccurate, this unclarifies the full context from the original schema/data, potentially leading to shallower analysis.

- **Logical Inconsistencies and Over-Specificity (Minor Flaw, -0.5 deduction):** Task 1 asks to "analyze Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004" explicitly, which narrows focus to these (flagged as deviant) rather than encouraging broad scanning of all cases (e.g., including the normal Case 1001 more holistically). This creates a logical tilt toward confirmation bias. Additionally, the happy path is presented as absolute, but the prompt doesn't clarify if variations (e.g., by order_type like priority in Case 1002) might be allowable, introducing potential ambiguity in hypothesis generation.

- **Strengths Not Fully Maximized (No deduction, but caps upside):** The prompt correctly ties to PostgreSQL syntax and encourages joins across tables, aligning with the schema. Hypotheses are business-oriented (e.g., compliance risks), and the full-dataset focus is good. However, it doesn't push for quantitative metrics (e.g., frequency thresholds for anomalies) or edge-case exploration (e.g., incomplete cases like 1004 lacking payment), missing opportunities for deeper testing.

The prompt is functional and comprehensive (starting from ~8.0 baseline), but the hinting issues are significant breaches of the "no hints" criterion, warranting a mid-range score. A near-flawless version would remove all examples/cues, relying solely on schema, happy path, and raw data to provoke unguided discovery.
