### Evaluation Rationale
This answer produces an excellent, well-structured list of 19 open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's goals. It categorizes them logically (e.g., by process stage or theme), ensuring comprehensive coverage of missing details (e.g., Q1 on documentation issues, Q6 on inspection thresholds), decision criteria (e.g., Q2 on factor weighting, Q10 on tenant selection frameworks), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q5 on manager authority, Q7 on financial accountability, Q16 on handoffs), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q12 on review points, Q15 on mid-process withdrawal), and exception handling (e.g., Q14 on common requests, Q15 on withdrawals). Additional questions on metrics (Q18) and process evolution (Q19) naturally deepen conceptual understanding without straying into prohibited areas like SQL or implementation.

The questions are precisely targeted, inviting elaboration (e.g., "walk me through," "what is the typical approval pathway") while remaining conceptual and process-focused. Phrasing is professional and flows sequentially where possible, enhancing clarity for an interview context. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities exist—each question is grounded in the provided process description and probes ambiguities effectively. The only minor nitpick (not warranting a deduction beyond 0.5) is the slight specificity in Q18 ("two or three metrics"), which could be even more purely open-ended as "key metrics," but it does not detract from the overall quality or intent. This is nearly flawless execution.
