In the context of process mining and fairness, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to discrimination or unfair treatment if used in decision-making processes. These attributes are often related to personal characteristics that are protected by law or ethical guidelines.

From the attributes provided in the event log, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether a case (e.g., a tenant or prospective tenant) is a citizen or not. Citizenship status is a sensitive attribute because decisions based on citizenship could lead to discrimination against non-citizens.

2. **case:gender**: Gender is a classic sensitive attribute. Decisions based on gender can lead to gender-based discrimination, which is unethical and often illegal.

3. **case:german speaking**: While language proficiency might seem neutral, it can be correlated with nationality, ethnicity, or cultural background. Using this attribute in decision-making could indirectly lead to discrimination based on these factors.

4. **case:married**: Marital status is another sensitive attribute. Decisions based on marital status could lead to discrimination against individuals based on their relationship status, which is generally considered unfair.

These attributes are sensitive because they can be associated with personal characteristics that should not influence the fairness of the process. In process mining and process management, it is important to ensure that decisions and processes are fair and free from discrimination based on these sensitive attributes.
