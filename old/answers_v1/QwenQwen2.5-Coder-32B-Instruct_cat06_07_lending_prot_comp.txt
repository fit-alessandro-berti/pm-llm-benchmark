To identify the main differences in the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second), let's analyze the process variants and their execution times. The key areas to focus on include the frequency of different outcomes, the presence or absence of certain steps, and the performance (execution time) of these processes.

### Process Outcomes:
1. **Application Rejected**
   - **Protected Group**: 960 occurrences
   - **Unprotected Group**: 664 occurrences
   
   The protected group is being rejected more frequently at the 'Application Rejected' stage.

2. **Loan Denied**
   - Protected Group has multiple variants totaling approximately 1,216 occurrences.
   - Unprotected Group has multiple variants totaling approximately 5,465 occurrences.
   
   The unprotected group is being denied a loan significantly more often. Specifically, the unprotected group has 5,465 occurrences of 'Loan Denied' compared to 1,216 occurrences for the protected group.

3. **Loan Approved**
   - Protected Group: totaling approximately 228 occurrences of 'Sign Loan Agreement'.
   - Unprotected Group: totaling approximately 2,513 occurrences of 'Sign Loan Agreement'.
   
   The unprotected group is being approved for a loan notably more often than the protected group.

### Process Steps:
1. **Request Appointment -> Appointment Denied**
   - Both groups have similar frequencies (599 protected vs. 363 unprotected), but let's check if the performance (execution time) is significantly different.
       - **Performance**: Protected (90000.623) vs. Unprotected (80001.088). This difference is relatively small.

2. **Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information ->**
   - Both groups follow through to this point in most cases, indicating similar procedural alignment.
   - The frequency of additional steps after this varies significantly between the two groups.

3. **Visit to Assess Collateral**
   - The protected group has multiple variants where they visit to assess collateral (229, 217, 138, 104, 88, 84, 40, 37, 33, 26, and 15 occurrences).
   - The unprotected group also visits collateral, but less frequently and fewer total occurrences (297, 58, 44, 40, 23, 12, and 7 occurrences).

4. **Request Co-Signer**
   - The protected group requests a co-signer in many variants (229, 217, 138, 104, 88, 84, 40, 37, 33, 26, and 15 occurrences of varying steps).
   - The unprotected group also requests a co-signer (335, 188, 183, 80, 58, 44, 40, 7, and 5 occurrences).

### Overall Performance (Execution Time):
- The average execution time is higher for the protected group in several variants (e.g., 350014.817) compared to the unprotected group (e.g., 439983.167), especially in detailed assessment variants. However, overall average performance between these groups does show overlaps that are within a reasonable range.

### Deduction Analysis:
1. **Higher Rejection Rate:** The protected group is being rejected more frequently at the initial stage 'Application Rejected', which is concerning for fairness.
2. **Higher Denial Rate:** The higher occurrence of 'Loan Denied' in the protected group suggests potential systematic issues or biases in the loan application process for this group.
3. **Lower Approval Rate:** The lower rate of 'Sign Loan Agreement' for the protected group indicates underrepresentation in loan approvals, which is another critical indicator of potential bias.

### Recommendations:
- **Audit the Application Rejection Criteria:** Review why the protected group is being rejected more frequently. Perhaps there are specific criteria that disproportionately affect them.
- **Evaluate the Assessment Procedures:** Investigate why the protected group requires more collateral visits and co-signer requests. How are these decisions made? Are they in line with fair lending practices?
- **Performance Review:** Analyze if the higher execution times for protected group variants are due to biased or overly meticulous procedures and consider streamlining where possible.

By reviewing these differences, you can identify potential areas of unfair treatment and make informed decisions to address and rectify any biases in the loan application process.
