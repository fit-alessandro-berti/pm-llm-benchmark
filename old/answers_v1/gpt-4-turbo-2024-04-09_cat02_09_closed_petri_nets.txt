Certainly! Here's a conceptual exploration of each provided Petri net concept, addressing their opposites and proposing more general overarching ideas:

1. **Source Place**
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Sink Place*. While a source place in Petri nets is a place with no incoming arcs, only having outgoing arcs (acting as a producer of tokens), a sink place conversely has no outgoing arcs but only incoming arcs, essentially consuming or accumulating tokens without distributing them further.
   - **More General Concept:** *Petri Net Places*. This generalized concept encompasses all types of places in a Petri net, including source places, sink places, and standard places with both incoming and outgoing arcs. It focuses on the role and function of places within the structure of a Petri net, facilitating the overall modeling of process dynamics through token distribution.

2. **Immediate Transition**
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Timed Transition*. If an immediate transition is a type of transition in Petri nets that fires instantaneously without any delay when its preconditions are met, a timed transition involves a delay, requiring a certain condition of time before it fires. Timed transitions simulate transitions that consume real-time.
   - **More Informative Concept:** *Transition Types in Petri Nets*. This concept covers all the different kinds of transitions that can exist in Petri nets, such as immediate transitions, timed transitions, and stochastic transitions, each adding different layers and dimensions to the modeling of processes and systems.

3. **Live Transition**
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Dead Transition*. A live transition in a Petri net is one that can potentially fire, given some specific conditions or marking of the net, and can continually be fired indefinitely. In contrast, a dead transition is a transition that can no longer fire under any marking of the net, indicating stagnation or an endpoint in the flow within the network.
   - **More General Concept:** *Transitional Attributes*. This broader concept encompasses different attributes or states of transitions in Petri nets, such as live, dead, enabled, or disabled, illustrating the varying statuses and behaviors transitions can exhibit based on the net's configuration and token distribution.

4. **Bounded Net**
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Unbounded Net*. A bounded net in Petri nets terms is a net where the number of tokens in each place does not exceed a certain fixed upper limit for any reachable marking, hence ensuring that the net's state space is finite. An unbounded net does not have such restrictions, thereby potentially growing infinitely in terms of tokens in some places, which can lead to infinite state spaces.
   - **More General Concept:** *Net Capacity Constraints*. This concept refers broadly to the limitations and boundaries (or lack thereof) regarding the capacities of places within a Petri net. It covers notions of boundedness, safety, and limitations of state space, addressing the scalability and manageability of the modeled system or process.

5. **Free Choice Net**
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Non-Free Choice Net*. In a free choice net, every place that feeds into more than one transition does so under a condition where the firing of one transition does not influence the availability of others — equivalent to a freely made choice without external dependencies. A non-free choice net, then, involves situations where the choice of transitions to fire is dependent on the state or conditions external to the local structure of transitions.
   - **More General Hierarchy:** *Decision Structures in Petri Nets*. As a general concept, decision structures encompass all the different ways in which choices and decisions can be modeled within Petri nets, including free choice nets, non-free choice nets, and extended free choice nets. This broader viewpoint helps analyze how decisions and their dependencies shape the dynamics and control within different Petri net frameworks.
