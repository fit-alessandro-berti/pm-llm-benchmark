Sure, here's an example Python code to implement a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the pm4py library:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (transitions) for the process
create_purchase_order = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
create_invoice = Transition(label="Create Invoice")
approve_invoice = Transition(label="Approve Invoice")
make_payment = Transition(label="Make Payment")

# Define silent transitions (if needed)
silent_transition = SilentTransition()

# Define choices (XOR operators)
goods_received_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[receive_goods, silent_transition])
invoice_approved_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve_invoice, silent_transition])

# Define loops (if needed)
# For example, a loop for approving an invoice
approve_invoice_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[approve_invoice, silent_transition])

# Define the overall process as a partial order
purchase_to_pay_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    create_purchase_order,
    goods_received_choice,
    create_invoice,
    invoice_approved_choice,
    approve_invoice_loop,
    make_payment
])

# Define the order of execution
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(create_purchase_order, goods_received_choice)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(goods_received_choice, create_invoice)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(create_invoice, invoice_approved_choice)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(invoice_approved_choice, approve_invoice_loop)
purchase_to_pay_process.order.add_edge(approve_invoice_loop, make_payment)
```

In this example, we first define the activities (transitions) for the Purchase-to-Pay process, such as "Create Purchase Order," "Receive Goods," "Create Invoice," "Approve Invoice," and "Make Payment." We also define silent transitions if needed.

Next, we define choices (XOR operators) and loops (if needed). In this case, we have an XOR choice for "Receive Goods" and another for "Approve Invoice." We also define a loop for the "Approve Invoice" activity, in case the invoice needs to be approved multiple times.

Then, we define the overall Purchase-to-Pay process as a `StrictPartialOrder`, which represents the partial order of execution. We add all the activities, choices, and loops as nodes in the partial order.

Finally, we define the order of execution by adding edges between the nodes using the `order.add_edge` method. The order follows the typical Purchase-to-Pay process flow: create a purchase order, receive goods (or skip this step), create an invoice, approve the invoice (potentially in a loop), and make the payment.

You can modify this code to adjust the process flow, add more activities, choices, or loops as needed for your specific Purchase-to-Pay process requirements.
