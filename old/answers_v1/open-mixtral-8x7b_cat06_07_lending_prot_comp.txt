Based on the data provided, here are some of the main differences in the process variants and their execution times between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. Loan Approval Rate: The protected group has a lower loan approval rate compared to the unprotected group. The protected group has more process variants that result in loan denial or application rejection, while the unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants that result in loan approval (i.e., Sign Loan Agreement).
2. Examination and Assessment: The protected group has more process variants that involve making visits to assess collateral, requesting co-signers, and submitting files to underwriters, which may indicate a more rigorous examination and assessment process compared to the unprotected group.
3. Execution Time: The protected group has longer execution times for some process variants compared to the unprotected group. For example, the process variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" takes an average of 390019.000 seconds for the protected group, while it takes an average of 440003.565 seconds for the unprotected group. However, it's important to note that the unprotected group has a higher frequency of this process variant, which may affect the overall execution time for this group.
4. Skipped Examination: The unprotected group has a process variant called "skipped examination," which is not present in the protected group. It's unclear what this process variant entails, but it may indicate a less rigorous examination process for the unprotected group.

Based on these observations, it appears that the protected group undergoes a more rigorous examination and assessment process, which may contribute to the lower loan approval rate and longer execution times for some process variants. The unprotected group, on the other hand, has a higher loan approval rate, shorter execution times for some process variants, and a process variant called "skipped examination" that is not present in the protected group. These differences may suggest unfair treatment of the protected group, but further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis.
