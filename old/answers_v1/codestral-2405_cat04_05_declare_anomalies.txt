Yes, there are some anomalies in the proposed process model. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. In the chain response ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), it's not possible for 'Request Payment' to directly follow 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' because according to the responded existence constraint, 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must always be followed by 'Request Payment'. This creates a circular dependency.

2. There is a contradiction between the 'Exactly 1' constraint and the 'Alternate response' constraint involving 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled'. If 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' must alternate without repetitions, then they cannot both occur exactly once.

3. The 'Absence' constraint is applied to activities that might be involved in the process. For instance, 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' and 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER' are marked as absent, but without knowing the context, it's unclear why these activities should not occur or whether their absence is intended.

4. The 'Succession' and 'Alternate succession' constraints between 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled' are redundant because 'Response' and 'Alternate response' constraints already include these relationships.

5. The 'Co-Existence' constraint between 'Request Payment' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' is unnecessary because the 'Responded Existence' constraint already implies this relationship.

These issues could lead to incorrect or unintended behavior in the process model and should be reviewed and corrected to ensure the model accurately reflects the desired process.
