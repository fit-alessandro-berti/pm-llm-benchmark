Process cubes were first introduced by Zijmunt Van Dongen and Wil van der Aalst as a unique concept for multi-dimensional process mining. Process cubes can be seen as a three-dimensional extension of process-centric data warehousing and offer a powerful approach to analyze processes from multiple perspectives.

Process cubes utilize a data structure that consists of three dimensions:

1. **Activity Dimension**: This dimension represents the activities or tasks that are performed in a process.

2. **Time Dimension**: This dimension represents the time at which the activities are executed. It can cover various time granularities like years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and even milliseconds.

3. **Case Dimension**: This dimension represents the individual instances or cases of process execution. Each case is a unique path through the process.

These dimensions enable multi-perspective process analysis. By analyzing data from these three dimensions simultaneously, it becomes possible to answer complex questions about processes, such as:

- Which activities are most frequently performed?
- How long does it usually take to complete a process?
- Which activities are most time-consuming?
- What is the relationship between the sequence of activities and the time taken to complete a process?
- Which cases (or instances of a process) are the most common and which are the exceptions?

Process cubes differ significantly from traditional process mining approaches, which primarily focus on discovering and visualizing process models. While these approaches are useful for understanding the flow of activities, they provide limited insights into how processes evolve over time or why certain behaviors occur.

Traditional process mining approaches often use techniques like event logs, Petri nets, and process trees to discover, analyze, and visualize processes. However, these approaches typically consider only one or two dimensions of data. For example, event logs may provide information about the sequence of activities and the time at which they occur, but they do not inherently provide information about the individual cases or instances of process execution.

By contrast, process cubes enable multi-dimensional process analysis, allowing data analysts to consider multiple perspectives simultaneously. This can lead to more comprehensive and accurate insights into processes, which can in turn be used to improve process efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and enhance customer satisfaction.

Overall, process cubes play a crucial role in multi-dimensional process mining by enabling the analysis of processes from multiple perspectives, providing insights that are not possible with traditional process mining approaches. However, using process cubes effectively requires careful data modeling and the use of appropriate analysis techniques.
