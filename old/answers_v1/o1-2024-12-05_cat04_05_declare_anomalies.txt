**Short Answer:**  
Yes, there are several anomalies. The model includes numerous overlapping, redundant, and contradictory constraints on the same pairs of activities. This leads to a highly over-constrained scenario with only one possible execution sequence. In particular, the combination of multiple constraint types (response, precedence, succession, alternate/chain variants) for the same activity pairs and the symmetrical responded-existence and co-existence constraints among all core activities result in contradictions or reduce the model’s flexibility to zero.

**Detailed Analysis:**  
The given DECLARE model imposes a wide array of constraints on the same set of activities, often in multiple and stronger forms. This can introduce anomalies in terms of both logical consistency and intended flexibility. Some key points are:

1. **Excessive Redundancy Among Constraints:**
   - For each pair of core activities (e.g., `(Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR)`, `(Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment)`, `(Request Payment, Payment Handled)`), the model includes multiple constraint types such as:
     - Responded Existence
     - Response
     - Precedence
     - Succession
     - Alternate Response/Precedence/Succession
     - Chain Response/Precedence/Succession
     - Co-Existence
     
   Typically, in a DECLARE model, one chooses a minimal set of constraints to express the intended behavior. Having all these variants (simple, alternate, chain, etc.) for the same pairs of activities is not only unusual but can create overlapping and possibly conflicting specifications.

2. **Symmetrical and Fully Connected Constraints:**
   - The Responded Existence and Co-Existence constraints appear symmetrically among all four main activities (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`). For instance:
     - If `Request Payment` occurs, then `Payment Handled` must also occur, and vice versa.
     - If `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` occurs, then `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`, and `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must also occur, and each of these in turn requires the others.
   
   This creates a fully interconnected structure where all main activities are mutually dependent. In practice, this means that once one activity occurs, all must occur. Given that each one has an "Existence" constraint (and in fact, an "Exactly 1" constraint), the entire set of four activities must appear exactly once in every valid trace.

3. **"Exactly 1" Constraints on All Core Activities:**
   - All main activities are mandated to occur exactly once. Combined with the symmetrical co-existence and responded existence constraints, this leaves no room for variability in the order or frequency. Every valid execution must have exactly these four events.

4. **Rigid Ordering Imposed by Precedence, Chain Precedence, and Chain Succession:**
   - The constraints like `Chain precedence: (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment)` and `Chain response: (Request Payment, Payment Handled)` force a strict, linear order:
     1. `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` (must start the trace per Initialization)
     2. `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`
     3. `Request Payment` (immediately after `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`)
     4. `Payment Handled` (immediately after `Request Payment`)

   Since alternate and chain variants also apply, the sequence is fully predetermined: there is only one possible sequence that satisfies all these constraints. This negates the purpose of a declarative model, which is to allow flexibility.

5. **Contradictions and Over-Constraint:**
   - Having alternate succession, chain succession, and standard succession on the same pairs is not only redundant but can lead to contradictions if interpreted strictly. For example, alternate succession implies a strict alternation pattern between the activities involved. Yet, we have multiple such constraints from the same source activity to different targets. Because all activities occur only once, some of these constraints are trivially satisfied or impossible to violate, but their presence still adds unnecessary complexity and confusion.
   
   - The combination of "Precedence" and "Response" for the same pair yields "Succession." If Succession is already stated, adding the individual Precedence and Response constraints is redundant. Stating Chain Succession and Alternate Succession on the same pairs further compounds the redundancy.

**Conclusion:**
The anomalies in the model are due to the presence of multiple, overlapping constraints that serve the same logical purpose but at varying degrees of strictness, all applied simultaneously to the same activities. This over-specification removes any flexibility and leads to a single permissible trace, contradicting the declarative paradigm’s core idea of allowing multiple valid executions. Thus, the model is overly complex, redundant, and anomalous as a result.
