Here is an example of a DECLARE model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9},
        'Send Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.95}
    },
    'absence': {
        'Cancel Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8}
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.9}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Cancel Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8}
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Cancel Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.8}
    }
}
```
This model specifies the following constraints:

* The activities "Create Purchase Order", "Send Invoice", and "Pay Invoice" must exist in the process.
* The activity "Cancel Order" must not exist in the process.
* The activity "Create Purchase Order" must be executed exactly once.
* The process must start with the activity "Create Purchase Order".
* If "Create Purchase Order" is executed, then "Send Invoice" must also be executed.
* If "Send Invoice" is executed, then "Pay Invoice" must also be executed.
* The activities "Create Purchase Order" and "Send Invoice" must coexist.
* The activities "Create Purchase Order" and "Send Invoice" must be executed in succession.
* The activities "Send Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" must be executed in succession.
* The activities "Cancel Order" and "Pay Invoice" must not coexist.
* The activity "Cancel Order" must not be followed by "Pay Invoice".

Note that this is just an example model, and you may need to adjust it to fit the specific requirements of your Purchase-to-Pay process.
