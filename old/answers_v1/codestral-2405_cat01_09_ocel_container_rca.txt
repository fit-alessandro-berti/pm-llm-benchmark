Based on the given directly follows graph, there are several performance issues that can be identified:

1. Delays in loading and unloading trucks: The "Load Truck" activity for trucks and containers occurs multiple times, which could indicate delays or inefficiencies in the loading and unloading process. The duration for these activities is also relatively high, suggesting that the process could be optimized for faster throughput.
2. Delays in container transportation: The "Drive to Terminal" and "Weigh" activities for containers have high durations. Additionally, the "Bring to Loading Bay" activity is repeated multiple times for some containers, which could indicate delays or inefficiencies in the transportation process.
3. Delays in vehicle booking and rescheduling: The "Book Vehicles" activity for vehicles and transport documents is repeated multiple times, and the duration for this activity is quite high. Additionally, the "Reschedule Container" activity is repeated for some vehicles and transport documents, which could indicate issues with availability or scheduling.
4. Delays in container ordering and picking up: The "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" activities have high durations, suggesting that the process for ordering and picking up containers could be optimized.
5. Delays in customer order registration and transport document creation: The "Register Customer Order" and "Create Transport Document" activities have high durations, suggesting that the process for registering customer orders and creating transport documents could be optimized.

To address these performance issues, specific considerations could include:

1. Improving truck loading and unloading efficiency: This could involve using larger trucks, implementing automated loading systems, or optimizing the sequence of loading and unloading activities to minimize overlap.
2. Optimizing container transportation: This could involve implementing a more efficient routing system for trucks, reducing the number of stops made at the terminal, or improving the efficiency of the weighing process.
3. Optimizing vehicle booking and rescheduling: This could involve implementing a more sophisticated scheduling system that takes into account vehicle availability, transportation demand, and other factors.
4. Optimizing container ordering and picking up: This could involve implementing a more efficient ordering system, improving the inventory management of empty containers, or using a more streamlined picking up process.
5. Optimizing customer order registration and transport document creation: This could involve implementing a more efficient ordering system, improving the accuracy of customer order data, or using automated systems to generate transport documents.

Overall, the performance issues in the process appear to be caused by a combination of inefficiencies in the loading and unloading process, delays in container transportation, difficulties with vehicle booking and rescheduling, and inefficiencies in the ordering and picking up process. Addressing these specific considerations could help to improve overall process performance and efficiency.
