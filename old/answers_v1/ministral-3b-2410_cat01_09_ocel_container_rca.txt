The performance issues in the process can be attributed to several specific factors related to the data and structure of the event log. Here are some key considerations:

1. **High Frequency of Events**: The event "Load Truck" has a very high frequency for both the Handling Unit and the Container objects. This indicates that this activity is being performed frequently, which could lead to bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

   - **Handling Unit**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 10553
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 10553
     - Duration = 7820.93
   - **Container**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 8559
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 1896
     - Duration = 5259.71

   These high frequencies suggest that the "Load Truck" activity might be a bottleneck or a critical step that needs more attention.

2. **High Frequency of "Load to Vehicle"**: The "Load to Vehicle" activity has a high frequency for the Forklift and Vehicle objects.

   - **Forklift**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 1753
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 3
     - Duration = 2318.32
   - **Vehicle**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 1390
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 3
     - Duration = 4349.86

   The high frequency and associated durations suggest that this activity is also a significant contributor to performance issues.

3. **High Frequency of "Pick Up Empty Container" and "Bring to Loading Bay"**: These activities have high frequencies for the Container object, which suggests they are part of a critical loop.

   - **Container**:
     - "Pick Up Empty Container" -> "Load Truck":
       - Frequency (number of events) = 1995
       - Frequency (number of objects) = 1995
       - Duration = 368943.92
     - "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle":
       - Frequency (number of events) = 1931
       - Frequency (number of objects) = 1931
       - Duration = 2428.91

   The high frequency and long durations indicate that these steps might be inefficient or could be optimized to reduce time and improve throughput.

4. **Long Duration of "Weigh" and "Place in Stock"**: The "Weigh" and "Place in Stock" activities have high frequencies and long durations for the Forklift and Container objects.

   - **Forklift**:
     - "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock":
       - Frequency (number of events) = 1326
       - Frequency (number of objects) = 3
       - Duration = 26927.52
     - "Place in Stock" -> "Weigh":
       - Frequency (number of events) = 1326
       - Frequency (number of objects) = 3
       - Duration = 26927.52
     - "Place in Stock":
       - Frequency (number of events) = 23
       - Frequency (number of objects) = 3
       - Duration = 469.57

   These long durations suggest that these activities might be time-consuming, and optimizing them could reduce overall process performance.

5. **High Frequency of "Reschedule Container"**: The "Reschedule Container" activity has a high frequency for both the Vehicle and Forklift objects.

   - **Vehicle**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 7
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 7
     - Duration = 152433.14
   - **Forklift**:
     - Frequency (number of events) = 36
     - Frequency (number of objects) = 36
     - Duration = 7110.06

   The high frequency and associated durations indicate that this activity is a significant contributor to performance issues.

### Root Causes and Recommendations:

1. **Optimize the "Load Truck" Activity**: Reducing the time or increasing the efficiency of the "Load Truck" activity could help alleviate bottlenecks.
2. **Streamline "Load to Vehicle" and "Bring to Loading Bay"**: Improving the efficiency of these activities can reduce the total time per process.
3. **Reduce Duration of "Weigh" and "Place in Stock"**: Efficiently handling these activities can reduce overall process time.
4. **Minimize Frequency of "Reschedule Container"**: Identifying and reducing the frequency at which containers are rescheduled could improve process performance.

By addressing these specific aspects of the process, the overall performance can be improved. Additionally, analyzing the data to identify potential inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the workflow can provide further insights for optimization.
