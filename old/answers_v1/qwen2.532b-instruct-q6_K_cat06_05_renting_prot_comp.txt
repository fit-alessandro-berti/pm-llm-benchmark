To identify unfair differences in treatment between the protected group and the unprotected group, we need to analyze both the frequency of process variants and their execution times (performance). Here are the key observations based on the provided data:

1. **Frequency Distribution**:
   - The most frequent variant for the unprotected group is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant` (frequency = 2490), which significantly outnumbers any single process variant of the protected group.
   - This suggests that the unprotected group faces a higher rate of rejection after completing more steps, compared to the protected group.

2. **Early Rejection**:
   - The second most frequent variant for the unprotected group involves early rejections (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant`), occurring 365 times.
   - For the protected group, similar early rejection variants exist but occur less frequently and with different subsequent steps leading to a rejection.

3. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - Variants where the unprotected group undergoes `Extensive Screening`, followed by rejection or eviction (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant`), have significantly lower performance (execution times) compared to similar variants in the protected group.
   - For example, the unprotected group's `Extensive Screening` variant has an average execution time of 480013.530, whereas a similar process for the protected group (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant`) occurs with different performance metrics and much less frequency.

4. **Advanced Stages Before Rejection or Eviction**:
   - There are fewer instances of the protected group undergoing extensive screening before rejection or eviction compared to the unprotected group.
   - The protected group tends to experience more complex processes that involve multiple payments followed by cancellation (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> ...`), which might indicate a different level of scrutiny or more thorough vetting.

5. **Missed Payments and Eviction**:
   - There is an instance in the protected group where extensive screening leads to missed rent payments, issue warnings, and eviction (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant`), which occurs less frequently compared to similar scenarios in the unprotected group.

### Conclusion

The key differences are primarily related to:
- **Early Rejection**: The unprotected group faces more frequent early rejections without proceeding further into the process.
- **Execution Time and Complexity**: Variants for the protected group often involve more complex processes with higher execution times, possibly indicating a more thorough evaluation before reaching a final decision or outcome.
- **Rejection After Extensive Screening**: There are fewer instances of extensive screening leading to rejection in the protected group compared to the unprotected group.

These observations suggest that there may be an unfair bias in how the groups are treated, with the unprotected group facing higher rates of early and post-screening rejections.
