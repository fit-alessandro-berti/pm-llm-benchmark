Analyzing the directly follows graph (DFG) provided for each object type, we can identify several potential root causes for performance issues within the process. These considerations are based on the observed durations, frequencies, and sequence flows:

1. **Handling Unit:**
   - The transition from "Collect Goods" to "Load Truck" has a high frequency and a notable duration (7820.93). This suggests that there might be bottlenecks or inefficiencies during the loading of goods.

2. **Truck:**
   - The loop transition "Load Truck" to itself has a significant number of occurrences (8559 events) with only 6 objects involved, indicating that loading activities repeat frequently. This may suggest waiting times, re-adjustments, or inefficient loading practices.
   - The transition "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck" has an exceptionally long duration (84119.09). This indicates delays in returning from the terminal to the loading phase, suggesting possible queue times or transport delays.

3. **Container:**
   - The transition "Order Empty Containers" to "Pick Up Empty Container" has a very high average duration (368943.92), indicating potentially lengthy processing times for container ordering, which could point to inefficiencies in order processing or container availability.
   - The transition "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay" has a very long duration (743380.51). This suggests significant idle times or delays between placing containers in stock and moving them to the loading bay, possibly due to scheduling or coordination issues.
   - The frequent looping activity between similar tasks, like "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Reschedule Container", suggests potential inefficiencies in managing container schedules and locations.

4. **Vehicle:**
   - "Book Vehicles" transitions have long durations, especially the loop "Book Vehicles" to itself (295965.56). This indicates inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process or availability.
   - Multiple transitions, such as "Book Vehicles" to "Load to Vehicle", have long durations, highlighting delays in the execution of vehicle assignments and logistics coordination.

5. **Forklift:**
   - The cycle between "Place in Stock" and "Weigh" has significant durations (e.g., 26927.52 and 112600.53), suggesting inefficiencies in inventory management or forklift operations, leading to delays in processing and movement activities.

6. **Customer Order and Transport Document:**
   - The transition "Register Customer Order" to "Create Transport Document" has a very high duration (329005.22), highlighting potential delays in documentation creation which can affect overall process throughput.
   - For transport documents, the transition from "Order Empty Containers" to "Depart" has an exceptionally high duration (1007066.16). This indicates prolonged wait times from ordering containers to departure, pointing to logistical or scheduling issues that could be a major bottleneck.

Overall, the root causes for performance issues in this process are mainly related to:
- Long durations in transition activities that are likely bottlenecks.
- Repetitions within certain loops indicating inefficiencies in process execution.
- Delays in container and vehicle scheduling, loading, and documentation, which could be tied to resource constraints or poor process synchronization.
