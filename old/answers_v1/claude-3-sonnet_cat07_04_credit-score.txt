The provided image is a process flow diagram that illustrates the sequence of steps involved in a credit scoring process. The diagram consists of two main sections or "pools" - one labeled "credit scoring request" and the other labeled "credit scoring entity".

The process starts with a "scoring request received" event in the credit scoring entity pool. This triggers the "request credit score" task, which sends the request to the credit scoring request pool. Here, the "compute credit score (level 1)" task is performed.

If the credit score is available after level 1, the "send credit score" task is executed, and the credit score is sent back to the credit scoring entity pool, where it is received and handled by the "send credit score" task, completing the process.

However, if the credit score is not available after level 1, a "report delay" task is triggered, which sends a delay notification to the credit scoring entity pool. In this case, the "compute credit score (level 2)" task is performed, and the resulting credit score is sent back to the credit scoring request pool via the "send credit score" task, where it is handled and the scoring request is handled.

The diagram also includes a note indicating that an "inst. ID for message queueing" is used, suggesting the involvement of a message queueing system in the process.
