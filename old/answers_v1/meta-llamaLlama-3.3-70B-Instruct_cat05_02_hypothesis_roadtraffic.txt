Here are 20 relevant questions over the process with a confidence score for each:

1. **What is the most common process variant in terms of frequency?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the most common path taken by the process.
2. **What is the average performance of the process variants that involve payment?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the efficiency of the process when payment is involved.
3. **Which activity has the highest frequency of occurrence across all process variants?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
	* This question is relevant because it helps identify the most critical activity in the process.
4. **What is the probability of a process instance going to credit collection after adding a penalty?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the likelihood of a process instance taking a specific path.
5. **What is the average performance of the process variants that involve an appeal to the judge?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the efficiency of the process when an appeal is involved.
6. **Which process variant has the highest performance in terms of completion time?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps identify the most efficient process variant.
7. **What is the frequency of process instances that involve both payment and credit collection?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the overlap between payment and credit collection.
8. **How does the frequency of process variants change when an appeal to the prefecture is involved?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the impact of an appeal on the process.
9. **What is the average number of activities in a process variant that involves an appeal to the judge?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the complexity of the process when an appeal is involved.
10. **Which activity has the lowest frequency of occurrence across all process variants?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
	* This question is relevant because it helps identify the least critical activity in the process.
11. **What is the probability of a process instance going to payment after adding a penalty?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the likelihood of a process instance taking a specific path.
12. **What is the average performance of the process variants that involve an appeal to the prefecture?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the efficiency of the process when an appeal is involved.
13. **Which process variant has the lowest performance in terms of completion time?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps identify the least efficient process variant.
14. **What is the frequency of process instances that involve both an appeal to the judge and credit collection?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the overlap between an appeal and credit collection.
15. **How does the performance of process variants change when payment is involved?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the impact of payment on the process.
16. **What is the average number of activities in a process variant that involves payment?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the complexity of the process when payment is involved.
17. **Which process variant has the highest frequency of occurrence among process instances that involve an appeal to the prefecture?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the most common path taken by the process when an appeal is involved.
18. **What is the probability of a process instance going to an appeal to the judge after adding a penalty?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the likelihood of a process instance taking a specific path.
19. **What is the average performance of the process variants that involve an appeal to the prefecture and credit collection?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps understand the efficiency of the process when an appeal and credit collection are involved.
20. **Which activity has the highest impact on the overall performance of the process?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
	* This question is relevant because it helps identify the most critical activity in terms of performance.

Note that the confidence scores are subjective and based on my understanding of the process and the questions. They are intended to provide a rough estimate of the relevance and answerability of each question.
