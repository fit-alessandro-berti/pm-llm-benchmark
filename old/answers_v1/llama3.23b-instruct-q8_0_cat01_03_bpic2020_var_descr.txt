The process underlying this data appears to be a workflow management system for processing and approving financial declarations, specifically requests for payment related to expenses or reimbursements submitted by employees.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED**: An employee submits a declaration (e.g., expense report, reimbursement request) through an electronic submission system.
2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administration reviews and approves the submission.
3. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor reviews and finalizes the approval of the declaration.
4. **Request Payment**: After all approvals are received, a request for payment is generated.
5. **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and handled.

There are various branches in this process that diverge based on the outcome of certain steps:

1. **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** or **MISSING**: If the supervisor rejects the declaration or there's an issue, it goes to a "missing" category.
2. **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**: Some declarations are rejected by the employee themselves before reaching the administration level.
3. **Rejection by BUDGET OWNER**: Declarations may be rejected by the budget owner at various stages of the process.

The frequency and performance metrics provided suggest that this process is critical to the organization's financial management, with thousands of declarations processed annually.

Some observations about the data:

* There are multiple paths through the process, indicating that some declarations may not require all approvals or steps.
* Some declarations may be rejected at various stages, leading to alternative routes through the process.
* Performance metrics vary significantly across different branches and frequency, suggesting that certain areas of the process have efficiency issues or bottlenecks.

Overall, this data suggests a complex workflow management system with multiple approval levels and rejection mechanisms, indicating a high level of complexity in financial declaration processing.
