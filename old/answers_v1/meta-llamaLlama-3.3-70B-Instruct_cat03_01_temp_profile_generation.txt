Here's an example of a temporal profile for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. 

The P2P process involves several activities such as Purchase Request, Purchase Order, Goods Receipt, Invoice Receipt, and Payment. 

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order'): (3 * 86400, 1 * 86400),  # 3 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (7 * 86400, 2 * 86400),  # 7 days avg, 2 days std dev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (10 * 86400, 3 * 86400),  # 10 days avg, 3 days std dev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (3 * 86400, 1 * 86400),  # 3 days avg, 1 day std dev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment'): (14 * 86400, 4 * 86400),  # 14 days avg, 4 days std dev
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): (7 * 86400, 2 * 86400),  # 7 days avg, 2 days std dev
}
```
In this example, the average and standard deviation of the times are fictional and used just for illustration purposes. 
In a real-world scenario, you would need to calculate these values from historical data of your process executions.

Theouples of activities and their corresponding average and standard deviation of times are:
- ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order'): 3 days average, 1 day standard deviation
- ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): 7 days average, 2 days standard deviation
- ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): 10 days average, 3 days standard deviation
- ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): 3 days average, 1 day standard deviation
- ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment'): 14 days average, 4 days standard deviation
- ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): 7 days average, 2 days standard deviation

These values indicate that for example, the time between the 'Purchase Order' and 'Goods Receipt' activities is expected to be around 7 days on average, with a standard deviation of 2 days. 

You can use these values to determine if a deviation occurs in a process execution by using the given ZETA value. 

For instance, given a ZETA value of 2, a deviation would occur if the time between 'Purchase Order' and 'Goods Receipt' is less than 7 - 2 * 2 = 3 days or greater than 7 + 2 * 2 = 11 days.
