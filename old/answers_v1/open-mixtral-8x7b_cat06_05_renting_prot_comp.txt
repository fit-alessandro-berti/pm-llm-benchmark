Based on the data provided, here are some of the main differences in the process variants between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. **Frequency of "Reject Prospective Tenant"**: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include "Reject Prospective Tenant" than the unprotected group. This could indicate that the protected group is being rejected more frequently during the tenant screening process.
2. **Extensive Screening**: The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include "Extensive Screening" than the unprotected group. This could indicate that the protected group is being subjected to more rigorous screening processes, which could potentially be a barrier to entry.
3. **Frequency of "Pay Rent"**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants that include "Pay Rent" than the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to become tenants and successfully complete the rental process.
4. **Frequency of "Tenant Cancels Apartment"**: Both groups have process variants that include "Tenant Cancels Apartment", but the protected group has a higher frequency of these process variants. This could indicate that the protected group is more likely to cancel their rental agreement after signing the contract.
5. **Performance**: The protected group generally has higher execution times or "performance" than the unprotected group. This could indicate that the processes for the protected group are more time-consuming and complex, which could be a disadvantage.

These differences could suggest that the protected group is facing unfair treatment in the rental process. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm this and to identify the specific causes of these differences. It would also be important to consider other factors that could influence the rental process, such as the applicants' credit scores, income, and rental history.
