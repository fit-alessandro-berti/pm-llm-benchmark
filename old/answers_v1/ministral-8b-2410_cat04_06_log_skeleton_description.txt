Certainly! Based on the declarative constraints provided, we can infer the process underlying the Log Skeleton process model. Here's a description of the process:

### Activities and Roles
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** - The employee submits a declaration.
2. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION** - The administrator reviews the declaration for approval.
3. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** - The administrator approves the declaration.
4. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER** - A pre-approver reviews the declaration for approval.
5. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER** - The pre-approver approves the declaration.
6. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR** - A supervisor reviews the declaration for approval.
7. **Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor approves the declaration.
8. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor makes the final approval of the declaration.
9. **Request Payment** - A request for payment is made.
10. **Payment Handled** - Payment is processed.
11. **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE** - The employee saves the declaration.
12. **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** - The employee rejects the declaration.
13. **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** - The administrator rejects the declaration.
14. **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** - The pre-approver rejects the declaration.
15. **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor rejects the declaration.
16. **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER** - The budget owner rejects the declaration.
17. **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** - The declaration is rejected due to missing information.

### Process Flow
1. **Submission Phase**
   - The process begins with the **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**.
   - The **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION** follows, where the administrator reviews the declaration.
   - If approved, the process proceeds to the approval phase. Otherwise, it moves to the rejection phase.

2. **Approval Phase**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** - After the administrator's approval, the declaration moves to the pre-approver.
   - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER** - The pre-approver reviews the declaration.
   - If approved, the process proceeds to the supervisor's review. Otherwise, it moves to the rejection phase.

3. **Supervisor's Review Phase**
   - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor reviews the declaration.
   - If approved, the declaration moves to the final approval phase. Otherwise, it moves to the rejection phase.

4. **Final Approval Phase**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor makes the final approval of the declaration.

5. **Payment Phase**
   - After the final approval, a **Request Payment** is made.
   - If the payment is successful, **Payment Handled** is recorded.

6. **Rejection Phase**
   - Declarations can be rejected at various points:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** - The employee rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** - The administrator rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** - The pre-approver rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** - The supervisor rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER** - The budget owner rejects the declaration.
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** - The declaration is rejected due to missing information.

7. **Saving Declarations**
   - Declarations can be saved by the employee using **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**.

### Constraints
- **Equivalence**: Certain declarations have equivalent outcomes, such as 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.
- **Always Before**: For example, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' always occurs before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.
- **Always After**: For instance, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' always occurs after 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'.
- **Never Together**: Some activities cannot co-exist, such as 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' and 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'.
- **Directly-Follows Constraints**: For example, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' directly follows 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

### Activity Occurrences
- Certain activities have bounded occurrences, such as the declaration can be submitted multiple times (0 to 7 times) by the employee.
