   - It can follow "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

8. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**:
   - This activity signifies that the declaration is awaiting approval by the supervisor.
   - It can follow "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

9. **Request Payment**:

10. **Payment Handled**:
    - This activity signifies that a payment has been handled (processed).
    - It can follow "Request Payment" and must alternate with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

### Constraints and Sequences
1. **Responded Existence**:
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" should also occur.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Request Payment" should also occur.

2. **Alternate Response**:
   - Activities such as "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" must alternate without repetition.
   - Similarly, "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Payment Handled".

3. **Precedence and Chain Precedence**:
   - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must precede "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Payment Handled".
   - Chain precedence ensures a direct sequence.

4. **Response and Chain Response**:
   - "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" should be followed by "Request Payment" or "Payment Handled".
   - Chain response ensures direct sequencing without repetition.

5. **Succession and Chain Succession**:
   - The sequence following "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Request Payment" should be direct and chain-like.

6. **Co-Existence**:
   - Activities like "Request Payment" and "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must co-exist but not necessarily in that order.

7. **Non Co-Existence and Non Succession**:
   - Activities like "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" should not co-exist with "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR".

### Summary of the Process Flow
1. **Start:** "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".
2. **Approval/Rejection Steps:** Activities such as "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR".
3. **Payment Request:** "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled".
   - These activities must alternate and follow the approval process.
4. **Initialization:** Starts with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".
5. **Absence:** Certain activities like "Declaration REJECTED" are not part of the main sequence.

The process integrates approvals, rejections, and payments in a structured manner, ensuring that activities follow specific sequence and interaction rules defined by the constraints.
