To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process described, we need to focus on process-specific aspects and data. Here are the potential causes and considerations based on the given data:

### 1. **High Frequency of Rejections and Re-submissions**
- **Rejections from Administrators and Pre-Approvers:**
  - **Root Cause:** There is a significant number of declarations being rejected by Administrators and Pre-Approvers. This suggests a need for review and approval processes that might be too stringent or necessitating more scrutiny.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Frequency:** The frequencies of rejections by Administrators and Pre-Approvers are relatively high (e.g., Administrators: 174, Pre-Approvers: 575, 29).
    - **Performance Impact:** These rejections often lead to multiple re-submissions, which can increase the overall process time.
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Improve the approval criteria or automation to handle routine approvals efficiently.
      - Implement a feedback mechanism to understand why some declarations are rejected, possibly leading to policy or procedural adjustments.

- **Rejections from Budget Owners:**
  - **Root Cause:** There are several declarations rejected by Budget Owners, which can lead to additional re-submissions.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Frequency:** Number of rejections by Budget Owners is high (e.g., 29, 21).
    - **Performance Impact:** Budget Owners' rejections can delay the final approval process.
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Review and streamline the budget approval process.
      - Ensure Budget Owners have clear guidelines and processes for rejection.

### 2. **Long Approval Times**
- **Root Cause:** There are instances where the process involves multiple approvals, each taking time.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Process Variants:** Some variants involve multiple approval steps (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR").
    - **Performance Impact:** Each approval step can add to the total processing time.
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Streamline the approval process by reducing redundant approval steps.
      - Implement parallel approvals where appropriate.

### 3. **High Frequency of Re-submissions**
- **Root Cause:** Several rejections followed by re-submissions increase the overall time spent on the process.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Process Variants:** Multiple rejections followed by re-submissions are common (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE").
    - **Performance Impact:** Re-submissions add to the overall frequency and performance.
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Improve the initial submission process to ensure all necessary information is included.
      - Implement triggers for automated follow-ups on rejections.

### 4. **Lack of Clear Final Approval Pathways**
- **Root Cause:** Variants involving "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" or "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" indicate unclear or incomplete final approval pathways.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Frequency:** High rejections with unclear pathways (e.g., 21, 6, 40, 22, 14).
    - **Performance Impact:** Unclear pathways can lead to delays and rejections.
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Define clear pathways and exceptions for final approvals.
      - Implement robust tracking and escalation processes for missing or delayed approvals.

### 5. **Performance Impact of Payment Handled**
- **Root Cause:** The "Payment Handled" step is the final stage, and its performance varies significantly.
  - **Data Specific Considerations:**
    - **Performance Impact:** Varies widely (e.g., 810187.903 to 3502608.250).
    - **Suggestions:**
      - Review the efficiency of the payment handling process.
      - Identify bottlenecks or delays in this final step and address them.

### Summary
The root causes for the performance issues in the process revolve around high frequency of rejections, multiple approval steps, re-submissions, unclear final approval pathways, and inefficiencies in the payment handling process. Addressing these specific process and data considerations will help improve overall performance.
