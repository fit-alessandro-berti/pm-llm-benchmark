To identify the main differences in the treatment of the "protected" and "unprotected" groups, we'll focus on process variants, frequencies, and performance times. Here's a comparative analysis:

### Main Differences:

1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The "protected" group has a more varied set of process variants, with more detailed and varied steps.
   - The "unprotected" group has fewer and simpler process variants.

2. **Performance Times:**
   - Generally, the "protected" group has higher performance times for their process variants.
   - The "unprotected" group has lower performance times for most variants, especially those leading to loan denials.

3. **Frequencies:**
   - The "protected" group processes more frequently involve steps like making visits to assess collateral and requesting co-signers.
   - The "unprotected" group has a higher frequency of straightforward steps like submitting files to underwriters and having loan applications rejected.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Protected Group:
- **High Variability in Steps:**
  - The protected group has more complex processes with multiple steps such as verifying borrower information, making visits to assess collateral, and requesting co-signers.
- **Higher Performance Times:**
  - Most variants have higher performance times, indicating more time spent on the process.
- **Frequent Denials:**
  - Many variants end in loan denials, which suggests that the protected group faces more scrutiny and rejection.

#### Unprotected Group:
- **Simpler and More Streamlined Processes:**
  - The unprotected group follows a more linear and straightforward process, with fewer additional steps.
- **Lower Performance Times:**
  - Generally, process times are lower, indicating faster processing.
- **Higher Frequency of Loan Approvals:**
  - There are more instances of successful loan agreements (Sign Loan Agreement), suggesting a higher approval rate for the unprotected group.

### Specific Differences:

1. **Step `Make Visit to Assess Collateral`:**
   - **Protected Group:** This step is frequent and often leads to making additional visits, which increases the overall process time.
   - **Unprotected Group:** This step is also frequent but often leads directly to loan denials or approvals, with fewer additional visits.

2. **Step `Request Co-Signer On Loan`:**
   - **Protected Group:** This step is frequently required and often leads to multiple visits to assess collateral, which increases the process time.
   - **Unprotected Group:** This step is also required but less frequently results in additional visits compared to the protected group.

3. **Loan Denials:**
   - **Protected Group:** Frequently ends in loan denials after additional steps like making visits to assess collateral and requesting co-signers.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Also ends in loan denials but with fewer additional steps and lower overall performance times.

4. **Application Rejections:**
   - **Protected Group:** Rejected applications are less frequent compared to the unprotected group's straightforward rejections.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Rejections are more frequent, often after straightforward processes.

### Potential Unfairness:

1. **Complexity and Time:**
   - The protected group faces a more complex process with higher time requirements, suggesting a potentially unfair delay or difficulty in processing compared to the unprotected group.

2. **Approval Rates:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan approvals, implying a quicker and more efficient approval process compared to the protected group.

3. **Scrutiny and Rejection:**
   - The protected group experiences more rejection after additional steps, which could be seen as unfair scrutiny or unnecessary delays.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the complexity and time required for the process variants, with the protected group facing more scrutiny and longer processing times. The unprotected group, on the other hand, has more streamlined and faster processes, leading to higher approval rates and fewer denials. This analysis suggests potential unfair differences in the treatment of the two groups.
