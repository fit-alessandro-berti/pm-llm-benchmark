Based on the provided data, I'll identify some of the main differences between the treatment of the "protected" group and the "unprotected" group.

1. **Number of process variants**: The unprotected group has more process variants (13) compared to the protected group (15). This could indicate that the unprotected group is being treated differently or with less scrutiny.
2. **Complexity of processes**: Some processes in the unprotected group are shorter and simpler, such as "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 365, performance = 80002.688) vs. "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" (frequency = 268, performance = 640003.769). This could suggest that the unprotected group is being given more leniency or fewer opportunities for scrutiny.
3. **Performance metrics**: The average performance metrics for the unprotected group are generally higher than those of the protected group. For example, the unprotected group's average performance metric is around 800000-900000, while the protected group's average performance metric is around 400000-500000. This could indicate that the unprotected group is being treated differently or with more leniency.
4. **Frequency of processes**: The frequency of some processes in the unprotected group is much higher than those in the protected group. For example, "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 2490) vs. "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 1036). This could suggest that the unprotected group is being treated differently or with more leniency.
5. **Length of process chains**: Some processes in the protected group involve longer chain lengths, such as "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 793, performance = 540011.977). This could indicate that the protected group is being subjected to more scrutiny or has fewer opportunities for leniency.
6. **Significant variations in performance**: Some processes in both groups have significant variations in performance. For example, "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" (frequency = 29, performance = 810021.897) vs. "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 365, performance = 80002.688). This could suggest that there are opportunities for improvement in both groups.

It is essential to note that these differences might not necessarily be due to unfair treatment and should be investigated further to understand the underlying reasons behind them.
