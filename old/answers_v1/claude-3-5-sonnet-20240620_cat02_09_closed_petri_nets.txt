Certainly, I'll provide the opposite concept, a more general concept, and explanations for each of the Petri net concepts you've listed.

1. Source Place
   - Opposite: Sink Place
   - More general: Place
   - Explanation: A source place is a place with no incoming arcs, while a sink place has no outgoing arcs. Both are specific types of places in a Petri net.

2. Immediate Transition
   - Opposite: Timed Transition
   - More general: Transition
   - Explanation: An immediate transition fires as soon as it's enabled, while a timed transition has a delay. Both are types of transitions in a Petri net.

3. Live Transition
   - Opposite: Dead Transition
   - More general: Transition
   - Explanation: A live transition can always be fired through some firing sequence, while a dead transition can never be fired. Both describe the behavior of transitions in a Petri net.

4. Bounded Net
   - Opposite: Unbounded Net
   - More general: Petri Net
   - Explanation: A bounded net has a finite number of tokens in each place for all reachable markings, while an unbounded net can accumulate an infinite number of tokens in at least one place. Both are properties of entire Petri nets.

5. Free Choice Net
   - Opposite: Non-Free Choice Net
   - More general: Petri Net
   - Explanation: In a free choice net, if two transitions share an input place, it's the only input place for both. Non-free choice nets don't have this restriction. Both are structural classifications of Petri nets.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts or their relationships?
