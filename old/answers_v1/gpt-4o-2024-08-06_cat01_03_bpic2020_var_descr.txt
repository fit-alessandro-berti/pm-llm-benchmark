Certainly! The data you've presented reflects a process involving the submission, approval, and handling of declarations, likely representing an internal business procedure such as an expense report or payment request system. Here's a description of the process based on the given information:

1. **Initiation**: 
   - The process starts with a declaration being submitted by an employee. In some cases, a declaration can also be saved as a draft by the employee without being submitted immediately.

2. **Approval Workflow**:
   - After submission, the declaration goes through a series of approval stages:
     - It may first be approved or rejected by an intermediary like **Administration** or **Pre-Approver**.
     - If approved by Administration, it often proceeds to the **Budget Owner** for further approval, though not in all cases.
     - Final approval is usually required from a **Supervisor**.
   - A declaration might be directly approved by a Supervisor without previous approvals, suggesting some flexibility in the approval path.

3. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
   - If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it is typically returned to the employee, who may then resubmit it.
   - Rejection by Administration is common and can result in multiple resubmissions before eventual approval or final rejection.
   - Some paths indicate that after being rejected by any intermediary, such as the Pre-Approver or Supervisor, the declaration might follow an alternate path for resubmission.

4. **Final Handling**:
   - Once a declaration has received all necessary approvals (up to and including by the Supervisor), a request for payment is initiated.
   - The final stage is the handling of the payment itself, which completes the process.

5. **Performance & Frequency**:
   - The data includes performance metrics representing the time it takes to complete each process variant. Lower performance values suggest faster processing times, whereas higher values indicate delays and potential inefficiencies.
   - Frequency data indicates how common each process variant is. The most frequent path involves the submission, approval by administration, and final approval by the supervisor before handling payment.
   - Variants involving multiple rejections and resubmissions, although less frequent, tend to have higher performance times, indicating longer completion periods due to repeated iterations.

In summary, the process outlined is a typical iterative approval pipeline with certain variations in approval paths, potential for intermediate rejections, and multiple loops through the process stages before completion. Performance metrics suggest potential areas for process improvement, particularly in variants with high rejection and resubmission rates.
