To identify unfair differences in the treatment between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to look at both the frequency of certain outcomes and the execution times associated with those processes.

### Frequency Analysis

1. **Application Rejected:**
   - Protected Group: 960 (most frequent outcome)
   - Unprotected Group: 664
   The protected group has a significantly higher rate of applications being rejected compared to the unprotected group, suggesting potential bias against the protected group at the initial stages.

2. **Appointment Denied:**
   - Protected Group: 599
   - Unprotected Group: 363
   A similar trend can be observed where appointments are more frequently denied for members of the protected group compared to the unprotected group, indicating a possible early-stage bias against them.

### Execution Time Analysis

1. **Process Variants Leading to "Loan Denied":**
   - The average performance times for loan denials in both groups are comparable (around 330k-340k seconds), which suggests that the time taken for processing loan applications leading to denial is similar, regardless of group membership.

2. **Skipped Examination:**
   - Unprotected Group has a variant where the process includes "skipped_examination" directly leading to a sign loan agreement (frequency 332). There's no such variant in the protected group.
   
   This skipped examination step could imply that the unprotected group might be subject to less rigorous scrutiny, potentially indicating an unfair advantage.

### Key Differences

1. **Early Rejection:**
   The most striking difference is the higher frequency of early rejections and appointment denials for the protected group compared to the unprotected group, which suggests potential bias against the protected group at initial stages of the loan application process.

2. **Rigorous Scrutiny:**
   - The absence of a "skipped_examination" variant in the protected group indicates that members of this group might undergo more rigorous scrutiny than those from the unprotected group.
   
3. **Overall Process Variants:**
   - Protected Group tends to have more variants involving multiple "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" steps, which could indicate more thorough and potentially time-consuming assessments for members of the protected group.
   - This suggests that the process for the protected group might be designed in a way that imposes more obstacles or scrutiny compared to the unprotected group.

### Conclusion

The main differences highlight potential biases against the 'protected' group at various stages:
- Higher frequency of application rejections and appointment denials.
- More rigorous assessment processes, including multiple collateral assessments.
- Absence of any skipped examination variants indicating less leniency in scrutiny.

These findings suggest that there might be unfair treatment towards the protected group both in terms of early-stage rejections and more stringent processing requirements.
