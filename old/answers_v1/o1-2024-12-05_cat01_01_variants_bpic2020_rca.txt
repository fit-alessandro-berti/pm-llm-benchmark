Based on the provided data, the primary root causes of performance issues appear to be related to the complexity and rework loops within the actual workflow variants. Specifically:

1. **Repeated Rejections and Resubmissions:**  
   Many slow-performing variants involve multiple reject-resubmit cycles. For example, sequences like:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**  
   repeated several times before eventually reaching a final approval step.  
   These repeating rejection steps introduce significant delays because each loop adds extra waiting time, handling time, and administrative overhead.

2. **Involvement of Multiple Approval Layers in Certain Variants:**  
   Variants that move through multiple additional approval steps (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR) repeatedly—sometimes redoing these steps—tend to have longer overall performance times.  
   For instance:  
   - Variants with **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> then re-submission** and so forth.  
   Each additional check and subsequent rejection leads to waiting in queues, scheduling further reviews, and repetitive data handling.

3. **Long, Extended Paths with Multiple Conditional Approvals and Rejections:**  
   The most time-consuming variants frequently include multiple conditional branching points (approval followed by another level’s rejection, then going back to the employee), creating extended process paths.  
   These long “detours” through several “Approve” -> “Reject” -> “Resubmit” cycles add complexity and lengthy lead times before reaching a final "Request Payment -> Payment Handled" step.

4. **“MISSING” Approver Steps and Unresolved Exceptions:**  
   Variants that list “Declaration REJECTED by MISSING” suggest a break in the normal approval chain, possibly causing additional delays due to unclear responsibility or waiting for manual intervention.  
   Such exceptions likely introduce waiting periods while the process tries to resolve the missing actor step before continuing.

In summary, the performance bottlenecks are predominantly found in process instances that undergo multiple iterative loops of rejection and resubmission, involve numerous approval layers and back-and-forth handoffs, and contain exceptional steps (like missing approvers) that interrupt the normal workflow.
