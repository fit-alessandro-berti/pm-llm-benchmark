Creating a DECLARE model for the given process variants is a complex task, especially without knowing the context or specific goals of the model. However, based on the general structure of the process variants, here is a simplified example of a DECLARE model for the provided process. Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all the aspects of your process.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'Create Fine': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'Send Fine': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'Insert Fine Notification': 1.0},
        'Add penalty': {'Add penalty': 1.0},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {'Send for Credit Collection': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'Payment': 1.0},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {'Send Appeal to Prefecture': 1.0},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': 1.0},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': 1.0},
        'Appeal to Judge': {'Appeal to Judge': 1.0},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': 1.0},
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {},
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': 1.0,
        'Send Fine': 1.0,
        'Insert Fine Notification': 1.0,
        'Add penalty': 1.0,
        'Send for Credit Collection': 1.0,
        'Payment': 1.0,
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': 1.0,
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': 1.0,
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': 1.0,
        'Appeal to Judge': 1.0,
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': 1.0,
    },
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {},
    'precedence': {},
    'succession': {},
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {},
}
```

This model assumes that every activity can be executed once (existence), that no activity can be skipped (absence), that every activity can start the process (init), and that every activity can follow any other activity (succession).
