Below is an example of a DECLARE model in pm4py for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
# Define the activities in the process
activities = ['Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods', 'Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice', 'Receive Payment']

# Define the DECLARE model as a Python dictionary
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Pay Invoice', 'Receive Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Pay Invoice', 'Send Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Payment', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```
This model defines the following constraints:

*   The activities `Create Purchase Order`, `Send Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Send Invoice`, `Pay Invoice`, and `Receive Payment` must occur at least once (`existence` constraint).
*   The trace must start with the activity `Create Purchase Order` (`init` constraint).
*   If `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must occur in the future (`response` constraint).
*   If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Create Purchase Order` must have occurred in the past (`precedence` constraint).
*   If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must occur in the future (`response` constraint).
*   If `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must have occurred in the past (`precedence` constraint).
*   If `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Send Invoice` must occur in the future (`response` constraint).
*   If `Send Invoice` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must have occurred in the past (`precedence` constraint).
*   If `Send Invoice` occurs, then `Pay Invoice` must occur in the future (`response` constraint).
*   If `Pay Invoice` occurs, then `Send Invoice` must have occurred in the past (`precedence` constraint).
*   If `Pay Invoice` occurs, then `Receive Payment` must occur in the future (`response` constraint).
*   If `Receive Payment` occurs, then `Pay Invoice` must have occurred in the past (`precedence` constraint).
*   The activities `Create Purchase Order`, `Send Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Send Invoice` and `Pay Invoice` cannot occur simultaneously (`noncoexistence` constraint).

Please note that this is a hypothetical example, and the actual constraints and activities may vary depending on the specific requirements of your Purchase-to-Pay process.
