To analyze the potential root causes for performance issues specific to the process described, we can delve into the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some observations that might identify root causes of performance inefficiencies:

1. **Repeated Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions tend to have higher performance times. For example, the variants with declarations rejected by the administration multiple times before being ultimately approved and handled (e.g., frequency = 36 with performance = 2542497.917) are among the slowest.
   - Longer performance times often occur in variants where there are repeated cycles of rejection by different authorities followed by resubmission by the employee.

2. **Role and Step Complexity:**
   - Variants that require approval from multiple roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) before final handling are slower. For instance, involving the BUDGET OWNER appears to increase the time (e.g., frequency = 2473 with performance = 1084338.407).
   - Processes that necessitate multiple role approvals before final approval by a supervisor have a longer lead time, which could be due to the logistical complexity or coordination required between different departments.

3. **Specific Role Impact:**
   - Processes involving initial rejections by roles such as ADMINISTRATION, followed by subsequent steps, tend to have significantly higher performance metrics. For instance, the rejection by ADMINISTRATION followed by approval takes notably longer time to resolve.
   - Roles like PRE_APPROVER and SUPERVISOR can contribute to inefficiencies when initial rejections lead to resubmissions and further rejections, exemplified by cycle times that extend due to additional loops through these roles.

4. **Unexpected Steps:**
   - Certain variants involve an unusual step such as 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', causing extensive delays (e.g., a variant with performance = 1947246.400). These anomalies suggest possible data errors or uncommon workflow paths that extend process time.

5. **High Performance Delays on Low Frequency Steps:**
   - Some infrequent variants, such as those involving multiple rejections and resubmissions (frequency = 5, 6 but with very high performance times), suggest that while less common, these paths are notably inefficient once they occur.

6. **Single Major Bottleneck:**
   - There may be a specific bottleneck step like 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION,' showing extremely high time on certain low-frequency paths (e.g., performance = 13805869.200), possibly due to escalations or resource shortages specific to that step.

Understanding these observations, the performance issues in this process are likely related to the complexity introduced by repeated rejections, the number of different roles that must approve the declarations, and the inefficiencies in certain low-frequency non-standard processing paths. Addressing these specific concerns could lead to performance improvements in the process.
