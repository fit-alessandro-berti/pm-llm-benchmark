The provided data describes a complex workflow related to processing declarations, most likely in an organizational or financial context. The process involves multiple stages and actors such as EMPLOYEEs, ADMINISTRATION (or PRE_APPROVER), BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, and finally, the handling of payments. Below is a high-level description of how this process operates:

1. **Submission by Employee:** Every declaration begins when an employee submits it.

2. **Initial Review Stages:**
   - The declaration can be initially reviewed/approved by either the ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER.
   - If rejected at these stages, there's a loop where the EMPLOYEE can reject and then resubmit the declaration until it is approved.
   
3. **Approval and Budget Owner Steps:**
   - After initial approval (by ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER), some declarations might need additional approval from the BUDGET OWNER.
   - If rejected by the BUDGET OWNER, similar to previous stages, there's a loop where the EMPLOYEE can reject and resubmit until it gets approved.

4. **Final Approval:**
   - Once all necessary approvals are obtained (including ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER if applicable, and BUDGET OWNER), the declaration is finally reviewed/approved by the SUPERVISOR.
   - If rejected at this stage or any other intermediate step involving the SUPERVISOR, thereâ€™s a loop where it can be resubmitted until approval is granted.

5. **Payment Request:**
   - After final approval, a request for payment is made and handled.

6. **Special Cases:**
   - There are cases (indicated as "REJECTED by MISSING") that suggest missing approvals or errors in the workflow which can lead to further resubmissions.
   - Some declarations might reach an end without being fully processed (e.g., when they get saved but not submitted, or rejected at certain stages).

### Key Observations:
- **Frequency and Performance:** The data also includes frequency and performance metrics for each path. Frequency indicates how often a specific workflow occurs, while performance could refer to the time taken in completing the process or some other form of efficiency metric.
  
- **Complexity:** Certain paths are quite complex with multiple rejections and resubmissions, indicating that getting through all stages successfully can be challenging.

### Process Optimization:
Given the data, optimizing this process might involve:
- Streamlining initial approval processes to reduce the number of rejections.
- Identifying bottlenecks (e.g., high performance values on certain paths) and addressing them.
- Reducing loops where possible by providing feedback at each rejection stage to avoid repeated submissions without changes.

This detailed workflow suggests that improving communication between stages, especially at points where declarations are rejected, could significantly enhance overall efficiency.
