Okay, let's break down this process based on the provided event data. It appears to be a declaration or request process, likely financial or expense-related, with multiple approval steps and potential rejection loops. Here's a description focusing on the typical flow and then highlighting variations and issues:

**Core Process (Ideal Path):**

1.  **Declaration Submission:**
    *   The process begins with an `EMPLOYEE` submitting a `Declaration SUBMITTED`.

2.  **Sequential Approvals:**
    *   The declaration typically moves through a series of approval steps:
        *   First, it might go to a `PRE_APPROVER` for `Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`. (though less frequent)
        *   Then, it's commonly approved by an `ADMINISTRATION` official: `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`.
        *   It can go to the `BUDGET OWNER`: `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` (less frequent).
        *  Finally, a `SUPERVISOR` gives the final approval: `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`.

3.  **Payment Request and Handling:**
    *   Once a declaration is `FINAL_APPROVED`, a `Request Payment` is initiated.
    *   The final step is the `Payment Handled`.

**Variations and Loops (Reject/Rework Paths):**

*   **Rejections:** Declarations can be rejected at almost any approval stage, leading to rework loops:
    *   `EMPLOYEE` can reject their own submitted Declaration.
    *   `ADMINISTRATION` can reject: `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`
    *   `PRE_APPROVER` can reject: `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`.
    *   `BUDGET OWNER` can reject: `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`.
    *   `SUPERVISOR` can reject: `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`.
    *   `MISSING` can reject. (This "missing" user likely indicates a problem with the submission or the required data.)

*   **Rework Loops:**
    *   Rejected declarations often loop back to the `EMPLOYEE` for correction or resubmission:
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` (self rejections)
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`
    *   Rejected submissions can also loop back to the beginning `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`.
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *   `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *    `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *    `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
        *    `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`
*   **Bypasses & Shortcuts:**
    *   A direct path exists for `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` however, this is not the typical route and it is less frequent.
   *     `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` can be directly rejected by most approvers bypassing the approvals (however, this is infrequent).
    *    There are some unusual path such as:
        *    `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment` (very rare occurrence).
        *    `Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` (This might be a payment reversal or error that triggers a rejection, also rare).
*  **"FOR_APPROVAL" States:**
    *  There are  very infrequent instances of `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL` states prior to an official approval step. These could indicate instances of a declaration waiting to be actioned.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Frequent Approval Bottleneck:** The paths `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and the subsequent `Request Payment -> Payment Handled` have the highest frequencies and therefore could be considered bottlenecks of the process. This indicates a critical path.
*   **Rejection Loops are a Significant Part of the Process:** A substantial amount of process flow is devoted to rejecting and resubmitting declarations, indicating inefficiencies and the possibility for errors in the initial declaration submissions.
*   **"Missing" Rejections:**  The presence of `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` suggests there might be data integrity issues, or the process may need better error handling at the initial stage.
*   **Performance Time Variability:** The performance times are all over the board with some lasting less than a second to almost a year.
*   **Rare edge cases:** Some extremely rare edge cases and paths that could be investigated.

**In summary, the process is a multi-stage declaration/request system involving multiple approvers. The core process is well established, however, there are a lot of loops, rejections, and edge cases that seem to slow the process down.**

**Potential Questions for Further Investigation:**

*   Why are there so many rejections? Are there specific reasons or common errors?
*   What causes `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` and how can we minimize it?
*   Why does the direct path for `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` rarely occur and when does it?
*   Can we optimize the approval sequence to reduce bottlenecks and shorten the overall process time?
*   Why are there so many rejections by supervisors after approval by the pre approvers, administration, and budget owner?

By investigating these questions, the organization can improve the process and reduce waste and errors.
