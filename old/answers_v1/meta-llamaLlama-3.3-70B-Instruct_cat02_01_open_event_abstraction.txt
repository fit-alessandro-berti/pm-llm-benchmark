Event abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex process models by grouping related events together, reducing the number of distinct events and making the model more abstract and easier to understand. To effectively utilize event abstraction to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs, consider the following strategies:

1. **Identify key event patterns**: Analyze the event log data to identify recurring patterns or sequences of events. These patterns can be used to define abstract events that represent a group of related events.
2. **Group events by business meaning**: Group events that have similar business meanings or outcomes. For example, events related to customer registration, order processing, or payment processing can be grouped together.
3. **Use hierarchical abstraction**: Apply hierarchical abstraction by creating a layered structure of abstract events. Each layer can represent a different level of abstraction, with higher layers representing more general concepts and lower layers representing more specific events.
4. **Use clustering techniques**: Apply clustering techniques, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to group similar events together based on their attributes, such as timestamp, user, or activity.
5. **Automate event abstraction**: Utilize automated techniques, such as data mining or machine learning algorithms, to discover patterns and relationships in the event log data and apply event abstraction.
6. **Visualize abstracted models**: Use visualization techniques, such as process maps or heat maps, to represent the abstracted process model. This can help to identify areas of the process that require attention or optimization.
7. **Validate abstracted models**: Validate the abstracted process model by comparing it to the original event log data and ensuring that it accurately represents the underlying business processes.
8. **Use event abstraction in conjunction with other process mining techniques**: Combine event abstraction with other process mining techniques, such as filtering, splitting, or merging, to further simplify and improve the readability of complex process models.
9. **Consider the level of abstraction**: Balance the level of abstraction to avoid losing important details while still achieving a manageable and readable process model.
10. **Iterate and refine**: Iterate through the abstraction process, refining the abstracted model as needed, to ensure that it accurately represents the underlying business processes and meets the needs of stakeholders.

Benefits of event abstraction include:

* **Improved readability**: Simplified process models that are easier to understand and analyze.
* **Increased manageability**: Reduced complexity of process models, making them more manageable and maintainable.
* **Enhanced analysis**: Ability to focus on high-level business processes and identify areas for improvement.
* **Better decision-making**: More accurate and informed decision-making based on simplified and abstracted process models.

To illustrate the concept of event abstraction, consider a simple example:

Suppose we have an event log containing the following events:

* "Customer login"
* "Customer search for product"
* "Customer add product to cart"
* "Customer checkout"
* "Payment processing"
* "Order shipping"

Using event abstraction, we can group these events into abstract events, such as:

* "Customer interaction" (covering "Customer login", "Customer search for product", and "Customer add product to cart")
* "Order processing" (covering "Customer checkout" and "Payment processing")
* "Order fulfillment" (covering "Order shipping")

The abstracted process model would then show the high-level business processes, such as "Customer interaction", "Order processing", and "Order fulfillment", rather than the individual detailed events. This simplification can make the process model more readable and manageable, while still capturing the essential business processes.
