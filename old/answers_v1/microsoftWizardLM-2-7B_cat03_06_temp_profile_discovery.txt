To generate a temporal profile for the given process variants, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation for each couple of activities based on the times they occur in the process variants. Let's calculate these values for some notable couples of activities:

- Create Fine -> Send Fine
- Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification
- Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty
- Add penalty -> Payment
- Payment -> Send for Credit Collection

First, we'll collect all the inter-activity times for each couple and then calculate the average and standard deviation.

For example, for the couple "Create Fine -> Send Fine", we'll extract all the times `A -> B` from the process variants and calculate the average and standard deviation from these times.

Let's do this for all notable couples of activities:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import statistics

# Define the activity couples of interest
activity_pairs = [
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'),
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'),
    ('Add penalty', 'Payment'),
    ('Payment', 'Send for Credit Collection')
]

# Process variants data
process_variants = {
    'Create Fine -> Send Fine': [],
    'Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification': [],
    'Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty': [],
    'Add penalty -> Payment': [],
    'Payment -> Send for Credit Collection': []
}

# Populate the process variants with times
for variant in process_variants_data:
    for pair in activity_pairs:
        if pair[0] in variant and pair[1] in variant:
            process_variants[pair].append(variant[pair[1]] - variant[pair[0]])

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each activity pair
temporal_profile = {}
for pair in activity_pairs:
    times = process_variants[pair]
    average = statistics.mean(times)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(times)
    temporal_profile[pair] = (average, std_dev)

print(temporal_profile)
```

Given the process variants data you provided, let's calculate the temporal profile for the activity pairs mentioned above. Note that the actual values would be calculated by running the above Python code with the provided process variants data.

Here's an example of what the temporal profile might look like after running the code:

```python
{
    'Create Fine -> Send Fine': (average_time_create_fine_to_send_fine, std_dev_create_fine_to_send_fine),
    'Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification': (average_time_send_fine_to_insert_fine_notification, std_dev_send_fine_to_insert_fine_notification),
    'Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty': (average_time_insert_fine_notification_to_add_penalty, std_dev_insert_fine_notification_to_add_penalty),
    'Add penalty -> Payment': (average_time_add_penalty_to_payment, std_dev_add_penalty_to_payment),
    'Payment -> Send for Credit Collection': (average_time_payment_to_send_for_credit_collection, std_dev_payment_to_send_for_credit_collection)
}
```

The actual values for the average and standard deviation would be computed by the Python code snippet provided earlier. Keep in mind that the standard deviation close to zero would indicate high consistency in the process time, while a higher value would indicate variability.
