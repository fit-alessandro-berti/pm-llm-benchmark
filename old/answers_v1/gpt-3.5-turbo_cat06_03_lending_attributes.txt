In the context of process mining, fairness can be evaluated based on attributes related to case characteristics, such as "case:citizen" (True or False), "case:gender" (True or False), and "case:german speaking" (True or False). These attributes can be considered sensitive for fairness as they pertain to potentially discriminatory factors that could impact the outcomes of the process.

Additionally, attributes related to resources, such as "resource" (e.g., Loan Officer 1, 2, 3, etc.), can also be sensitive for fairness if certain resource allocations or decisions are influenced by factors such as gender, race, or other protected characteristics.

Other attributes like "start_timestamp," "time," and "time:timestamp" are not typically considered sensitive for fairness in process mining analysis as they are related to time variables and do not have direct implications for discrimination or bias. These attributes are more related to the temporal aspects of the process data and do not inherently involve considerations of fairness.
