# Now you have a ProcessTree object representing the Purchase-to-Pay process

```

This code defines the process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the pm4py library. The process tree is constructed hierarchically, with each branch representing a different stage in the process.

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary classes:**
   - `ProcessTree`: Represents a node in the process tree.
   - `Operator`: Defines the type of operator (sequence, XOR, parallel, loop) connecting the process trees.

2. **Define the root process tree:**
   - Create a `ProcessTree` object with `operator=Operator.PARALLEL` to indicate that the branches are executed in parallel.

3. **Define the branches:**
   - Create `ProcessTree` objects for each stage of the process (Supplier Selection, Purchase Order Creation, Goods Receipt, Invoice Processing).
   - Define the sequence of activities within each branch using `ProcessTree` objects and `Operator.SEQUENCE`.
   - Set the `parent` attribute of each child `ProcessTree` to its corresponding parent branch.

4. **Connect the branches to the root:**
   - Append each branch `ProcessTree` object as a child of the root `ProcessTree`.
