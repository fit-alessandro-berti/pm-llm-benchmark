Based on the attributes provided, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual, which is a protected characteristic that can be used to discriminate against certain groups. Fairness metrics can be applied to ensure that the process does not unfairly favor or disfavor individuals based on their gender.
2. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates the citizenship status of the individual, which can also be a protected characteristic. Fairness metrics can be applied to ensure that the process does not unfairly favor or disfavor individuals based on their citizenship status.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates the language proficiency of the individual, which can be a proxy for their ethnicity or national origin. While language proficiency may be a relevant factor in certain contexts, it can also be used to discriminate against individuals who are not proficient in the dominant language. Fairness metrics can be applied to ensure that the process does not unfairly favor or disfavor individuals based on their language proficiency.

The other attributes, such as **concept:name**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp**, do not appear to be sensitive for fairness, as they relate to the process itself rather than individual characteristics.

However, it's worth noting that the **resource** attribute may be related to fairness if certain resources (e.g., loan officers) are biased in their decision-making. In this case, fairness metrics can be applied to ensure that the process is fair across different resources.

To determine which attributes are sensitive for fairness, it's essential to consider the specific context and the potential for discrimination or unequal treatment based on those attributes. A thorough analysis of the data and the process is necessary to identify potential fairness issues and develop strategies to mitigate them.
