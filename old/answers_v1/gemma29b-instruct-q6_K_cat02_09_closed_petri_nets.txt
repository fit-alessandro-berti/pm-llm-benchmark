Here are some opposite, and more general concepts related to the Petri net terms you provided:

**Concept** | **Opposite Concept** | **More General Concept**
--- | --- | ---
Source Place | **Sink Place** | **Place**
Immediate Transition | **Delayed Transition** | **Transition**
Live Transition | **Dead Transition** | **Transition System** 
Bounded Net | **Unbounded Net** | **Net**
Free Choice Net | **Non-Free Choice Net** | **Net Structure**

**Explanations:**

* **Source Place:**  A place that has an incoming arc but no outgoing arcs.  Its opposite, a **Sink Place**,  has outgoing arcs but no incoming arcs. Both are special types of **Places**, which are fundamental components of Petri nets representing storage locations.

* **Immediate Transition:** A transition that fires as soon as its input place(s) are marked.  **Delayed Transitions** require more specific conditions to fire, possibly involving time delays or other factors. Both are subtypes of **Transitions**, which represent actions or events that occur in the system.

* **Live Transition:** A transition that can fire infinitely often given suitable input.  A **Dead Transition** can never fire. Both are properties of **Transitions** within a Petri net model. The broader concept is **Transition Systems**, which encompass a wider range of models where transitions change the state of a system.

* **Bounded Net:** A Petri net where each place has a finite capacity.  **Unbounded Nets** have no capacity restrictions on their places. Both are types of **Nets**, the fundamental building blocks of Petri nets.

* **Free Choice Net:** A Petri net where for each transition, there is at most one place from which it can be enabled.  **Non-Free Choice Nets** have more complex enabling conditions for transitions. Both are types of **Net Structures**, which define the arrangement and relationships between places and transitions.
