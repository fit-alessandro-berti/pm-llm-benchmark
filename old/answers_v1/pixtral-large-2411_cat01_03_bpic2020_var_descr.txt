The data provided describes a process for handling declarations, likely related to some form of expense reimbursement, approval, or similar administrative workflow. Here's a breakdown of the underlying process based on the variants:

### Process Steps:

1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration.
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE:** In some cases, the employee may save the declaration without submitting it.

2. **Initial Approval/Rejection:**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION:** The declaration is reviewed and approved by the administration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION:** The declaration is reviewed and rejected by the administration.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER:** The declaration is reviewed and approved by a pre-approver.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER:** The declaration is reviewed and rejected by a pre-approver.

3. **Budget Owner Approval (if applicable):**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER:** The declaration is reviewed and approved by the budget owner.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER:** The declaration is reviewed and rejected by the budget owner.

4. **Final Approval:**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:** The declaration is reviewed and finally approved by a supervisor.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR:** The declaration is reviewed and rejected by a supervisor.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING:** The declaration is rejected due to missing information or documents.

5. **Rejection Handling:**
   - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE:** The employee acknowledges the rejection.
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (after rejection):** The employee resubmits the declaration after addressing the rejection.

6. **Payment Request and Handling:**
   - **Request Payment:** A request for payment is initiated.
   - **Payment Handled:** The payment is processed and handled.

### Process Variants and Frequencies:

- **Most Common Paths:**
  - The most frequent path is: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 4618).
  - Another common path includes an additional approval step by the budget owner: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 2473).

- **Less Common Paths:**
  - Paths involving rejections and resubmissions are less frequent but still notable. For example: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (frequency = 345).

- **Rare Paths:**
  - Some paths are very rare, such as those involving multiple rejections and resubmissions, or paths where the declaration is saved but not submitted.

### Performance Metrics:

- **Performance** likely refers to the time taken for each process variant to complete, measured in some unit (possibly seconds or milliseconds).
- The performance varies significantly across different paths, with simpler paths generally having better performance (lower values) compared to more complex paths involving rejections and resubmissions.

### Summary:

The process involves multiple stages of approval and potential rejections, with the most straightforward paths being the most frequent. Rejections can occur at various stages, leading to resubmissions and additional review steps. The performance of the process varies based on the complexity and number of steps involved.
