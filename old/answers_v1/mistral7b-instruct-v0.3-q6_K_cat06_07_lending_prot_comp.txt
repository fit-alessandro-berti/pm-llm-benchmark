 From the data provided, it appears that there are several significant differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups in this credit application process:

1. **Number of process variants**: The unprotected group has fewer process variants compared to the protected group. This suggests that the process for the unprotected group may be simpler or less complex, possibly due to fewer checks and balances in place to protect them from potential discrimination or misuse.

2. **Loan Denial Rates**: The loan denial rates are generally higher for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. For instance, the majority of process variants for the protected group result in loan denials (e.g., 960 out of 1358 cases), while for the unprotected group, around half of the process variants result in loan denials (e.g., 2709 out of 6428 cases).

3. **Loan Approval Rates**: Conversely, the loan approval rates are lower for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. There are fewer instances where loans are approved for the protected group, such as only 31 cases of "Submission to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement" out of 1358 cases.

4. **Additional steps**: The protected group's process variants involve more steps than the unprotected group's, such as additional visits for collateral assessment and co-signer requests, which may add unnecessary complexity or delays to the application process for protected individuals.

5. **Performance**: While both groups have similar average performance times for their process variants, it is worth noting that some of the protected group's variants take significantly longer than their unprotected counterparts (e.g., "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" has a performance time of 489,840 compared to "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" with a performance time of 340,005.309 for the unprotected group).

These differences suggest that there may be biases or unfair treatment in the credit application process between the protected and unprotected groups. It is essential to investigate these discrepancies further and take steps to address any identified issues to ensure equal opportunities and fairness for all applicants.
