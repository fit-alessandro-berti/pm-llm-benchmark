Observing the process variants, the following anomalies can be identified:

1. Irregular Process Flows: Some process variants are seen to occur irregularly. For instance, the variant "Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine" is not a usual process flow. Ideally, "Create Fine" should be followed by "Send Fine" and then payments.

2. Inconsistent Sequence: In some process sequences, "Payment" event occurs twice consecutively, which is unusual, like for example: "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment".

3. Low Frequency: Certain process variants are occurring in very low frequency (less than 1000 times) compared to other variants, which might indicate outliers or exceptional cases. For instance, the process "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Appeal to Judge".

4. High Performance Variation: Variations in performance among different process variants appear inconsistent. Some process flows with similar lengths or complexities display significantly different performance scores. For instance, the variant "Create Fine -> Payment " has a performance of 889688.400 while a much longer variant like "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment" has a performance score of 27487271.949.

5. Duplication in Processes: Some processes seem to be repeated after another process intervenes, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine" or "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment". This implies that some fines are being sent or paid more than once which might be anomalous or might indicate a different type of process variation.

Note: The specific anomalies depend heavily on the specific scenario and business rules, thus further inspection may be needed.
