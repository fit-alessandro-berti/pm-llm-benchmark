This Log Skeleton model represents the constraints between the activities in the given process. The `equivalence` key contains the pairs of activities that are considered equivalent, meaning that if one occurs, the other must also occur the same number of times. The `always_before` key contains the pairs of activities where the first activity must occur before the second activity. The `always_after` key contains the pairs of activities where the first activity must occur after the second activity. The `never_together` key contains the pairs of activities that cannot occur together in the same trace. The `activ_freq` key contains the allowed number of occurrences for each activity. The `directly_follows` key contains the pairs of activities where the first activity must be immediately followed by the second activity.
