Event abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex process models derived from event logs by aggregating low-level events into higher-level abstract events. This concept can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models in the following ways:

1. **Reducing model complexity**: By abstracting low-level events into higher-level events, the number of nodes and arcs in the process model can be significantly reduced, making it easier to comprehend and analyze.
2. **Improving model interpretability**: Abstract events can be defined in terms of business-relevant concepts, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the process model and its underlying behavior.
3. **Enhancing model generalizability**: Abstract events can be designed to capture common patterns and behaviors across multiple process instances, enabling the creation of more generalizable process models.
4. **Facilitating model comparison**: Abstract events can serve as a common language for comparing process models across different domains, organizations, or time periods.
5. **Enabling hierarchical analysis**: Event abstraction allows for the creation of hierarchical process models, where abstract events can be decomposed into lower-level events, facilitating analysis at different levels of granularity.
6. **Supporting root cause analysis**: By abstracting events, it becomes easier to identify and analyze the root causes of process deviations, errors, or inefficiencies.
7. **Improving model scalability**: As event logs grow in size and complexity, event abstraction can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it more manageable and scalable for analysis.

To effectively utilize event abstraction, consider the following best practices:

1. **Domain knowledge**: Use domain expertise to identify meaningful abstract events that capture business-relevant concepts and behaviors.
2. **Event clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to group similar low-level events into abstract events.
3. **Abstraction hierarchies**: Establish a clear hierarchy of abstract events to facilitate analysis at different levels of granularity.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure consistency in the definition and application of abstract events across the process model.
5. **Iterative refinement**: Refine the abstraction scheme iteratively, based on feedback from stakeholders and analysis results.
6. **Balancing granularity**: Balance the level of abstraction with the need for detail, to avoid over- or under-abstraction.
7. **Documentation**: Document the abstraction scheme and its rationale to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

By applying these best practices, event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs.
