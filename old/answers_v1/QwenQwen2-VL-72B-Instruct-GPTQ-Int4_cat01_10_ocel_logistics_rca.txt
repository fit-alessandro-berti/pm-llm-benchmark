Based on the directly follows graph, some potential root causes for performance issues in the process could be:

  1. Delays between "pay order" and "package delivered" for customers: The duration between these two events is 120345.93, which is relatively long compared to other durations in the graph. This delay could be due to issues with the payment processing or shipping process.
  2. Delays between "reorder item" and "pick item": The duration between these two events is 564359.01, which is significantly longer than other durations in the graph. This delay could be due to issues with the inventory management system or the process for ordering new items.
  3. Delays between "send package" and "package delivered": The duration between these two events is 41297.65, which is relatively long compared to other durations in the graph. This delay could be due to issues with the shipping process or delivery service.
  4. High frequency of "item out of stock": The frequency of events related to "item out of stock" and "reorder item" is relatively high (1078 and 895, respectively), which suggests that there may be issues with inventory management or forecasting demand.

Overall, it appears that there may be issues with the inventory management and shipping processes, which could be causing delays and leading to performance issues in the process.
