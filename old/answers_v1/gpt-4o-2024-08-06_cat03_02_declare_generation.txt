Certainly! Below is a simple example of a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using the structure you provided. This is just one of many possible configurations for such a process.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': (1.0, 0.9),
        'Receive Goods': (1.0, 0.8),
        'Make Payment': (1.0, 0.85),
    },
    'absence': {
        # If there are any activities that should not occur, they would be listed here
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Approve Purchase Order': (1.0, 0.95),
    },
    'init': {
        'Receive Purchase Requisition': (1.0, 1.0),
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Create Purchase Order'): (1.0, 0.7),
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment'): (1.0, 0.9),
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): (1.0, 0.85),
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment'): (1.0, 0.95),
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): (1.0, 0.8),
    },
    'altresponse': {
        # Alternating response rules
    },
    'altprecedence': {
        # Alternating precedence rules
    },
    'altsuccession': {
        # Alternating succession rules
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Make Payment', 'Close Purchase Order'): (1.0, 0.9),
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): (1.0, 0.6),
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Create Purchase Order'): (1.0, 0.7),
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        # Activities that should not coexist
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Cancel Order', 'Receive Goods'): (1.0, 1.0),
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        # Rules about what should not directly follow
    }
}

# Output the declare model
print(declare_model)
```

### Explanation
- **Existence**: Specifies activities like 'Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods', and 'Make Payment' that are expected to occur with a certain confidence.
- **Exactly One**: The approval of a purchase order happens exactly once.
- **Init**: The process starts with 'Receive Purchase Requisition'.
- **Responded Existence**: If 'Approve Purchase Order' occurs, 'Create Purchase Order' must also occur.
- **Coexistence**: 'Receive Invoice' must occur if 'Make Payment' occurs and vice versa.
- **Response**: After creating a purchase order, goods are expected to be received.
- **Precedence**: An invoice must be received before making a payment.
- **Succession**: After receiving goods, it is expected that the invoice will be received.
- **Chain Response**: After making a payment, the purchase order is directly closed.
- **Chain Precedence**: Goods receiving directly follows an invoice reception.
- **Non Succession**: Goods should not be received after an order is canceled. 

Please remember that the values assigned to support and confidence are arbitrary examples and should be adjusted to fit the data derived from an actual purchase-to-pay process.
