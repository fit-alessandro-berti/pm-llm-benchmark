Based on the provided process variants, I will identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group.

1. **Frequency of Loan Denials**: In the protected group, the frequency of loan denials is relatively high, with 13 out of 24 process variants resulting in a loan denial. In contrast, the unprotected group has a lower frequency of loan denials, with 7 out of 25 process variants resulting in a loan denial.
2. **Application Rejection**: The protected group has a higher frequency of application rejections (960) compared to the unprotected group (664). This suggests that the protected group is more likely to have their applications rejected at an early stage.
3. **Request for Co-Signer**: The protected group is more likely to be asked to provide a co-signer (11 out of 24 process variants) compared to the unprotected group (6 out of 25 process variants).
4. **Assessment of Collateral**: The protected group is more likely to have their collateral assessed multiple times (8 out of 24 process variants) compared to the unprotected group (4 out of 25 process variants).
5. **Performance (Execution Time)**: The unprotected group has a relatively consistent execution time for most process variants, whereas the protected group has a wider range of execution times, with some process variants taking significantly longer to complete.
6. **Skipped Examination**: The unprotected group has a process variant where the examination is skipped (frequency = 332), which is not present in the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to have a streamlined process.
7. **Outcome of Loan Application**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan approvals (1656) compared to the protected group (39). This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to have their loan applications approved.

Using domain knowledge, these differences could indicate:

1. **Discrimination**: The protected group may be facing discrimination, as they are more likely to have their applications rejected, be asked to provide a co-signer, and have their collateral assessed multiple times.
2. **Inconsistent Application of Policies**: The differences in execution times and the presence of a skipped examination process variant in the unprotected group may indicate inconsistent application of policies or procedures.
3. **Lack of Transparency**: The protected group may not have clear understanding of the loan application process, as they are more likely to experience multiple assessments and requests for co-signers.

These findings should be further investigated to determine the root causes and potential biases in the loan application process.
