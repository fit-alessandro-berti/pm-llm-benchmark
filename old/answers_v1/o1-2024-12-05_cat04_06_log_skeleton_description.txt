The constraints you have provided originate from a discovered Log Skeleton process model, which is a type of declarative process model extracted from an event log. In essence, these constraints represent the underlying rules and patterns that were inferred from real process executions (cases). By examining these constraints, we can piece together a high-level narrative of the process they describe. Although the process is complex and involves numerous roles and approval/rejection steps, the main idea seems to center around the life cycle of a "Declaration" object, which goes through multiple states and multiple actors before reaching a final outcome.

**Key Themes and Entities:**

1. **Declaration as the Core Object:**  
   All activities revolve around handling a "Declaration." This declaration likely starts in a draft form ("SAVED by EMPLOYEE"), then is submitted ("SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"), and subsequently flows through a series of approval steps by different organizational roles. We see roles like:
   - **EMPLOYEE** (who can save and submit the declaration),
   - **PRE_APPROVER** (perhaps an initial gatekeeper),
   - **SUPERVISOR** (another gate or manager level),
   - **ADMINISTRATION** (central administrative authority),
   - **BUDGET OWNER** (someone controlling or approving funds),
   - **MISSING** (possibly a placeholder for missing data or an unknown actor).

   These actors either move the declaration forward (e.g., "FOR_APPROVAL") or take deciding actions on it (e.g., "APPROVED," "REJECTED," "FINAL_APPROVED").

2. **Sequential Flow with Multiple Approval Layers:**  
   The constraints suggest a sequence in which the declaration moves through various stages of approval. For instance:
   - "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" seems to be an early step, but it is constrained by and often co-occurs with certain "FOR_APPROVAL" steps.  
   - "FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER" and "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" appear multiple times and are closely intertwined with other approval or rejection events. They are subject to both "Always Before" and "Always After" constraints in relation to other events, indicating they act as transitional checkpoints.
   - The presence of multiple "FOR_APPROVAL" activities (by PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, and ADMINISTRATION) strongly suggests a hierarchical review process. Each role may serve as a gatekeeper, where their approval leads to the next stage and their rejection terminates or redirects the process.

3. **Approvals, Rejections, and Final Outcomes:**
   There are several approval and rejection activities:
   - **APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**, **APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**, **APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**, and even a **FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** indicate a multi-step endorsement flow.  
   - Rejections are just as multifaceted: **REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**, **REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**, **REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**, **REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**, **REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**, **REJECTED by MISSING**, etc.  
   This complexity suggests that at each stage multiple stakeholders can reject the declaration, possibly resulting in rework, termination, or redirection of the process.

4. **Conditional Co-existence and Equivalences:**
   - **Equivalence constraints** (e.g., if one approval occurs, then some other approval or a related event also occurs the same number of times) hint at locked-in patterns, such as: if a declaration gets a certain approval, it also always (or never) goes through a related event.  
   - **Never Together** constraints show that certain pairs of activities never happen in the same case. This implies exclusive pathways: for example, if the declaration moves through a certain approval path, it never includes certain rejections or it never returns to certain earlier states. This likely reflects mutually exclusive scenarios based on the decision points in the process.

5. **Precedence and Ordering Rules:**
   - **Always Before** and **Always After** constraints set clear sequencing rules. For instance, a declaration might always need to be "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" before it can be "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR," or a certain rejection type always follows an attempt at approval. This imposes a top-down structure: certain steps must come first, others can only happen after prior conditions are met.
   
   - **Directly-Follows constraints** (like “(Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING)”) indicate immediate sequencing in the event log. This means as soon as a declaration is placed "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR," it might be immediately followed by a "REJECTED by MISSING" event in some process variants, suggesting a rapid decision at that stage.

6. **Activity Occurrence Bounds:**
   The Activity Occurrences constraints provide information on how many times certain events can happen within a single case. For example, "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR: 0, 1" means that in any given case, this activity either occurs not at all or only once. Meanwhile, some activities (like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE") can occur multiple times (0 to 7), suggesting iterative loops of resubmission and re-approval attempts.

7. **Involvement of Payment Handling:**
   The mention of "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" indicates that once the declaration passes through certain approvals, it may lead to a financial transaction step. The constraints linking these payment steps to certain approval stages suggest the finalization of the declaration results in a payment request and subsequent handling.

**Overall Process Narrative:**

From these constraints, we can infer a complex organizational approval process for some sort of "Declaration" (which could represent an expense claim, a procurement request, or similar formal request). The employee starts the process by saving and eventually submitting the declaration. Then the declaration moves through multiple approval layers (Pre-approver, Supervisor, Administration, Budget Owner), each of which can either approve or reject. Some roles or conditions may allow looping back to earlier states (e.g., the employee resubmits after a rejection), but certain constraints prevent contradictory sequences or the co-occurrence of incompatible outcomes.

If all approvals succeed, the declaration may achieve "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR," possibly triggering a "Request Payment" and then a "Payment Handled" step, concluding the process positively. If, at any stage, a stakeholder rejects it, certain other steps become either impossible or irrelevant, reflecting the process’s strict gating rules.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the process described by these constraints is a multi-step, role-driven approval workflow for a declaration, characterized by strict ordering of events, conditional approvals and rejections, carefully bounded repetition, and the eventual possibility of payment handling. The complexity of the constraints and roles indicates a highly regulated, formal process where each actor and decision point significantly shapes the final outcome.
