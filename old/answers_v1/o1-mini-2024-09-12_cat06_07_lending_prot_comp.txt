To identify the unfair differences in the treatment of the **protected** and **unprotected** groups based on the provided process variants and their execution times, let's analyze and compare key aspects of each group's processes. This analysis will focus on the **number of steps**, **process complexity**, **execution times**, and **outcome frequencies** to uncover potential biases or disparities.

### 1. **Process Complexity and Number of Steps**

**Protected Group:**
- **Higher Complexity:** The protected group exhibits a significantly higher number of process variants with more steps. Common additional steps include:
  - **Make Visit to Assess Collateral:** Multiple instances where this step is repeated.
  - **Request Co-Signer On Loan:** Frequently required.
  - **Multiple Visits to Assess Collateral:** Some variants include up to four visits.
- **Example:** 
  ```
  Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
  ```
  *(Total Steps: 9)*

**Unprotected Group:**
- **Lower Complexity:** The unprotected group has fewer process variants with fewer steps. Common paths include:
  - **Direct Submission to Underwriter:** Less frequent additional steps.
  - **Skipped Examination:** In some cases, an examination step is skipped.
- **Example:**
  ```
  Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
  ```
  *(Total Steps: 6)*

### 2. **Execution Times (Performance)**

**Protected Group:**
- **Longer Execution Times:** The performance times for the protected group processes are generally higher, indicating longer processing durations.
  - **Range:** Approximately **219,999** to **490,000** units (assuming milliseconds or another time unit).
  - **Higher Averages:** Multiple processes exceed **330,000** units.
  
**Unprotected Group:**
- **Shorter Execution Times:** The performance times are relatively lower, suggesting faster processing.
  - **Range:** Approximately **80,001** to **489,840** units.
  - **Consistent Lower Averages:** Many processes hover around **260,000** to **390,000** units, with some exceptions.

### 3. **Outcome Frequencies**

**Protected Group:**
- **Higher Denial Rates:** A significant number of processes end with "Loan Denied" or "Application Rejected."
  - **Frequent Denials:** Many variants have high frequencies of denial, e.g., **960**, **599**, **229**, etc.
- **Lower Approval Rates:** Fewer instances lead to "Sign Loan Agreement," indicating fewer approvals.
  
**Unprotected Group:**
- **Mixed Outcomes:** While there are also denials and rejections, the frequencies suggest a more balanced outcome distribution.
  - **Higher Approval Instances:** Processes leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" have substantial frequencies, e.g., **1,656**, **1,656**, etc.
- **Denials Present:** However, denials still occur but are not as disproportionately high as in the protected group.

### 4. **Specific Process Path Differences**

**Additional Scrutiny Steps:**
- **Protected Group:** Multiple instances require "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and repeated "Make Visit to Assess Collateral," which can introduce delays and increase the complexity of the application.
- **Unprotected Group:** These additional steps are less frequent, and some processes skip certain examinations altogether, reducing the potential for delays.

**Example Comparison:**
- **Protected Group:**
  ```
  Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
  ```
- **Unprotected Group:**
  ```
  Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied
  ```
  *(Protected group has additional steps leading to potential delays and increased likelihood of denial.)*

### 5. **Performance Time Discrepancies for Similar Outcomes**

- **Loan Denied Processes:**
  - **Protected Group:** Denial processes often have higher performance times due to additional verification steps.
    - Example: **390,055.423** vs. **389,998.313** (similar for unprotected, but protected group often has more steps leading to similar or higher times)
  
- **Sign Loan Agreement:**
  - **Protected Group:** Even approval processes take longer due to extra steps.
    - Example: **330,025.590** vs. **390,033.075** (some overlap, but protected group generally has longer times)

### **Summary of Unfair Differences**

1. **Increased Process Complexity for Protected Group:**
   - More steps such as additional collateral assessments and co-signer requests introduce unnecessary hurdles.

2. **Longer Execution Times:**
   - Protected group applications take significantly longer to process, leading to delays and potentially increased customer dissatisfaction.

3. **Higher Denial Rates:**
   - Protected group faces a higher frequency of loan denials and application rejections, suggesting possible bias in decision-making.

4. **Fewer Approvals:**
   - The protected group has fewer instances leading to successful loan agreements, indicating potential discrimination in approval rates.

5. **Disproportionate Scrutiny:**
   - The additional steps required for the protected group may reflect discriminatory practices, creating an uneven playing field compared to the unprotected group.

### **Recommendations**

- **Audit Processes:** Conduct a thorough audit of the loan processing steps to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps that disproportionately affect the protected group.
  
- **Standardize Procedures:** Ensure that all applicants, regardless of their protected status, undergo the same evaluation process without additional scrutiny.

- **Training and Awareness:** Provide training for staff to recognize and prevent unconscious biases that may influence loan approval decisions.

- **Monitor Outcomes:** Continuously monitor and analyze loan processing outcomes to ensure fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

By addressing these disparities, the organization can work towards more equitable treatment of all applicants, fostering trust and compliance with legal and ethical standards.
