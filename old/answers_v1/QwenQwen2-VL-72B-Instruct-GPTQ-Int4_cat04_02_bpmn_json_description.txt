The process starts with a start event, and then proceeds to a task called "Prepare implements". After that, there is a sequence of tasks that include "Hand washing", "Get in sterile clothes", "Clean puncture area", "Drap puncture area", "Ultrasound configuration", "Gel in probe", "Cover probe", "Put sterile gel", "Position probe", and "Position patient". Then, there is an exclusive gateway that splits the process into three paths. One path leads to a task called "Doppler identification", the second path leads to a task called "Anatomic identification", and the third path leads to a task called "Compression identification". After these tasks, there is another exclusive gateway that joins the paths back together and leads to a task called "Anesthetize". Then, there is another exclusive gateway that splits the process into two paths. One path leads to a task called "Puncture" and the other path leads to a task called "Blood return". After these tasks, there is another exclusive gateway that joins the paths back together and leads to a task called "Drop probe". Then, there is another sequence of tasks that include "Remove syringe", "Guidewire install", "Remove trocar", "Check wire in long axis", and "Check wire in short axis". After these tasks, there is another exclusive gateway that joins the paths back together and leads to a task called "Wire in good position". Then, there is another exclusive gateway that splits the process into two paths. One path leads to a task called "Widen pathway" and the other path leads to a task called "Advance catheter". After these tasks, there is another exclusive gateway that joins the paths back together and leads to a task called "Remove guidewire". Then, there is another sequence of tasks that include "Check flow and reflow", and "Check catheter position". Finally, the process ends with an end event.
