Certainly! Let's consider a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process with the following activities:

1. **Purchase Order Creation (PO)**
2. **Purchase Order Approval (POA)**
3. **Goods Receipt (GR)**
4. **Invoice Receipt (IR)**
5. **Invoice Approval (IA)**
6. **Payment (P)**

We'll create a temporal profile for this process. The temporal profile will include the average and standard deviation of the times between these activities. For simplicity, let's assume the following temporal relationships:

- **PO to POA**: Average time is 1 day (86400 seconds), standard deviation is 4 hours (14400 seconds).
- **POA to GR**: Average time is 3 days (259200 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **GR to IR**: Average time is 2 days (172800 seconds), standard deviation is 12 hours (43200 seconds).
- **IR to IA**: Average time is 1 day (86400 seconds), standard deviation is 8 hours (28800 seconds).
- **IA to P**: Average time is 1 day (86400 seconds), standard deviation is 8 hours (28800 seconds).

Additionally, we'll include some indirect temporal relationships:

- **PO to GR**: Average time is 4 days (345600 seconds), standard deviation is 1.5 days (129600 seconds).
- **PO to IR**: Average time is 6 days (518400 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **PO to IA**: Average time is 7 days (604800 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **PO to P**: Average time is 8 days (691200 seconds), standard deviation is 2.5 days (216000 seconds).
- **POA to IR**: Average time is 5 days (432000 seconds), standard deviation is 1.5 days (129600 seconds).
- **POA to IA**: Average time is 6 days (518400 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **POA to P**: Average time is 7 days (604800 seconds), standard deviation is 2.5 days (216000 seconds).
- **GR to IA**: Average time is 3 days (259200 seconds), standard deviation is 1.5 days (129600 seconds).
- **GR to P**: Average time is 4 days (345600 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **IR to P**: Average time is 2 days (172800 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).

Here is the temporal profile expressed as a Python dictionary:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('PO', 'POA'): (86400, 14400),
    ('POA', 'GR'): (259200, 86400),
    ('GR', 'IR'): (172800, 43200),
    ('IR', 'IA'): (86400, 28800),
    ('IA', 'P'): (86400, 28800),
    ('PO', 'GR'): (345600, 129600),
    ('PO', 'IR'): (518400, 172800),
    ('PO', 'IA'): (604800, 172800),
    ('PO', 'P'): (691200, 216000),
    ('POA', 'IR'): (432000, 129600),
    ('POA', 'IA'): (518400, 172800),
    ('POA', 'P'): (604800, 216000),
    ('GR', 'IA'): (259200, 129600),
    ('GR', 'P'): (345600, 172800),
    ('IR', 'P'): (172800, 86400)
}
```

This dictionary represents the temporal profile for the hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, including both direct and indirect temporal relationships between activities.
