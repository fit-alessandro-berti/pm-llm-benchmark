Sure! Here is an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Submit Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order')},
    'always_before': {('Receive Goods', 'Check Invoice')},
    'always_after': {('Receive Goods', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'never_together': {('Submit Purchase Requisition', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'activ_freq': {'Submit Purchase Requisition': {1}, 'Create Purchase Order': {1}, 'Receive Goods': {1}, 'Check Invoice': {1}, 'Pay Invoice': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {('Submit Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'), ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'), ('Receive Goods', 'Check Invoice'), ('Check Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')}
}
```

In this model, we have declared constraints such as equivalence between submitting a purchase requisition and creating a purchase order, always performing the receiving of goods before checking the invoice, always paying the invoice after receiving the goods, and never submitting a purchase requisition and paying the invoice together. The allowed number of occurrences for each activity is also defined, along with the direct sequence of activities in the process flow.
