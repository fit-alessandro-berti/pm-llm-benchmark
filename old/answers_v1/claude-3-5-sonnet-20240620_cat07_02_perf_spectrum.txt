This visualization appears to be a Sankey diagram or flow chart depicting a process over time, from January 25, 2000 to April 24, 2013.

The diagram is divided into three main horizontal sections:

1. At the top, labeled "Send Fine", there are many thin vertical gray lines of varying heights.

2. In the middle, labeled "Insert Fine Notification", there's a transition area where the lines from the top section converge.

3. At the bottom, labeled "Send for Credit Collection", the lines fan out into wider, angled streams in shades of pink and red.

The flow of the diagram suggests a process where many individual cases (represented by the thin lines at the top) go through a notification stage, and then a portion of these cases end up being sent for credit collection.

The varying densities and colors in the bottom section might indicate the volume or severity of cases sent to collection over time.

This visualization likely represents a financial or legal process, possibly related to fines or penalties, showing how cases progress from initial sending, through notification, to potential credit collection.
