To create a DECLARE model for the given process, we need to analyze the provided variants and identify the relevant constraints among activities. Based on the given variants, I will derive some of the key constraints that can be reasonably inferred from them.

Here is an example of how the DECLARE model might look based on the provided data:

```python
DECLARE_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': 1.0,
        'Send Fine': 1.0,
        'Insert Fine Notification': 1.0,
        'Add penalty': 1.0,
        'Payment': 1.0,
        'Send for Credit Collection': 1.0,
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': 1.0,
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': 1.0,
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': 1.0
    },
    
    'absence': {
        # No activities are absent in the given variants, so this dictionary is empty.
    },
    
    'exactly_one': {
        # Given the nature of the process and the variants provided, there may be no exact one constraints that can be inferred directly from the data.
    },
    
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': 1.0,
    },
    
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'coexistence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'response': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Send Fine', 'Add penalty'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'succession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'altresponse': {
        # No alternating responses are clearly defined in the given data.
    },
    
    'altprecedence': {
        # No alternating precedence is clearly defined in the given data.
    },
    
    'altsuccession': {
        # No alternating succession is clearly defined in the given data.
    },
    
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Send Fine', 'Add penalty'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (1.0, 1.0),
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    },
    
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): (1.0, 1.0),
        # Add other couples as needed based on the variants.
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:

- **Existence**: Every activity is executed at least once in all provided variants.
  
- **Absence**: No activity is absent.

- **Exactly One**: There are no explicit constraints that every activity should be executed exactly once.

- **Initialization**: The process starts with `Create Fine`.

- **Responded Existence**: If `Create Fine` occurs, then both `Send Fine` and `Payment` occur in the variants provided. 

- **Co-Existence**: For example, if `Send Fine` happens, then `Insert Fine Notification` also happens.

- **Response**: If `Create Fine` happens, then `Send Fine` or `Payment` will happen subsequently.

- **Precedence**: If `Send Fine` occurs, then `Insert Fine Notification` and `Add penalty` must occur before it.

- **Succession**: Similar to Response, but the sequence is more strict. For instance, `Create Fine` can lead to either `Send Fine` or `Payment`.

- **AltResponse/AltPrecedence/AltSuccession**: Not applicable as per given data since there are no clear alternating patterns observed.

- **Chain Response/Chain Precedence/Chain Succession**: Similar to standard responses but ensuring the direct follow-up without any other activities in between. For instance, `Create Fine` must directly lead to `Send Fine`.

- **Non Co-Existence**: Some combinations like `Send for Credit Collection` and `Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture` do not co-exist.

- **Nonsuccession/Nonchain succession**: Certain activities are expected not to follow others in the sequence. For instance, `Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine` should not be a valid sequence.

### Note:
This is a simplified model based on the provided data. In practice, you may need to further refine and expand this model by analyzing more of the process variants or additional domain knowledge.
