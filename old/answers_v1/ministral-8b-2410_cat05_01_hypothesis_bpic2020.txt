   - This question is based on the highest frequency value from the given data.

2. **Which process variant has the highest performance (total time to completion)?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**
   - This question is based on the highest performance value from the given data.

3. **What is the average frequency of the process variants?**
   - **Confidence Score: 90%**
   - This question requires calculating the average frequency across all variants.

4. **How many times has the process variant with the highest frequency been executed?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**
   - This question is directly derived from the given data.

5. **Which approval stage has the highest frequency of rejections?**
   - **Confidence Score: 90%**
   - This question requires identifying the stage with the most rejections from the given data.

6. **What is the total number of process variants?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**
   - This question is based on counting the distinct process paths provided.

7. **What is the longest duration for a single process variant?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**
   - This question is based on the highest performance value from the given data.

8. **What is the shortest duration for a single process variant?**
   - **Confidence Score: 95%**
   - This question is based on the lowest performance value from the given data.

9. **What is the variance in the performance (duration) of the process variants?**
   - **Confidence Score: 90%**
   - This question requires calculating the variance in the performance values.

10. **How many times has the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' sequence occurred?**
    - **Confidence Score: 95%**
    - This question is directly derived from the given data.

11. **What is the average time taken to complete the payment handling stage?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires calculating the average performance value for the 'Payment Handled' stage.

12. **How many times has the process ended in 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'?**
    - **Confidence Score: 95%**
    - This question is based on counting the variants that end with this stage.

13. **Which approval stage has the highest rejection rate?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires calculating the rejection rates for each approval stage.

14. **What is the longest path involving the 'REJECTED' stage?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires identifying the longest sequence that includes a 'REJECTED' stage.

15. **How many times has the 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' sequence occurred?**
    - **Confidence Score: 95%**
    - This question is directly derived from the given data.

16. **What is the average frequency of process variants involving 'REJECTED' stages?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires calculating the average frequency for all variants that include a 'REJECTED' stage.

17. **How many times has the 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' stage been reached after an initial rejection?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires identifying the frequency of this specific path.

18. **What is the average time taken for the 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' stage?**
    - **Confidence Score: 90%**
    - This question requires calculating the average performance for all variants that include this stage.

19. **How many times has the process been short-circuited with a 'MISSING' rejection?**
    - **Confidence Score: 95%**
    - This question is based on counting the variants that include 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.

20. **What is the total number of process completions?**
    - **Confidence Score: 95%**
    - This question is derived by summing up the frequencies of all process variants.

These questions should provide a comprehensive understanding of the process variants and their performance.
