This process appears to be a workflow for approving declarations and handling payments within an organization. The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration, which then goes through various approval steps by different authorities such as pre-approvers, budget owners, administrators, and supervisors. The final approval is given by the supervisor before the declaration is considered final.

If the declaration is rejected at any point in the process, it may be sent back to the employee for resubmission or rejected by another authority. There is also an option for the declaration to be rejected by "missing," which seems to indicate that there is missing information or documentation.

Once the declaration is final approved, a payment is requested and subsequently handled. There are also instances where a payment is requested directly without going through the approval process.

Overall, the process involves multiple steps of submission, approval, rejection, and payment handling, with different frequencies and performances associated with each step.
