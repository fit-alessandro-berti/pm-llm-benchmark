The provided data shows a wide range of performance times, strongly suggesting multiple root causes related to the approval process.  A few key observations:

* **High Variance in Rejection Rates and Rework:**  The significant number of rejection paths (by Administration, Supervisor, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, and Missing) and resubmissions (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE")  demonstrates a problem with either unclear approval criteria or inconsistent application of those criteria.  The process is highly susceptible to errors or disagreements that lead to cycles of rejection and resubmission.  Processes with a high number of rejected steps will naturally have longer processing times.

* **Long Rejection Chains:**  Processes involving multiple rejections and resubmissions (e.g., 5 or 6 rejections in a row) are significantly slower.  The data shows substantial performance penalty for these longer loops.  Identifying the reasons for these multiple rejections is critical.  This indicates problems with communication or lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities.

* **Different Approval Paths with Varying Performance:** Several different approval paths are possible, leading to variations in completion times (e.g. 810187.903 vs 1084338.407).  Not all paths are equally efficient.  Examining the characteristics that differentiate these paths could highlight areas for improvement.

* **"MISSING" Approvals:** The frequency of approvals being rejected by "MISSING" individuals demonstrates a critical issue in communication or oversight, either for who is responsible, or how to find the appropriate individuals in a timely way.

* **Variations in "SAVED" Status (with no Performance Data):**  This suggests possible issues with user workflow or data management practices that are not properly being tracked for analysis and therefore might not be impacting performance as much as other aspects.


* **Very High Performance Values:**  While frequency is low, several paths have unusually high performance times (e.g., some exceeding 2 million).  These extreme values might reflect outliers or data anomalies that require further investigation.

* **Limited Data on "Payment Handled":** This suggests it might not be a part of the approval problem itself, rather a separate stage that the approval process might not have a direct impact on but might be impacted by the other issues such as time delays.


**In summary:** The process has significant bottlenecks caused by a high volume of rejected declarations, long approval chains, variable approval pathways, and insufficient clarity around responsibilities and approval criteria. These elements, combined with "Missing" approvals and large variance in performance values, need to be analyzed in detail to pinpoint specific issues and implement targeted improvements.
