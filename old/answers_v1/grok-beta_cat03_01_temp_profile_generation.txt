Here's a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process, which involves steps from purchasing to payment:

```python
purchase_to_pay_temporal_profile = {
    ('Requisition', 'Approval'): (43200, 7200),  # 12 hours average, 2 hours std deviation
    ('Approval', 'Purchase Order'): (86400, 14400),  # 1 day average, 4 hours std deviation
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (259200, 43200),  # 3 days average, 12 hours std deviation
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (172800, 28800),  # 2 days average, 8 hours std deviation
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'): (21600, 3600),  # 6 hours average, 1 hour std deviation
    ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment Request'): (43200, 7200),  # 12 hours average, 2 hours std deviation
    ('Payment Request', 'Payment'): (604800, 86400),  # 1 week average, 1 day std deviation
    ('Payment', 'Account Reconciliation'): (1209600, 172800),  # 2 weeks average, 2 days std deviation
    ('Requisition', 'Payment'): (2419200, 432000),  # 28 days average, 5 days std deviation (overall process time)
    ('Purchase Order', 'Payment'): (1814400, 345600)  # 21 days average, 4 days std deviation
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Requisition to Approval**: This step involves the time taken for a purchase requisition to be approved, which might take about half a day on average, with some variation.

2. **Approval to Purchase Order**: After approval, creating a purchase order can take around a full day.

3. **Purchase Order to Goods Receipt**: This interval can vary significantly due to supplier lead times, hence a longer average time with a relatively high standard deviation.

4. **Goods Receipt to Invoice Receipt**: The time from when goods are received to when an invoice arrives can be a couple of days.

5. **Invoice Receipt to Verification**: Checking an invoice might be quick, but there's room for delay, especially if discrepancies are found.

6. **Invoice Verification to Payment Request**: After verification, preparing for payment might take half a day to a day.

7. **Payment Request to Payment**: Depending on payment terms, this can take up to a week or more.

8. **Payment to Account Reconciliation**: After payment, reconciling accounts might take a couple of weeks due to accounting practices.

9. **Requisition to Payment**: The total time for the entire process from requisition to payment.

10. **Purchase Order to Payment**: This tracks the time from when a purchase order is issued to when payment is made, excluding the initial requisition step.

This temporal profile captures typical intervals within a Purchase-to-Pay process, but remember, these numbers are hypothetical and can vary greatly depending on the organization's efficiency, supplier relationships, and internal policies.
