Event abstraction is a powerful technique to enhance the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. It involves transforming low-level, detailed events into higher-level, more abstract events. Here’s how this can be effectively utilized:

1. **Grouping Activities**: Identify and group similar or related low-level events into a single high-level activity. For instance, a series of low-level IT system logs could be abstracted into a high-level process like "User Authentication."

2. **Pattern Recognition**: Use pattern recognition to identify recurring sequences of events that can be abstracted into a single event. This helps in reducing the complexity of the model by minimizing the number of distinct events.

3. **Hierarchical Modeling**: Create a hierarchical structure where all low-level details remain available but focus is shifted to a higher level of abstraction. This allows different stakeholders to view the process at the level of detail most relevant to them.

4. **Semantic Annotations**: Use semantic metadata to add meaning to the events. Assigning business-related meanings to technical events can help stakeholders better understand the process without needing to delve into technical details.

5. **Reduction Techniques**: Employ event reduction techniques, such as filter mechanisms, to remove less significant events that do not substantially affect the understanding of the process.

6. **Process Mining Tools**: Utilize process mining tools that support event abstraction features to automatically transform detailed logs into more abstracted process models. These tools often provide customizable settings to balance detail and abstraction.

7. **User-Centric Abstraction**: Design abstractions based on the needs of different users. For example, managers might prefer more abstract views focusing on outcomes, while process analysts might require more detailed views.

8. **Iterative Refinement**: Implement an iterative approach to refine the abstraction process. Get feedback from users who interact with the process models to adjust the level of detail as needed.

By effectively applying these strategies, organizations can create process models that are not only more understandable and manageable but also better aligned with business objectives, facilitating easier communication and analysis.
