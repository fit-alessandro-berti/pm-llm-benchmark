Based on the provided data, here are some potential root causes for the performance issues in each object type:

**Handling Unit**

* The "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck" transition has a high frequency (10553 events) but a low number of objects (10553). This might indicate that there is a bottleneck at this stage, where not all events are being processed correctly.
* The duration of this transition (7820.93 seconds) is also quite long, indicating potential inefficiencies in the process.

**Truck**

* The "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" transition has a high frequency (1989 events) and a low number of objects (6). This might indicate that there are not enough trucks available to handle the demand.
* The duration of this transition (10999.07 seconds) is also quite long, indicating potential inefficiencies in the process.

**Container**

* The "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" transition has a high frequency (1995 events) and a low number of objects (1995). This might indicate that there are not enough containers available to handle the demand.
* The duration of this transition (368943.92 seconds) is extremely long, indicating potential inefficiencies in the process due to repeated failed attempts.
* The "Pick Up Empty Container" -> "Load Truck" transition has a high frequency (1994 events) and a low number of objects (1994). This might indicate that there are not enough containers available to handle the demand.

**Vehicle**

* The "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" transition has an extremely long duration (295965.56 seconds), indicating potential inefficiencies in the process due to repeated failed attempts.
* The "Load to Vehicle" -> "Depart" transition has a low frequency (127 events) and a high number of objects (127). This might indicate that there are not enough vehicles available to handle the demand.

**Forklift**

* The "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" transition has an extremely long duration (26927.52 seconds), indicating potential inefficiencies in the process due to repeated failed attempts.
* The "Load to Vehicle" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" transition has a high frequency (1390 events) and a low number of objects (3). This might indicate that there are not enough forklifts available to handle the demand.

**Customer Order**

* The "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" transition has an extremely long duration (329005.22 seconds), indicating potential inefficiencies in the process due to repeated failed attempts.

**Transport Document**

* The "Book Vehicles" -> "Order Empty Containers" transition has a high frequency (593 events) and a low number of objects (593). This might indicate that there are not enough vehicles available to handle the demand.
* The "Depart" -> "Depart" transition has an extremely long duration (1051301.41 seconds), indicating potential inefficiencies in the process due to repeated failed attempts.

These findings suggest that the main performance issues are related to:

1. Inefficient processes with repeated failed attempts
2. Bottlenecks at certain stages of the process
3. Insufficient resources (e.g., trucks, containers, forklifts) to handle demand

These issues should be addressed by analyzing and optimizing each process stage separately.
