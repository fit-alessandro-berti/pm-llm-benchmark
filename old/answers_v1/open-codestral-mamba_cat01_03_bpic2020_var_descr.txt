The process described by the data you've provided seems to be a complex workflow or approval process where employees can submit declarations, which are then reviewed by different levels of administrators and supervisors. The process may vary depending on the specific situation, but generally, it follows these steps:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration is reviewed by an administrator.
3. If the declaration is approved by the administrator, it is then reviewed by the supervisor.
4. If the declaration is approved by the supervisor, the request for payment is made.
5. The payment is handled.

However, the process can also have multiple variations, such as when the declaration is rejected by the administrator or the supervisor, or when it is reviewed by a budget owner instead of a supervisor.

The frequency and performance metrics you've provided seem to indicate the number of times each process variant occurs and the average time it takes to complete the process, respectively. For example, the first process variant has a frequency of 4618 and a performance of 810187.903, which means that on average, it takes 810187.903 units of time to complete this process variant.

Overall, this process seems to be relatively complex and may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each declaration.
