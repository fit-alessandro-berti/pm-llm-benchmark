To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group, we need to analyze both the frequencies and execution times of process variants. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Frequent Process Variants:**
   - The protected group has several frequent process variants that include a mix of standard examinations and expert examinations.
   - In contrast, the unprotected group predominantly includes variants with expert examinations, thorough examinations, and multiple treatment attempts.

### 2. **Execution Time Analysis:**
   - The execution times for both groups are quite high, which could indicate inefficiencies or additional steps in the process.
   - However, there is a notable difference in performance values (execution time) between the variants of the two groups:
     - Protected group has lower and more consistent performance values compared to the unprotected group.

### 3. **Variants with Expert Examinations:**
   - The unprotected group frequently uses expert examinations, which are present in many of their high-frequency process variants.
   - For instance, "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" is a common and frequent variant for the unprotected group.
   - In contrast, while there are some expert examination variants in the protected group, they do not dominate as much.

### 4. **Treatment Success Rate:**
   - The performance values (execution times) suggest that certain variants in the unprotected group take significantly longer to complete compared to those in the protected group.
   - For example, several variants in the unprotected group have higher execution times than most of the variants in the protected group.

### 5. **Discharge Variants:**
   - The frequency and performance values for discharge without further treatment (e.g., "Discharge" or "Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge") are lower for both groups, but this does not seem to be a primary differentiating factor between them.

### Summary of Differences:
- **Frequency:** The unprotected group has more frequent process variants that include expert examinations and thorough examinations.
- **Performance (Execution Time):** Variants in the protected group tend to have shorter execution times compared to those in the unprotected group, which might indicate fewer unnecessary steps or quicker processing.
- **Treatment Success Rate:** The performance values for certain variants in the unprotected group are higher, suggesting longer treatment processes and possibly more complications.

### Potential Unfair Differences:
1. **Resource Allocation:**
   - More resources (time, staff) may be allocated to the expert examinations in the unprotected group, leading to extended processing times.
2. **Treatment Complexity:**
   - The presence of multiple thorough examinations and additional treatment attempts might suggest a higher complexity or severity of cases for the unprotected group.

### Recommendations:
- Investigate why certain variants with expert examinations and thorough examinations are more frequent and time-consuming in the unprotected group.
- Ensure that all patients, regardless of their group classification, receive efficient and timely care to minimize differences in treatment processes and execution times.
