This BPMN model represents a process of performing an ultrasound-guided procedure. The process involves several tasks such as preparing the equipment, hand washing, getting in sterile clothes, cleaning and draping the puncture area, configuring the ultrasound, and positioning the probe and patient.

The process also includes tasks for identifying the target using Doppler, anatomical, and compression techniques. Anesthetizing, puncturing, returning blood, and removing the syringe are also steps in the process. Additionally, tasks for installing the guidewire, removing the trocar, and checking the position of the wire in different axes are part of the procedure.

The process involves various gateways for diverging and converging paths to control the flow of the process based on different conditions. The process ends with the final task of checking the catheter position before reaching the end event.

Overall, this BPMN model outlines a detailed and complex process for performing an ultrasound-guided procedure with multiple steps and decision points.
