**Short Summary:**  
This visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram showing the interaction between two participants—a "credit scoring" function (e.g., at a bank) and a separate "scoring service" provider. The top lane represents the bank's credit scoring process, while the bottom lane represents the external (or internal but separate) service that computes the credit score. Together, they depict how a credit score request is made, processed, potentially delayed, and finally resolved.

**Detailed Explanation:**  
1. **Participants (Pools/Lanes):**  
   - **Credit Scoring (Bank) Pool:** This is the top lane. It starts by receiving a scoring request from some external trigger (like a customer application or an internal system).
   - **Scoring Service Pool:** This is the bottom lane. It receives requests from the credit scoring function of the bank and attempts to provide a computed score.

2. **Start and End Points:**  
   - The process in the **Credit Scoring (Bank)** lane begins with a start event labeled "scoring request received," indicating that the bank’s credit scoring module has a new request to process.
   - The final state "scoring request handled" (shown as a circle with a bold border) indicates the completion of the entire sequence of obtaining the credit score and returning it to the requesting entity.

3. **Main Flow of the Credit Scoring (Bank):**  
   - After receiving the request, the bank's credit scoring function issues a "request credit score" action. This is represented by a task box.
   - A message (dashed arrow with an envelope icon) is sent to the **Scoring Service** pool, initiating the computation process.
   
4. **Scoring Service Process:**
   - The scoring service starts by receiving the scoring request message.
   - It attempts "compute credit score (level 1)." This suggests a first-level computation, possibly a fast initial score or retrieval from a quick data source.
   - A decision gateway (diamond shape) checks if a score is available immediately:
     - **If Yes (Score Available):** The scoring service directly proceeds to "send credit score" back to the bank’s credit scoring function.
     - **If No (Score Not Available):** The service "report[s] delay." This implies that the scoring service needs more time. After reporting a delay, it might perform a more intensive or secondary computation step "compute credit score (level 2)," which could mean a deeper analysis or calling additional data sources. Ultimately, once the level 2 score is computed, the service "send[s] credit score."

5. **Handling Delays (Communication Between Participants):**  
   - When the scoring service cannot return a score immediately, it sends a "delay information" message back to the bank’s credit scoring function.
   - On the bank side, once a delay notification is received, the "report delay" task handles that information—this could involve notifying a user, logging the event, or waiting in a queue.
   - The bank’s credit scoring function remains in a loop waiting for the final credit score. When the "credit score received" message eventually arrives, the process moves forward.

6. **Consolidation and Completion:**
   - When the bank finally receives the "credit score," it exits the loop, stops waiting, and then "send[s] credit score" to the original requester or the next stage in the bank’s workflow.
   - The "scoring request handled" end event marks that all necessary steps—delay handling, score computation, and result delivery—have concluded.

**Key BPMN Elements in the Diagram:**
- **Pools/Lanes:** Show different entities or departments. In this diagram, we have two pools for two different participants.
- **Tasks (Rectangles):** Show the actions being performed, such as "request credit score" or "compute credit score."
- **Events (Circles):** Start events (usually a single thin border) and end events (thicker border). Intermediate events are often used to show messages or other triggers.
- **Gateways (Diamonds):** Decision points that guide the flow based on conditions (such as "score available?" yes/no).
- **Message Flows (Dotted Arrows with Envelopes):** Represent communications between the two participants. They cross the boundary between pools.
- **Sequence Flows (Solid Arrows):** Show the order of activities within a single participant’s process.

**Interpretation:**
Overall, this diagram models a realistic scenario where a credit score request is made to an external service. The service attempts a quick computation, and if it fails to quickly produce a score, it informs the requesting party about a delay and tries a more in-depth computation. Eventually, a final credit score is returned, completing the process.
