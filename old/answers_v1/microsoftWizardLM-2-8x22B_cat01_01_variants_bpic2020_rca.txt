 To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the provided data specific to each process variant. Performance issues can be indicated by high frequency of rework, long durations, or high financial impact due to delays or inefficiencies. Here are some process and data-specific considerations based on the given variants:

1. **Rejections and Rework**: The process variants with multiple rejections followed by re-submissions indicate significant rework. For example:
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (and similar loops with other roles).
   - These rejections lead to repeated cycles, which consume time and resources, contributing to performance issues.

2. **Missing Approvals**: The variant with "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" suggests an incomplete process or a missing step that causes confusion or delays.

3. **Bottlenecks at Specific Steps**: Some steps have higher frequencies of rejections, such as:
   - Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION and Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR.
   - These bottlenecks can be due to strict approval criteria, lack of clarity in guidelines, or high workload on these roles, leading to delays.

4. **Inefficiencies in Communication**: The need for employees to resubmit declarations multiple times indicates potential communication issues between the parties involved, leading to unnecessary iterations.

5. **Resource Constraints**: High-frequency variants with lower performance (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled with frequency = 4618 and performance = 810187.903) may suggest that the administration and supervisor roles are resource-constrained and cannot process submissions quickly enough.

6. **Complexity in Approval Flows**: The presence of multiple approval paths (e.g., involving PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER) adds complexity to the process, which can lead to confusion and errors, necessitating rework.

7. **Inconsistent Processing Times**: Some variants with lower frequency but high performance (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled with frequency = 4 and performance = 9110508.000) indicate inconsistencies in processing times, which could be due to exceptions, errors, or differences in handling by different personnel.

8. **High Financial Impact**: Some rejected and resubmitted variants have a very high financial impact (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION with performance = 13805869.200). This suggests that rejections can be very costly, possibly due to delayed payments or project timelines.

9. **Lack of Standardization**: Different process paths for similar scenarios indicate a lack of standardization, which can lead to inconsistent processing and decision-making.

10. **Error Rates and Quality Issues**: High rejection rates may indicate errors in the submission process or quality issues with the declarations being submitted.

To address these root causes, the organization should consider process improvement initiatives such as:
- Streamlining the approval process to reduce the number of steps and decision points.
- Providing clear guidelines and training to reduce errors and rejections.
- Balancing the workload across roles to prevent bottlenecks.
- Implementing automated checks or pre-validation steps to catch errors early.
- Standardizing processes to ensure consistency in decision-making.
- Monitoring and analyzing process performance regularly to identify and address inefficiencies.

By focusing on these specific areas, the organization can reduce the frequency of rework, minimize delays, and improve overall process performance.
