Based on the provided data, the underlying process appears to be a multi-stage approval workflow for handling employee declarations, leading to a payment request and final payment handling. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Employee Initiation**:
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Initial Approval**:
   - The declaration is then evaluated by an administrator (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` or rejected (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`).

3. **Additional Approvals**:
   - Depending on the specific workflow variant, the declaration may require additional approvals from various stakeholders such as:
     - Budget Owner (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` or `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`)
     - Pre-Approver (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER` or `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`)
     - Supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` or `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`)

   - Some variants involve multiple rounds of resubmission and reapproval if the declaration is initially rejected.

4. **Payment Request**:
   - Once theall required approvals are obtained, a request for payment is made (`Request Payment`).

5. **Payment Handling**:
   - Finally, the payment is handled (`Payment Handled`). The frequency and performance metrics indicate how often this final step occurs and the corresponding performance values.

6. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
   - If a declaration is rejected at any stage, the employee may need to make revisions and resubmit the declaration, restarting the approval process.

### Key Variants and Their Frequency:

1. **Standard Approval Path**:
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (Frequency = 4618, Performance = 810187.903)
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (Frequency = 2473, Performance = 1084338.407)

2. **Approval by Pre-Approver**:
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` (Frequency = 575, Performance = 861058.409)

3. **Resubmission and Multiple Attempts**:
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> ... (repeated reubmission and reapproval) -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`

4. **Early Rejection**:
   - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` (Frequency = 174, Performance = 727139.517)

5. **Other Variants**:
   - Involve different combinations of rejections, resubmissions, and approvals at various stages. leading to thefinal payment handling.

### Performance Metrics:

- The performance metric appears to represent some form of cost or efficiency associated with each process variant. Higher performance values generally indicate more complex or longer-duration processes.

### Summary:

The process involves an employee initiating a declaration, which then undergoes a series of approvals from various stakeholders. If approved, a payment request is made and handled. If rejected, the process may involve multiple rounds of resubmission and reapproval. Each variant of the process has associated frequency and performance metrics, indicating how often it occurs and its relative efficiency or cost.
