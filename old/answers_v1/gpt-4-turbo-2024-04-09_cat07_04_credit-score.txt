The provided image is a flowchart diagram that outlines the process of managing a credit scoring request. There are two main sections depicted within the diagram, each detailing a different approach for handling a scoring request.

1. **Credit Scoring Through API**
   - **Start Point**: The process initiates when a credit scoring request is received.
   - **Request Credit Score**: A sub-process where a credit score is requested. The process then diverges based on whether there is a delay in receiving the information or the credit score itself.
     - **Delay Information**:
       - If there is a delay, it is reported.
       - If there is no delay, the process continues to check for the credit score receipt.
     - **Credit Score Received**:
       - If the credit score is received, it proceeds to a decision point.
       - If it is not received even after the delay is reported, the process ends.
   - **Decision Point**: Determines whether to send the credit score or end the process based on the successful retrieval of the credit score.
   - **End Point**: The scoring request is handled and finalized.

2. **Session-Based Scoring**
   - **Start Point**: Similar to the first process, it starts when a scoring request is received.
   - **Compute Credit Score (Level 1)**: Initially, tries to compute the credit score.
     - **Score Available?**: Checks if the score is available.
       - **Yes**: If available, the credit score is sent directly.
       - **No**: If not available, a delay is reported and the system attempts to compute the score again at a second level.
   - **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)**: A secondary attempt to compute the score after reporting a delay.
   - **Send Credit Score**: Following the successful computation at level 2, the credit score is sent.
   - **End Point**: The scoring request is treated as handled and concluded.

**Additional Features**:
- There is a connection indicated for message queuing, labeled 'link1: ID for message queuing', suggesting integration with asynchronous message processing components.
- Decision points and branching logic are clearly marked, showing where conditions are checked (e.g., delay, availability of score) and actions based on these conditions.

Overall, the flowchart is used to visually represent the logical steps involved in a credit scoring system, emphasizing decision-making points, process flow, and error handling through delay reports.
