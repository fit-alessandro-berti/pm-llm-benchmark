Based on the provided directly follows graph and the associated frequencies and durations, here are some process and data-specific considerations that could be root causes for performance issues:

1. **Long durations in loops and self-loops:**
   - **Container: "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay"** (1794 events, duration = 743380.51)
   - **Vehicle: "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles"** (585 events, duration = 295965.56)
   - **Forklift: "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock"** (23 events, duration = 469.57)

   These long durations in loops and self-loops suggest that there might be inefficiencies or delays in these steps, leading to overall process delays.

2. **High frequency of certain events with long durations:**
   - **Container: "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container"** (1995 events, duration = 368943.92)
   - **Transport Document: "Depart" -> "Depart"** (142 events, duration = 1051301.41)

   The high frequency of these events with long durations indicates that these steps might be bottlenecks in the process, causing delays for other steps and objects.

3. **Low frequency of certain events with high durations:**
   - **Forklift: "Weigh" -> "Weigh"** (1 event, duration = 219774.00)
   - **Transport Document: "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container"** (2 events, duration = 8635.50)

   While the frequency is low, the high durations suggest that when these events occur, they significantly impact the process performance.

4. **Imbalanced resource utilization:**
   - **Truck: "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"** (6 objects, duration = 5259.71)
   - **Container: "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"** (1896 objects, duration = 5259.71)

   The significant difference in the number of objects for the same event type suggests that resources might be underutilized or overutilized, leading to inefficiencies.

5. **Data inconsistencies or inaccuracies:**
   - **Handling Unit: "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"** (10553 events, 10553 objects)
   - **Truck: "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal"** (1989 events, 6 objects)

   The discrepancy in the number of events and objects for the same event type might indicate data inconsistencies or inaccuracies, which could affect process performance analysis and improvement.

To address these root causes, consider investigating the reasons behind the long durations, high frequencies with long durations, and data inconsistencies. This might involve analyzing resource allocation, process flows, data accuracy, and other factors specific to the process.
