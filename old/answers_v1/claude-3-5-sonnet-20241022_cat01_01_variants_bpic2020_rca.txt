Based on the process variants provided, here are the key process-specific performance issues:

1. Rejections by ADMINISTRATION cause significant delays:
- Variants with ADMINISTRATION rejections show much higher performance times (e.g., 2,542,497 vs 810,187 for the happy path)
- Multiple rejection cycles by ADMINISTRATION create the longest process variants
- The simple rejection by ADMINISTRATION has an extremely high performance time (13,805,869)

2. Budget Owner involvement increases processing time:
- Variants including BUDGET OWNER approval consistently show higher performance times compared to similar variants without it
- The basic path with BUDGET OWNER takes 1,084,338 vs 810,187 without it

3. Multiple submission cycles:
- Each additional submission cycle after rejection adds significant time
- Cases with 3 or more submission attempts show the highest performance times (e.g., 3,502,608 for a variant with 4 submission attempts)

4. Missing status handling:
- Variants with "REJECTED by MISSING" status show unusually high performance times
- The variant with PRE_APPROVER and "REJECTED by MISSING" shows one of the highest performance times (4,922,455)

5. Complex approval chains:
- The more approvers involved (PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR), the longer the process takes
- The shortest performing complete variants are those with direct SUPERVISOR approval (854,633)

These issues suggest problems with the initial quality of submissions, coordination between approval layers, and possibly unclear approval criteria leading to multiple rejection cycles.
