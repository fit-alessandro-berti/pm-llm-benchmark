Analyzing the provided Log Skeleton process model involves reviewing the constraints to identify potential anomalies. Here are some possible issues:

1. **Equivalence Conflicts**: Certain equivalence constraints might lead to complications if they're tightly interlinked without clear paths. For instance, if 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' is equivalent to both 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER', it raises questions about the workflow paths if both outcomes can simultaneously take place within a single case. The model should clarify if these can indeed occur independently.

2. **Contradictions in Never Together**: The 'Never Together' constraints suggest that certain activities cannot co-exist. For instance, 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' both having strict separation can lead to contradictions in cases where the supervisor plays a pivotal role in approvals and rejections. While theoretically sound, the practical workflow might not adhere strictly to this.

3. **Activity Occurrences with Excessive Range**: Some activities allow a broad range of occurrences, especially for rejections and approvals. For example, 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' allows between 0 to 6 occurrences; this could lead to overly complex or contradictory states and may violate other constraints like Always Before or Always After if not managed properly.

4. **Directly-Follows Constraints**: A 'Directly-Follows' constraint linking 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' with subsequent actions suggests immediacy in the process. However, in conjunction with both 'Never Together' constraints and 'Always Before' constraints, these can create potential deadlocks or incomplete transaction pathways.

5. **Cascade Effects of Always After**: The 'Always After' constraints imply certain activities must happen after others, yet if these activities also feature in other conflicting constraints (like 'Never Together'), this may create scenarios where the workflow breaks down or doesn't provide a valid execution path.

6. **Activity Evolution Dynamics**: The process shows several activities that can represent states of approval or rejection (e.g., multiple rejections by different stakeholders). The model does not clarify the hierarchical dynamics or authority levels clearly, which can disrupt the coherent flow of the process.

7. **Multiple Approvals**: Activities like 'Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER' alongside 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' can potentially coexist in an ambiguous manner, leading to uncertainty about the approval process. This can result in contradictory interpretations of which declaration carries more weight.

8. **Unclear Boundaries for Re-work**: The 'SAVED by EMPLOYEE' and 'SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' activities alongside their associated constraints suggest an allowed iterative process. However, the model does not clearly allow for processes of reworking declarations in a defined manner, possibly leading to confusion about state progression.

To fix these anomalies, clarifications about the nature of the activities, the hierarchy of approvals and rejections, and establishment of stricter correlations between activities are needed. Streamlining the allowed occurrences per activity and ensuring that conflicting constraints are resolved through additional rules could further solidify the integrity of the process model.
