Decomposition strategies are an essential approach in large-scale process mining projects to handle the complexity of the data. The main benefits of decomposition strategies include:

1. Simplification of process mining tasks: By breaking down a large process into smaller subprocesses, decomposition strategies simplify the process mining task, making it easier to identify patterns and anomalies in the data.

2. Improved accuracy: Decomposition strategies can help to reduce noise and improve the accuracy of the process mining results. By focusing on smaller subprocesses, it is easier to identify patterns that may be obscured in the larger process.

3. Increased efficiency: Decomposition strategies can help to reduce the computational resources required to perform process mining tasks, making it possible to analyze larger datasets in a more efficient manner.

The main challenges of applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects include:

1. Difficulty in choosing the right decomposition strategy: There are many different decomposition strategies, and choosing the right one can be challenging. A poorly chosen decomposition strategy can lead to inaccurate results or the loss of important information.

2. Difficulty in merging subprocesses: Once subprocesses have been identified, they need to be merged back into the larger process. This can be challenging, as it requires careful consideration of the relationships between the subprocesses.

3. Complexity of the data: Large-scale process mining projects often involve complex data, which can make it difficult to identify meaningful subprocesses. This can lead to inaccurate results or the loss of important information.

Overall, decomposition strategies offer significant benefits in large-scale process mining projects, but they also present challenges that need to be carefully considered.
