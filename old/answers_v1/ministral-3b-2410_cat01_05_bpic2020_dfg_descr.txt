Based on the provided data, the process can be described as follows:

1. **Declaration Submitted**: The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration. This can be approved by the pre-approver, administration, or budget owner.

2. **Approval Paths**:
   - If approved, the declaration can proceed to be reviewed by the pre-approver, administration, or budget owner, and then finally by the supervisor. The supervisor can approve or reject the declaration.
   - If rejected by any of these steps, the process can either go back to the employee for resubmission or end without further action.

3. **Request Payment**:
   - Once a declaration is finalized (approved by the supervisor), a request for payment is initiated.
   - The payment can then be handled, leading to the final approval and payment.

4. **Rejection**:
   - Declarations can also be rejected at various stages (employee, administration, supervisor, pre-approver, or budget owner).
   - Rejected declarations can either be sent back to the employee for resubmission or end the process.

5. **Special Cases**:
   - Some declarations can go through specific approvals (e.g., "FOR_APPROVAL" by supervisor, pre-approver, or administration).
   - Declarations can also be "SAVED" by the employee without any further action.

Here's a summarized version of the flow:

```
Employee -> Submission
          -> Approval by Pre-approver -> Final Approval by Supervisor -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
          -> Approval by Administration -> Final Approval by Supervisor -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
          -> Approval by Budget Owner -> Final Approval by Supervisor -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled
          -> Rejection by Employee -> Submission
          -> Rejection by Administration -> Rejection by Employee
          -> Rejection by Pre-approver -> Rejection by Employee
          -> Rejection by Supervisor -> Rejection by Employee
          -> Rejection by Budget Owner -> Rejection by Employee
          -> FOR_APPROVAL by Supervisor -> Final Approval by Supervisor
          -> FOR_APPROVAL by Pre-approver -> Final Approval by Supervisor
          -> FOR_APPROVAL by Administration -> Rejection by Employee
          -> SAVED by Employee -> Request Payment
          -> Rejection by Supervisor -> Request Payment
          -> Rejection by Pre-approver -> Rejection by Employee
          -> Rejection by Budget Owner -> Rejection by Employee
          -> Rejection by Missing -> Submission
```

This process ensures that declarations are thoroughly reviewed and approved before payment is handled, with the option to reject and resubmit at various stages.
