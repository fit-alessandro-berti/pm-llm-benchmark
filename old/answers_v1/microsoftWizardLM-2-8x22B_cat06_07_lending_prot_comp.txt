 To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups in the loan application process, we need to compare their experiences based on the process variants and their execution times. Here are some key observations:

1. **Rejection Rates**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of "Application Rejected" (960 times) compared to the unprotected group (664 times), despite the unprotected group having a higher overall number of process instances. This could indicate a potential bias against the protected group.
   - The performance (execution time) for the "Application Rejected" variant is also faster for the protected group (219999.156) compared to the unprotected group (260002.042), which might suggest a quicker rejection process for the protected group.

2. **Appointment Denials**:
   - The protected group has fewer "Appointment Denied" instances (599) compared to the unprotected group (363). However, the execution time for this variant is much faster for the protected group (90000.623) than for the unprotected group (80001.088), possibly indicating a more efficient, but potentially harsher, initial screening process for the protected group.

3. **Loan Denial After Underwriting**:
   - Both groups have variants where the loan is denied after the file is submitted to the underwriter. The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of this variant (2709) compared to the protected group's most similar variant (229). This suggests that the unprotected group experiences a higher rate of denial at this stage.
   - The execution times for these variants are relatively similar (330021.590 for protected vs. 340005.309 for unprotected), but the higher frequency for the unprotected group could indicate a systemic issue at the underwriting stage.

4. **Co-Signer Requests**:
   - The protected group appears to have more instances where a co-signer is requested before the loan is denied (e.g., 217 instances of "Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied"). This suggests an additional barrier for the protected group.
   - The unprotected group has fewer instances of co-signer requests leading to denial, and when they do occur, the execution times are similar to those of the protected group.

5. **Skipped Examination**:
   - The unprotected group has a variant where the "skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" occurs with a relatively high frequency (332). This variant is not present in the protected group's list. This could indicate a favorable treatment or a less stringent process for the unprotected group.

6. **Multiple Visits to Assess Collateral**:
   - Both groups have instances where multiple visits are made to assess collateral. However, the protected group has more variants with three or more visits before the loan is denied or approved, which could indicate additional scrutiny or barriers for the protected group.

7. **Loan Agreement Signing**:
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of the variant leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" after fewer steps compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group is more successful in obtaining loans.

8. **Performance Times**:
   - The performance times (execution times) for similar variants are generally comparable between the two groups. However, the differences in frequencies of certain steps, such as the higher rate of rejections and co-signer requests for the protected group, are concerning and may indicate systemic biases.

In summary, the main differences that could point towards unfair treatment include higher rejection rates, more frequent requests for co-signers, and additional bureaucratic steps (like multiple visits to assess collateral) for the protected group. Additionally, the presence of a "skipped_examination" variant leading directly to loan agreement signing exclusively for the unprotected group suggests a potential advantage. These differences merit further investigation to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all applicants.
