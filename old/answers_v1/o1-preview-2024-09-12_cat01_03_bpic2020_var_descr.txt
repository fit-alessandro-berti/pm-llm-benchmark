Yes, I can describe the process underlying the data you've provided.

**Overview of the Process:**

The data represents a multi-level approval workflow for declarations (likely expense reports, reimbursement requests, or similar financial documents). The process involves several roles and steps, and it includes paths for both straightforward approvals and scenarios where declarations are rejected and resubmitted.

**Key Roles Involved:**

1. **EMPLOYEE**: The individual submitting the declaration.
2. **ADMINISTRATION**: The department responsible for initial review and approval.
3. **PRE_APPROVER**: An optional role that may review the declaration before administration.
4. **BUDGET OWNER**: The person responsible for budgetary oversight, involved in certain cases.
5. **SUPERVISOR**: Provides the final approval before payment is processed.
6. **MISSING**: Occurs in some cases, possibly indicating an unidentified or system-generated rejection.

**Core Process Steps:**

1. **Declaration Creation and Submission:**
   - The **EMPLOYEE** creates a declaration, which may be saved initially (as seen in "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE").
   - The **EMPLOYEE** submits the declaration ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE") to initiate the approval process.

2. **Approval Workflow:**
   - **Initial Approval**:
     - The declaration is reviewed by one or more of the following:
       - **ADMINISTRATION** ("Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" or "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION").
       - **PRE_APPROVER** ("Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" or "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER").
   - **Budget Approval (Conditional)**:
     - For declarations that require budget oversight, the **BUDGET OWNER** reviews the declaration ("Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" or "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER").
   - **Final Approval**:
     - The declaration is reviewed by the **SUPERVISOR** ("Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" or "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"), who provides the final authorization before payment processing.

3. **Handling Rejections:**
   - If any approver **rejects** the declaration, it is sent back to the **EMPLOYEE** ("Declaration REJECTED by [Role]" followed by "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE").
   - The **EMPLOYEE** can then make necessary corrections and **resubmit** the declaration ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"), restarting the approval process.
   - This loop can happen multiple times if the declaration continues to be rejected at different stages.

4. **Payment Processing:**
   - Once the declaration has received all necessary approvals, the **EMPLOYEE** may need to **request payment** ("Request Payment"), after which the payment is handled ("Payment Handled").
   - In some cases, the payment handling occurs immediately after final approval without an explicit payment request.

**Variations and Frequencies:**

- The most common path (frequency = 4,618) involves the declaration being approved by **ADMINISTRATION** and then **FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** before payment.
- The next common variation (frequency = 2,473) includes an additional approval by the **BUDGET OWNER** after **ADMINISTRATION** approval.
- In some cases (frequency = 1,392), the declaration goes directly to the **SUPERVISOR** for final approval, bypassing other approvals.
- Rejections can occur at any approval stage, resulting in the declaration being sent back to the **EMPLOYEE** for revision and resubmission.
- There are instances where multiple rejections and resubmissions occur, indicating more complex cases or issues with the declaration.

**Special Cases:**

- **MISSING Role**: Occurs in some rejection events ("Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"), possibly indicating a system error or undefined role in the process.
- **SAVED Declarations**: Some declarations are saved but not immediately submitted (frequency = 134), suggesting that employees can save drafts before final submission.
- **Direct Payment Handling**: A few cases show the payment being handled directly after final approval without a separate payment request step.

**Conclusion:**

The underlying process is a structured approval workflow designed to ensure that declarations are thoroughly reviewed by the necessary parties before any payments are made. It includes mechanisms for handling rejections and corrections, and the approval path can vary depending on the declaration's specifics (e.g., amount, type, departmental policies). The process aims to balance efficiency (by allowing some declarations to skip certain approvals) with control (by involving additional approvers like the **BUDGET OWNER** when necessary).
