Based on the provided declarative process model constraints, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Declaration and Payment Handling

**Actors:**
1. Employee
2. Supervisor
3. Pre-Approver
4. Administration
5. Budget Owner
6. Missing (unknown role)

**Process Steps:**

1. **Initialization:** The process begins with the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. This is the initial activity that starts the process.

2. **Declaration Review and Approval:**
   - The submitted declaration is reviewed and can be in one of the following states:
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER' (absent in the model)
     - 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' (absent in the model)
   - The only mandatory final state for the declaration is 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.

3. **Payment Handling:**
   - After the declaration is final-approved by the supervisor, a 'Request Payment' activity occurs.
   - The 'Payment Handled' activity follows the 'Request Payment' activity, indicating that the payment has been processed.

4. **Constraints and Relationships:**
   - The activities 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled' must occur exactly once in the process.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur in the future of the trace (Response constraint).
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur in the future of the trace (Response constraint).
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur in the future of the trace (Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Request Payment' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Payment Handled' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Request Payment' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Payment Handled' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' must alternate without repetitions (Alternate Response constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must precede 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must precede 'Payment Handled' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must precede 'Request Payment' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must precede 'Payment Handled' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must precede 'Request Payment' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Request Payment' must precede 'Payment Handled' (Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must directly follow 'Request Payment' (Chain Precedence constraint).
   - 'Request Payment' must directly follow 'Payment Handled' (Chain Precedence constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled' must occur in the given order (Succession constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled' must occur in the given order without repetitions (Alternate Succession constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Request Payment' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Payment Handled' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Request Payment' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Payment Handled' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).
   - 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' must co-occur (Co-Existence constraint).

In summary, the process involves an employee submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved by a supervisor. After the declaration is final-approved, a payment request is made, and the payment is handled. The process has several constraints ensuring the correct order and relationships between activities.
