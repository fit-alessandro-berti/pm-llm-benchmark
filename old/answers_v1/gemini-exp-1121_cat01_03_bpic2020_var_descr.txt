Based on the provided process variants, here's a description of the underlying process, including its main activities, possible paths, and key characteristics:

**Process Name:** Declaration Processing and Payment

**Overall Goal:**  To process employee declarations, obtain necessary approvals, and ultimately issue payment.

**Main Activities:**

*   **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:**  The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration.
*   **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE:**  A declaration can be saved without being submitted.
*   **Declaration APPROVED/REJECTED by [Role]:** The declaration goes through an approval process involving different roles:
    *   **ADMINISTRATION:**  Likely an initial administrative check.
    *   **SUPERVISOR:**  Final approval authority.
    *   **BUDGET OWNER:**  Approval related to budget allocation.
    *   **PRE\_APPROVER:** An optional pre-approval step before the supervisor.
    *   **MISSING:**  Indicates a rejection due to missing information.
*   **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE:** When a declaration is rejected in a previous step, it is sent back to the employee, who can modify it or cancel it.
*   **Request Payment:** Once all approvals are obtained, a payment request is initiated.
*   **Payment Handled:** The final step, indicating the payment has been processed.

**Process Paths and Variations:**

The process exhibits significant variability, with multiple possible paths:

*   **Happy Path (Most Frequent):**  `SUBMITTED` -> `APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` -> `FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`
*   **Budget Approval Path:**  `SUBMITTED` -> `APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION` -> `APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` -> `FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`
*   **Simplified Path (No Admin Approval):**  `SUBMITTED` -> `FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`
*   **Pre-Approval Path:** `SUBMITTED` -> `APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER` -> `FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`
*   **Rejection and Resubmission Paths:** Several variants involve rejections at different stages (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE\_APPROVER, MISSING), followed by the EMPLOYEE resubmitting the declaration. These paths can include multiple iterations of rejection and resubmission.
*   **Direct Rejection:** In some cases, the declaration is rejected without payment (`REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION` or `FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `REJECTED by MISSING`).
*   **Saving:** Some declarations are only saved and not submitted.
*   **Payment without Request:** Some declarations are paid without a request (`FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Payment Handled`).

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Multiple Approval Levels:**  The process involves multiple levels of approval, indicating a need for checks and balances.
*   **Rework and Iteration:**  The presence of many rejection and resubmission paths highlights the iterative nature of the process and the potential for rework.
*   **Variability:** The process shows high variability, with different paths taken depending on the declaration's characteristics and organizational rules.
*   **Performance Differences:**  The performance data (likely in milliseconds or a similar time unit) reveals significant differences in processing time between different paths. Rework loops and budget owner approvals seem to increase the processing time.

**Potential Issues and Areas for Improvement:**

*   **High Rework:** The numerous rejection/resubmission cycles suggest potential inefficiencies in the initial declaration submission or approval criteria. Analyzing the reasons for rejection could identify areas for improvement, such as better training for employees or clearer guidelines.
*   **Process Complexity:**  The numerous variants might indicate an overly complex process. Simplifying the process, where possible, could improve efficiency and reduce errors.
*   **Bottlenecks:**  Analyzing the performance data could help pinpoint bottlenecks in the process, particularly around budget owner approvals and rework loops.

**In summary,** the process is a multi-step declaration processing and payment system with multiple approval levels, a significant degree of variability, and potential for rework. Analyzing the different paths and performance metrics can provide valuable insights for process optimization and improvement.
