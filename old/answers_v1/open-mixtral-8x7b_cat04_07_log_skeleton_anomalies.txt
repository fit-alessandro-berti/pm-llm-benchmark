Based on the declarative constraints provided, there are a few potential anomalies in the proposed process model:

1. Equivalence constraints: There are several equivalence constraints defined that may not make practical sense or may represent redundant constraints in the model. For example, the equivalence constraint between "Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" and "Request Payment" implies that every time the declaration is forwarded for approval by the administration, a payment request must be made, which may not always be the case. Similarly, there are equivalence constraints defined between approval and rejection activities, which may not be logical.

2. Always Before constraints: There are two "Always Before" constraints defined between "Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by [SOMEONE]" and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activities. However, it is not possible for a declaration to be approved before it is submitted, so these constraints may represent modeling errors.

3. Always After constraints: There are several "Always After" constraints defined that may not make practical sense or may not accurately represent the process flow. For example, the constraint between "Payment Handled" and "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" implies that a payment can only be handled after an employee has rejected a declaration, which may not always be the case. Similarly, there are constraints defined between approval and rejection activities, which may not be logical.

4. Never Together constraints: Some of the "Never Together" constraints defined may not make practical sense or may not accurately represent the process flow. For example, the constraint between "Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" and "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" implies that a declaration cannot be approved by a supervisor and rejected by an administrator in the same process instance. However, this may be a valid scenario depending on the business context.

5. Activity Occurrences constraints: Some of the activity occurrences constraints defined may not make practical sense or may not accurately represent the process flow. For example, the constraint for "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" allows for up to 7 occurrences, which may not be a realistic limit depending on the business context. Similarly, the constraint for "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" allows for up to 3 occurrences, which may not make practical sense if the "MISSING" role is not a valid role in the process.

6. Directly-Follows constraints: Some of the directly-follows constraints defined may not make practical sense or may not accurately represent the process flow. For example, the constraint between "Declaration FOR\_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" implies that the declaration must be submitted by the employee immediately after it is approved by the administration, which may not always be the case. Similarly, there are constraints defined between approval and rejection activities, which may not be logical.

Overall, the proposed process model may contain several anomalies that may need to be reviewed and corrected to accurately represent the business process.
