Analyzing the provided process variants, I'll identify potential root causes for performance issues specific to the process and data:

1. **Looping and rework**: Variants with high frequencies and performance times often involve rejects and resubmissions, leading to additional processing steps. This suggests that reducing errors and improving quality control during the initial submission could minimize rework and associated delays.
2. **Multiple approvals and stakeholders**: Variants with more approval steps (e.g., involving Administration, Budget Owner, and Supervisor) tend to have longer performance times. Streamlining approval processes or reducing the number of stakeholders involved might help reduce processing times.
3. **Missing or incorrect information**: The presence of "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" and "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" suggests that missing or incorrect information is a common issue. Implementing better data validation and verification mechanisms could help reduce errors and rejections.
4. **Overly complex approval chains**: Variants with complex approval chains (e.g., involving multiple rejects and resubmissions) tend to have longer performance times. Simplifying these chains or introducing more flexible approval workflows might help reduce processing times.
5. **Lack of parallel processing**: The data suggests that many approval steps are sequential, leading to longer overall processing times. Introducing parallel processing or concurrent approval steps could help reduce processing times.

Some specific examples to illustrate these points:

* Variant `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a high frequency (345) and performance time (1604595.638). Reducing errors and improving quality control during the initial submission could minimize rework and associated delays.
* Variant `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` has a long performance time (2061236.516) due to multiple approval steps and rejections. Streamlining approval processes or reducing the number of stakeholders involved might help reduce processing times.

To further analyze and address performance issues, I would recommend:

1. **Create a process map**: Visualize the entire process to better understand the approval chains, decision points, and potential bottlenecks.
2. **Identify and prioritize improvements**: Based on the analysis, prioritize process improvements that can have the most significant impact on reducing performance times and errors.
3. **Implement data validation and verification mechanisms**: Introduce better data validation and verification mechanisms to reduce errors and rejections.
4. **Streamline approval processes**: Simplify approval chains and reduce the number of stakeholders involved to minimize processing times.
5. **Monitor and evaluate**: Continuously monitor the process and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented improvements to identify further areas for optimization.
