Sure, here's an example of a log skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'),
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'),
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'),
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Pay Invoice'),
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Create Purchase Order'),
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Approve Purchase Order'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Goods Receipt'),
        ('Pay Invoice', 'Invoice Receipt'),
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice')
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {0, 1},
        'Approve Purchase Order': {1, 2},
        'Goods Receipt': {1, 2},
        'Invoice Receipt': {1, 2},
        'Pay Invoice': {1},
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order'),
        ('Approve Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'),
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Pay Invoice'),
    }
}
```

In this hypothetical log skeleton model:

- The creation and approval of a purchase order are equivalent, as are the receipt of goods and the invoice receipt.
- The creation of a purchase order always occurs before the approval of the purchase order, and this is followed by the goods receipt, followed by the invoice receipt and finally the payment of the invoice.
- The approval of a purchase order always occurs after the creation of the purchase order, and is followed by the goods receipt, the invoice receipt, and the payment of the invoice.
- The approval of a purchase order and the payment of the invoice never happen in the same case concurrently.
- The frequency of the activities is such that the creation of a purchase order occurs 0 or 1 time(s), the approval of a purchase order occurs 1 or 2 time(s), the goods receipt occurs 1 or 2 time(s), the invoice receipt occurs 1 or 2 time(s), and the payment of the invoice occurs once.
- The approval of a purchase order directly follows the creation of a purchase order, then the approval of a purchase order is directly followed by the goods receipt, which is then directly followed by the invoice receipt, which is directly followed by the payment of the invoice.
