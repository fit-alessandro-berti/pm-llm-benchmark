In the context of process mining and fairness analysis, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially introduce bias or unfairness in the process outcomes. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics or other factors that should not influence the process outcomes but might do so due to underlying biases.

From the provided attributes, the following are typically considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen (True) or not (False). Citizenship status can be a sensitive attribute because it might lead to differential treatment based on nationality or immigration status.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual (True or False). Gender is a sensitive attribute because it can lead to biases in treatment, diagnosis, and other process outcomes.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is German-speaking (True) or not (False). Language can be a sensitive attribute because it might affect communication and, consequently, the quality of care or treatment.

4. **case:private_insurance**: This attribute indicates whether the individual has private insurance (True) or not (False). Insurance status can be a sensitive attribute because it might influence the quality and speed of care received.

5. **case:underlying_condition**: This attribute indicates whether the individual has an underlying condition (True) or not (False). While this is a medical attribute, it can be sensitive because it might lead to differential treatment or outcomes based on pre-existing conditions.

These attributes are sensitive because they can influence the process outcomes in ways that might be considered unfair or biased. For example, if individuals with private insurance receive better or faster treatment than those without, this could be seen as unfair. Similarly, if gender or citizenship status affects the diagnosis or treatment process, it could indicate bias.

To ensure fairness, it is important to analyze the process outcomes with respect to these sensitive attributes and identify any potential biases or disparities. This can involve comparing the performance metrics (such as frequency and performance) across different groups defined by these attributes.
