Below is a Python code example that implements a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) models with `pm4py`. This P2P process includes common steps found in many procurement workflows, though specifics can vary by organization. The modeled process here includes:

1. **Purchase Request**: A user requests a purchase.
2. **Approval Loop**:
   - **Approve**: The request is approved.
   - **Reject**: The request is rejected, leading back to a revision of the purchase request (loop).
3. **Exclusive Choice after Approval**:
   - **Direct Purchase**: If the item is off-contract or under a certain threshold, proceed directly to payment.
   - **Tendering Process**: Otherwise, initiate a tendering process.
4. **Tendering Process Sequence**:
   - **Publish Tender**
   - **Evaluate Bids**
   - **Select Supplier**
5. **Payment** (common outcome for both direct purchase and after tendering)

Here's how you might model this using POWL in `pm4py`:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities as Transitions (or SilentTransitions if needed)
purchase_request = Transition(label="Purchase Request")
approve = Transition(label="Approve")
reject = Transition(label="Reject")
direct_purchase = Transition(label="Direct Purchase")
publish_tender = Transition(label="Publish Tender")
evaluate_bids = Transition(label="Evaluate Bids")
select_supplier = Transition(label="Select Supplier")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")
skip = SilentTransition()  # Not used in this example, but shown for completeness

# Approval Loop
approval_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[purchase_request, 
                                                                OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approve, reject])])

# Tendering Process Sequence
tendering_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[publish_tender, evaluate_bids, select_supplier])
tendering_process.order.add_edge(publish_tender, evaluate_bids)
tendering_process.order.add_edge(evaluate_bids, select_supplier)

# Exclusive Choice after Approval (Direct Purchase vs. Tendering Process followed by Payment)
post_approval_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    direct_purchase,
    StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[tendering_process, payment], order Relations=[(tendering_process, payment)])
])

# Connecting the Approval Loop to the Post-Approval Choice
approval_to_outcome = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[approval_loop, post_approval_choice])
approval_to_outcome.order.add_edge(approval_loop, post_approval_choice)

# Final Model: Adding Payment as a Common Outcome (Already handled within post_approval_choice for clarity)
final_model = approval_to_outcome

# For visualization or further analysis with pm4py, you might use:
# net, initial_marking, final_marking = pm4py.convert_TO_PETRI_NET(final_model)  # Note: This step may require adjustments based on the specific POWL to Petri Net conversion capabilities in your version of pm4py
# pm4py.visualization(net, initial_marking, final_marking)
```

**Important Considerations:**

1. **Visualization and Conversion**: The example above directly constructs a POWL model. For visualization or analysis that requires a Petri Net (e.g., reachability graph analysis), you would typically convert the POWL model to a Petri Net using `pm4py.convert_TO_PETRI_NET()`. However, this conversion is not explicitly covered in the provided code snippet due to potential version-specific differences in `pm4py`'s handling of POWL models.

2. **Dependency Version**: Ensure you're running the latest version of `pm4py` or at least a version that supports POWL models and their conversions as described.

3. **Customization**: This is a simplified example based on hypothetical requirements. Real-world Purchase-to-Pay processes may involve additional steps, conditional dependencies, or more complex loops and choices, which can be integrated into the model using the provided `pm4py` constructs.
