I'm going to try to identify the root causes of performance issues in this process based on the provided directly follows graph for different object types. I'll focus on specific aspects of the process and data, avoiding general considerations.

First, I need to understand the flow of activities across different object types and identify bottlenecks or areas where durations are unusually high.

Starting with the **Handling Unit** object type:

- "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck" has a high frequency (10,553 events) and a duration of about 7,821 units. This seems significant, but without context on what the units are (e.g., seconds, minutes), it's hard to judge. Assuming these units are in seconds, this would be around 130 minutes per handling unit, which might be too long.

Moving to **Truck**:

- "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" has a frequency of 8,559 events with a duration of about 5,259 units. Again, assuming seconds, that's around 87.6 minutes per cycle. This might indicate that trucks are being loaded multiple times, possibly inefficiently.

- "Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal" has a frequency of 1,989 events with a duration of about 10,999 units (around 183 minutes). This seems excessively long for driving to a terminal.

- "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" has a frequency of 1,988 events with a duration of about 84,119 units (around 1,402 minutes or 23.4 hours). This suggests that after driving to the terminal, there's a long wait before loading another truck, which could be a significant bottleneck.

Looking at **Container**:

- There are multiple activities involving "Load Truck," "Drive to Terminal," "Weigh," "Place in Stock," "Bring to Loading Bay," etc. The durations vary widely, with some activities taking very long times, such as "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" with a duration of about 368,944 units, which is over 6,149 minutes or nearly 103 hours.

This suggests that ordering empty containers takes a considerable amount of time, which could be a major contributor to performance issues.

In **Vehicle**:

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" has a frequency of 585 events with a duration of about 295,965 units, which is over 4,932 minutes or 82 hours. This indicates that booking vehicles is a time-consuming process, possibly due to high demand or inefficient booking procedures.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle" has a frequency of 122 events with a duration of about 283,101 units, around 4,718 minutes or 78.6 hours. This also suggests a long wait time between booking vehicles and loading them.

In **Forklift**:

- Activities like "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" have frequencies in the thousands but relatively shorter durations, which seems manageable. However, some activities have very high durations, such as "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" with about 112,600 units, around 1,877 minutes or 31.3 hours.

This indicates potential inefficiencies in moving containers from stock to the loading bay.

In **Customer Order**:

- "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" has a frequency of 594 events with a duration of about 329,005 units, around 5,483 minutes or 91.4 hours. This suggests that processing customer orders to creating transport documents takes a long time, which could be a bottleneck in the overall process.

In **Transport Document**:

- "Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles" has a frequency of 594 events with a duration of about 22,207 units, around 370 minutes or 6.17 hours. This seems reasonable.

- "Book Vehicles" -> "Order Empty Containers" has a frequency of 593 events with a duration of about 43,935 units, around 732 minutes or 12.2 hours. This is a significant amount of time between booking vehicles and ordering empty containers.

- "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" has a frequency of 561 events with a duration of about 1,007,066 units, around 16,784 minutes or 279.7 hours (over 11 days). This is an extremely long duration, suggesting a major delay in the process.

- "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" has a frequency of 21 events with a duration of about 255,614 units, around 4,260 minutes or 71 hours. This also indicates long rescheduling times after departure.

Based on this analysis, several root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. **Long waiting times for trucks and vehicles:** The duration from "Drive to Terminal" back to "Load Truck" is over 23 hours, indicating potential inefficiencies in terminal operations or scheduling.

2. **Extended durations in ordering and picking up empty containers:** The "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" activity takes nearly 103 hours, which is a significant portion of the overall process time.

3. **Inefficient vehicle booking process:** The "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" loop and the "Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle" activities have durations of over 82 and 78 hours, respectively, suggesting bottlenecks in vehicle allocation and preparation.

4. **Delays in processing customer orders and creating transport documents:** The "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" activity takes over 91 hours, which may be too long and could be improved.

5. **Significant time gaps between ordering containers and departing:** The "Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart" activity spans over 11 days, which is likely too long and needs optimization.

6. **Long rescheduling times:** Activities involving "Reschedule Container" have durations ranging from several hours to over 275 hours, indicating issues in handling exceptions or changes in the process.

To address these issues, the following specific actions could be considered:

- **Optimize terminal operations:** Reduce the time trucks spend at the terminal before being loaded again by improving scheduling and coordination.

- **Streamline container ordering and pickup:** Find ways to reduce the time it takes to order and pick up empty containers, possibly by improving forecasting, pre-ordering based on demand, or optimizing logistics for container delivery.

- **Improve vehicle booking and allocation:** Enhance the vehicle booking process to reduce waiting times between booking and loading. This could involve better planning, real-time tracking, or more efficient allocation algorithms.

- **Accelerate customer order processing:** Streamline the process from registering a customer order to creating a transport document to reduce the turnaround time, possibly through process automation or improving coordination between departments.

- **Enhance coordination between ordering containers and vehicle departure:** Ensure that container ordering aligns with vehicle departure schedules to minimize delays. This might require better integration between different parts of the logistics process.

- **Improve rescheduling processes:** Streamline the rescheduling of containers to reduce the time taken for these activities, possibly by identifying common causes of rescheduling and addressing them proactively.

By focusing on these specific areas, the overall performance of the process can be improved, leading to faster turnaround times and increased efficiency.
