Based on the process variants you provided, here are some main anomalies:

1. Process Variants with High Frequency:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 9520, performance = 35037723.025)"
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment (frequency = 3736, performance = 27487271.949)"
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Payment -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 3301, performance = 22266910.633)"

   These process variants have high frequencies, indicating that they are common or occur often.

2. Process Variants with Low Performance:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment (frequency = 56482, performance = 10147598.595)"
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 9520, performance = 35037723.025)"

   These process variants have low performance values, suggesting that they take a long time to complete or produce low-quality results.

3. Process Variants with Different Insertion Sequences:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 9520, performance = 35037723.025)"
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Payment -> Add penalty -> Payment (frequency = 3736, performance = 27487271.949)"

   These process variants have different insertion sequences for the "Add penalty" and "Payment" steps.

4. Process Variants with Different Steps:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment (frequency = 56482, performance = 10147598.595)"
   - "Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine (frequency = 20385, performance = 8380516.026)"

   These process variants have different steps in the process sequence, such as "Send Fine" being inserted between "Create Fine" and "Payment" in one variant.

5. Process Variants with Different Insertion Points:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture (frequency = 443, performance = 39950735.892)"
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment (frequency = 3736, performance = 27487271.949)"

   These process variants have different insertion points within the process sequence, such as "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" being inserted between "Send Fine" and "Insert Fine Notification" in one variant.
