Certainly! Let's design a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (PTP) process tree using the `pm4py` library. Here's how we can structure this process:

1. **Create Purchase Order** - This is a sequence of selecting a supplier, creating the PO, and approving it.
2. **Order Goods** - After the PO is approved, goods are ordered from the supplier.
3. **Receive Goods** - Goods are received, which can be done concurrently with the payment process or independently.
4. **Payment** - This involves invoice verification, payment initiation, and finally payment confirmation.

Here's the Python code to implement this process tree:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root node of the process tree for Purchase-to-Pay
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Create Purchase Order Subprocess
create_po = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
select_supplier = ProcessTree(label="Select Supplier", parent=create_po)
create_po.children.append(select_supplier)
create_purchase_order = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=create_po)
create_po.children.append(create_purchase_order)
approve_po = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Order", parent=create_po)
create_po.children.append(approve_po)
root.children.append(create_po)

# Order Goods
order_goods = ProcessTree(label="Order Goods", parent=root)
root.children.append(order_goods)

# Goods Receipt and Payment can happen in parallel
parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)

# Goods Receipt
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=parallel)
parallel.children.append(receive_goods)

# Payment Process
payment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=parallel)
verify_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Verify Invoice", parent=payment)
payment.children.append(verify_invoice)
initiate_payment = ProcessTree(label="Initiate Payment", parent=payment)
payment.children.append(initiate_payment)
confirm_payment = ProcessTree(label="Confirm Payment", parent=payment)
payment.children.append(confirm_payment)
parallel.children.append(payment)

root.children.append(parallel)

# Optional: Add a loop for invoice correction if necessary (not included in main flow)
# loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=payment)
# correct_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Correct Invoice", parent=loop)
# loop.children.append(correct_invoice)
# payment.children.append(loop)

# Print out the structure or visualize it if needed
print(f"Root operator: {root.operator}")
for child in root.children:
    if child.operator:
        print(f"  - Child operator: {child.operator}")
        for sub_child in child.children:
            if sub_child.label:
                print(f"    - {sub_child.label}")
```

This code constructs a process tree for a Purchase-to-Pay process where:

- A Purchase Order is created, approved, and then goods are ordered.
- Receiving goods and the payment process can happen concurrently.
- The payment process itself involves verifying the invoice, initiating payment, and confirming payment.

Note:
- The `parent` attribute is set for each node to maintain the tree structure.
- The `children` list is appended to connect nodes in a hierarchical manner.
- There's an optional loop for invoice correction which I've left commented out but can be included if needed for handling discrepancies or issues with the invoice.
