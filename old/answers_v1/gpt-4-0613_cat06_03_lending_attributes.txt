The attributes that could be considered sensitive for fairness are 'case:citizen', 'case:gender', and 'case:german speaking'. These attributes are often associated with demographic distinctions among individuals, particularly around aspects such as citizenship status, gender, and language spoken. The use of these attributes in decision-making processes may potentially introduce unjust discrimination or bias.

In this context, it would be necessary to ensure that the loan application process does not treat individuals unfairly based on these attributes, for example, by denying or granting loans at different rates across these different groups. Fairness in this case would imply that the loan approval or denial is based strictly on objective factors such as financial status, credit history, etc., and not on these sensitive attributes.
