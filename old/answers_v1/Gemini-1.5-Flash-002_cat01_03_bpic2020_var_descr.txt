The data describes a payment request process where an employee submits a declaration.  The process can involve several approval stages and potential rejections at various points.  Let's break down the common steps and variations:

**Core Process:**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process begins with the employee submitting a declaration.
2. **Approval Stages (Variable):**  This is where the most variation occurs.  The declaration may go through:
    * **ADMINISTRATION:**  Approval or rejection by administrative staff.
    * **PRE_APPROVER:** An optional pre-approval stage.
    * **BUDGET OWNER:**  An optional approval stage by the budget owner.
    * **SUPERVISOR:** Final approval by the supervisor.  Rejection at this stage is common.
3. **Rejection Handling (Variable):** If the declaration is rejected at any stage, the employee typically resubmits it after addressing the rejection reasons. This can lead to multiple iterations of submission, approval, and rejection.
4. **Request Payment:** Once the declaration is finally approved by the Supervisor, the system proceeds to a payment request.
5. **Payment Handled:**  The final stage where payment is processed.

**Process Variations and Bottlenecks:**

The data highlights several process variations:

* **Different Approval Paths:** Some declarations only require approval by Administration and the Supervisor, while others include Budget Owner or Pre-Approver stages.  This suggests a lack of standardization in the routing of requests.
* **Rejection Loops:**  Frequent rejections lead to significant process elongation, notably when the same rejection happens repeatedly.  This indicates potential issues with the initial declaration or unclear approval criteria.
* **"MISSING" Rejections:**  The presence of "REJECTED by MISSING" suggests a systematic problem where approvals are not properly tracked or assigned.  This is a critical flaw requiring investigation.
* **Performance Variation:** The performance metric (presumably time or cost) varies considerably, highlighting that the extra approval steps and rejections significantly impact efficiency.  Declarations that loop through multiple rejections have disproportionately high performance values.

**Process Improvement Suggestions:**

Based on the data, the process needs improvement in several areas:

* **Standardize Approval Paths:** Define clear guidelines for which declarations require which approval stages to eliminate unnecessary steps.
* **Improve Rejection Handling:** Implement mechanisms to reduce rejections by providing clearer guidelines and feedback to employees during the submission process.
* **Address "MISSING" Rejections:** Identify and fix the root cause of "REJECTED by MISSING" errors. This is a high priority.
* **Analyze Bottlenecks:**  Investigate why specific approval stages or rejections cause significant delays or increased costs.  This likely involves analyzing the reasons for rejection and improving the declaration process to minimize errors.
* **Process Automation:** Consider automating parts of the process (especially approvals and routing) to improve efficiency and reduce human error.
* **Data Analysis:**  Analyze the data more comprehensively to identify correlations between specific rejection reasons, approval paths, and performance metrics to pinpoint the most significant process inefficiencies.

In short, the data shows a payment request process prone to inefficiencies due to variability, rejection loops, and systemic issues.  Addressing these issues through standardization, improved communication, and potentially automation is essential for process improvement.
