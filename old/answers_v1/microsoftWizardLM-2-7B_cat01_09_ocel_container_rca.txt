Based on the directly follows graph provided in the event log, there are several specific performance issues that can be identified for each object type involved in the process. Here are the root causes for the performance bottlenecks and issues, considering only the process and data specifics:

1. **Handling Unit:**
   - The "Load Truck" to "Load Truck" transition is the most frequent directly follows pair (8559 events). However, this high frequency is handled by only 6 trucks, which could lead to overutilization of the trucks and cause delays. The duration of 5259.71 minutes indicates that each truck is loaded once every 43.6 minutes on average, which seems efficient. However, the bottleneck could occur before or after this step.
   - The duration from "Load Truck" to "Drive to Terminal" (5259.71 minutes) is similar to the loading duration, but the subsequent "Load Truck" after "Drive to Terminal" has a significantly longer duration (84119.09 minutes), suggesting a bottleneck after the initial drive to the terminal.

2. **Truck:**
   - The alternation between "Load Truck" and "Drive to Terminal" suggests a potential imbalance in workload distribution or truck availability. The longer duration for "Load Truck" after "Drive to Terminal" could be due to long wait times at the terminal or bottlenecks in the loading process.
   - The "Load Truck" to "Load Truck" transition involves 1896 containers, which is significantly more than the six trucks handling the transitions. This discrepancy could lead to significant queuing delays.

3. **Container:**
   - The "Order Empty Containers" to "Pick Up Empty Container" transition occurs 1995 times, each handled by a single container, which seems efficient. However, the long duration for "Order Empty Containers" (368943.92 minutes) suggests that the ordering process or the lead time for empty container availability is a major bottleneck.
   - The "Load Truck" to "Drive to Terminal" transition for containers shows a large discrepancy in the number of events (8559) vs. objects (1896), indicating significant rework or variation in the process, possibly due to containers being loaded onto different trucks or other operational issues.

4. **Vehicle:**
   - The "Book Vehicles" to "Book Vehicles" transition (124 vehicles) occurs frequently, but the long duration (295965.56 minutes) indicates that the booking process is a bottleneck.
   - The "Load to Vehicle" to "Load to Vehicle" transition has a high frequency (1827 events) but only 127 vehicles, which could lead to vehicle underutilization or delays in vehicle allocation.

5. **Forklift:**
   - The forklift operations are frequent and relatively efficient in terms of duration, but the low number of forklifts (3 in total) could be a bottleneck, especially if the demand for forklift services is higher.
   - The "Bring to Loading Bay" to "Load to Vehicle" transition has a duration that includes both forklift operations and vehicle availability, which could be a source of delays.

6. **Customer Order:**
   - The "Register Customer Order" to "Create Transport Document" transition occurs 594 times with a long duration (329005.22 minutes), indicating that the creation of transport documents is a significant bottleneck.

7. **Transport Document:**
   - The "Create Transport Document" to "Book Vehicles" transition is frequent, but the long duration for booking vehicles (22207.07 minutes) suggests inefficiencies in the vehicle booking or allocation process.
   - The "Order Empty Containers" to "Depart" transition shows a long duration (1007066.16 minutes), which could be due to delays in container ordering, filling, or vehicle scheduling.
   - The "Reschedule Container" to "Depart" transition has a high frequency (33 events), but the long duration (275189.97 minutes) suggests that rescheduling containers is causing significant delays.

To address these performance issues, the following data and process specific considerations could be explored:

- Increase the number of available trucks, containers, vehicles, and forklifts to reduce underutilization and queuing times.
- Optimize the booking and scheduling processes for vehicles and containers to reduce the time spent waiting.
- Improve the efficiency of the container ordering and filling process to reduce the duration from "Order Empty Containers" to "Depart."
- Analyze the reasons behind the frequent rescheduling of containers and address the root causes to minimize delays.
- Streamline the process of creating transport documents to reduce the time between registering a customer order and the transport document being created.
- Ensure that the workload is evenly distributed among all available resources to prevent bottlenecks and optimize the loading process.
- Implement real-time tracking and monitoring to identify and address issues as they arise, reducing overall process duration.

By focusing on these bottlenecks and inefficiencies, the process can be optimized to improve overall performance and reduce process durations.
