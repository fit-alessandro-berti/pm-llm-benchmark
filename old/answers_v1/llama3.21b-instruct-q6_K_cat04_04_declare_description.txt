This is a declarative process model, also known as a POM (Process Model and Notation) or BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). Here's an overview of the process underlying this data:

**Basic Structure**

The process consists of multiple activities (also known as "states" in POM), which can be executed sequentially or concurrently. The activities are represented by rectangles, and the transitions between them are shown as arrows.

**Activities**

Each activity is a state machine that represents an individual task or action within the process. Some common characteristics of these states include:

* **Existence**: An activity exists when it has been performed at least once.
* **Absence**: An activity does not exist when it has not been performed.
* **Exactly 1**: An activity exists only once in a sequence.

**Constraints**

The model includes several constraints that define the behavior of the process:

* **Responded Existence**: Activities that occur after "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" are always followed by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".
* **Exactly 1**: Only one activity can occur at a time, unless it is part of a chain or sequence.
* **Precedence**: If an activity follows another, they must happen in that order (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" cannot be executed before "Request Payment").
* **Chain Precedence and Succession**: Activities can only follow one other if they are directly related; otherwise, they follow each other.
* **Alternate Response**: If two or more activities have the same response type ("Payment Handled"), they must alternate between them in some way (e.g., "Request Payment" followed by "Payment Handled").
* **Non-Coexistence**: Activities that occur together do not happen at all.
* **Non-Succession and Chain Succession**: Only one activity can follow another if it is the same type; otherwise, they must alternate.

**Notation**

The notation used in this model follows the BPMN 2.0 standard:

* **Activities**: Rectangles representing individual tasks or actions
* **Transitions**: Arrows connecting activities to represent flow between them
* **Service**: Boxes containing a single activity (e.g., "Request Payment")
* **Gateways**: Boxes with multiple activities (e.g., "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR")

**Process Flow**

A process can be composed of one or more sequences, which are represented as linear flows of activities. Each sequence must satisfy the constraints mentioned above to ensure correctness and efficiency.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at an example:

Suppose we want to create a sequence for managing payment-related tasks. This sequence might include steps such as requesting payment, approving payment, and handling payment. The constraint ensures that these activities are always performed in sequence after "Request Payment" and before "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".

The entire process can be visualized using the BPMN 2.0 notation, where each activity is represented by a rectangle and transitions between them are shown as arrows.
