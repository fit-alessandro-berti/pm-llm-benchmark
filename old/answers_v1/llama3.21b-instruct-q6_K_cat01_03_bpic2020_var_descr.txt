This dataset appears to represent a workflow or business process involving multiple stakeholders, including employees, administrators, and budget owners. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits a declaration ( likely a form for reporting income, expenses, or other financial information) to an administrator.
2. **Approval**: The administrator reviews the declaration and either approves it, rejecting it based on certain criteria, or requests additional information for further review.
3. **Final Approval**: If the declaration is approved, it is forwarded to a supervisor for final approval.
4. **Request Payment**: Once the declaration has been finalized, payment is requested from the employee.
5. **Payment Handling**: The payment is handled by either the administrator or supervisor, depending on their role and the process in place.

The process seems to follow a hierarchical structure, with each level of approval building upon the previous one:

* Administrator -> Supervisor -> Employee (multiple levels)
* Rejection at any level can trigger further action, such as returning the declaration to the administrator for re-approval

There is also an indication that some requests are rejected without explanation or resolution, which may suggest a lack of clear process documentation or inadequate escalation procedures.

The frequency of certain actions suggests that the organization has a high volume of declarations being processed and reviewed. Additionally, the use of various approval levels (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, PRE-APOVER) implies a need for standardized processes to ensure consistency and accountability across different departments and stakeholders.

Overall, this data likely represents a complex business process with multiple layers of approval and a significant volume of activity, requiring careful management and optimization to maintain efficiency and accuracy.
