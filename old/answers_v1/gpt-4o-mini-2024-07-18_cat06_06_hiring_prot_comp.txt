To analyze the differences in treatment between the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we can look at various aspects including the frequency of process variants, their performance metrics (execution times), treatment success rates, and the types of processes being utilized. 

Here’s a breakdown of the main differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The unprotected group has significantly higher frequencies of process variants across most treatments, indicating that these processes are utilized more often. For instance, the most frequent variant in the unprotected group has a frequency of 1466, while the highest in the protected group is 284. This suggests that the unprotected group is experiencing treatments that are likely more standardized or preferred.

### 2. **Execution Performance (Time):**
   - The protected group has some processes that take considerably longer (e.g., 480,000+ seconds) for certain treatment variants that include multiple unsuccessful attempts before success, whereas the unprotected group’s similar processes average out to lower execution times. For example, both groups show variants with long execution times, but they are generally more frequent and accepted in the unprotected group, which might suggest better overall efficiency in the treatment pathways.
   - Conversely, some processes are performed at similar execution times across both groups (e.g., around 320,000 seconds), but the unprotected group tends to encapsulate more successful outcomes more quickly. 

### 3. **Success Rates of Treatments:**
   - The unprotected group shows a clearer path toward successful treatment execution, with multiple instances of straightforward treatments leading directly to discharge. Many of the paths in the protected group exhibit more complexity, involving extra examinations and unsuccessful attempts which may slow down treatment (e.g., "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge").
   - The presence of "unsuccessful" treatment paths is generally more prevalent in the protected group, suggesting potential inefficiencies or underlying issues leading to treatment failure before success. 

### 4. **Types of Processes Utilized:**
   - The unprotected group utilizes a wider range of simplified process routes leading to discharge. For instance, they have numerous instances of simply undergoing examinations and then directly achieving treatment success.
   - The protected group, however, has a higher tendency towards thorough examinations and expert evaluations, which implies a potentially beneficial but also delayed path to treatment success.

### 5. **Patient Registration Variants:**
   - The unprotected group exhibits more diversity in registration methods (ER and FD) leading to successful treatment, while the protected group shows a heavier reliance on processes that often require more specific sequencing (e.g., thorough examination and diagnosis stages).

### Conclusion:
The key findings highlight considerable disparities in efficiency and treatment outcomes between the two groups. The unprotected group benefits from higher utilization frequency of more streamlined and less complex treatment paths leading to better performance metrics. In contrast, the protected group may encounter more barriers or delays in achieving treatment success, as indicated by longer execution times and more complex paths. Addressing these differences might require a reevaluation of the treatment strategies employed for the protected group to minimize delays and improve overall efficacy.
