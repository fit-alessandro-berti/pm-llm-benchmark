To identify the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, we need to analyze the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some key observations based on the provided data:

### Frequency and Performance Metrics

1. **Frequency of Process Variants**:
   - The unprotected group has significantly higher frequencies for most process variants compared to the protected group. For example, the most frequent process variant in the unprotected group is "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 1466, while the highest frequency in the protected group is 284 for "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge".

2. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - The performance metrics (execution times) are generally similar for corresponding process variants between the two groups. However, there are some notable differences:
     - The unprotected group has more variants with higher execution times, especially in cases involving multiple examinations and unsuccessful treatments.
     - The protected group has fewer variants with very high execution times, indicating possibly fewer complex cases or fewer instances of unsuccessful treatments.

### Specific Differences in Process Variants

1. **Complexity of Process Variants**:
   - The unprotected group has more complex process variants, such as those involving multiple unsuccessful treatments and thorough examinations. For example:
     - "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 225 and performance of 480007.484.
     - The protected group has fewer such complex variants, and when they do occur, the frequencies are lower.

2. **Types of Examinations**:
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of variants involving "Thorough Examination" and "Expert Examination" compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may undergo more rigorous or specialized examinations.
   - For example, "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 1466 in the unprotected group, while the highest frequency for a similar variant in the protected group is 130.

3. **Treatment Outcomes**:
   - The unprotected group has more variants involving unsuccessful treatments followed by successful treatments. This indicates that the unprotected group may experience more treatment failures requiring additional interventions.
   - For example, "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a frequency of 225 in the unprotected group, compared to a similar variant with a frequency of 48 in the protected group.

4. **Simplified Process Variants**:
   - The protected group has more variants with simpler processes, such as those involving only registration and discharge without treatment. For example:
     - "Register at ER" with a frequency of 158 and performance of 0.000.
     - "Register at FD" with a frequency of 156 and performance of 0.000.

### Conclusion

The main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups are:

1. **Higher Frequency of Complex Variants**: The unprotected group has more complex and rigorous process variants, involving thorough and expert examinations, and more instances of unsuccessful treatments requiring additional interventions.
2. **Higher Execution Times**: The unprotected group has more variants with higher execution times, indicating potentially more complex cases or more instances of treatment failures.
3. **Simpler Processes in Protected Group**: The protected group has more variants with simpler processes, such as registration without further treatment steps.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group may face more rigorous and complex treatment processes, potentially leading to longer execution times and more instances of treatment failures. This could indicate a need for further investigation into the reasons behind these disparities and potential interventions to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all groups.
