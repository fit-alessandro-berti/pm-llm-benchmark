Indeed, with the provided Log Skeleton process model and its constraints, it is possible to identify several anomalies. Here are some observations based on the given constraints:

1. **Equivalence Anomalies:**
   - **Contradictions in Occurrences**: 
     Some equivalences appear inconsistent with the "Activity Occurrences" constraint. For example:
     - Equivalence between 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' and multiple other activities like 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', etc., seems inconsistent given that 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' can occur 0 or 1 times, but 'Request Payment' can occur 0 or 1 time, and 'Payment Handled' can occur 0 or 1 time independently.
     - There are too many equivalences that seem mutually exclusive.

2. **Always Before and Always After Anomalies:**
   - **Circular Dependencies**:
     There could be a potential circular dependency anomaly with pairs like:
     - ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR') in the "Never Together" constraint versus equivalencies involving 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' that indicate it must occur if 'Request Payment' occurs.
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' must be before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', which conflicts with direct follows involving 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

3. **Never Together Anomalies:**
   - **Mutual Exclusivity Errors**:
     Many "Never Together" constraints seem to directly conflict with equivalence constraints. For instance:
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' cannot co-exist with 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', yet there are equivalences linking both, such as:
       ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION') and 
       ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER').
       
4. **Activity Occurrences Inconsistencies:**
   - **Large Range Differences**:
     Several activities have ranges that might make it hard to maintain the equivalence and directly follows constraints without violating either "Always Before" or "Always After" constraints.
     E.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' can occur 0 or 1 time, but equivalencies imply repeated pairwise occurrences elsewhere, which can conflict.

5. **Directly-Follows discrepancies:**
   - **Directly-Follows vs Always Before/After**:
     - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' followed by 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', yet Always Before indicates 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' must be before 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

In summary, the provided model has several anomalies that arise mainly from overlapping and conflicting constraints. The primary issues may arise due to conflicting rules surrounding equivalences and directly-follows constraints versus activity occurrences and never-together constraints. Resolving these would require clear priority rules or refactoring constraints to harmonize the process model.
