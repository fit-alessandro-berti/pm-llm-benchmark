Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performance times, there appear to be several notable differences in the treatment of the "protected" group and the "unprotected" group:

1. Loan Denial Rate: The "protected" group seems to have a significantly higher frequency of process variants that end in loan denial compared to the "unprotected" group. For instance, the most frequent variant for the "protected" group (960 occurrences) ends with "Application Rejected," while the most frequent variant for the "unprotected" group (2709 occurrences) ends with "Loan Denied."

2. Additional Verification Steps: The process variants for the "protected" group seem to involve more additional verification steps, such as "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and multiple instances of "Make Visit to Assess Collateral." These additional steps can potentially delay the loan process and increase the likelihood of loan denial.

3. Longer Process Times: For similar process variants, the "protected" group generally seems to have longer average performance times (execution times) compared to the "unprotected" group. For example, the variant "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" has an average performance of 310015.991 for the "protected" group and 340005.309 for the "unprotected" group.

4. Skipped Examination: The "unprotected" group has a process variant that includes "skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" (332 occurrences), which is not present in the "protected" group's variants. This suggests that the "unprotected" group may have had some loan applications approved without a thorough examination or assessment of collateral.

These differences could potentially indicate unfair treatment or bias against the "protected" group in the loan application process. The higher loan denial rates, additional verification steps, longer process times, and the absence of a "skipped examination" variant for the "protected" group may suggest a more stringent and potentially discriminatory process for this group.

However, it's important to note that without additional context and information about the specific characteristics of the groups, loan criteria, and decision-making processes, it's difficult to make definitive conclusions about the fairness or unfairness of the treatment. Further investigation and analysis would be necessary to determine if these differences are indeed unfair or if there are legitimate business reasons behind them.
