The process described by the data you've provided appears to be a workflow for the handling of employee declarations, which ultimately lead to payment processing. The process involves multiple stages and decision points, with variants in the flow based on approvals and rejections at different levels of authority. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the provided data:

1. **Submission by Employee**: An employee submits a declaration for approval. This is the starting point for all variants.

2. **Initial Approval by Administrator**: The initial review of the declaration is done by an administrator. This step is followed in most variants.

3. **Further Approval(s)**: Depending on the variant, the declaration might undergo additional approval steps, such as approval by a Budget Owner, a Supervisor, a Pre-Approver, or an ADMINISTRATION (possibly at a different level or with a different focus).

4. **Rejection and Appeal**: If the declaration is rejected at any point, the employee may have the option to resubmit the declaration for approval (as indicated by sequences with "REJECTED by [Role] -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> [Next Approval Step]").

5. **Final Approval by Supervisor**: After all necessary approvals are obtained, the declaration reaches the final approval stage by the Supervisor. This step is critical as it leads to the payment handling process.

6. **Payment Handling**: Once the declaration is finalized, a request for payment is made, and the payment is processed. The performance data attached to this step indicates the cost or the time taken to process the payment.

7. **Rejected by MISSING/Not Applicable**: In some cases, the declaration is rejected by a node labeled "MISSING," which might represent an automated check or a step in the process that was not met or was not applicable.

8. **Saved Declaration**: There is one variant where the declaration is simply saved without immediate approval or rejection, indicating that it might be stored for later review or after further information is provided.

9. **Performance Metrics**: The performance data for each variant includes the frequency (how often this variant occurred) and the cost associated with the payment handling process. The performance metric for each step is relatively high, with costs ranging from 727,139.517 to 27,909,773.106.

From the data, we can infer the following about the process:

- There are multiple checkpoints and opportunities for human intervention, with administrative and supervisory levels overseeing the approval of declarations.
- The process is designed to handle both approvals and rejections, with the possibility of resubmission after rejection.
- There are potential bottlenecks, as indicated by the variability in the number of times each step occurs.
- The process is subject to rejection at various stages, which can lead to additional submissions and processing time.
- The process includes an automated payment handling system that appears to be consistent across different approval paths.
- The "Performance" metric seems to be related to the cost of payment processing, which can vary significantly across different variants of the process.

Overall, the process is complex and includes multiple decision points that influence the final outcome. It is designed to manage declarations with accountability and oversight, with mechanisms in place for employees to address rejections and resubmit their declarations for approval.
