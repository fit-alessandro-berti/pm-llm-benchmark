Based on the provided directly follows graph and the associated frequencies and durations, here are some process and data-specific considerations that might contribute to performance issues:

1. **High frequency and duration of certain event pairs:**
   - **Items:**
     - "pick item" -> "confirm order" has a high frequency (1495) and duration (55395.26), which might indicate a bottleneck or inefficiency in the order confirmation process after items are picked.
     - "place order" -> "confirm order" has a high frequency (1797) and duration (90745.84), suggesting potential delays in order confirmation.
   - **Customers:**
     - "place order" -> "confirm order" has a high frequency (1495) and duration (64508.10), which could indicate a delay in order confirmation after placement.
   - **Products:**
     - "place order" -> "confirm order" has a high frequency (956) and duration (18600.81), suggesting potential delays in order confirmation for products.

2. **Low frequency but high duration of certain event pairs:**
   - **Items:**
     - "pay order" -> "pick item" has a low frequency (1236) but high duration (429073.36), which might indicate inefficient resource allocation or delays in picking items after payment.
   - **Employees:**
     - "pick item" -> "pick item" has a low frequency (4545) but high duration (17545.19), suggesting potential inefficiencies or delays in item picking.
   - **Orders:**
     - "confirm order" -> "pay order" has a low frequency (1557) but high duration (528039.95), which might indicate delays in payment processing after order confirmation.

3. **High frequency of certain events leading to other events:**
   - **Items:**
     - "pick item" leads to multiple other events with high frequencies, such as "confirm order" (1495), "create package" (1122), and "pay order" (1236). This could indicate that item picking is a critical process step with many dependencies.
   - **Products:**
     - "pick item" also leads to multiple other events with high frequencies, suggesting that item picking is a crucial process step for products as well.

4. **Long durations for certain event pairs involving the same object type:**
   - **Items:**
     - "pick item" -> "pick item" has a high duration (7384.51), which might indicate inefficiencies or delays in item picking.
   - **Products:**
     - "pick item" -> "pick item" has a high duration (7384.51), suggesting potential inefficiencies or delays in item picking for products.
     - "place order" -> "place order" has a high duration (38253.45), which might indicate delays in order placement.

To improve performance, consider investigating and addressing the specific event pairs and object types mentioned above. This might involve optimizing processes, reallocating resources, or improving communication and coordination between different stages of the process.
