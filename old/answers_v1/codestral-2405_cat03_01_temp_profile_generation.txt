Sure! For the purpose of this example, I'm going to make a few assumptions about a Purchase-to-Pay process:

1. The process includes the following activities: 'Order Placement', 'Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt', 'Payment', and 'Invoice Verification'.
2. The average times between these activities and their standard deviations are made up for the sake of the example. In a real-world scenario, these values would be derived from actual data.

The temporal profile might look something like this:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Order Placement', 'Goods Receipt'): (5, 1),  # 5 days on average, with a standard deviation of 1 day
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (2, 0.5),  # 2 days on average, with a standard deviation of 0.5 days
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): (1, 0.2),  # 1 day on average, with a standard deviation of 0.2 days
    ('Payment', 'Invoice Verification'): (1, 0.1)  # 1 day on average, with a standard deviation of 0.1 days
}
```

This means, for example, that on average it takes 5 days from the 'Order Placement' activity to the 'Goods Receipt' activity, but the actual time can vary by up to 1 day.

Again, these are made-up values. A real-world temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process would be based on actual data and may include more or less activities, and would have different average times and standard deviations.
