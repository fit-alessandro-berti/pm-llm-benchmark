In process mining, there are several core tasks that help organizations to understand, optimize, and improve their business processes. These include process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement. Each of these tasks serves a different purpose and contributes to the overall goal of improving operational efficiency and effectiveness.

### Process Discovery

Process discovery is the first step in process mining where an automated algorithm is used to infer a process model from event logs collected during the execution of real business processes. The objective is to derive a workflow model that represents how tasks are performed, decisions are made, and data flows through the system based on historical activity traces.

### Conformance Checking

Conformance checking involves comparing the actual behavior (reflected in an event log) against an expected or ideal process model (e.g., a business process model). This step helps identify deviations between what is actually happening in the organization's processes and how these should be executed according to policies, procedures, or regulations. By highlighting these discrepancies, conformance checking can help pinpoint where improvements are needed.

### Process Enhancement

Process enhancement builds on the findings from process discovery and conformance checking. Its primary goal is to take the insights gained about current process performance (from both discovered models and conformance checks) and use them to propose or implement changes that will improve the process's efficiency, effectiveness, or alignment with business goals.

#### Key Aspects of Process Enhancement:

1. **Identifying Opportunities for Improvement:**
   - Analyzing root causes of issues identified during conformance checking.
   - Identifying bottlenecks in current processes based on performance metrics and event data.

2. **Proposing Changes:**
   - Suggesting modifications to the process flow, such as adding steps, removing redundant activities, or optimizing task assignments.
   - Recommending changes to business rules or decision-making criteria within tasks.

3. **Implementing Solutions:**
   - Working with stakeholders to design and implement new or improved processes.
   - Ensuring that any proposed changes are tested and validated before full-scale deployment.

4. **Monitoring and Adjusting:**
   - Continuously monitoring the impact of implemented changes using process mining techniques.
   - Making adjustments as necessary based on real-world performance data to ensure ongoing optimization.

### Differences Between Process Discovery, Conformance Checking, and Process Enhancement

- **Process Discovery** focuses on uncovering how processes are currently being executed from event data.
- **Conformance Checking** evaluates the actual execution against a predefined process model or policy to identify deviations.
- **Process Enhancement** leverages the insights gained from discovery and conformance checking to propose actionable improvements, implement changes, and continuously monitor performance.

In summary, while process discovery uncovers how processes work, and conformance checking identifies where those processes may be falling short of expectations, process enhancement is about taking concrete steps to improve these processes based on a deep understanding of their current state and the goals of the organization.
