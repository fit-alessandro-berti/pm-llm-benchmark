Sure! Here are the corresponding concepts in the Petri nets field:

1. **Sink Place**: In a Petri net, a place is called a sink if it has no input arcs (i.e., no transitions pointing to it). This means that there are no tokens moving into this place from other places.

2. **Dead Transition**: A transition in Petri nets is considered dead if the number of tokens on all its input arcs is zero, and the net remains bounded after firing these transitions. Dead transitions can be seen as a "nonexistent" or "inactive" component within the net structure.

3. **Unbounded Net**: An unbounded Petri net does not have upper bounds on the maximum number of tokens that any place may hold. This means there is no limit to how many times a transition can fire without running out of places with tokens to absorb its output tokens.

4. **Deterministic Choice Net**: In deterministic choice nets, each immediate predecessor of an event must be fired exactly once before another successor can fire. Unlike free choice nets where transitions are selected based on some criterion (like priority or fairness), in a deterministic choice net, the firing order is fixed and follows a predefined sequence.

5. **Parallel Composition Network**: A parallel composition network represents multiple concurrent executions of one or more processes simultaneously without overlapping their execution paths. Each process can be viewed as a separate instance that runs independently but shares common input and output ports where tokens are exchanged between different instances.

Each of these concepts provides insights into specific aspects or behaviors of Petri nets, offering analogues or complementary ideas for understanding similar phenomena in other network models.
