To assess the main differences between the process variants experienced by the protected group versus those experienced by the unprotected group, several aspects can be analyzed: frequency and performance timings of treatments, the complexity of the pathways, and the distribution of specific steps within these pathways, such as "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination". Here’s a breakdown of the major differences based on these aspects:

1. **Frequency of Treatments:**
   - The frequency of process variants in the unprotected group is generally higher than that in the protected group. This suggests either a larger population size being served or possibly higher access to or necessity for more recurrent health services in the unprotected group. For example, the process variant with "Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" alone has a remarkably higher frequency in the unprotected group (1466) versus its near counterparts in the protected group (73-78).

2. **Process Complexity:**
   - The unprotected group has process variants highlighting higher complexity processes (involving multiple layers of examination and diagnosis) leading to discharge after successful treatment at significantly greater frequencies. This might indicate better or more comprehensive care or more complex health conditions commonly handled in the unprotected group.
   - In contrast, less complex routes, such as those from registration directly to diagnosis and treatment, occur more frequently in the protected group but with far less frequency relative to the most complex processes in the unprotected group.

3. **Performance Timing of Treatings:**
   - Though performance timings across the most frequent process variants in both groups are roughly similar (especially for variants including Expert and Thorough Examinations followed by successful discharge), we see a trend where multiple re-diagnosis and treatment steps (indicating unsuccessful initial treatments) also result in prolonged performance timing in the unprotected group (around 640000 units for repeated unsuccessful treatment cases). This could indicate not only more serious or complicated health issues but potentially less effective initial interventions compared to the protected group.

4. **Inclusion and Frequency of Specific Steps:**
   - Steps involving "Expert Examinations" and "Thorough Examination" appear frequently in the unprotected group, which might be indicative of access to more specialized health care resources or professionals. In contrast, simpler paths are more frequent in the protected group, which might suggest either limited access to specialty care services or fewer conditions requiring such specialized assessments.

5. **Unsuccessful Treatments Leading to Re-Diagnosis:**
   - Both groups show process variants that require re-diagnosis and re-treatment due to unsuccessful initial treatments, indicating that treatment failures and the consequent need for repeating diagnostic procedures are common scenarios in healthcare processes. However, the impact and the specific frequency of these steps warrant further examination to discern any significant quality or efficiency discrepancies between the two groups.

Conclusively, there is a semblance of disparity where the unprotected group might be subjected to more rigorous or comprehensive healthcare processes more frequently. This could reflect disparities in healthcare access, quality of care, or baseline health conditions between the groups. Further deep-dive analyses with additional data on patient outcomes, satisfaction, and demographic differences would enrich the understanding of these discrepancies and their implications on fair healthcare service delivery.
