Analyzing the complex network of constraints in the provided Log Skeleton process model, here are some potential anomalies or irregularities identified based on the listed interactions and behaviors:

1. **Cyclical Equivalence Dependencies**: Some equivalence constraints might create cyclic dependencies which are logically confusing or ineffective for enforcing consistent process flows. For example:
   - If `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` is equivalent to both `'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'` and `'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR'`, it implies that these latter two events should also be equivalently occurring, which doesn't align with typical process flows where approvals and rejections are mutually exclusive outcomes.

2. **Conflicting Always Before and Always After Constraints**:
   - The constraint Always Before `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')` suggests that submission by employee should always come after any declaration for approval by the supervisor. However, an Always After constraint `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')` and the presence of a Directly-Follows constraint `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')` indicate a potential for conflict if both 'Submission by Employee' and 'Rejected by Missing' are linked to 'FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'.

3. **Contradictory Never Together Constraints**:
   - There are numerous never together constraints that might conflict with other declarative rules like equivalence. For instance, `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` and `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'` being never together and yet linked possibly through other indirectly enforced actions via equivalence or direct follows constraints.

4. **Incoherent Directly Follows Constraints**:
   - Having specific events like `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'` directly followed by `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'`, alongside similar constraints which indirectly imply a tight control sequence might prevent logical alternative paths, impacting the flexibility and the realism of modeling real-world scenarios where conditions can change dynamically.

5. **Activity Occurrences Restrictions**:
   - Restrictions like `'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6'` which skip permissible values (e.g., not including 4 or 5) may indicate either a mistake in the modeling or a very rigid system that doesn't accurately reflect usual operational procedures. This might become problematic if real data does not adhere strictly to these constraints.

6. **General Logical Cohesion and Practical Application**:
   - Checking the practicality of enforcing all these constraints in a real business process, especially considering that some roles or activities appear very restricted while others are tightly linked in scenarios that don’t normally allow for such synchronization, e.g., approvals and rejections being equivalent might indicate a misunderstanding of the process's intent or an overly restrictive modeling.

This model may need a thorough review with stakeholders to clarify the intended process flow, simplify overly complex or conflicting rules, and ensure that the constraints are realistic and implementable in the operational setting.
