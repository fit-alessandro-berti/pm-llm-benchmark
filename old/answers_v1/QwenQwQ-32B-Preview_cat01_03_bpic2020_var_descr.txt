Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performances, it appears that this data represents a reimbursement or expense approval process within an organization. The process involves several stages and approvals from different roles such as employees, administrators, budget owners, pre-approvers, and supervisors. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the given data:

### Key Process Stages

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - This is the initial step where an employee submits a declaration for reimbursement or expense approval.

2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**
   - The administration reviews and approves the declaration.

3. **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**
   - In some variants, after administration approval, the budget owner also approves the declaration.

4. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**
   - Some declarations are approved by a pre-approver before final approval.

5. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - The supervisor provides the final approval for the declaration.

6. **Request Payment**
   - Once all approvals are obtained, a payment request is made.

7. **Payment Handled**
   - The final step where the payment is processed and handled.

8. **Declaration REJECTED by [Role]**
   - At various stages, declarations can be rejected by different roles, leading to potential resubmissions or corrections.

9. **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**
   - Employees can save declarations without submitting them immediately.

10. **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**
    - In some cases, declarations are rejected due to missing information.

### Process Flow

The core process seems to be:

- Employee submits a declaration.
- Administration approves it.
- Depending on the variant, it may go to a budget owner for approval.
- Supervisor provides the final approval.
- Employee requests payment.
- Payment is handled.

However, there are several variations and potential loops due to rejections:

- If a declaration is rejected at any stage (by administration, budget owner, supervisor, or due to missing information), it can be rejected back to the employee for corrections.
- The employee can then resubmit the declaration, potentially going through the approval process again.

Some specific observations:

- In some variants, there is a pre-approver role before supervisor final approval.
- There are instances where declarations are rejected multiple times before final approval.
- There is a "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" variant with zero performance, indicating declarations that are saved but not submitted.

### Performance Metrics

- **Frequency**: The number of times each process variant occurs.
- **Performance**: Likely represents the time taken for the process variant to complete, possibly in seconds or another time unit.

Higher performance values indicate longer processing times, which might be due to multiple rejections and resubmissions.

### Recommendations

1. **Streamline Approval Process**: Reduce the number of approval stages where possible to decrease processing time.
2. **Improve Initial Submission Quality**: Provide clearer guidelines to employees to minimize rejections due to missing information.
3. **Enhance Communication**: Ensure that reasons for rejection are communicated clearly to employees to facilitate quicker corrections.
4. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of different process variants to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

By addressing these areas, the organization can potentially reduce the time and effort required to process reimbursement declarations, leading to improved efficiency and satisfaction among employees.
