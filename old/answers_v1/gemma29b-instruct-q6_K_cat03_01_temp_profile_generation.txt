Here's a possible temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. 

Keep in mind that this is a simplification and real-world P2P processes can be much more complex with various variations depending on the industry, company size, and automation levels.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Request_PO', 'Approve_PO'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, SD: 4 hours
    ('Approve_PO', 'Send_PO'): (0, 0),  # Usually immediate
    ('Send_PO', 'Receive_Goods'): (86400, 3600), # Average: 1 day, SD: 1 hour
    ('Receive_Goods', 'Verify_Goods'): (2400, 1200),  # Average: 4 hours, SD: 2 hours
    ('Verify_Goods', 'Submit_Invoice'): (2400, 600),  # Average: 4 hours, SD: 1 hour
    ('Submit_Invoice', 'Process_Invoice'): (7200, 14400), # Average: 2 days, SD: 4 hours
    ('Process_Invoice', 'Pay_Invoice'): (86400, 7200), # Average: 1 day, SD: 2 days
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Request_PO to Approve_PO:** This stage involves approvals and can take a day or more. The standard deviation accounts for potential variations in approval cycles.
* **Approve_PO to Send_PO:** This is usually an immediate action.
* **Send_PO to Receive_Goods:**  The time depends on shipping times and can vary.
* **Receive_Goods to Verify_Goods:** This stage involves inspection and verification.
* **Verify_Goods to Submit_Invoice:**  The invoice is prepared and submitted after verification.
* **Submit_Invoice to Process_Invoice:**  This stage involves internal processing and matching.
* **Process_Invoice to Pay_Invoice:**  The final payment is made after invoice processing.


**Important Notes:**

* **ZETA Value:** You'd need to choose a suitable ZETA value based on your tolerance for deviations from the average. A higher ZETA value indicates a wider acceptable range of times.
* **Context Matters:** This is a general example. The specific times and standard deviations would vary significantly depending on your organization's size, industry, and processes.
* **Data-Driven:** The best way to create an accurate temporal profile is to analyze real-world process data from your organization.
