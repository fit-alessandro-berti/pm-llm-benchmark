Sure, here are three opposing concepts in process mining:

1. **Predictive Monitoring vs. Traditional Monitoring**

   Traditional monitoring involves manual analysis of past events to understand what happened and why. Predictive monitoring, on the other hand, uses statistical models and algorithms to predict future events based on historical data. While traditional monitoring provides a retrospective view of an organization's processes, predictive monitoring offers a proactive view that can help in identifying potential issues before they occur.

2. **Bottom-up Discovery vs. Top-down Analysis**

   Bottom-up discovery involves analyzing small parts of the process and gradually understanding its overall behavior. In contrast, top-down analysis starts with an overview of the entire system or process and then drills down to understand individual components. While bottom-up discovery provides a detailed, granular view of processes, top-down analysis offers a more general, high-level understanding that can be useful for strategic decision making.

3. **Real-time Monitoring vs. Historical Analysis**

   Real-time monitoring involves analyzing data as it is being generated to quickly identify issues or anomalies. Historical analysis, on the other hand, involves examining past events to understand trends and patterns. While real-time monitoring offers immediate insights into an organization's processes, historical analysis provides a more thorough understanding of how processes have evolved over time.
