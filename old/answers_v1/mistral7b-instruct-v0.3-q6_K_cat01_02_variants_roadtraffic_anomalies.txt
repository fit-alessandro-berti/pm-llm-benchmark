 Based on the provided data, there are several process variants with notable differences in their frequency and performance:

1. The variant with the highest frequency (occurrence) is "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection" with 56482 occurrences, but it also has the highest performance (total time taken), which might indicate a longer processing time per instance.

2. On the other hand, the variant with the lowest frequency is "Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Appeal to Judge -> Payment" with only 42 occurrences, which could be a rare process variant or an infrequently used appeal process.

3. The variants with the highest performance (total time taken) are:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection" with a total performance of 90716800.000, which aligns with its high frequency.
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Send for Credit Collection" with a total performance of 17523000.000, despite having a lower frequency.

4. The variants with the lowest performance (total time taken) are:
   - "Create Fine -> Payment (frequency = 46371)" with a total performance of 889688.400, which indicates a relatively quick processing time for this variant.
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment" with a total performance of 20088000.000, despite having a higher frequency than some other variants.

5. There are also several process variants that have similar frequencies but differ significantly in their performance. For example:
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment" and "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Payment" both have 89 occurrences, but the former has a total performance of 24426930.337 while the latter has a total performance of 66126052.174.
   - "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment" and "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Appeal to Judge -> Payment" both have 69 occurrences, but the former has a total performance of 47844313.043 while the latter has a total performance of 66487073.684.

These differences might indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in certain process variants that could benefit from optimization.
