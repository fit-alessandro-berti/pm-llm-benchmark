It's difficult to definitively state "main differences" without knowing the context of the process and the specific reasons for these variations in performance. However, based on the data provided, we can identify some potential areas where there may be unfair treatment between the protected and unprotected groups:

**1.  The presence of "extensive screening":** 
* The "protected group" seems to be subject to significantly more extensive screening processes with a higher percentage of steps involving "Extensive Screening", while the "unprotected group" generally does not include this step in their process flow. This could imply that the protected group faces potentially stricter or longer vetting procedures, which could be discriminatory based on their characteristics and/or due to other underlying factors.

**2. The frequency of certain process steps:**
* **Reject Prospective Tenant:** Both groups show a similar frequency for rejecting prospective tenants at different stages. However, the "unprotected group" appears to have a higher percentage of this stage occurring in its overall workflow compared to the "protected group". This could suggest that the "unprotected group" faces more difficult screening conditions leading to rejection at certain points.

**3. The duration of specific process steps:**
* Although not directly comparing the groups, some variations exist in specific step durations (e.g., "Extensive Screening", "Sign Contract", "Move In", "Pay Rent"). These differences, if significant and consistently present, could indicate that processes involving different groups differ in their time consumption. 

**4. The presence of actions requiring rent payment:**
* Both groups have steps where tenants are expected to pay rent or face consequences for missed payments. However, the "unprotected group" has a higher frequency of steps involving paying rent, which could point to potential issues around financial capacity and affordability within the process flow.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Context is Crucial:** To draw conclusive findings, we need more information about:
    * The specific properties being advertised, their location, target demographics, etc. 
    * The reason behind each step's existence in the process flow (is it required by law? Does it relate to property type/location?).
    * The overall application process itself and what factors are considered for tenant acceptance or rejection. 
    * Whether there are any known policies or legal implications regarding discrimination based on protected characteristics.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Thorough Contextual Investigation:** You need a deeper understanding of the specific contexts of both groups and their interactions within the process to effectively identify unfair differences.  

2. **Transparency and Equality Monitoring:** Implement clear, documented criteria for tenant selection that are objectively applied across all groups. Consider using standardized metrics to track and analyze potential biases.


Without further context or clarification on what constitutes "protected" and "unprotected," it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions about unfair treatment.
