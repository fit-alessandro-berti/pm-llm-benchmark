Based on the directly follows graph you provided, there are several potential root causes for performance issues in the process. Here are some of them, focusing only on process and data specific considerations:

1. Frequency of "pick item" event: The "pick item" event is the most frequent event in the graph, appearing 12,674 times across different object types. This suggests that picking items may be a time-consuming activity, and any inefficiencies in this process could significantly impact the overall performance of the system.
2. Duration of "pay order" event for customers: The "pay order" event has a relatively long duration (198743.13) for the customer object type. This could indicate that the payment process is slow or inefficient, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential loss of business.
3. Frequency of "confirm order" event for orders: The "confirm order" event appears 2000 times for the orders object type, which is the highest frequency for this object type. This suggests that there may be delays or inefficiencies in the order confirmation process, which could impact the overall performance of the system.
4. Frequency of "pick item" event for employees: The "pick item" event appears 4545 times for the employees object type, which is the highest frequency for this object type. This suggests that employees may be spending a significant amount of time picking items, which could impact their productivity and the overall performance of the system.
5. Duration of "pick item" event for employees: The "pick item" event has a relatively long duration (17545.19) for the employees object type. This could indicate that the item picking process is inefficient or time-consuming, which could lead to employee dissatisfaction and potential turnover.
6. Frequency of "place order" event for customers: The "place order" event appears 1495 times for the customers object type, which is the second-highest frequency for this object type. This suggests that there may be a high volume of orders being placed, which could put pressure on the system and lead to performance issues.
7. Frequency of "create package" event for products: The "create package" event appears 1143 times for the products object type, which is the highest frequency for this object type. This suggests that package creation may be a time-consuming activity, and any inefficiencies in this process could significantly impact the overall performance of the system.
8. Frequency of "send package" event for packages: The "send package" event appears 1128 times for the packages object type, which is the highest frequency for this object type. This suggests that package delivery may be a time-consuming activity, and any inefficiencies in this process could significantly impact the overall performance of the system.

Overall, the high frequency and long duration of certain events, particularly those related to item picking, package creation, and payment processing, suggest that these may be the root causes of performance issues in the system. Additionally, the high volume of orders being placed may put pressure on the system and exacerbate any existing inefficiencies.
