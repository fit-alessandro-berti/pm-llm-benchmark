To identify the main differences in the treatment of the 'protected' group versus the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some key observations:

1. **Frequency of Loan Denials**:
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of loans being denied (`Loan Denied` process variant). This suggests that a larger proportion of applicants in the unprotected group are being rejected.

2. **Frequency of Appointment Denials**:
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of appointment denials (`Appointment Denied` process variant). This could indicate that potential borrowers in the protected group are being blocked from even starting the loan application process more often.

3. **Frequency of Signing Loan Agreements**:
   - The 'protected' group has more instances of loan agreements being signed (`Sign Loan Agreement` process variant). This suggests that, among those who complete the process, the protected group is more successful in obtaining loans.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The 'unprotected' group has higher average performance times for most process variants, especially for loan denials and loan approvals (`Loan Denied`, `Loan Denied`, `Sign Loan Agreement`). This could indicate longer decision times for the unprotected group.
   - The 'protected' group has a lower average performance time for the entire process of setting an appointment, handing in a credit application, verifying borrower information, and either getting a loan denied or signed, as indicated by the `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected` or `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` path.

5. **Additional Steps**:
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of processes that skip verification steps (`skipped_examination`), which might either be due to a different underwriting process or a result of a higher denial rate leading to skipping the verification stage.
   - Both groups have similar frequencies of making visits to assess collateral, which suggests that the assessment of collateral is consistent across groups.

6. **Loan Approval Times**:
   - There are instances where the 'unprotected' group has significantly longer approval times (e.g., `Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement` with a performance time of 489840.000ms for the unprotected group vs. 349945.923ms for a protected group case).

7. **Consistency of Outcomes**:
   - The 'protected' group shows a wider range of outcomes, including both loan denials and approvals, whereas the 'unprotected' group has a higher concentration of loan denials.

From a domain knowledge perspective, these differences could be indicative of disparate treatment between the two groups. The higher frequency of loan denials and longer approval times for the 'unprotected' group, combined with the higher frequency of appointment denials for the 'protected' group, suggest that there may be systemic biases or barriers affecting applicants who are not protected by anti-discrimination laws. It is important to investigate whether these differences are due to actual risk differences or if they reflect unfair treatment.

To address these differences, a thorough audit of the loan application process, including an analysis of the underwriting criteria, decision-making algorithms, and human interactions, should be conducted. Additionally, the compliance of the process with fair lending laws and regulations should be scrutinized to ensure that all applicants are treated equally and without discrimination.
