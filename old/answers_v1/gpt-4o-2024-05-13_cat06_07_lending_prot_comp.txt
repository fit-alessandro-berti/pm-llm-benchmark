To identify unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, let's analyze the process variants in terms of frequency and performance (execution time). Here’s a structured comparison with the main observations:

### Key Metrics for Each Group

1. **Frequency of Process Variants**:
   - **Protected Group**: Variation is significant with certain processes having very low frequency (e.g., 13-40) while some are quite common (e.g., 960, 599).
   - **Unprotected Group**: Higher frequency across most variants, especially for processes leading to Loan Denied (up to 2709) and Sign Loan Agreement (up to 1656).

2. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - **Protected Group**: Execution times range from around 90,000.623 to 390,055.423, with more variability and noticeably longer times in complex paths.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Execution times show a similar range but tend to be longer for some repeated steps, e.g., Make Visit to Assess Collateral.

### Main Differences:

1. **Denial Rates**:
   - **Protected Group**: Higher frequency of paths leading to Loan Denied, particularly with repeated steps (e.g., multiple visits to assess collateral) and co-signer requests.
   - **Unprotected Group**: Lower relative frequency for Loan Denied; the most common path for denial follows directly from submission to the underwriter without repeated steps.

2. **Approval Rates**:
   - **Protected Group**: Fewer pathways that lead to Sign Loan Agreement (e.g., most common is with a frequency of 39 or fewer).
   - **Unprotected Group**: More favorable pathways leading to Sign Loan Agreement; higher frequencies (up to 1656).

3. **Exercise of Additional Conditions**:
   - **Protected Group**: More instances of additional requirements (e.g., Request Co-Signer On Loan, multiple visits to assess collateral).
   - **Unprotected Group**: Fewer and less complex additional conditions; inclusion of a 'skipped_examination' process leading directly to Sign Loan Agreement.

4. **Performance Variability**:
   - **Protected Group**: Wide variability in performance times, especially in processes with high frequency of intermediate steps (e.g., repeated collateral assessments).
   - **Unprotected Group**: Despite similar ranges, mean execution times for final steps seem to converge more tightly.

### Specific Process Differences:

- **Collateral Visits**:
  - **Protected Group**: Multiple visits increase execution time and likelihood of denial (e.g., 349,990.080).
  - **Unprotected Group**: Fewer repeated visits and, when they do occur, they do not seem to affect the times or outcomes as drastically.

- **Co-Signer Requests**:
  - **Protected Group**: Frequent need for co-signer leads to increased steps and delays in processing.
  - **Unprotected Group**: Co-signer requests are less frequent and seem to affect the final decision less negatively.

- **Skipped Examinations** (Unique to Unprotected Group):
  - Direct pathway to loan approval significantly reduced time and steps for the unprotected group (e.g., 260,013.446).

### Conclusion:

**Unfair Differences**:
The analysis shows that the 'protected' group faces:
1. Higher likelihood of loan denial.
2. More intermediate steps, especially additional requirements like co-signer requests and multiple collateral assessments.
3. Greater variability and longer execution times in the loan approval process.
4. Less frequent pathways leading to an approved loan.

In contrast, the 'unprotected' group benefits from:
1. More frequent direct pathways to loan approval with fewer intermediate conditions.
2. Instances of skipped examination steps leading to quicker approvals.

These differences suggest potential biases in the treatment of loan applicants between the two groups. The 'protected' group experiences more obstacles, longer processing times, and higher denial rates, indicating a need for review and adjustment of the process to ensure equity and fairness.
