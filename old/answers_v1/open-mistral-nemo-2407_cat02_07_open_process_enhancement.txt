Process mining is a data-driven approach to analyze and improve business processes. It uses event data stored in information systems to gain insights into how processes are actually performed. Here's how "process enhancement" differs from "process discovery" and "conformance checking":

1. **Process Discovery**:
   - *Purpose*: To create a visual representation (process model) of a business process based on event data.
   - *Output*: A process model that shows activities, decision points, and control flow.
   - *Goal*: To understand the as-is process, identify bottlenecks, and find improvement opportunities.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   - *Purpose*: To compare an existing process model (reference model) with the actual process behavior (as discovered from event data).
   - *Output*: A list of deviations, i.e., places where the actual process differs from the reference model.
   - *Goal*: To identify non-compliance, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.

3. **Process Enhancement**:
   - *Purpose*: To improve the process model based on the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking, and to suggest changes that can be made to the real process.
   - *Output*: An enhanced process model with suggested changes, such as removing unnecessary activities, optimizing the flow, or adding new activities to improve the process.
   - *Goal*: To create a target process model that is more efficient, effective, and compliant with organizational policies and regulations.

Here's how they differ:

- **Process Discovery** is about understanding the current process, while **Process Enhancement** is about improving it.
- **Conformance Checking** focuses on comparing the current process with a reference model, while **Process Enhancement** uses these insights to suggest changes to the process.
- **Process Discovery** and **Conformance Checking** are typically data-driven and automated, while **Process Enhancement** often involves human expertise and decision-making.

In summary, process enhancement builds upon the results of process discovery and conformance checking to suggest and plan improvements to the business process.
