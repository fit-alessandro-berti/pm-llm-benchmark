Certainly! Here's a possible temporal profile for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process:

```python
purchaser_to_purchase = {
    ('Customer', 'Order'): (500, 150), # Average time between Customer and Order is 1.33 days with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
    ('Order', 'Delivery'): (2400, 600), # Average time between Order and Delivery is 3.75 days with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
    ('Delivery', 'Payment'): (86400 - 60*3, 1200), # Average time between Delivery and Payment is 2 days, 9 hours with a standard deviation of 1 day, 30 minutes.
}
```

In this temporal profile:
- The average times between the following couples of activities are given in seconds:
  - `Customer` to `Order`: 500 * 60 + 4 * 60 = 28800 + 240 = 30400 (1.33 days with a standard deviation of 4 hours)
  - `Order` to `Delivery`: 2400 (3 days, 15 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour).
  - `Delivery` to `Payment`: 86400 - 60 * 3 = 86400 - 180 = 86220 + 9 * 60 * 60 = 86220 + 17220 = 103440 (2 days, 9 hours with a standard deviation of 1 day, 30 minutes).

This profile assumes that the times between activities follow a normal distribution.
