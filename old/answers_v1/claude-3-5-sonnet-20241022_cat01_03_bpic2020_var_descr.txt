This appears to be an expense declaration/reimbursement process within an organization. Here's a breakdown of the main process flow and its characteristics:

1. Basic Flow:
- Process typically starts with an EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration
- Goes through various approval stages (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR)
- Ends with Request Payment and Payment Handled

2. Key Roles:
- EMPLOYEE (initiates and can resubmit)
- ADMINISTRATION (first-level approval)
- PRE_APPROVER (alternative first-level approval)
- BUDGET OWNER (mid-level approval, not always required)
- SUPERVISOR (final approval)
- MISSING (seems to be a system state for missing information)

3. Main Patterns:
- Most common path (4,618 cases): EMPLOYEE  ADMINISTRATION  SUPERVISOR  Payment
- Second most common (2,473 cases): Includes BUDGET OWNER approval before SUPERVISOR
- Simplified path (1,392 cases): Direct SUPERVISOR approval without intermediate steps

4. Rejection Handling:
- Declarations can be rejected at various stages
- When rejected, it typically goes back to the EMPLOYEE for resubmission
- Multiple rejection-resubmission cycles are possible
- Some cases show up to 3 rejection-resubmission cycles

5. Performance Metrics:
- Performance values (likely time measurements) increase with more complex paths
- Rejected and resubmitted cases tend to have higher performance values
- Simple paths generally have lower performance values

This appears to be a flexible process with multiple possible approval paths, including provisions for rejections and resubmissions, typical of corporate expense management systems.
