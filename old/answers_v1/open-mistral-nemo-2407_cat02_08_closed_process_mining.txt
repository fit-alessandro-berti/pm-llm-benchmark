Sure, here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the process mining terms you've listed:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**
   - *Opposite*: Manual Process Modeling
     - *Explanation*: While automated process discovery uses algorithms to extract process models from event data, manual process modeling involves human experts creating process models based on their knowledge and understanding of the process.
   - *More General*: Process Modeling
     - *Explanation*: Process modeling is a broader term that encompasses both automated and manual methods used to create visual representations of business processes.

2. **Predictive Monitoring**
   - *Opposite*: Descriptive Monitoring
     - *Explanation*: Predictive monitoring uses historical data and machine learning techniques to forecast future process behavior, while descriptive monitoring simply describes what has happened in the past without making predictions.
   - *More General*: Process Analytics
     - *Explanation*: Process analytics is a broader field that includes both predictive and descriptive analysis of process data to gain insights and support decision-making.

3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
   - *Opposite*: Top-down Modeling
     - *Explanation*: Bottom-up discovery starts from individual cases and gradually builds up to a process model, while top-down modeling begins with a high-level view of the process and then refines it into more detailed steps.
   - *More General*: Process Discovery
     - *Explanation*: Process discovery is the broader activity of extracting process models from event data, which can be done using either bottom-up or top-down approaches.

4. **Process Simulation**
   - *Opposite*: Process Documentation
     - *Explanation*: Process simulation uses process models to predict how a process will behave under different conditions, while process documentation is the act of recording and maintaining up-to-date information about a process without necessarily testing or validating its behavior.
   - *More General*: Process Analysis
     - *Explanation*: Process analysis is a broader term that includes both simulation (testing and validating process behavior) and other forms of analysis, such as conformance checking and process mining.

5. **Process Efficiency**
   - *Opposite*: Process Inefficiency
     - *Explanation*: Process efficiency refers to the optimal use of resources to achieve the desired outcome, while process inefficiency indicates that resources are being wasted or not used effectively.
   - *More General*: Process Performance
     - *Explanation*: Process performance is a broader term that encompasses not only efficiency but also other aspects of process quality, such as effectiveness, reliability, and agility.

6. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - *Opposite*: Post-mortem Analysis
     - *Explanation*: Real-time monitoring involves tracking and analyzing process data as it happens, while post-mortem analysis occurs after the process has been completed, focusing on what has already happened.
   - *More General*: Process Monitoring
     - *Explanation*: Process monitoring is the broader activity of tracking and analyzing process data, which can be done in real-time or after the fact.

These opposite and more general concepts should help provide a better understanding of the relationships between these process mining terms and related concepts.
