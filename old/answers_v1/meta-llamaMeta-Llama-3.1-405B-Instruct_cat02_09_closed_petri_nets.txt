Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given Petri net concepts:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place** - A place that only has outgoing arcs and no incoming arcs, i.e., it only consumes tokens and never produces any.
	* More general concept: **Place** - A node in the Petri net that can hold tokens, without any specific restrictions on its input or output arcs.
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Timed Transition** - A transition that has a delay or duration associated with it, i.e., it takes some time to fire after being enabled.
	* More general concept: **Transition** - A node in the Petri net that represents a change in the system's state, without any specific assumption about its firing behavior.
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition** - A transition that can never fire, either because it is never enabled or because it is blocked by other transitions.
	* More general concept: **Transition** - A node in the Petri net that represents a change in the system's state, without any specific assumption about its firing behavior or liveness.
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net** - A Petri net in which the number of tokens in some places can grow indefinitely, i.e., there is no upper bound on the number of tokens in the net.
	* More general concept: **Petri Net** - A mathematical model of a system that uses places, transitions, and arcs to describe its behavior, without any specific assumption about boundedness.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflict Net** - A Petri net in which there are conflicts between transitions, i.e., the firing of one transition can disable other transitions.
	* More general concept: **Petri Net** - A mathematical model of a system that uses places, transitions, and arcs to describe its behavior, without any specific assumption about conflict or free choice.

Note that these opposite concepts are not necessarily exact opposites, but rather concepts that contrast with the original concept. Similarly, the more general concepts are not necessarily the most general possible, but rather a more general concept that encompasses the original concept.
