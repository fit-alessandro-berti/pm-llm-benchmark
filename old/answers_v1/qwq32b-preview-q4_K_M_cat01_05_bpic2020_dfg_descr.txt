Based on the provided flow data, it appears to represent a reimbursement or expense approval process within an organization. The process involves multiple stages and approvals from different roles such as employees, administrators, budget owners, pre-approvers, and supervisors. Each transition between states has associated frequencies and performance metrics, likely indicating how often that transition occurs and the time taken for the transition.

Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Initiation by Employee:**
   - An employee submits a declaration (likely an expense report or reimbursement request), moving it to the "SUBMITTED" state.

2. **Initial Review:**
   - The submission is reviewed by different authorities:
     - **Administration:** Can approve, reject, or forward for further approval.
     - **Pre-approver:** Can approve or reject.
     - **Budget Owner:** Can approve or reject.

3. **Approval Pathways:**
   - If approved by administration, it can be further approved by the budget owner or directly by the supervisor.
   - If approved by a pre-approver, it moves towards final approval by the supervisor.

4. **Final Approval:**
   - Once finally approved by the supervisor, the declaration is ready for payment handling.

5. **Payment Handling:**
   - The payment is handled after the final approval.

6. **Rejection Pathways:**
   - At various stages, declarations can be rejected and returned to the employee for corrections or resubmission.
   - Rejections can come from administration, budget owners, pre-approvers, supervisors, or even missing approvals.

7. **Special Cases:**
   - Some transitions indicate unusual paths, such as directly requesting payment from a saved declaration or rejecting by missing approvers.

### Key Roles and Their Actions:

- **Employee:**
  - Submits declarations.
  - Resubmits after rejections.
  - Can reject their own submissions in some cases.

- **Administration:**
  - Approves or rejects submissions.
  - Forwards to budget owners or supervisors.

- **Budget Owner:**
  - Approves or rejects declarations.

- **Pre-approver:**
  - Approves or rejects submissions before they reach the supervisor.

- **Supervisor:**
  - Provides final approval.
  - Can reject declarations.

- **Missing Approvers:**
  - Indicate scenarios where required approvals are not present.

### Performance Metrics:

- **Frequency:** How often a particular transition occurs.
- **Performance:** Likely represents the time taken for the transition, possibly in seconds or milliseconds.

### Potential Bottlenecks and Areas for Improvement:

1. **High Frequency of Rejections:**
   - Transitions like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" have high frequencies and performance times, indicating that many submissions are being rejected at the administration level, which could be a bottleneck.

2. **Time-Consuming Approvals:**
   - Transitions with high performance metrics (e.g., "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled" with very high performance time for low frequency) may indicate delays in payment processing.

3. **Complex Approval Paths:**
   - The presence of multiple approval pathways and potential loops (like rejections leading back to submission) can complicate the process and increase turnaround times.

### Recommendations:

1. **Streamline Initial Submission:**
   - Provide clearer guidelines to employees for submitting declarations to reduce rejection rates at the administration level.

2. **Optimize Approval Workflows:**
   - Standardize the approval to minimize the number of steps and potential bottlenecks.
   - Consider automating approvals where possible to reduce human latency.

3. **Improve Communication:**
   - Enhance communication between employees and approvers to ensure that submissions meet all requirements before being submitted for approval.

4. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Regularly review performance metrics to identify and address any delays or inefficiencies in the process.

By analyzing these transitions and their associated metrics, the organization can gain insights into the efficiency of its reimbursement process and make data-driven decisions to improve it.
