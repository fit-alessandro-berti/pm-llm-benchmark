Based on the provided constraints, I can describe the process underlying this data. It appears to be a declaration and payment handling process, likely in a business or organizational context. Here's a description of the process:

1. Initialization:
   The process always starts with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE". This is the only activity that can initiate a trace.

2. Main Flow:
   a. An employee submits a declaration.
   b. The declaration is then reviewed and approved by a supervisor (FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   c. After approval, a payment is requested (Request Payment).
   d. Finally, the payment is handled (Payment Handled).

3. Key Characteristics:
   - Each of the four main activities (Declaration SUBMITTED, FINAL_APPROVED, Request Payment, and Payment Handled) occurs exactly once in each process instance.
   - The activities must follow a specific order:
     * Declaration SUBMITTED → Declaration FINAL_APPROVED → Request Payment → Payment Handled
   - There's a strict chain of events between:
     * Declaration FINAL_APPROVED → Request Payment
     * Request Payment → Payment Handled

4. Constraints:
   - The process ensures that if any of the main activities occur, all others will also occur (Co-Existence and Responded Existence constraints).
   - Activities alternate without repetitions (Alternate response, precedence, and succession constraints).
   - Certain activities must directly follow others (Chain response, precedence, and succession constraints).

5. Excluded Activities:
   The process explicitly excludes several activities related to rejection, pre-approval, and other intermediate steps. This suggests a streamlined process focusing only on successfully approved and paid declarations.

In summary, this process represents a straightforward declaration submission, approval, and payment workflow. It ensures that each step occurs once and in the correct order, with no provisions for rejections or multiple approval stages. The process is designed to handle successfully approved declarations from submission to payment, without branching paths or complex decision points.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process description?
