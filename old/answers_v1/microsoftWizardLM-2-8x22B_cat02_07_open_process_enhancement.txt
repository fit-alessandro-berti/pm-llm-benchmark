 Process mining is a field that sits at the intersection of data science and business process management, leveraging the wealth of data stored in enterprise systems to analyze and improve business processes. The core activities within process mining include process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement (or process improvement). Each of these activities serves a different purpose and plays a unique role in the lifecycle of process management.

1. **Process Discovery**:
   Process discovery is the initial step in process mining, where the goal is to construct a process model that accurately represents the actual process performed within an organization. This is done by extracting knowledge from event logs, which contain data about the execution of tasks, activities, and transactions within a system. The resulting model is typically a flowchart or a Petri net that visually depicts the sequence of steps, decision points, and parallel activities. Process discovery helps stakeholders understand how processes are currently being executed, potentially revealing bottlenecks, deviations, and inefficiencies that are not immediately apparent.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   Once a process model has been discovered (either from event logs or by manually modeling a "to-be" process), conformance checking is used to compare the actual process execution (as recorded in event logs) against the process model. This activity aims to detect discrepancies between the observed behavior and the expected behavior described by the model. Conformance checking can uncover non-conformance issues such as unexpected paths, skipped steps, or compliance violations. It is a critical step for ensuring that the process adheres to certain standards, norms, or regulations, and it can also be used to validate the accuracy of the discovered process model.

3. **Process Enhancement**:
   Process enhancement (or improvement) is the phase where insights from process discovery and conformance checking are used to optimize the process. This involves redesigning the process model to eliminate inefficiencies, reduce costs, improve compliance, or enhance performance in other ways. Process enhancement can be guided by specific performance metrics, such as throughput time, resource utilization, or error rates, which are identified as needing improvement. The goal is to make the process more effective and efficient, which might involve automating certain tasks, reorganizing the flow of activities, or implementing new rules and policies.

   Enhancement techniques can include:
   - Redesigning the process model to remove unnecessary steps or to streamline complex paths.
   - Integrating new technologies, such as robotic process automation (RPA), to handle repetitive tasks.
   - Adjusting resource allocations to better match the demand of the process.
   - Implementing controls to ensure compliance and to reduce the risk of errors or exceptions.

The key difference between process enhancement and the other two activities is that while process discovery and conformance checking are primarily diagnostic in nature, process enhancement is prescriptive. Discovery and conformance checking help in understanding and evaluating the process, whereas process enhancement is about making informed changes to improve the process.

In summary, process mining's lifecycle starts with discovering how processes actually work, moves on to checking whether these processes conform to the desired model or standard, and culminates in enhancing the process to achieve better performance and compliance. Each step builds upon the previous one, providing a structured approach to continuous process improvement.
