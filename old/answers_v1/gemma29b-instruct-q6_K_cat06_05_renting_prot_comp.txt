Here's a breakdown of potential unfair differences based on the provided process variant data, keeping in mind that I need more context about the domain to give definitive conclusions.

**Possible Unfair Differences**

* **Rejection Rates:**

    * The protected group seems to have a higher percentage of applications ending in rejection ("Reject Prospective Tenant") compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate bias against the protected group at some stage.

* **Path Complexity & Length:**

    * The protected group has a higher proportion of longer, more complex application processes that involve "Extensive Screening" and multiple steps before a potential tenant is rejected. 
    * This suggests that the protected group might be subjected to more rigorous scrutiny, potentially leading to increased effort and potentially discriminatory delays.

* **Success Rate:**

    * The unprotected group appears to have a higher success rate (reaching "Move In" and beyond). This difference could be influenced by several factors, including rejection bias, differing application requirements, or simply a different pool of applicants.

* **Payment Delays & Evictions:**

    * The protected group data shows instances of "Tenant Cancels Appartment" and "Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant." While these are not necessarily discriminatory on their face, it's crucial to examine if these events are proportionally more frequent for the protected group.

**Domain Knowledge Needed**

To determine if these differences are truly unfair, we need to understand:

* **The nature of the protected characteristic:**  This is crucial for identifying potential bias.
* **The goals of the application process:**  Are all steps truly necessary? Could some be streamlined?
* **Industry benchmarks and legal requirements:** Are the process lengths and rejection rates within acceptable ranges? Are there legal protections against discrimination in this domain?

**Next Steps**

1. **Analyze the data for statistical significance:** Are the differences in process variants and outcomes statistically significant, or could they be due to random chance?
2. **Compare application data:** Look for differences in application completeness, accuracy, or supporting documentation between the groups.
3. **Conduct interviews:**  Speak to representatives from both groups to understand their experiences and identify any potential pain points.

By combining data analysis with domain expertise and user feedback, we can get a clearer picture of whether unfair differences exist and take steps to address them.
