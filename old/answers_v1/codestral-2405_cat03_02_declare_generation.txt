Yes, based on the explanation given, I can create a declarative process model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. However, since this is a hypothetical scenario, specifics like activities and rules might need to be adjusted to fit your actual process.

Here's a simple example:

```python
purchase_to_pay_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Initiate Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Approve Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Make Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Close Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        'Cancel Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        'Initiate Purchase Order': 'Approve Purchase Order',
        'Approve Purchase Order': 'Make Payment'
    },
    'succession': {
        'Make Payment': 'Receive Goods'
    },
    'precedence': {
        'Receive Goods': 'Close Purchase Order'
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        'Initiate Purchase Order': 'Cancel Purchase Order'
    }
}
```

In this model:

- The existence constraint ensures that each activity ('Initiate Purchase Order', 'Approve Purchase Order', 'Make Payment', 'Receive Goods', 'Close Purchase Order') is executed at least once.
- The absence constraint ensures that 'Cancel Purchase Order' is not executed.
- The response constraint ensures that if 'Initiate Purchase Order' occurs then 'Approve Purchase Order' also occurs, and if 'Approve Purchase Order' occurs then 'Make Payment' also occurs.
- The succession constraint ensures that if 'Make Payment' occurs then 'Receive Goods' also occurs in the future of the trace.
- The precedence constraint ensures that if 'Receive Goods' occurs then 'Close Purchase Order' also occurs in the past of the trace.
- The nonsuccession constraint ensures that 'Cancel Purchase Order' should not follow 'Initiate Purchase Order'.
