To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second), let's analyze the process variants and their execution times along with frequencies. Here are some key points to consider:

### Frequency and Performance Comparisons

1. **Rejection Before Viewing:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 484, performance = 89999.306)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 365, performance = 80002.688)

   **Observation:**
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of rejections before viewing the property, and the execution time is also longer, though not significantly.

2. **Rejection After Viewing:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 1036, performance = 270000.477)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 674, performance = 240000.654)

   **Observation:**
   - The protected group sees more rejections after viewing the property and experiences longer delays in this process stage compared to the unprotected group.

### Extensive Screening and Longer Processes

1. **Extensive Screening Leading to Rejection:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 793, performance = 540011.977)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 1022, performance = 480013.530)

   **Observation:**
   - While the unprotected group has a slightly higher frequency of extensive screenings leading to rejections, the execution time is significantly longer for the protected group.

### Successful Applications Leading to Contract Signing and Move-In

1. **Rejected After Extensive Screening:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 793, performance = 540011.977)
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant (frequency = 1022, performance = 480013.530)

   **Observation:**
   - Even though both groups experience this, the performance time is longer for the protected group.

### Tenancy and Rent Payment

1. **Dealing with Tenancy and Rent Payment Complexity:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Moves in and then deals with multiple (up to 7) rent payments or extensive rent histories, leading eventually to tenant cancellation with high variance in execution times.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Similar processes are observed but the frequencies are higher, and the performance times tend to be slightly shorter on average, indicating smoother processing.

   **Observation:**
   - There seems to be a higher variability in the execution time for the protected group compared to the unprotected group when it comes to handling tenancy and subsequent rent payments. Cases involving more steps (like pay rent, issue warning, evict tenant) are more frequent in the protected group albeit with lower frequencies.

### Conclusion

Main differences highlight the potential unfair treatment as follows:
- The protected group has higher rejections both before and after viewing appointments.
- The extensive screening processes are longer for the protected group.
- Successful tenancy processes for the protected group tend to have higher variability in execution times and deal with more complexity post-move-in (multiple rent payments).

This could indicate systematic bias in the way processes are handled, suggesting a need for reviewing and possibly revising these processes to ensure fair treatment across both groups.
