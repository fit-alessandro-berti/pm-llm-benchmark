Based on the provided data, several root causes for performance issues in the process can be identified:

1. **High Frequency of Rejections**:
   - There are numerous instances where declarations are rejected by various parties (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER) leading to multiple resubmissions. This increases the time and effort required to handle each declaration, thus reducing overall performance.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 174)
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 345, 188, etc.)

2. **Multiple Approval Steps**:
   - The presence of multiple approval steps (e.g., by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) adds complexity and delays to the process. Each additional step increases the time taken for a declaration to be finalized.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (frequency = 2473)

3. **Rejections Resulting in Multiple Resubmissions**:
   - Declarations frequently need to be resubmitted after rejections, leading to additional delays and inefficiencies.
   - For instance:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 31, 29, 14, etc.)

4. **Declarations Getting Lost or Missing Information**:
   - Instances where declarations are 'REJECTED by MISSING' or 'REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' indicate issues with completeness or tracking of declarations.
   - For example:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency = 40)

5. **High Performance Variability**:
   - There is a significant variability in performance metrics, suggesting inconsistencies in how different cases are handled.
   - For instance:
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (performance = 810187.903)
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (performance = 1084338.407)
     - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (performance = 727139.517)

By addressing these specific issues related to high rejection rates, multiple approval steps, inefficiencies caused by resubmissions, and problems with missing information, the performance of the process can be significantly improved.
