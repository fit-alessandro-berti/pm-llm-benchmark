The process described by the data involves a sequence of actions related to issuing fines, managing payments, and handling appeals in a structured financial or legal system. Here’s a comprehensive description of the main stages and transitions:

1. **Create Fine:**
   - This is the initial step where a fine is generated.
   - From here, the fine can either be sent (to the person owing the fine) or directly proceed to Payment if the payment is received immediately.

2. **Send Fine:**
   - Once a fine is created, it is typically sent to the individual or entity responsible for paying it.
   - After sending the fine, it can lead to various steps:
     - **Insert Fine Notification:** Record the fact that the fine has been sent.
     - **Payment:** Directly receive payment as a result of sending the fine.
     - **Appeal:** Trigger an appeal process (e.g., sending an appeal to the prefecture, appealing to the judge) as a result of sending the fine.

3. **Insert Fine Notification:**
   - After the fine is sent, a notification is recorded in the system.
   - This step can lead to:
     - **Add Penalty:** Adding additional penalties or fees on the fine. 
     - **Payment:** Receiving a payment.
     - **Appeal:** Triggering an appeal process.
     - **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture:** Recording an appeal date to the prefecture.

4. **Add Penalty:**

     - **Add Penalty:** Applying additional penalties.
     - **Sending for Credit Collection:** Sending the case for credit collection if the payment does not cover the total amount.
     - **Triggering Appeals:** Going back to an appeal process.
     - **Notifying the Result of an Appeal:** After an appeal is resolved, notifications are sent back to the offender.

6. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture:**
   - This involves recording the date a formal appeal is scheduled to be sent to a prefecture.

     - **Add Penalty:** Apply additional penalties as decided by the prefecture.
     - **Payment:** Collect payment based on the appeal result.
     - **Send Appeal to Judge:** If necessary, escalate further to a judge.
