Certainly! Here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('A', 'A1'), ('B', 'B1')},  # A and A1 must have the same occurrences; B and B1 must have the same occurrences
    'always_before': {('Purchase Order', 'Approval'), ('Approval', 'Payment'), ('Payment', 'Archive')},  # These activities must always occur in the specified order
    'always_after': {('Approval', 'Rejection')},  # Approval must be followed by Rejection at some point
    'never_together': {('Purchase Order', 'Archive'), ('Rejection', 'Payment')},  # These activities cannot co-exist in the same case
    'activ_freq': {
        'Purchase Order': {1},  # Purchase Order must occur exactly once
        'Approval': {0, 1},  # Approval can occur 0 or 1 time
        'Rejection': {0, 1},  # Rejection can occur 0 or 1 time
        'Payment': {0, 1},  # Payment can occur 0 or 1 time
        'Archive': {0, 1}  # Archive can occur 0 or 1 time
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Purchase Order', 'Approval'),  # Purchase Order must be directly followed by Approval
        ('Rejection', 'Archive')  # Rejection must be directly followed by Archive
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence**: Activities `A` and `A1` must occur the same number of times, and activities `B` and `B1` must occur the same number of times.
- **Always Before**:
  - `Purchase Order` must occur before `Approval`.
  - `Approval` must occur before `Payment`.
  - `Payment` must occur before `Archive`.
- **Always After**:
  - `Approval` must occur before `Rejection` at some point.
- **Never Together**:
  - `Purchase Order` and `Archive` cannot occur in the same case.
  - `Rejection` and `Payment` cannot occur in the same case.
- **Activity Occurrences (`activ_freq`)**:
  - `Purchase Order` must occur exactly once.
  - `Approval`, `Rejection`, `Payment`, and `Archive` can each occur 0 or 1 time.
- **Directly Follows**:
  - `Purchase Order` must be directly followed by `Approval`.
  - `Rejection` must be directly followed by `Archive`.

This Log Skeleton model captures the essential constraints and relationships in a typical Purchase-to-Pay process.
