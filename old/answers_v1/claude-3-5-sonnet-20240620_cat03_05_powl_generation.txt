Certainly! I'll create a Python code example implementing a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models in pm4py. This example will include various stages of a typical P2P process, such as requisition, approval, purchase order creation, goods receipt, and invoice processing.

Here's the Python code to implement this P2P process:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
create_requisition = Transition(label="Create Requisition")
approve_requisition = Transition(label="Approve Requisition")
reject_requisition = Transition(label="Reject Requisition")
revise_requisition = Transition(label="Revise Requisition")
create_po = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
send_po = Transition(label="Send PO to Supplier")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
receive_invoice = Transition(label="Receive Invoice")
match_invoice = Transition(label="3-Way Match")
approve_payment = Transition(label="Approve Payment")
make_payment = Transition(label="Make Payment")

# Define control flow structures
requisition_approval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    approve_requisition,
    OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[
        reject_requisition,
        revise_requisition
    ])
])

invoice_processing = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_invoice, match_invoice])
invoice_processing.order.add_edge(receive_invoice, match_invoice)

payment_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[approve_payment, make_payment])
payment_process.order.add_edge(approve_payment, make_payment)

# Define the main process structure
p2p_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    create_requisition,
    requisition_approval,
    create_po,
    send_po,
    receive_goods,
    invoice_processing,
    payment_process
])

# Define the order of execution
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_requisition, requisition_approval)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(requisition_approval, create_po)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_po, send_po)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(send_po, receive_goods)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(receive_goods, invoice_processing)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(invoice_processing, payment_process)

# The p2p_process object now represents the entire Purchase-to-Pay process
```

This POWL model represents a Purchase-to-Pay process with the following characteristics:

1. The process starts with creating a requisition.
2. The requisition then goes through an approval process, which can result in either approval or a loop of rejection and revision.
3. Once approved, a purchase order is created and sent to the supplier.
4. The goods are received.
5. Invoice processing involves receiving the invoice and performing a 3-way match.
6. Finally, the payment is approved and made.

The model includes both sequential activities and control structures like exclusive choice (XOR) and loops. The StrictPartialOrder structure ensures that certain activities must be completed before others can begin, while allowing for some parallel processing where appropriate.

This POWL model can be further analyzed or visualized using other pm4py functions, depending on your specific requirements.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?
