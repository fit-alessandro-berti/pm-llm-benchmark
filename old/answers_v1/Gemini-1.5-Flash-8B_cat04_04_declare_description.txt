The declarative process model describes a process for handling a payment request, likely in a business context.  The constraints outline the possible sequences and relationships between activities, ensuring certain steps are always taken, and others never.

**Key Activities:**

* **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:**  The employee initiates the request.
* **Request Payment:**  The formal request for payment is submitted.
* **Payment Handled:** The payment is processed.
* **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:** The request is approved by a supervisor.


**Process Description:**

The core process revolves around the employee submitting a request, which triggers a sequence of actions to validate and approve the payment.

* **Initialization:** The process starts with the `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` activity.  This is the only starting point.

* **Mandatory Steps:**  The `Existence` constraint ensures that `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`, and `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` all occur at least once in a valid trace.  The `Exactly 1` constraint ensures that each of these activities happens only once per trace (this is important, meaning there cannot be multiple submissions for the same request).

* **Approval Sequence:** The `Precedence`, `Response`, `Succession`, `Chain Precedence`, `Chain Response` and `Chain Succession` constraints specify the required order: the `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must occur *before* the approval and payment handling activities, and these must then occur *after* the request activity. Importantly,  the Chain constraints dictate that these steps should occur directly one after another, in a specific order, which strengthens the precedence constraints.  There is no need for intermediate activities, like those declared as 'Absence' to occur, as the constraint implicitly indicates they are not part of this workflow.


* **Relationships Between Activities:** The `Responded Existence`, `Co-Existence`, and `Alternate` constraints define the allowable concurrent or subsequent activities.  For example, the `Responded Existence` constraints dictate that if an employee submits a request, then likely the approval and handling of the payment will also occur. The `Alternate` constraints highlight the fact that the events are not independent, and only *alternatively* allowed to be sequential.

* **Exclusions:** The `Non Co-Existence` and `Non Succession` constraints ensure that certain activities don't occur together or in specific sequences (e.g., the `Declaration REJECTED` activities are implicitly prohibited from appearing alongside the 'normal' processing steps, demonstrating that there is no possible valid state to have a request rejected and then finalized for payment in the same process instance).


**Overall:**

The model describes a tightly controlled workflow for payment requests. It prioritizes the successful handling of the request, with specified approvals and sequences, and explicitly defines valid and invalid process flows. The model appears to be designed to prevent errors and ensure completeness in the processing of the employee submitted requests.
