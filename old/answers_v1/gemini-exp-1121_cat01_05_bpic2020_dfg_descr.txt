This data represents a process for handling employee declarations, likely expense reports or similar requests, which require approvals and eventually lead to payment. Here's a breakdown of the process flow:

**Main Path (Happy Path):**

1. **Submission:**  The process starts with an `EMPLOYEE` submitting a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
2. **Administration Approval:** The declaration goes to `ADMINISTRATION` for approval (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).
3. **Supervisor/Budget Owner Approval:**  From here, there are two possible paths for financial approval:
    *   **Supervisor Approval:**  Goes directly to the `SUPERVISOR` for final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`). This is the more common path.
    *   **Budget Owner Approval:**  Goes to the `BUDGET OWNER` for approval (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`) and then to the `SUPERVISOR` for final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
4. **Payment Request:** Once finally approved by the supervisor, a payment is requested (`Request Payment`).
5. **Payment Handling:** The payment request is handled, resulting in payment (`Payment Handled`).

**Alternative Paths and Reworks:**

*   **Pre-Approval:**  Some declarations might require pre-approval (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`) before going to the `SUPERVISOR` for final approval.
*   **Direct Supervisor Approval:** Some declarations can go directly from submission to `SUPERVISOR` final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), bypassing the administration step.
*   **Rejections:** The process includes various rejection points:
    *   `EMPLOYEE` can reject their own declaration and resubmit it.
    *   `ADMINISTRATION`, `SUPERVISOR`, `BUDGET OWNER`, and `PRE_APPROVER` can reject declarations.
    *   Rejections usually lead to the declaration being resubmitted by the `EMPLOYEE` or rejected outright.
    *   There's also a "missing" entity that can reject a declaration at various stages, likely indicating a process failure or missing information. This leads to either the employee resubmitting the declaration or the declaration getting rejected.
*   **Rework Loops:**  Several paths show declarations being rejected and then resubmitted by the `EMPLOYEE`, indicating rework cycles.

**Frequency and Performance:**

*   The `frequency` indicates how often a particular transition occurs. The most common path is the submission, admin approval, supervisor approval, payment request, payment handled flow.
*   The `performance` indicates the average time (in unspecified units, likely milliseconds or seconds) taken for a transition to complete. Rejected transitions and those involving the "missing" entity tend to have significantly higher performance times, suggesting bottlenecks or issues in those areas.

**Other Observations:**

*   There are a few rare paths like direct submission to for approval states and a rejected declaration directly requesting payment. These might be edge cases, errors, or data inconsistencies.
*   A "saved" state suggests declarations can be drafted and saved before submission.

**In summary, the process is a multi-step approval workflow for employee declarations, with various approval levels, rejection points, and rework loops. The data also provides insights into the frequency and performance of each step in the process, highlighting potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.**
