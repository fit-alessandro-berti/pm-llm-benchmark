Based on the provided data, it appears we're dealing with a process for handling declarations and making payments. Here's a summary of the processes and their common outcomes:

1. **Declaration Submitted by Employee**: This is the initial step of the process. After submission, the declaration can be approved or rejected by the Administration.

   - If approved by the Administration, it can then be approved or rejected by the Budget Owner. If it's rejected by the Budget Owner, the process can restart from the submission step with a new approval from the Administration.

   - If the declaration is approved by the Administration, it can also be approved or rejected by a Pre-Approver. If rejected by the Pre-Approver, the process can restart from the submission step with a new approval from the Administration.

   - If the declaration is approved by the Administration and either the Budget Owner or the Pre-Approver, it will then be sent to the Supervisor for final approval. If approved, a Request Payment is initiated.

   - If the declaration is rejected by the Administration or the Supervisor, it can be resubmitted by the Employee.

2. **Payment Handled**: Once a Request Payment is approved (after a declaration is final approved by the Supervisor), the payment is handled.

3. **Rejected States**: The declaration can be rejected at various stages of the process - by the Administration, the Budget Owner, the Pre-Approver, or the Supervisor. When rejected, it can be resubmitted by the Employee.

4. **Missing Information**: Sometimes, the declaration might be rejected due to missing information (MISSING state). In this case, the declaration is resubmitted by the Employee.

5. **Saved by Employee**: There's also a state where the declaration is saved by the Employee but not submitted.

This data shows the frequency and performance of each of these variants. The performance metric likely refers to the time taken for each variant to complete the process. It's important to note that this is a simplified description and there might be additional rules or exceptions not covered here.
