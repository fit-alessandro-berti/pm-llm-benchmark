To generate the temporal profile, we would need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each couple of activities based on the given process variants. However, from your description, it seems that only frequencies and performances are provided for different paths (variants) in the process, but not actual timestamps or durations between activities.

The performance values you have listed seem to be total durations for specific process variants (in seconds), but without knowing which path segment these durations represent, we cannot directly extract timing information. Additionally, even if we had this data, calculating the temporal profile would require having start and end times of each activity in a consistent format across all executions.

To create such a temporal profile, you'd typically follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather timestamps or durations for every transition between activities (A -> B) across all process instances.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Group the data by pairs of consecutive activities to calculate averages and standard deviations for each pair.
3. **Temporal Profile Construction**: For each activity pair, use the collected timing data to compute average time and standard deviation.

Given that we don't have actual timestamps or durations in your provided data, here's a simplified version of how you might structure the Python code if you had such data:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical dataset where each entry is (activity_pair: tuple, duration: float)
data = [
    (('A', 'B'), 86400),
    (('A', 'C'), 172800), 
    # ... more data entries for different activity pairs
]

temporal_profile = defaultdict(list)

# Collect durations by each pair of activities
for (activity_pair, duration) in data:
    temporal_profile[activity_pair].append(duration)
    
# Compute the average and standard deviation for each pair
result = {pair: (np.mean(durations), np.std(durations)) 
          for pair, durations in temporal_profile.items()}

print(result)
```

This code assumes you have a dataset where every entry contains a tuple of consecutive activities along with their duration. You would need to replace the hypothetical data (`data`) with your actual timing information.

If you can provide more detailed timing or timestamp data for each step in your process executions, we could use this approach to generate an accurate temporal profile. Otherwise, extracting such information directly from frequencies and performance metrics is not feasible without additional context on how these metrics relate to specific activity transitions.
