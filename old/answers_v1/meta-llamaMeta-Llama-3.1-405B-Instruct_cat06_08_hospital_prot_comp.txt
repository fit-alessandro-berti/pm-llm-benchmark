What a massive dataset!

After carefully reviewing the process variants of both the protected and unprotected groups, I've identified some key differences that may indicate unfair treatment:

1. **Frequency of thorough examinations**: In the unprotected group, thorough examinations are more frequent, especially in the process variants starting with "Register at FD" or "Register at ER". This might suggest that the unprotected group is being subjected to more rigorous testing, potentially leading to longer treatment times.
2. **Treatment unsuccessful loops**: The unprotected group has more process variants with treatment unsuccessful loops (e.g., "Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"). This could indicate that the unprotected group is being cycled through treatment options more frequently, potentially delaying successful treatment.
3. **Expert examinations**: Expert examinations are more common in the unprotected group, particularly in the process variants starting with "Register at FD" or "Register at ER". This might imply that the unprotected group is being scrutinized more closely, potentially leading to longer treatment times or more invasive procedures.
4. **Longer treatment paths**: The unprotected group has more process variants with longer treatment paths (e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"). This could indicate that the unprotected group is being subjected to more extensive treatment protocols, potentially leading to longer hospital stays.
5. **Discharge without treatment**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of discharge without treatment (e.g., "Discharge" with frequency 505). This might suggest that the unprotected group is being discharged without receiving adequate treatment, potentially due to biased decision-making.
6. **Process variant distribution**: The protected group has a more even distribution of process variants, whereas the unprotected group has a more skewed distribution, with some process variants being much more frequent than others. This could indicate that the unprotected group is being funneled into specific treatment paths more frequently, potentially due to biased decision-making.

These differences may indicate that the unprotected group is being treated unfairly, with potential biases in treatment protocols, examination frequencies, and discharge decisions. However, it's essential to note that these findings require further investigation and validation to determine the root causes of these differences.
