1. Frequency of Process Variants: The protected group has significantly fewer process variants compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate that the protected group is subject to a more standardized and limited process compared to the unprotected group, which might have more flexibility and options available.

2. Extensive Screening: The process variants in the protected group often involve extensive screening of prospective tenants before rejecting them. This suggests that there may be higher scrutiny and stricter criteria for the protected group compared to the unprotected group.

3. Sign Contract and Move In: The process variants in the unprotected group often involve signing a contract and moving in before the tenant eventually cancels the apartment. This could indicate that the unprotected group has a higher likelihood of actually becoming tenants before cancellation, compared to the protected group which seems to focus more on screening and rejecting prospective tenants.

4. Eviction: One process variant in the unprotected group involves issuing a warning and eventually evicting the tenant. This step is not present in any of the process variants in the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may have a higher risk of problematic tenants requiring eviction compared to the protected group.

Overall, the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups seem to be in the complexity and flexibility of the process, the level of scrutiny and screening applied, and the outcomes in terms of actual tenancy and potential eviction.
