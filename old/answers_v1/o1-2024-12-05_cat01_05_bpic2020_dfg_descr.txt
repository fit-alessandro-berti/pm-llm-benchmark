This data appears to represent event logs or process mining outputs from a workflow involving the submission, approval, and payment of “Declarations.” Each line shows a transition from one state (or activity) of the declaration lifecycle to another, along with how often that transition occurred (frequency) and the average performance time (perhaps in milliseconds or another time unit) for that transition.

**High-Level Narrative of the Process:**

1. **Initial Submission:**  
   The process seems to start with an **Employee** who creates and submits a declaration. The state "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" appears frequently as a starting point.

2. **Multiple Approval Stages:**
   Once submitted, the declaration may go through several approval layers, involving different stakeholders and roles:
   - **Administration Approval:** The declaration may move from "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" to "APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" or be "REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION."  
   - **Pre-Approver Approval:** For some cases, a "PRE_APPROVER" must approve before it moves forward.  
   - **Budget Owner Approval:** Another layer might require approval from a budget owner.  
   - **Supervisor Approval:** Finally, after administration, pre-approver, and/or budget owner approval, the declaration might reach a supervisor for a final verdict.

   Thus, the approval flow is not strictly linear. A declaration can branch into different approval paths, and rejections can send it back to employees for revision.

3. **Outcomes of Approval Stages:**
   From each approval step, there are two main outcomes:
   - **Approved:** The declaration moves forward in the chain (e.g., from administration to final approval by a supervisor).
   - **Rejected:** The declaration may be sent back to the employee for re-submission or it may end up in a rejected state, sometimes passing through multiple reject steps. Interestingly, there are transitions from "REJECTED by [role]" states back to "SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE," suggesting a correction and resubmission cycle.

4. **Final Approval and Payment:**
   Eventually, the declaration reaches a state called "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR." From here, the process moves into the payment phase:
   - A "Request Payment" activity occurs after the declaration is final-approved.
   - Once payment is requested, the next step is "Payment Handled," indicating the financial settlement stage.

5. **Exceptions and Special Cases:**
   Some transitions involve "MISSING" roles or unexpected rejections late in the process. These may represent data anomalies, incomplete logs, or system placeholders.  
   There are also rare transitions that appear to be experiments or less common paths (like going from "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" directly to "Payment Handled" with very high performance times, or states like "FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" leading to "REJECTED by MISSING").

6. **Performance and Frequency Measures:**
   Each transition line has two key measures:
   - **Frequency:** How many times a particular transition occurred in the observed data. For instance, "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment" has a high frequency, indicating this is a common and critical transition.
   - **Performance:** The time or cost associated with that transition. Higher performance values likely indicate longer lead times or more complex steps. For example, very high performance times (in the hundreds of thousands or millions) suggest slow, complex approval or payment handling processes.

**Overall Description:**

The underlying process is a multi-step approval and payment workflow for employee declarations (possibly expense claims, invoices, or similar financial documents). It starts with employees submitting their declarations, which then pass through various layers of approval (pre-approver, administration, budget owner, supervisor) before being finally approved. Once fully approved, a payment request is initiated, and upon handling the payment, the process completes. At any stage, rejections can occur, sending the declaration back for revision or ending the process. The data provides insight into how frequently each pathway is taken and how much time each step typically consumes.
