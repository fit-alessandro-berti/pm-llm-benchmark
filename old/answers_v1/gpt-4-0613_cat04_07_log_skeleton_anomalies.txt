1. Equivalence anomalies: Some constraints in the equivalence category seem to contradict the logic of the process. For example, the equivalence of 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' suggests that whenever a declaration is put for approval by the administration, it is final approved by supervisor. It is illogical for a final approval by the supervisor to always occur whenever a declaration is put forth for approval by administration. The final approval should follow a series of steps involving checking and approval by other roles.

2. Always Before anomalies: In Always Before: ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE') and ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), it seems illogical for a declaration to be submitted by the employee only after it has been approved by a supervisor or a pre-approver. Typically, an employee should first submit the declaration and then it will be approved by supervisor or pre-approver.

3. Always After anomalies: For Always after constraint -  ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'), it seems unusual that an employee's rejection comes after handling the payment. It is more rational for the rejection to occur before the payment is handled to prevent unnecessary transactions.

4. Never Together anomalies: Some of the Never Together constraints seem suspicious. For example, ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled') suggest that the supervisor’s approval of declaration and the processing of the payment cannot occur within the same process instance. Usually, following supervisor's approval, the payment could indeed be handled as the next step in workflow.

5. Directly-Follows Constraints anomalies: In Directly-follows constraints like ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), it seems unnatural for a document to be submitted by an employee directly after it has been put up for approval by the administration. It should be the other way - the submission should precede the approval process.

6. Activity Occurrences anomalies: Some of the activity occurrences also seem off. Having 0 occurences for processes like 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' would imply that there could be cases where these activities don't take place at all, which is unlikely in a financial approval process. They should occur at least once in a process case.
