This data describes a declaration process, likely for expenses or some other type of request, with multiple approval stages and possibilities for rejection and resubmission. Here's a breakdown:

**Main Flow (Happy Path):**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The employee initiates the process.
2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION:** Administrative staff review and approve.
3. **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER (Optional):**  Depending on the declaration, a budget owner might need to approve.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:**  Final approval by a supervisor.
5. **Request Payment:** After final approval, a payment request is generated.
6. **Payment Handled:** The payment is processed.

**Alternative Flows (Rejections and Loops):**

* **Rejection at various stages:** The declaration can be rejected by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, or SUPERVISOR.  Upon rejection, the declaration is usually returned to the EMPLOYEE for correction and resubmission.
* **Rejection due to MISSING information:**  Even after final approval, a declaration can be rejected due to missing information. This forces the process back to the submission stage.
* **Pre-Approval (Optional):**  A PRE_APPROVER can be involved in the process before final approval by the SUPERVISOR.  This step appears optional, as evidenced by the lower frequency compared to the ADMINISTRATION approval.
* **Direct Supervisor Approval:** In some cases, the declaration goes directly from the EMPLOYEE to the SUPERVISOR for FINAL_APPROVAL, bypassing other approval steps (likely for smaller or less complex declarations).
* **"FOR_APPROVAL" states (Rare):**  There are very infrequent occurrences of "FOR_APPROVAL" states for SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and ADMINISTRATION.  These likely represent intermediate states within the system and don't fundamentally change the overall process.  They might indicate that the declaration is waiting in a queue for approval.
* **Re-requesting payment after rejection:** If a request for payment leads to rejection due to missing information, the request can be re-submitted after resubmission of the declaration. Similarly, rejection by the supervisor can lead to re-requesting payment after resubmission and approvals.
* **Unusual edge case:** A payment being handled followed by rejection and return to the employee is present, but happens only once, suggesting a rare error or correction scenario.


**Performance Insights:**

The "performance" values likely represent the average time spent in each step (possibly in milliseconds, seconds, or some other unit).  Analyzing these values can pinpoint bottlenecks in the process. For example, the high performance value for "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" suggests that resolving missing information takes a significant amount of time. Similarly, the handling of payments after final approval takes a very long time, suggesting room for improvement in that stage.


**Further Analysis:**

To understand the process more thoroughly, one could analyze the correlation between the different paths and the overall processing time.  This would help identify the most efficient and problematic flows.  Additionally, investigating the reasons for rejections at each stage would provide valuable insights for process improvement.
