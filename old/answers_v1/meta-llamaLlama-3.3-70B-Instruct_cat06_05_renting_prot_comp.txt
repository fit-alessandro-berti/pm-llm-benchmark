After analyzing the process variants of both the protected and unprotected groups, I've identified some key differences:

1. **Frequency of rejection**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of rejection (e.g., "Reject Prospective Tenant" appears in 4 variants with frequencies ranging from 365 to 2490) compared to the protected group (e.g., "Reject Prospective Tenant" appears in 3 variants with frequencies ranging from 484 to 1036). This might indicate that the unprotected group faces more stringent screening or is more likely to be rejected.
2. **Length of process**: The protected group has longer process variants, with more activities (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" with a frequency of 11). In contrast, the unprotected group's process variants tend to be shorter (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" with a frequency of 674).
3. **Extensive screening**: The protected group is more likely to undergo extensive screening (e.g., "Extensive Screening" appears in 11 variants) compared to the unprotected group (e.g., "Extensive Screening" appears in 6 variants). This might indicate that the protected group is subject to more rigorous evaluation.
4. **Cancellation rates**: The protected group has a higher frequency of tenants canceling their apartments (e.g., "Tenant Cancels Appartment" appears in 12 variants with frequencies ranging from 10 to 29) compared to the unprotected group (e.g., "Tenant Cancels Appartment" appears in 15 variants with frequencies ranging from 45 to 268). However, the unprotected group's cancellation rates are still relatively high.
5. **Eviction**: The protected group has a process variant that includes eviction (e.g., "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" with a frequency of 6), whereas the unprotected group does not have a similar variant.
6. **Payment behavior**: The protected group has more process variants that include multiple rent payments (e.g., "Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent" appears in 4 variants), suggesting that they may be more likely to make timely payments. In contrast, the unprotected group has fewer process variants with multiple rent payments.

These differences might indicate that the protected group faces more stringent evaluation and screening, potentially leading to longer process times and higher cancellation rates. The unprotected group, on the other hand, may experience more rejection and have a higher likelihood of being evicted. However, without more context about the domain and the specific processes, it's essential to interpret these findings with caution.
