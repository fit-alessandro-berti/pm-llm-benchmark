Based on the provided attributes, the following are likely sensitive for fairness:

*   **`case:citizen`**:  This attribute indicates whether an applicant is a citizen or not. Using this in the hiring process could lead to discrimination based on nationality or origin, which is often illegal and unethical.
*   **`case:gender`**: This attribute reveals the gender of the applicant. Gender is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions, and using it for hiring decisions can lead to gender discrimination.
*   **`case:german speaking`**: While language proficiency might be a legitimate requirement for some jobs, this attribute could be a proxy for national origin or ethnicity, especially if fluency in German is not strictly necessary for the role. This could lead to indirect discrimination.
*   **`case:religious`**: This attribute discloses the religious affiliation of the applicant. Religion is a protected characteristic, and using it in hiring decisions can result in religious discrimination.

**Why are these attributes considered sensitive?**

These attributes are considered sensitive because they relate to personal characteristics that are often protected by anti-discrimination laws. Using these attributes in the hiring process can lead to unfair or biased outcomes, favoring certain groups over others based on characteristics unrelated to job performance.

**It's important to note:**

*   The sensitivity of an attribute can depend on the specific context and local laws.
*   Even if an attribute is not explicitly used in decision-making, its presence in the data can still introduce bias if it is correlated with other attributes that are used. For example, if "German speaking" is correlated with a specific educational background that is favored by the hiring process, it could indirectly lead to discrimination.

By identifying these sensitive attributes, you can take steps to mitigate potential fairness issues in the process. This might involve removing these attributes from the data, carefully considering their use in any analysis, or implementing fairness-aware algorithms if these attributes are deemed necessary for specific reasons.
