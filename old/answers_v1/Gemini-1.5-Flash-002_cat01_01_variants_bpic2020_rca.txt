Based solely on the provided data, the root causes for performance issues in the process appear to be linked to specific variant paths involving rejections and additional approvals:

1. **High Performance Impact of Rejections and Retries:** Process variants with multiple rejections ("REJECTED") followed by resubmissions ("SUBMITTED") show significantly higher performance values (longer processing times).  Examples include:

    *  Variants with 2-3 rejection loops before final approval.  These consistently have performance values exceeding 1.5 million, and in some cases, above 2 million or even 3 million.

2. **Additional Approval Stages:**  Including a "BUDGET OWNER" approval step adds time to the process. While not universally negative (some variants with this step have reasonable performance),  it does seem to exacerbate the performance issues when combined with rejections and retries.  The longer paths incorporating a Budget Owner generally have higher performance figures.

3. **"MISSING" Rejection:** The presence of a "REJECTED by MISSING" status suggests a potential systemic issue.  The infrequent nature of this doesn't definitively point to it as a major bottleneck, but the exceptionally high performance values associated with it warrant investigation.  This indicates a significant delay or disruption when this rejection occurs.


4. **Anomalous High Performance in Specific Variants:**  Some variants, even with relatively simple flows, exhibit surprisingly high performance figures (e.g., `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled` with a frequency of 4 and performance of 9,110,508.000). This suggests potential outliers or unforeseen bottlenecks within these specific subsets of the process that require deeper analysis.

**In summary:** The data strongly suggests that process inefficiencies stem from the handling of rejections (leading to repeated cycles and delays), the inclusion of the budget owner approval step in some flows, and the poorly understood "MISSING" rejection status.  Further investigation is needed into the specific reasons behind these rejections and the exceptionally high performance values in certain variants to pinpoint the precise bottlenecks.
