The following attributes are sensitive for fairness because they could potentially lead to discriminatory outcomes in the hiring process:

* **case:citizen:**  This attribute relates to a person's citizenship status.  Discrimination based on nationality or immigration status is illegal and unethical.
* **case:gender:** This attribute refers to a person's gender. Gender bias is a well-documented problem in hiring, and it's crucial to ensure that decisions are made based on merit, not gender.
* **case:german speaking:** This attribute relates to a person's language proficiency. While fluency in German may be relevant for some roles, using it as a discriminatory factor could exclude qualified candidates who are not German speakers.
* **case:religious:** This attribute relates to a person's religious beliefs. Discrimination based on religion is illegal and harmful.


It's important to note that even if these attributes are not directly used in decision-making, they can still contribute to unfair outcomes through **indirect discrimination**. For example, if a hiring process favors candidates with certain cultural backgrounds, it may inadvertently disadvantage individuals from other backgrounds, even if this is not the explicit intention.


It is crucial to develop and implement fair hiring practices that mitigate the risk of bias and ensure equal opportunities for all qualified candidates.
