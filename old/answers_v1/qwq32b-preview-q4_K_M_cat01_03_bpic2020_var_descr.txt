Based on the provided data, it appears that we're dealing with a reimbursement or expense declaration process within an organization. The process involves several stages and approvals from different roles such as employees, administrators, budget owners, pre-approvers, and supervisors. Each variant represents a possible path through this process, with varying frequencies and performance metrics.

### Key Roles and Activities:

1. **Employee:**
   - Submits declarations.
   - Can resubmit after rejections.
   - Saves declarations without submitting.

2. **Administration:**
   - Approves or rejects submissions from employees.

3. **Budget Owner:**
   - Approves or rejects submissions that have been approved by administration.

4. **Pre-Approver:**
   - Approves or rejects submissions, acting as an initial check before other approvals.

5. **Supervisor:**
   - Finally approves declarations after they have been approved by administration and/or budget owner.
   - Can reject declarations, which can be resubmitted by employees.

6. **Payment Handling:**
   - Once a declaration is finally approved, a payment request is made and handled.

### Process Flow:

1. **Standard Path:**
   - Employee submits a declaration.
   - Administration approves it.
   - Budget Owner approves it (in some variants).
   - Supervisor finally approves it.
   - Payment is requested and handled.

2. **Variations with Rejections:**
   - At various stages, declarations can be rejected by administration, budget owner, pre-approver, or supervisor.
   - Employees can resubmit declarations after rejections.
   - Some rejections loop back to earlier stages, requiring

3. **Shortcuts and Direct Approvals:**
   - In some cases, declarations are directly approved by supervisors without going through administration or budget owner.
   - Some payments are handled directly after supervisor approval without additional steps.

4. **Special Cases:**
   - Declarations can be saved by employees without submission.
   - Some rejections are marked as "rejected by missing," possibly indicating incomplete information.

### Performance Metrics:

- **Frequency:** The number of times a particular process variant occurs.
- **Performance:** Likely represents the time taken or some efficiency metric for each variant.

### Insights from Data:

- The most frequent path is when declarations are submitted, approved by administration, finally approved by supervisors, and then payment is handled.
- Variants involving rejections and resubmissions are less frequent but can significantly impact performance due to longer processing times.
- Paths with direct approvals from supervisors without intermediate checks are less common but may indicate trusted employees or urgent cases.

### Recommendations:

1. **Streamline Approval Workflows:**
   - Identify bottlenecks in the approval process, especially in variants with multiple rejections.
   - Consider providing more guidance to employees to reduce errors and rejections.

2. **Training and Communication:**
   - Train employees on proper declaration procedures to minimize mistakes.
   - Ensure clear communication channels for feedback during the

3. **Automate Where Possible:**
   - Automate approval steps where decisions can be made based on predefined rules, reducing human intervention and potential delays.

4. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Continuously monitor performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
   - Regularly review and update processes to maintain efficiency.

By understanding and optimizing this process, the organization can enhance the efficiency of its reimbursement system, reduce processing times, and improve satisfaction among employees handling declarations.
