Based on the provided directly follows graph, I've identified some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **High frequency of "pick item"**: In the "items" object type, "pick item" is involved in many relationships with high frequencies (e.g., 5290, 3528, 1915). This might indicate that the process is spending a lot of time on item picking, which could be a bottleneck.
2. **Long duration for "pay order"**: In the "items" object type, the relationship "pay order" -> "pick item" has a high duration (429073.36). This could indicate that the payment processing is taking a long time, delaying the picking of items.
3. **High frequency of "place order" and "confirm order"**: In the "orders" object type, the relationships "place order" -> "confirm order" and "confirm order" -> "pay order" have high frequencies (2000 and 1557, respectively). This might indicate that the process is handling a large volume of orders, which could be causing performance issues.
4. **Long duration for "package delivered"**: In the "items" object type, the relationship "package delivered" -> "payment reminder" has a very high duration (1127921.43). This could indicate that the process is taking a long time to send payment reminders after packages are delivered.
5. **Inefficient item handling**: In the "products" object type, there are many relationships involving "pick item" with relatively high frequencies (e.g., 1101, 1083, 1032). This might indicate that the process is handling items inefficiently, leading to performance issues.
6. **High frequency of "send package" and "package delivered"**: In the "packages" object type, the relationships "create package" -> "send package" and "send package" -> "package delivered" have high frequencies (1128 and 914, respectively). This might indicate that the process is handling a large volume of packages, which could be causing performance issues.
7. **Bottleneck in employee workload**: In the "employees" object type, some relationships have relatively high frequencies (e.g., 4545, 1995) and involve a small number of employees (e.g., 7, 5). This might indicate that certain employees are handling a disproportionately large workload, leading to performance issues.

These are just a few potential root causes for performance issues in the process, based on the provided data. Further analysis and investigation would be needed to confirm and prioritize these findings.
