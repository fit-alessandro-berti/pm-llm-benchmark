Analyzing the process variants and their performance metrics reveals several potential root causes for performance issues:

1. **Rejection loops**: Many process variants involve rejection loops, where a declaration is rejected by one or more approvers, and then resubmitted by the employee. These loops significantly increase the process duration and frequency, leading to performance issues. For example, the variant with the highest frequency (4618) has a relatively low performance metric (810187.903), while variants with rejection loops have much higher performance metrics (e.g., 2542497.917).
2. **Multiple approval levels**: Variants with multiple approval levels (e.g., Administration, Budget Owner, Supervisor) tend to have higher performance metrics, indicating longer processing times. This suggests that the additional approval steps may be causing delays.
3. **Missing or rejected declarations**: Variants involving missing or rejected declarations (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by MISSING) have high performance metrics, indicating that these instances are taking a long time to resolve.
4. **Re-submission after rejection**: When a declaration is rejected, the employee often resubmits it, leading to additional processing time. Variants with multiple resubmissions tend to have higher performance metrics.
5. **Inefficient payment handling**: The variant with the highest performance metric (13805869.200) involves a declaration being rejected by the administration, but then payment is handled anyway. This suggests that the payment handling process may be inefficient or not properly synchronized with the declaration approval process.
6. **Unnecessary approval steps**: Some variants involve approval steps that may not be necessary, such as the "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" step. Removing or streamlining these steps could improve process performance.
7. **Variants with low frequency and high performance metrics**: Some variants have low frequencies but high performance metrics, indicating that these instances are taking a disproportionately long time to process. For example, the variant with a frequency of 4 and a performance metric of 9110508.000 suggests that this specific process path is particularly inefficient.

By addressing these specific issues, the process can be optimized to reduce performance problems and improve overall efficiency.
