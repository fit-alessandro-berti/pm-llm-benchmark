Based on the provided flow, it appears to be a financial declaration and payment processing workflow in an organizational setting. The process involves several steps from initial submission by employees to final approval by supervisors and subsequent handling of payments. Hereâ€™s how the overall process can be described:

1. **Initial Declaration Submission**:
   - An employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Initial Review and Approval Paths**:
   - The submitted declaration goes through various stages based on whether it's accepted or rejected.
     - If approved at this stage, the process may involve approval from an administration (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`) followed by further approvals by a budget owner or supervisor to reach final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
       - Some declarations might also go through a pre-approver before reaching final approval.
     - If rejected at any stage, the process may require resubmission by the employee with corrections or adjustments.

3. **Payment Request and Handling**:
   - After a declaration is finally approved (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), a payment request can be initiated (`Request Payment`). This could lead to actual payment handling (`Payment Handled`) if there are no issues.
   - However, at this stage, the process might also encounter rejections due to missing or incomplete information leading back to an employee's submission.

4. **Approval and Rejection Frequencies**:
   - Different paths are taken depending on whether a declaration is approved or rejected at each step. The frequency of these transitions indicates common flow patterns within the organization.
     - For example, most declarations that go through administration tend to be finalized after additional approvals from budget owners or supervisors before reaching payment requests.

5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Each transition has associated performance metrics (time taken) which might be used for analyzing efficiency and identifying bottlenecks in the process.

6. **Special Cases**:
   - There are some special cases like declarations going to a "for approval" status at various stages, indicating ongoing review processes.
   - Some transitions show unique or rare paths such as direct rejections leading back to initial submission states.

Overall, this workflow aims to ensure that financial declarations are thoroughly reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders before payments are processed. The system is designed with multiple checks and balances to prevent errors and ensure compliance with organizational policies regarding finances.
