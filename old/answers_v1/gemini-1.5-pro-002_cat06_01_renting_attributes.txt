In this context, sensitive attributes are those that define groups that could potentially experience unfair or discriminatory outcomes within the rental process.  From the given attributes, the following are sensitive for fairness:

* **case:citizen:**  Citizenship status is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions. Differentiating based on citizenship could lead to discriminatory practices.
* **case:gender:** Gender is a key protected characteristic. Any bias in the process based on gender would be unfair.
* **case:german speaking:** While not a traditionally protected characteristic like the others, language can be a proxy for nationality or ethnicity, and therefore discrimination based on this attribute could be a concern.  It's important to consider whether requiring German speaking skills is a bona fide occupational qualification for tenancy or if it's being used to exclude certain groups.
* **case:married:** Marital status can sometimes be correlated with other sensitive attributes like family status or age, and discrimination based on this is often unlawful.

The other attributes are less likely to be considered sensitive in a fairness context:

* **activity, concept:name:** These describe the steps in the process, not the individuals involved.
* **resource:**  While it's possible for bias to be introduced by specific resources (e.g., real estate agents), the resource attribute itself isn't inherently sensitive. Analysis of outcomes based on resources might reveal indirect bias, but the attribute itself is not a sensitive characteristic of the applicant.
* **start_timestamp, time, time:timestamp:** Time-related attributes could reveal indirect bias if certain groups experience systematically different processing times, but the attributes themselves are not sensitive.


It's important to note that the context matters. In different legal jurisdictions or social settings, other attributes might also be considered sensitive (e.g., race, religion, disability).  The analysis should always be guided by relevant legal and ethical considerations.
