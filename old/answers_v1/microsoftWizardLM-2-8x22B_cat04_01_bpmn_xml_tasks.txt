 The BPMN 2.0 XML provided describes a process model with several tasks. Here is a list of the tasks included in the process model, along with their respective `id` attributes and names:

1. `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b` - Name: "decide"
2. `idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e` - Name: "pay compensation"
3. `id8c2e27f2-838e-47e7-9506-1387d1d642eb` - Name: "check ticket"
4. `id1c963927-0fbe-4028-9d31-536a6e5362a9` - Name: "examine casually"
5. `id3a2e2f29-0e15-4dca-9602-6f8929a0dbcb` - Name: "register request"
6. `idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7` - Name: "reject request"
7. `idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2` - Name: "examine thoroughly"
8. `id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db` - Name: "reinitiate request"

These tasks represent specific activities that are part of the overall business process described by the BPMN model. Each task has a unique identifier (`id`) which is used to reference it in the process flow, particularly in the `sequenceFlow` elements that define the execution order of the process.
