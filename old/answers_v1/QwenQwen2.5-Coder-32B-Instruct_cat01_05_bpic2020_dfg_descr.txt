Certainly! This process appears to be a workflow for handling financial declarations or requests within an organization. The employees, administrators, budget owners, pre-approvers, and supervisors play various roles in either approving or rejecting these declarations. Here's a comprehensive description of the underlying process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - An **EMPLOYEE** submits a **DECLARATION**. This can lead to multiple outcomes:
     - The declaration can be **PASSED** to either the **ADMINISTRATION** for approval or directly to a **SUPERVISOR**.
     - The declaration may also be **REJECTED** by the **EMPLOYEE** and resubmitted.
     - There is even a possibility that the declaration can be **SAVED** by the **EMPLOYEE** to be handled later, and once ready, a **Request Payment** request can be made.

2. **Approval Process**:
   - The **DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** can lead to further approvals or rejections.
     - **ADMINISTRATION** can approve the declaration, moving it to **DECLARATION APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** or **DECLARATION APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**.
     - If rejected, it will go back to **EMPLOYEE**.
   - The **DECLARATION APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**:
     - Can also lead to final approval by the **SUPERVISOR**.
     - Can be rejected by the **SUPERVISOR** or **EMPLOYEE**.
     - Can be rescinded by the **BUDGET OWNER** with the declaration going back to the **EMPLOYEE**.
   - **SUPERVISOR** can handle the final approval for the declaration, which allows for a **Request Payment** request.
   - **PRE_APPROVER** can also handle declarations submitted by **EMPLOYEE**, approving them and passing to the **SUPERVISOR** for final approval.

3. **Request and Payment Handling**:
   - If all approvals are in order and **DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**, this leads to a **Request Payment** request.
   - **Request Payment** can be handled and finally resulting in **Payment Handled**.
   - In some cases, the request might skip the final approval and directly go to **Payment Handled**, indicating a streamlined process.
   
4. **Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - At any stage, a rejection can occur leading the declaration back to **EMPLOYEE** for resubmission or correction.
   - **DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, or MISSING** can result in the declaration going back to the **EMPLOYEE**.
   - If the **DECLARATION** is **REJECTED by MISSING**, it might go into a pending state or specific handling routine before being resubmitted by **EMPLOYEE**.

5. **For Approval Process**:
   - **EMPLOYEE** may mark the **DECLARATION FOR APPROVAL** specifically for different roles: **SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or ADMINISTRATION**.
   - These staged approvals can be part of a more complex approval workflow.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - There are special cases where declarations might be marked for differently named statuses, such as submitted or rejected by **MISSING**, which seem unusual and may require further investigation.

### Summary:
This workflow is a complex process involving approvals and rejections by various roles – EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, and SUPERVISOR. The goal is to ensure that all declarations are correctly approved before a payment request can be made and handled. Rejections occur at various points, allowing the process to cycle back to the EMPLOYEE for corrections or resubmission. This process includes necessary safeguards and checks to ensure the accuracy and flow of the workflow.
