Based on the provided data, here's a description of the underlying process. This process appears to be related to the handling of declarations, likely for some form of expense or payment requests within an organization. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Declaration Submission**:
   - The process begins with an `EMPLOYEE` submitting a declaration.
   - The declaration can be `SUBMITTED` directly to various approvers or initially `SAVED` by the employee.

2. **Initial Approval**:
   - After submission, the declaration can follow multiple paths:
     - Directly to `FINAL_APPROVED` by `SUPERVISOR`.
     - To `ADMINISTRATION` for approval.
     - To a `PRE_APPROVER` for initial approval.
     - To a `BUDGET OWNER` for approval.
     - Rarely, it can go to a state `FOR_APPROVAL` by different roles.

3. **Administration Approval**:
   - If the declaration is approved by `ADMINISTRATION`, it can then:
     - Go to `SUPERVISOR` for final approval.
     - Go to `BUDGET OWNER` for further approval.
     - Be rejected by `ADMINISTRATION`.

4. **Budget Owner Approval**:
   - If the declaration is approved by the `BUDGET OWNER`, it can:
     - Go to `SUPERVISOR` for final approval.
     - Be rejected by the `BUDGET OWNER`.

5. **Pre-Approver**:
   - If the declaration is approved by the `PRE_APPROVER`, it can:
     - Go to `SUPERVISOR` for final approval.
     - Be rejected by the `PRE_APPROVER`.

6. **Supervisor Final Approval**:
   - The `SUPERVISOR` can `FINAL_APPROVE` the declaration.
   - After `FINAL_APPROVED`, the process can move to `Request Payment`.
   - The `SUPERVISOR` can also reject the declaration.

7. **Request Payment**:
   - Once the declaration is `FINAL_APPROVED`, a `Request Payment` is initiated.
   - The payment is then `Handled`.

8. **Rejection Paths**:
   - At various stages (`ADMINISTRATION`, `BUDGET OWNER`, `PRE_APPROVER`, `SUPERVISOR`), the declaration can be rejected.
   - Rejections typically loop back to the `EMPLOYEE` for resubmission or to other stages for re-evaluation.
   - There are also rare cases where declarations are rejected due to missing information (`REJECTED by MISSING`).

9. **Performance and Frequency**:
   - The data includes performance metrics (likely time in seconds) and frequency counts for each transition.
   - High-frequency transitions indicate common paths, while low-frequency transitions indicate rare or exceptional cases.

10. **Special Cases**:
    - There are some very rare transitions, such as direct loops back to the employee or unusual rejection paths.
    - Some declarations are saved before being submitted, indicating a drafting phase.

This process map highlights the complexity and multiple approval layers involved in handling declarations, with various points of potential rejection and resubmission.
