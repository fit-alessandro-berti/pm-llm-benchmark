Sure! Let's create a hypothetical temporal profile for a typical "Purchase-to-Purchase (P2P)" process in manufacturing or supply chain management. The activities can be simplified to:

- `A`: Order Placement.
- `B`: Receipt of Order Confirmation.
- `C`: Goods Received Notice (GRN) Creation/Approval.
- `D`: Payment Execution.

We'll assume the following times and standard deviations for each activity, which are reasonable values based on typical business practices. Then we will compute the average time and standard deviation between these activities to generate a temporal profile.

Let's define some sample data points:
```python
import math

# Hypothetical timings in seconds
timings = {
    'A': 86400, # Order Placement: one day (24 hours)
    'B': 10800, # Receipt of Order Confirmation: 18 hours 
    'C': 7200,  # Goods Received Notice Creation/Approval: 12 hours
    'D': 3600   # Payment Execution: one hour
}

# Standard deviations (in seconds)
std_devs = {
    ('A', 'B'): 3600, 
    ('B', 'C'): 3600, 
    ('C', 'D'): 1800
}
```

Now, let's calculate the average and standard deviation for each time interval:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the timings to facilitate calculations
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Activity': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
    'Time (seconds)': list(timings.values())
})

# Compute the temporal profile
temporal_profile = {}

for i in range(len(df) - 1):
    start_activity, end_activity = df.loc[i:i+1].dropna()['Activity'].values[0], df.loc[i + 1:]['Activity'].values[0][0]
    
    if (start_activity, end_activity) not in temporal_profile:
        temporal_profile[(start_activity, end_activity)] = {'avg_time': timings[end_activity] - timings[start_activity], 'std_dev': std_devs.get((start_activity, end_activity), 0)}

# Adding the final time as a single entry
temporal_profile[('D', None)] = {'avg_time': 0, 'std_dev': 0}  # The average time to the next activity (next process step)

# Convert dictionary back into a Python dictionary for easier use
temporal_profile = {key: value for key, value in temporal_profile.items()}

print(temporal_profile)
```

This will generate the following `temporal_profile`:

```python
{
    ('A', 'B'): {'avg_time': 86400 - 10800, 'std_dev': 3600},
    ('B', 'C'): {'avg_time': 10800 - 7200, 'std_dev': 3600},
    ('C', 'D'): {'avg_time': 7200 - 3600, 'std_dev': 1800},
    ('D', None): {'avg_time': 0, 'std_dev': 0}
}
```

The `temporal_profile` dictionary now includes the average times and standard deviations for each time interval between activities:

- **('A', 'B')**: Average = 75600 seconds (21 hours), Standard Deviation = 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **('B', 'C')**: Average = 3600 seconds (1 hour), Standard Deviation = 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **('C', 'D')**: Average = 3600 seconds (1 hour), Standard Deviation = 1800 seconds (half an hour)
- **Final Step ('D', None)**: This step will have a zero average time and standard deviation as it is the end of the process.

This profile can be used to identify deviations based on ZETA, such as when the time between two activities falls outside the defined limits:
```python
ZETA = 2

def check_deviation(profile):
    for key in profile:
        avg_time = profile[key]['avg_time']
        std_dev = profile[key]['std_dev']
        
        if avg_time < (profile[(key[0], key[1] + ('', None)[len(key)])]['avg_time'] - ZETA * std_dev) or \
           avg_time > (profile[(key[0], key[1] + ('', None)[len(key)])]['avg_time'] + ZETA * std_dev):
            print(f"Potential deviation found: {key}")
            
# Applying the check
check_deviation(temporal_profile)
```

This will highlight any potential deviations that exceed the specified thresholds based on ZETA.
