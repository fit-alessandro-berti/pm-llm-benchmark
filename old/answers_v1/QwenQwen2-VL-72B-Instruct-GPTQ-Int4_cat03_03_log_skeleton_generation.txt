Sure, here's an example of a Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Order Received', 'Order Acknowledged')},
    'always_before': {('Order Placed', 'Order Received'), ('Invoice Received', 'Order Placed')},
    'always_after': {('Order Placed', 'Order Acknowledged'), ('Order Received', 'Order Processed')},
    'never_together': {('Order Received', 'Invoice Received')},
    'activ_freq': {'Order Placed': {1}, 'Order Received': {1}, 'Order Acknowledged': {1}, 'Order Processed': {1}, 'Invoice Received': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {('Order Placed', 'Order Received'), ('Order Received', 'Order Processed'), ('Order Processed', 'Order Acknowledged'), ('Order Processed', 'Invoice Received')}
}
```

This Log Skeleton model represents a simple Purchase-to-Pay process where an order is placed, received, acknowledged, and processed before an invoice is received. The model includes constraints such as equivalence between the Order Received and Order Acknowledged activities, always before constraints between the Order Placed and Order Received activities, always after constraints between the Order Placed and Order Acknowledged activities, never together constraints between the Order Received and Invoice Received activities, activity occurrences constraints for each activity, and directly follows constraints between the activities.
Note that this is just an example and the actual constraints and activities in a Purchase-to-Pay process may vary depending on the specific business process and requirements.
