In the context of fairness and non-discrimination in decision-making processes—such as hiring—sensitive attributes are those that can lead to biased outcomes if they influence the process in a way that disproportionately favors or disadvantages certain groups. Typically, sensitive attributes include demographics like gender, race, religion, nationality, or language-related characteristics, as these are protected categories in many legal frameworks and standards of ethical practice.

In the provided attributes, the following stand out as inherently sensitive with respect to fairness:

1. **case:gender**:  
   This attribute directly identifies the applicant’s gender. Using gender as a factor in deciding whether to hire, reject, or move an applicant forward in a process is often legally and ethically problematic.

2. **case:citizen**:  
   This attribute (True/False) presumably indicates whether the applicant is a citizen of a certain country. Citizenship or nationality status is often considered a protected or sensitive category. Using citizenship as a basis for unfair treatment may constitute discrimination.

3. **case:german speaking**:  
   This attribute (True/False) indicates whether the applicant is a German speaker. Language ability can sometimes be a job requirement, but when used improperly or when not relevant to the actual job responsibilities, language attributes can introduce bias against certain ethnic or national groups.

4. **case:religious**:  
   This attribute (True/False) indicates whether the applicant is religious. Religion is a protected category in many jurisdictions, and making decisions based on religious status or affiliation can be discriminatory.

**Why these are sensitive:**  
Attributes like gender, religious status, citizenship, and language can lead to discrimination if used improperly. Fairness frameworks and non-discrimination laws generally suggest treating all candidates equally, regardless of these personal characteristics. Leveraging such attributes directly or indirectly in decision-making can create unfair barriers or biases.

**Non-sensitive attributes example:**  
By contrast, attributes like "activity," "concept:name," "resource," or "time" are not typically considered sensitive in a fairness context. These attributes describe process steps, involved resources (like the type of interviewer), and timestamps, which are less likely to be protected by anti-discrimination laws and ethics guidelines.

In summary, the attributes from the provided list that are sensitive for fairness are those that reveal or strongly correlate with protected personal characteristics: **gender, citizen, german speaking, and religious**.
