26. Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 9, performance = 640007.778)

Now, let's identify the main differences:

1. **Registration Points:**
   - **Protected Group:** Registration primarily occurs at ER and FD.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Registration at FD is significantly more frequent, with many variants starting at FD.

2. **Examination Types:**
   - **Protected Group:** Examination is standard, with some variants including Expert Examination and Thorough Examination.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Includes Expert Examination and Thorough Examination, with a higher frequency of these in the process variants.

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment Steps:**
   - **Protected Group:** Includes standard Diagnosis and Treatment steps, with some variants having multiple unsuccessful treatments before successful discharge.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Similar steps but with a higher frequency of Treatment steps and multiple unsuccessful treatments before successful discharge.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Protected Group:** Performance metrics vary but generally range around 260,000.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Performance metrics are significantly higher, especially in variants with multiple unsuccessful treatments, reaching up to 640,000 and above.

5. **Discharge Outcomes:**
   - **Protected Group:** More straightforward discharge with fewer unsuccessful treatment attempts.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Higher frequency of multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts before successful discharge, indicating more complex treatment paths.

6. **Frequency of Variants:**
   - **Protected Group:** Many variants have low frequencies (e.g., frequency = 158, 156), indicating less common processes.
   - **Unprotected Group:** High-frequency variants (e.g., frequency = 1466, 1418) suggest more prevalent treatment pathways.

7. **Use of Thorough Examination:**
   - **Protected Group:** Thorough Examination is used but not as frequently as in the unprotected group.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Thorough Examination is a common step in many variants, emphasizing thoroughness in the treatment process.

8. **Unsuccessful Treatment Attempts:**
   - **Protected Group:** Some variants include multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts before successful discharge.
   - **Unprotected Group:** A higher number of variants include multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts, indicating more challenges in the treatment process.

In summary, the unprotected group exhibits more frequent and complex treatment pathways, with higher performance metrics and a greater number of unsuccessful treatment attempts before achieving successful discharge. This suggests that the unprotected group faces more challenges and requires more extensive processes to achieve treatment success compared to the protected group.

<Output>
The main differences between the treatment processes of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups are as follows:

1. **Registration Points:** The unprotected group shows a higher frequency of registration at FD, whereas the protected group registers at both ER and FD but with fewer variants.

2. **Examination Types:** Both groups include standard examinations, but the unprotected group frequently includes Expert and Thorough Examinations, indicating a more rigorous assessment process.

3. **Diagnosis and Treatment Steps:** Both groups have similar diagnosis and treatment steps, but the unprotected group has a higher frequency of multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts before achieving successful discharge.

4. **Performance Metrics:** The unprotected group exhibits significantly higher performance metrics, especially in variants with multiple unsuccessful treatments, reaching up to 640,000.

5. **Discharge Outcomes:** The unprotected group has more complex treatment paths with multiple unsuccessful attempts, while the protected group has more straightforward discharge processes.

6. **Frequency of Variants:** The unprotected group has highly frequent variants (e.g., frequency = 1466, 1418), indicating more prevalent treatment pathways, compared to the protected group's lower frequencies.

7. **Use of Thorough Examination:** Thorough Examination is more commonly used in the unprotected group, highlighting a focus on thoroughness in treatment processes.

8. **Unsuccessful Treatment Attempts:** The unprotected group includes multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts in a higher number of variants, suggesting more challenges in the treatment process.

Overall, the unprotected group demonstrates more complex and frequent treatment pathways with higher performance metrics and more extensive treatment steps before achieving successful discharge, indicating greater complexity and challenges in the treatment process compared to the protected group.
