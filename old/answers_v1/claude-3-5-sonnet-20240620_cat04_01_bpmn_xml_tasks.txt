Based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, here are the tasks in the process model:

1. decide
2. pay compensation
3. check ticket
4. examine casually
5. register request
6. reject request
7. examine thoroughly
8. reinitiate request

These tasks are defined in the XML using the <bpmn:task> elements, each with a unique id and name attribute.

Would you like me to explain any of these tasks or provide any additional information about the process model?
