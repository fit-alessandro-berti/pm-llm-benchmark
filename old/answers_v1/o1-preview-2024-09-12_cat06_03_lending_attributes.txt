In the context of fairness analysis within process mining and data processing, sensitive attributes are those that can lead to biased or discriminatory outcomes if not handled carefully. These attributes are often protected by law and include characteristics such as gender, nationality, ethnicity, language proficiency, and citizenship status.

**Sensitive Attributes in the Given Event Log:**

1. **`case:citizen`**
   - **Values:** `True`, `False`
   - **Explanation:** Citizenship status is a sensitive attribute because decisions or processes should not discriminate against individuals based on whether they are citizens or non-citizens. Using this attribute in process analysis or automated decision-making could lead to unfair treatment of non-citizens.

2. **`case:gender`**
   - **Values:** `True`, `False`
   - **Explanation:** Gender is a classic sensitive attribute as per anti-discrimination laws and fairness guidelines. Processes should ensure that individuals are not treated differently based on their gender, and any analysis should prevent gender bias.

3. **`case:german speaking`**
   - **Values:** `True`, `False`
   - **Explanation:** Language proficiency, particularly related to a specific language like German, can be a sensitive attribute. Discrimination based on language can indirectly relate to ethnicity or national origin, which are protected characteristics. Ensuring fairness means that individuals should not face adverse decisions due to their language abilities.

**Non-Sensitive Attributes:**

- **`activity`** and **`concept:name`**
  - Represent the steps or events in the process; they are operational data rather than personal characteristics.
- **`resource`**
  - Refers to the entity (e.g., system or personnel) performing the activity; while important for process analysis, it is not a personal attribute of the case and thus not sensitive in this context.
- **`start_timestamp`, `time`, and `time:timestamp`**
  - These are temporal attributes indicating when events occurred. They are not sensitive as they do not relate to personal characteristics that could lead to discrimination.

**Conclusion:**

The sensitive attributes in this event log are:

- **`case:citizen`**
- **`case:gender`**
- **`case:german speaking`**

These attributes should be handled with care to ensure that the process analysis or any automated decisions derived from this data do not result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes based on citizenship status, gender, or language proficiency.

**Answer:**

The attributes that are sensitive for fairness are:
-case:citizen
-case:gender
-case:german speaking
