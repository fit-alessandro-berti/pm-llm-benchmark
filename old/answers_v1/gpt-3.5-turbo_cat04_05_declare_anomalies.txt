One anomaly in the proposed process model is the Existence constraint for the activity Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR. The Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR activity has an Exactly 1 constraint attached to it, which contradicts the Existence constraint. This means that the activity is meant to be executed exactly once, but the Existence constraint implies that it should be executed at least once.

Another anomaly is the Chain response constraint for the activities Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR and Request Payment. The Chain response constraint states that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must directly follow it. However, in this case, the Request Payment activity does not directly follow the Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR activity as specified in the constraint.

Lastly, the Chain succession constraint for the activities Request Payment and Payment Handled is also anomalous. The Chain succession constraint states that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must directly follow it. In this case, the Request Payment activity does not directly lead to the Payment Handled activity, which violates the constraint.
