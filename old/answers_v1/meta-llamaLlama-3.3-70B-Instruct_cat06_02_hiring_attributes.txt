Based on the provided event log attributes, the following attributes can be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant, which is a sensitive attribute for fairness. Gender bias can be a significant issue in hiring processes, and analyzing this attribute can help identify potential biases.
2. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. This can be a sensitive attribute for fairness, as citizenship status can be a factor in hiring decisions, and biases may exist against non-citizens.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant speaks German or not. While language proficiency can be a relevant factor in hiring decisions, it can also be a sensitive attribute for fairness, as language proficiency can be correlated with ethnicity or national origin.
4. **case:religious**: This attribute indicates whether the applicant has a religious affiliation or not. This can be a sensitive attribute for fairness, as religious discrimination can be a significant issue in hiring processes.

These attributes can be used to analyze fairness in the hiring process, such as:

* **Disparate impact**: Analyzing whether certain groups (e.g., women, non-citizens, non-German speakers, or individuals with a specific religious affiliation) are disproportionately affected by the hiring process.
* **Disparate treatment**: Analyzing whether certain groups are treated differently during the hiring process, such as being more likely to be rejected or offered a job.
* **Fairness metrics**: Calculating fairness metrics, such as demographic parity, equalized odds, or calibration, to evaluate the fairness of the hiring process with respect to these sensitive attributes.

By analyzing these attributes and their relationships with the hiring process, you can identify potential biases and areas for improvement to ensure a fair and inclusive hiring process.
