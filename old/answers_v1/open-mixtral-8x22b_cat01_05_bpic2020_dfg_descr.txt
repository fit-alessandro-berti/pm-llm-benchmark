This data represents a process for handling expense declarations in an organization. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. An employee submits an expense declaration.
2. The declaration can then follow different paths based on approval or rejection by various roles:
   - The declaration can be approved by an administrator and then forwarded for approval to either the budget owner or the supervisor. If approved by the budget owner, it goes to the supervisor for final approval. If approved by the supervisor, a payment request is made.
   - The declaration can also be approved by a pre-approver, after which it goes to the supervisor for final approval, and then a payment request is made.
3. If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it is sent back to the employee who can then resubmit it. The rejection can occur due to various reasons, such as missing information or non-compliance with company policies.
4. Once a payment request is made, it is handled by the relevant department.
5. If a payment is rejected, it can be sent back to the declaration stage for correction and resubmission.

The frequency and performance metrics indicate how often each step occurs and how long it takes respectively. However, the units of measurement for the performance are not specified in the provided data.
