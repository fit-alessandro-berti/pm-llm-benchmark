To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each couple of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution. However, the provided process variants do not contain the time information between activities. To proceed, I'll assume that the "frequency" column represents the number of times each process variant was executed, and the "performance" column represents the total time taken for each process variant in seconds.

Here's a Python script that generates a temporal profile based on the given assumptions:

```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data (replace this with your actual data)
data = [
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", 56482, 59591524.946),
    ("Create Fine", "Payment", 46371, 889688.400),
    # ... rest of the data ...
]

# Create a DataFrame from the sample data
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["Activity1", "Activity2", "Frequency", "Performance"])

# Calculate the total time for each couple of activities
total_time = df.groupby(["Activity1", "Activity2"]).sum()["Performance"]

# Calculate the average time for each couple of activities
avg_time = total_time / df.groupby(["Activity1", "Activity2"]).sum()["Frequency"]

# Calculate the standard deviation of the time for each couple of activities
std_time = df.groupby(["Activity1", "Activity2"]).std()["Performance"] / df.groupby(["Activity1", "Activity2"]).sum()["Frequency"]

# Create a temporal profile dictionary
temporal_profile = defaultdict(list)
for (activity1, activity2), (avg, std) in zip(total_time.index, avg_time.values):
    temporal_profile[(activity1, activity2)].append((avg, std))

# Print the temporal profile
for (activity1, activity2), times in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"({activity1}, {activity2}): {times}")
```

This script will output the temporal profile as a dictionary with couples of activities as keys and a list of tuples containing the average and standard deviation of the times as values. In case there are multiple paths between the same couple of activities, the list will contain multiple tuples.

Please note that this script assumes that the "Performance" column represents the total time taken for each process variant in seconds. If your data has a different format or contains different information, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.

Since the provided process variants do not contain time information, I cannot run the script with the given data. However, you can use the script as a template and adapt it to your specific use case.
