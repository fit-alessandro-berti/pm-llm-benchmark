Based on the provided process variants, the underlying process appears to be a declaration or claim submission and approval workflow, likely within an organizational context. Here's a breakdown of the process:

### Core Process Steps:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**:
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration.

2. **Initial Approval Steps**:
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**:
     - The declaration is approved by the administration.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**:
     - The declaration is approved by a pre-approver.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**:
     - The declaration is approved by the budget owner.

3. **Final Approval**:
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**:
     - The declaration is finally approved by a supervisor.

4. **Payment Process**:
   - **Request Payment**:
     - A request for payment is made.
   - **Payment Handled**:
     - The payment is processed and handled.

### Variations and Rejections:
1. **Rejections**:
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**:
     - The declaration is rejected by the administration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**:
     - The declaration is rejected by the pre-approver.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**:
     - The declaration is rejected by the budget owner.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**:
     - The declaration is rejected by the supervisor.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**:
     - The declaration is rejected due to missing information.

2. **Re-submissions**:
   - After a rejection, the employee can resubmit the declaration.
   - This can lead to multiple cycles of rejections and re-submissions.

### Performance and Frequency:
- **Frequency**: Indicates how often each variant occurs.
- **Performance**: Likely represents the time taken for each variant to complete.

### Key Observations:
1. **Common Paths**:
   - The most common path is `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled` with a frequency of 4618.
   - Another frequent path includes an additional approval step by the budget owner.

2. **Rejection Cycles**:
   - There are multiple variants where the declaration is rejected and resubmitted, sometimes multiple times.
   - Rejections can occur at various stages (administration, pre-approver, budget owner, supervisor) and can lead to significant delays.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - Some variants involve rejections due to missing information.
   - There are cases where the declaration is saved by the employee but not submitted.

### Summary:
The process involves employees submitting declarations, which go through various approval steps. Rejections can occur at any step, leading to resubmissions and additional approval cycles. The final approval by the supervisor is a critical step before requesting and handling payment. The variants show the complexity and potential inefficiencies in the process, especially when rejections and resubmissions occur.

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Reduce Rejections**:
   - Improve the initial submission process to reduce the likelihood of rejections.
   - Provide clear guidelines and checklists for employees to ensure complete and accurate submissions.

2. **Streamline Approval Process**:
   - Simplify the approval steps where possible.
   - Implement automated checks to catch common errors early in the process.

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Continuously monitor the performance of each variant to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
   - Use data analytics to predict and mitigate potential delays.

By addressing these areas, the process can become more efficient and less prone to delays and rejections.
