In the context of fairness in process mining, attribute sensitivity refers to the attributes that affect the behavior of process models, such as the likelihood of certain paths being taken or the performance of certain activities. In order for an attribute to be considered sensitive for fairness, it must have a significant impact on the outcome of the evaluation of fairness.

Looking at the provided data, the attributes with potentials for sensitive values affecting fairness are:

* `case:citizen`
* `case:gender`
* `case:german speaking`
* `case:private_insurance`
* `case:underlying_condition`
* `resource`

These attributes are considered sensitive because they have a mix of frequency and performance metrics that might be different across different values. For example, the distribution of frequency and performance for different resources (Doc. Low, Doc. Pro, Nurse 3, etc.) might show fairness or bias concerns.

However, the sensitivity of an attribute would need to be evaluated rigorously through fairness computations to identify any biases. The eventual choice of sensitive attributes will depend on the outcome of those fairness computations.
