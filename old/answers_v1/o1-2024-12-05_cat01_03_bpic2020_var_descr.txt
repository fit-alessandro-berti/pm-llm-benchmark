The data appears to represent a complex, real-world approval workflow for something called a "Declaration," likely a form or document submitted by employees—possibly expense claims, reimbursement requests, or some other financial or administrative request. The process involves multiple actors with different roles and authority levels, and it can loop through various approval and rejection steps before the request either concludes successfully (with payment handled) or terminates (fully rejected and closed).

**Key Characteristics of the Underlying Process:**

1. **Initial Submission:**  
   The process generally begins with an action like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE." This suggests the employee initiates the process by submitting a declaration or request that needs to be reviewed and approved.

2. **Multiple Approval Layers:**
   After submission, the declaration can pass through various approval stages involving different roles:
   - **ADMINISTRATION:** An administrative approval layer.
   - **BUDGET OWNER:** Approval from the person or department responsible for the budget from which funds would be allocated.
   - **PRE_APPROVER:** Possibly a preliminary check before final authorization.
   - **SUPERVISOR:** A final level of management or supervisory approval.

   The process does not always require all of these steps—some variants are simpler, only going through ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR, while others are more complex and include BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER.

3. **Rejections and Iterations:**
   The process can be rejected at various stages. For example:
   - "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"
   - "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER"
   - "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"
   - "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER"
   - And even "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE," which might mean the employee withdraws or acknowledges the rejection.

   When a rejection occurs, it often leads to the declaration looping back to the EMPLOYEE for resubmission. This explains the presence of sequences like:
   - SUBMITTED -> REJECTED -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED again
   This cyclical pattern indicates a corrective workflow, where the employee modifies or clarifies the request and then resubmits it until approval is obtained, or they give up.

4. **Final Approval and Payment:**
   Once a declaration successfully passes all required approval steps, it moves towards the financial execution phase:
   - "Request Payment" -> "Payment Handled"

   This signifies the close of the transaction where the employee’s declaration is fully approved and paid out.

5. **Performance and Frequency Indicators:**
   Each variant is associated with:
   - **Frequency:** How often that particular path through the process occurred.
   - **Performance (time):** A measurement (likely total throughput time) it took for the process to run from start to end for that variant. High performance values could mean the process took longer on average, possibly due to multiple rejection loops or complex approval chains.

   For example, a simpler path (Employee -> Administration -> Supervisor -> Payment) has a shorter or medium performance time, while a complex route with multiple rejections and resubmissions has a much higher performance time.

6. **MISSING Approver Role:**
   Occasionally, there is a "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING," which might indicate data quality issues, placeholders for unidentified approvers, or an exceptional case in the workflow logging.

7. **Saved but Not Submitted Requests:**
   There are instances like "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" with no further steps. This suggests that employees can prepare declarations, save them in the system, and not proceed to submission.

**Overall Description:**

This is a multi-layered approval process for declarations that employees initiate. The process is designed with multiple checkpoints (administrative checks, budget owner reviews, pre-approvals, and supervisory final approvals) before concluding with a payment step. Rejections can occur at any of these points, causing the process to return to the employee for corrections or additional information. Over multiple cycles of re-submission and approval, the declaration either achieves final approval and triggers payment or remains stuck in a cycle of rejections until it is abandoned.

Thus, the underlying process can be described as a complex, multi-step authorization and compliance workflow, typically found in corporate or organizational finance and administrative systems, where an employee’s submitted declaration must navigate through various hierarchical and role-based approvals before final settlement.
