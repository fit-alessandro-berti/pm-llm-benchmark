Certainly. Based on the provided process variants, here's a DECLARE model in the form of a Python dictionary:

```python
from pm4py.algo.discovery.declare import algorithm as declare_discovery

# Initialize the DECLARE model
declare_model = declare_discovery.apply(log)

# Update the model with the provided process variants
for variant in process_variants:
    declare_model.update(variant)

# Print the DECLARE model
print(declare_model)
```

Please note that the `process_variants` variable should contain the list of process variants provided in the question. The `declare_discovery.apply` function is used to discover the DECLARE model from the event log, and the `update` method is used to update the model with the provided process variants.

This is a basic example of how to generate a DECLARE model using the PM4Py library. You may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements and the structure of the event log.
