Here's a sample implementation of a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Create the nodes of the POWL model
purchase_order = Transition(label="Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
make_payment = Transition(label="Make Payment")
pay_third_party = Transition(label="Pay Third Party")

purchase_to_pay = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[purchase_order, receive_goods])
make_payment_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[make_payment, pay_third_party])

# Create the POWL model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[purchase_to_pay, make_payment_loop])

# Define the execution order between nodes
root.order.add_edge(purchase_to_pay, make_payment_loop)
root.order.add_edge(make_payment_loop, make_payment)

# Add a silent transition to represent any potential issues during payment
payment_issue = SilentTransition()

# Add an operator that allows either receiving goods or making payment to proceed
receive_goods_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_goods, purchase_order])
pay_third_party_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[pay_third_party, make_payment])

# Define the execution order between nodes in a loop
root.order.add_edge(receive_goods, receive_goods_loop)
root.order.add_edge(make_payment, pay_third_party_loop)
root.order.add_edge(pay_third_party, payment_issue)

print(root)
```

In this example, we create a POWL model that represents the Purchase-to-Pay process. The `purchase_to_pay` node is an exclusive choice between receiving goods and making payment. Once one of these branches is completed, it leads to either `make_payment_loop`, which can be executed in a loop until the payment is made, or to `payment_issue`, which represents any potential issues that may arise during payment.

The `receive_goods_loop` node allows for the option to receive goods and then return to the beginning of this loop. Similarly, the `pay_third_party_loop` node enables the option to pay a third party and then repeat the process until the payment is made.

Note that the execution order between nodes in both loops must be explicitly defined using the `.order.add_edge()` method. This ensures that the correct sequence of events is executed according to the POWL model.

When you run this code, it will create a POWL model that represents the Purchase-to-Pay process and print the structure of the model to the console.
