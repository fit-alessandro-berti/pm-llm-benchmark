Certainly! Here is a list of 20 relevant questions about the BPMN process, along with their respective confidence scores:

1. **What is the first task performed after the process starts?**
   - Confidence Score: 100%

2. **How many tasks are there in total in the process?**
   - Confidence Score: 100%

3. **What is the sequence of tasks performed before the "Puncture" task?**
   - Confidence Score: 95%

4. **Which gateway is used to decide between "Doppler identification", "Anatomic identification", and "Compression identification"?**
   - Confidence Score: 95%

5. **What is the final task before the process ends?**
