The provided visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that represents a credit scoring process. The diagram is divided into two main sections: "credit scoring (bank)" and "scoring service."

**Credit Scoring (Bank) Section:**
1. **Initial Event (scoring request received):** This event triggers the process.
2. **Task (request credit score):** The bank requests a credit score.
3. **Gateway (exclusive XOR split):** This is a decision point where the process can take one of two paths based on the delay information received.
   - Path 1: If delay information is received, the process moves to the "report delay" activity.
   - Path 2: If no delay information is received, the process moves to the "credit score received" activity.
4. **Task (report delay):** The bank reports a delay.
5. **Gateway (exclusive XOR merge):** This is another decision point where the process can take one of two paths based on the credit score received.
   - Path 1: If credit score is received, the process moves to the "send credit score" activity.
   - Path 2: If no credit score is received, the process loops back to "request credit score."
6. **Task (send credit score):** The bank sends the credit score.
7. **End Event (scoring request handled):** The process is completed.

**Scoring Service Section:**
1. **Initial Event (scoring request received):** This event triggers the process.
2. **Task (compute credit score (level 1)):** The scoring service computes the credit score at level 1.
3. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** This is a decision point where the process can take one of two paths based on whether the score is available.
   - Path 1: If the score is available, the process moves to the "send credit score" activity.
   - Path 2: If the score is not available, the process moves to the "report delay" activity.
4. **Task (report delay):** The scoring service reports a delay.
5. **Sequence Flow:** The process loops back to "compute credit score (level 1)" to recompute the score.
6. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** This is another decision point where the process can take one of two paths based on whether the score is available.
   - Path 1: If the score is available, the process moves to the "send credit score" activity.
   - Path 2: If the score is not available, the process loops back to "report delay."
7. **Task (compute credit score (level 2)):** The scoring service computes the credit score at level 2.
8. **Task (send credit score):** The scoring service sends the credit score.
9. **End Event (scoring request handled):** The process is completed.

The diagram includes message queues indicated by the ID for message queueing, which is crucial for managing communication between the different components of the process.
