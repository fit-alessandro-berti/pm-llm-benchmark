Based on the provided declarative constraints, here's a description of the underlying process:

**Process Name:** Expense Approval and Payment

**Actors:**
1. Employee
2. Pre-Approver (likely a manager or a specific role)
3. Administration (likely a finance or HR department)
4. Budget Owner (likely a department head or a specific role)
5. Supervisor (likely a higher-level manager)
6. Missing (unknown or unassigned)

**Process Steps:**

1. **Expense Submission:**
   - The Employee submits an expense declaration for approval (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

2. **Pre-Approval:**
   - The Pre-Approver reviews and either approves, rejects, or saves the declaration.
     - If approved, the declaration is marked as 'APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER'.
     - If rejected, the declaration is marked as 'REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' with a reason.
     - If saved, the declaration is marked as 'SAVED by EMPLOYEE' and can be reviewed later.
   - The Pre-Approver can also request a payment (Request Payment) after approving the declaration.

3. **Administrative Review:**
   - The Administration reviews and either approves, rejects, or saves the declaration.
     - If approved, the declaration is marked as 'APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION'.
     - If rejected, the declaration is marked as 'REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' with a reason.
     - If saved, the declaration is marked as 'SAVED by EMPLOYEE' and can be reviewed later.
   - The Administration can also handle the payment (Payment Handled) after approving the declaration.

4. **Supervisor Review:**
   - The Supervisor reviews and either approves, rejects, or final approves the declaration.
     - If approved, the declaration is marked as 'APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.
     - If rejected, the declaration is marked as 'REJECTED by SUPERVISOR' with a reason.
     - If final approved, the declaration is marked as 'FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.
   - The Supervisor can also request a payment (Request Payment) after approving the declaration.

5. **Budget Owner Review:**
   - The Budget Owner reviews and either approves or rejects the declaration.
     - If approved, the declaration is marked as 'APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER'.
     - If rejected, the declaration is marked as 'REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER' with a reason.

6. **Rejection Reasons:**
   - Rejections can occur due to missing information (REJECTED by MISSING), or based on the review of the Pre-Approver, Administration, Supervisor, or Budget Owner.

**Process Flow:**

- The process starts with the Employee submitting an expense declaration.
- The declaration then goes through a series of approvals/rejections by the Pre-Approver, Administration, Supervisor, and Budget Owner.
- Each actor can approve, reject, or save the declaration. If approved, the declaration moves to the next actor. If rejected, the process ends with the rejection reason. If saved, the declaration can be reviewed later.
- Payments can be requested or handled at the Pre-Approver or Administration stages.
- The final approval comes from the Supervisor, marking the declaration as 'FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.

**Additional Notes:**

- Some activities have bounds on the number of occurrences, indicating that certain actions can happen multiple times within a case (e.g., 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' can occur up to 7 times).
- Some activities are directly followed by specific other activities, indicating a strict order (e.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' is directly followed by 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE').
- Certain activities cannot co-exist within the same case (e.g., 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' and 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' cannot both occur).
