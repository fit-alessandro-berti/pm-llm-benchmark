In the given context, the attributes that could potentially be sensitive for fairness are:

1. 'case:citizen': This attribute could be considered sensitive as it might indirectly reveal the ethnicity of the individual, which could lead to unfair treatment based on racial profiling.

2. 'case:gender': This attribute is directly related to gender and could potentially lead to unfair treatment based on gender stereotypes or assumptions.

3. 'case:german speaking': This attribute could be sensitive if it's related to the nationality or ethnicity of the individual, which could potentially lead to unfair treatment based on assumptions about language proficiency or cultural background.

4. 'case:married': This attribute could be sensitive if it's used to make assumptions about the individual's financial situation, family status, or personal circumstances, which could potentially lead to unfair treatment.

5. 'resource': This attribute indicates the person or entity interacting with the individual during the process, such as real estate agents or lawyers. If there are disparities in the performance of these resources, it could lead to unfair treatment based on the resource involved.

It's important to note that sensitivity can also depend on the context and the specific use case. Additionally, the fairness of an attribute might not be clear from the data alone and could require additional context or domain knowledge.
