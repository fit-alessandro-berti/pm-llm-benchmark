1. Petri net: This is an abstract graphical representation used in mathematical modeling and computer science for describing complex systems such as communication networks, chemical reaction networks, biological systems, etc.

2. Source Place: A place in a petri net that represents the source of any tokens entering it (i.e., from other places). The number of tokens in a source place is equal to the number of transitions in the net that are enabled by those tokens.

3. Immediate Transition: An immediate transition in a Petri net operates directly on the number of tokens in the current state of the net, without any token being sent into or out of it until after all other transitions have completed. It is marked by a small circle and consumes one or more tokens from its pre-places and produces one or more tokens to its post-places.

4. Live Transition: A live transition in a Petri net operates on the number of tokens within the current state of the net, consuming or producing them as needed without requiring an external input or output token stream until after all other transitions have completed. It is marked by a small circle and consumes one or more tokens from its pre-places and produces one or more tokens to its post-places.

5. Bounded Net: A bounded Petri net is one that has no internal loops (i.e., there are no places with more than 1 token). It ensures the system can operate indefinitely without entering an infinite loop, thereby guaranteeing termination of simulation under certain conditions.

6. Free Choice Net: This type of Petri net allows a transition to be triggered by zero or one tokens in its pre-place and produces zero or one tokens in its post-place. These transitions are free because they do not rely on any external input/output channel, making them more independent than live transitions but less constrained than immediate transitions.
