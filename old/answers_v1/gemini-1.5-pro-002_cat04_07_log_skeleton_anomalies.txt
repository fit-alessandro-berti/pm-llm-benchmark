The provided constraints have several conflicting and redundant declarations, leading to anomalies in the process model. Here are some examples:

1. **Conflicting Equivalence and Never Together:**  Several activities declared as equivalent are also declared as never together.  This is a direct contradiction.  For example:

* `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR')` (Equivalence)
* `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR')` (Never Together - implied by the chain of equivalences with other Never Together constraints)
If ADMINISTRATION makes a FOR_APPROVAL declaration, SUPERVISOR must also make one due to equivalence, but they can never occur together due to the Never Together constraint. This makes the process impossible to execute correctly.  This conflict appears in numerous places with chains of equivalence leading to implied Never Together violations.

2. **Conflicting Always Before/After and Never Together:** Some activities have Always Before/After relationships but are also marked as Never Together. This creates a conflict. For example:

* `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE')` (Always Before)
* Many `Never Together` constraints involving  `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` and other activities equivalent to `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` effectively imply `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` and `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` can't occur together.

How can `'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'` always occur *after*  `'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'` if they can never be in the same case?

3. **Redundant Directly-Follows and Always Before/After:** There's redundancy between Directly-Follows and Always Before/After constraints. For instance:

* `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')` (Directly-Follows)
* `('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING')` (Always After - implied, since Directly-Follows is a stronger constraint)


4. **Unrealistic Equivalence:**  Some equivalence constraints seem unrealistic in a business process context.  Why would a "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" *always* be equivalent to "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled"?  This implies every request for approval instantly results in payment being handled, which is unusual.

5. **Overuse of Equivalence:** The extensive use of equivalence significantly reduces the flexibility and expressiveness of the model.  It forces many activities to occur together, which may not reflect the actual business process.


**In summary:**  The model's heavy reliance on equivalence, combined with conflicting Never Together and Always Before/After declarations, creates a tangled web of constraints that renders the process model impractical and likely impossible to execute without violating constraints.  The model needs significant revision to resolve these conflicts and more accurately represent the intended workflow.  A better approach would be to carefully analyze the actual business process and express the constraints in a less restrictive and more logical manner, potentially reducing the use of equivalence and focusing on the essential ordering and exclusion relationships between activities.
