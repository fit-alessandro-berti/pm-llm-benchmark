Based on the provided Log Skeleton process model, the underlying **Declaration Approval Process** can be described as a complex, multi-role workflow with various approval stages, possible rejections, and iterative steps. Here's a comprehensive overview of the process:

### **1. Initiation**
- **Declaration Submission:**
  - The process begins when an **Employee** submits a **Declaration**. This is captured by the activity **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"**.
  - Alternatively, an employee can **save** the declaration as a draft, indicated by **"Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"**.

### **2. Approval Stages**
The declaration undergoes a series of approvals by different roles, each with specific responsibilities and possible outcomes:

- **Administration Approval:**
  - **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"** is a key activity where the **Administration** reviews the declaration.
  - **Possible Outcomes:**
    - **Approval:** Leads to **"Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION"**.
    - **Rejection:** Results in **"Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"**.
    - **Submission by Employee:** If rejected, the employee may need to **resubmit** or **revise** the declaration.

- **Supervisor Approval:**
  - **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"** involves the **Supervisor** in the approval process.
  - **Possible Outcomes:**
    - **Final Approval:** Achieved through **"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"**.
    - **Rejection:** Leads to **"Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"**.
    - **Interaction with Budget Owner:** Approval may also involve the **Budget Owner** via **"Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER"** or **"Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER"**.

- **Pre-approver Review:**
  - **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER"** signifies the involvement of a **Pre-approver**.
  - **Possible Outcomes:**
    - **Approval:** Document proceeds to further approvals.
    - **Rejection:** Can result in **"Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER"** or **"Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"**.

### **3. Handling Rejections**
Rejections can occur at multiple stages, each necessitating specific actions:

- **Rejection by Various Roles:**
  - **Administration**, **Supervisor**, **Pre-approver**, and **Employee** can all reject the declaration, leading to different paths:
    - **Rework and Resubmission:** The employee may need to revise and resubmit the declaration.
    - **Termination of Process:** Certain rejections may prevent further processing.

- **Constraints on Rejections:**
  - **Never Together Constraints:** Ensure that conflicting outcomes (e.g., **"Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"** and **"Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER"**) do not coexist within the same case.
  - **Activity Occurrence Limits:** Rejections can occur a limited number of times (e.g., **"Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE"** can occur up to 6 times).

### **4. Payment Handling**
Upon successful approvals, the process moves towards handling payments:

- **Payment Requests:**
  - **"Request Payment"** can be initiated after certain approvals.
  
- **Payment Processing:**
  - **"Payment Handled"** indicates that the payment has been processed.
  
- **Constraints and Sequences:**
  - **Always Before:** Certain approvals must occur before payment requests.
  - **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Specific sequences like **"Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"** immediately followed by **"Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE"** ensure proper workflow order.

### **5. Finalization**
The process culminates in the final approval or closure of the declaration:

- **Final Approval:**
  - **"Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"** signifies the completion of the approval process.
  
- **Closure:**
  - Once all approvals are secured and payments are handled, the declaration process is concluded.

### **6. Iterative and Parallel Paths**
The declarative constraints allow for flexibility in the process flow:

- **Equivalence Constraints:**
  - Ensure that certain approval or rejection activities occur equivalently, maintaining process consistency.
  
- **Activity Occurrence Constraints:**
  - Limit the number of times specific activities can repeat, preventing infinite loops and ensuring process efficiency.

- **Never Together Constraints:**
  - Prevent conflicting activities from occurring simultaneously, maintaining logical integrity.

### **7. Exception Handling**
The process includes mechanisms to handle exceptions and deviations:

- **Rejections by Missing Information:**
  - **"Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"** indicates incomplete submissions, prompting the employee to provide necessary details.

- **Saving Drafts:**
  - Employees can save declarations as drafts (**"Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"**), allowing for iterative improvements before final submission.

### **8. Role Interactions**
Multiple roles interact throughout the process, each with specific responsibilities:

- **Employee:** Initiates and possibly revises declarations.
- **Pre-approver:** Conducts initial reviews and approvals.
- **Supervisor:** Provides higher-level approvals and finalizes the declaration.
- **Administration:** Oversees the process, handles approvals, rejections, and payment processing.
- **Budget Owner:** Involved in financial approvals related to the declaration.

### **Summary Workflow Diagram**

While a precise visual diagram isn't provided, the workflow can be conceptualized as follows:

1. **Employee Submits Declaration** → 2. **Pre-approver Review** → 3. **Supervisor Review** → 4. **Administration Review** → 5. **Budget Owner Approval** → 6. **Payment Handling** → 7. **Final Approval by Supervisor** → 8. **Process Completion**

Throughout this flow, **rejections** at any stage can redirect the process back to the employee for revisions or terminate the process based on the constraints.

### **Key Characteristics of the Process:**

- **Declarative Nature:** The process does not follow a strict sequential path but adheres to constraints that govern the relationships and order of activities.
- **Flexibility:** Multiple roles can approve or reject declarations, allowing for parallel processing and decision-making.
- **Robust Constraint Enforcement:** Ensures process integrity through equivalence, ordering, mutual exclusivity, and occurrence limitations.
