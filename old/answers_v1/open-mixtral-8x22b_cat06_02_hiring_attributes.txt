In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are typically those that could potentially lead to discrimination or bias. In this given event log, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. case:citizen: This attribute indicates whether the job applicant is a citizen or not. This could potentially lead to discrimination based on nationality or citizenship status.

2. case:gender: This attribute indicates the gender of the job applicant. This could potentially lead to gender-based discrimination.

3. case:religious: This attribute indicates whether the job applicant has a religious affiliation or not. This could potentially lead to discrimination based on religion.

4. case:german speaking: This attribute indicates whether the job applicant speaks German or not. This could potentially lead to discrimination based on language proficiency.

In order to ensure fairness, it's important to analyze the process with respect to these sensitive attributes to ensure that there's no bias or discrimination in the hiring process. For example, you might want to check if the probability of being rejected is the same for citizens and non-citizens, for different genders, for different religious affiliations, and for German and non-German speakers. If there are significant differences, this could be an indication of potential bias or discrimination.
