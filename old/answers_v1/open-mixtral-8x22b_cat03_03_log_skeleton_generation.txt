I'm glad to help you generate a hypothetical Log Skeleton model for a Purchase-to-Pay process! Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-life processes may involve additional activities, constraints, and variations.

Here's a Python dictionary representing a Log Skeleton for a Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set([('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Send Purchase Order'),
                        ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment')]),
    'always_before': set([('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Send Purchase Order'),
                          ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'),
                          ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment')]),
    'always_after': set([('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods')]),
    'never_together': set([('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Make Payment')]),
    'activ_freq': {'Create Purchase Requisition': {1},
                   'Send Purchase Order': {1},
                   'Receive Goods': {1},
                   'Receive Invoice': {1},
                   'Make Payment': {1}},
    'directly_follows': set([('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Send Purchase Order'),
                             ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'),
                             ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'),
                             ('Receive Invoice', 'Make Payment')])
}
```

In this model:

1. 'equivalence' indicates that 'Create Purchase Requisition' and 'Send Purchase Order' have the same occurrences, as do 'Receive Invoice' and 'Make Payment'.
2. 'always_before' dictates the order of activities, such as 'Create Purchase Requisition' occurring before 'Send Purchase Order'.
3. 'always_after' ensures that 'Send Purchase Order' is executed before 'Receive Goods'.
4. 'never_together' prevents 'Create Purchase Requisition' and 'Make Payment' from occurring in the same case.
5. 'activ_freq' specifies that each activity can only occur once within a single case.
6. 'directly_follows' constraints ensure the immediate succession of activities as described in the process.
