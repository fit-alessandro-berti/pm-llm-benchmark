The provided data shows significant performance variations across different process variants.  Here's a breakdown of potential root causes based on frequency and performance:

1. **Rejections leading to rework:** Several variants involve multiple rejection loops significantly impacting performance.  Specifically:

    * Variants involving rejection by ADMINISTRATION, often followed by re-submission and eventual approval, exhibit very high performance values (e.g., 1604595.638, 2061236.516, 2542497.917, 2790977.310, 3502608.250).  This suggests inefficiencies in the ADMINISTRATION rejection process, requiring extensive rework.  The root cause could be unclear rejection reasons, inadequate information provided by employees initially, or problems within the ADMINISTRATION's review process.

    * Similarly, rejections by SUPERVISOR and PRE_APPROVER also contribute to performance issues, though less severely than ADMINISTRATION rejections. This suggests similar potential root causes within those rejection processes.

    * The variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION ( frequency = 5  performance = 13805869.200 )" stands out with drastically higher performance despite a low frequency.  This requires further investigation.  Is this an outlier? Are there data quality issues?  The high performance suggests a systemic issue tied specifically to these particular rejections by ADMINISTRATION, perhaps involving complex cases or exceptions.

2. **Involvement of BUDGET OWNER:**  Variants involving the BUDGET OWNER stage tend to have higher performance values compared to those without (e.g., 1084338.407 vs. 810187.903).  This indicates potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies within the BUDGET OWNER's approval process.

3. **"MISSING" rejections:** The variants including "REJECTED by MISSING" have high performance figures (e.g., 1947246.400). This suggests delays or difficulties related to missing information or documentation. Clarifying requirements and improving communication around required documentation could improve performance.

4. **"SAVED" declarations:** While the "SAVED by EMPLOYEE" variant has zero performance, it's worth noting. A high number of saved declarations could indicate issues with the declaration process itself, making it difficult for employees to complete. This could be due to usability problems, lack of clarity in the process, or technical difficulties.

5. **Unexpected high performance with "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR":** The variant "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled ( frequency = 4  performance = 9110508.000 )" raises another red flag. Despite only going through the SUPERVISOR and having low frequency, its performance is exceptionally high.  This might be a data anomaly or indicate a different kind of bottleneck occurring after the supervisor's approval but before payment handling.  This needs further investigation.


In summary, the data points towards rejections (particularly by ADMINISTRATION), involvement of the BUDGET OWNER, missing information ("REJECTED by MISSING"), and possibly issues related to saved declarations and post-supervisor approval processing as major contributors to performance problems. Further investigation into these specific areas is crucial to pinpoint the exact causes and develop targeted improvements.
