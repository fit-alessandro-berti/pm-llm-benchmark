To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we need to compare their process variants using domain knowledge. Here are the key differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants**

- **Protected Group:**
  - The protected group has a higher frequency for process variants involving the "Register at ER" and "Expert Examination."
  - Lower frequency for variants that involve the "FD" (First-Defense) approach.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The unprotected group has a higher frequency for process variants involving the "FD" (First-Defense) and "Thorough Examination."
  - Lower frequency for variants that involve the "ER" (Emergency Room) approach.

### 2. **Performance Metrics**

- **Protected Group:**
  - The protected group has higher performance values for the "FD" (First-Defense) variants, indicating potentially more efficient treatment processes.
  - Some lower performance values for the "ER" (Emergency Room) variants, which could indicate slower or less efficient processes.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The unprotected group shows higher performance values for variants involving the "FD" (First-Defense) and "Thorough Examination," indicating more efficient treatment processes.
  - Some higher performance values for the "ER" (Emergency Room) variants, which could indicate more efficiency or better outcomes.

### 3. **Specific Process Variants**

- **Protected Group:**
  - Variants involving "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" have higher performance values.
  - Higher frequency in variants ending with "Treatment successful -> Discharge" compared to "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment."
  - Lower frequency for variants starting with "Register at FD" and "Register at ER," but higher frequency for variants that include "Expert Examination."

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Variants involving "FD" and "Thorough Examination" have higher frequencies and lower performance values.
  - Higher frequency in variants involving "Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment."
  - Higher performance values for "FD" and "ER" variants, suggesting potentially better outcomes for these groups.

### Key Observations:

1. **Higher Frequency and Performance for "FD" Variants:**
   - The unprotected group shows a higher frequency and performance for variants involving "First-Defense" (FD) and "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination."
   - This could suggest that the FD variants are more efficient and are preferred by the unprotected group.

2. **Higher Frequency and Performance for "ER" Variants in Unprotected Group:**
   - The unprotected group has higher performance values for ER variants, indicating potentially better outcomes.
   - This could suggest that the ER approach is more efficient for the unprotected group.

3. **Lower Frequency for "FD" Variants in Protected Group:**
   - The protected group has a lower frequency for FD variants, suggesting fewer instances of FD in their process.
   - This could imply that FD is less utilized or less effective for the protected group.

### Summary of Main Differences:

- **Frequency:**
  - The protected group prefers ER and Expert Examination variants more than FD.
  - The unprotected group prefers FD and Thorough Examination variants more than ER.

- **Performance:**
  - The unprotected group generally has higher performance for FD and ER variants.
  - The protected group shows higher performance for variants involving Expert Examination and Thorough Examination.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group might benefit more from processes involving FD and Thorough Examination, while the protected group has more success with ER and Expert Examination variants.
