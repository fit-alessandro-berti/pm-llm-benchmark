```python

    'always_before': set(),  # Add always before constraints (e.g., order creation must be done before order processing)
    'always_after': set(),  # Add always after constraints (e.g., order validation should happen after order creation)
    'never_together': set(), # Add never together constraints (e.g., invoice approval and payment execution cannot happen simultaneously)
    'activ_freq': {
        'Order Creation': {0, 1},  # Example: Order Creation can occur 0 or 1 time per case
        'Purchase Requisition': {0, 1}, # ... for Purchase Requisitions...
        'Inventory Receiving': {0, 1}, # ... and Inventory Receiving
        'Order Processing': {0, 1},  # ... and Order Processing
        'Invoice Approval': {0, 1},  # ... and Invoice Approval
        'Payment Execution': {0, 1},  # ... and Payment Execution

```

**Explanation:**

* **`equivalence`**:  This is a set where you would add pairs of activities that are equivalent (i.e., they have the same occurrences). For example: `('Order Creation', 'Receipt Confirmation')`.
* **`always_before`**: This is a set where you would add pairs of activities where the first activity must happen before the second (e.g.,  `('Order Creation', 'Order Processing')`). 
* **`always_after`**: Similar to `always_before`, this set contains pairs where the first activity must occur after the second activity (`('Invoice Approval', 'Payment Execution')`). 
* **`never_together`**: This is a set that contains pairs of activities that cannot occur together. You would add any pair where their occurrence cannot be concurrent (e.g.,  `('Payment Execution', 'Order Confirmation')`). 
* **`activ_freq`**: This dictionary holds the allowed occurrences for each activity:
    * Keys: Activity names (e.g., `'Order Creation'`, `'Purchase Requisition'`)
    * Values: A list of allowed occurrences per activity 

* **`directly_follows`**: Similar to `always_before` and `always_after`, this set specifies activities that should occur immediately after the previous one (e.g.,  `('Invoice Approval', 'Payment Execution')`).


**Important Notes:**

* This is a basic skeleton model, you need to fill it with the specific constraints for your Purchase-to-Pay process based on its complexities and processes involved.
*  You should add more details and constraints as needed to define the exact flow of your process.
