This log skeleton describes a process for handling declarations, likely related to payments or expenses, with multiple approval stages and possibilities for rejection. Here's a breakdown:

**Process Initiation:**

* The process likely begins with an employee saving a declaration (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`).  While not explicitly stated, this is implied by the numerous "Never Together" constraints with this activity.

**Submission and Initial Approval:**

* The employee then submits the declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`). This is directly followed by the administration considering the declaration for approval (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`).
* The Equivalence constraint links 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' with several other activities, implying that if the administration considers the declaration, they will also take one of the following actions:
    * Approve it (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`).
    * Reject it (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`).
    * Request payment (`Request Payment`).
    * Mark the payment as handled (`Payment Handled`).
    * Pass it on to the Supervisor or Pre-approver.

**Pre-Approval Stage (Optional):**

* The involvement of a pre-approver (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`) appears optional. If involved, the pre-approver can:
    * Approve the declaration (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`).
    * Reject it (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`, `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`).
    * Submit it to the employee (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` - this might indicate a request for corrections).
* Note: There are several "Never Together" constraints related to pre-approval, suggesting this step is bypassed in some instances.

**Supervisor Approval Stage (Optional):**

* Similar to pre-approval, supervisor involvement (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`) seems optional. If involved, the supervisor can:
    * Give final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
    * Reject the declaration (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`, `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
    * Submit it back to the employee (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

**Rejection Handling:**

* Rejection can occur at multiple stages (administration, pre-approver, supervisor, employee, and due to missing information). The "Equivalence" constraint between 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' and 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' suggests these rejections might be related or represent the same underlying reason.

**Payment:**

* Once the administration marks a declaration "For Approval," the process can proceed to "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled." The "Never Together" constraints imply that payment processing happens independently of the pre-approver and supervisor stages.

**Key Observations and Potential Issues:**

* **Complex Equivalence:** The numerous equivalence constraints involving `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION` make the process logic quite intricate.  It's challenging to determine the exact conditions that lead to each outcome.
* **Optional Stages:** The pre-approval and supervisor stages seem optional and possibly mutually exclusive based on the "Never Together" constraints.  More context is needed to understand when each stage is triggered.
* **Employee Rejection:**  The role of employee rejection is unclear.  It might represent the employee withdrawing the declaration.
* **Missing Information Rejection:**  "REJECTED by MISSING" likely indicates rejection due to incomplete information in the declaration.
* **Cycle Potential:** The "Always After" constraints combined with the possibility of re-submission could lead to cycles in the process.

**In Summary:** This log skeleton describes a declaration handling process with complex approval routing, optional stages, and various rejection points.  While the constraints provide valuable information, additional context and potentially a visual representation would significantly improve understanding the precise process flow.
