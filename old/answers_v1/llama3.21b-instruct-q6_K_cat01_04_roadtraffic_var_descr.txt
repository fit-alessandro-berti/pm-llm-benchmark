This appears to be a detailed breakdown of a customer due diligence (CDD) process for the payment processing industry. I'll break down the process into its various stages and highlight the key steps involved.

**Step 1: Create Fine**

The process starts with creating a new fine, which is likely an initial step in generating revenue from customers who have been flagged or identified as potential non-compliant.

**Step 2: Send Fine (Payment)**

If the customer has already paid for their fine, this stage involves sending a payment notification to the customer. This is typically done via email or another preferred communication channel.

**Step 3: Insert Fine Notification**

This step is where additional notifications are inserted into the customer's transaction history, such as "you've been sent a payment reminder" or "your account has been updated." These notifications aim to engage customers and encourage them to pay their fine.

**Step 4: Add penalty (Create Fine)**

If the customer hasn't yet paid for their fine, this step involves adding a penalty to their transaction history. This can be done by sending another payment notification or updating an existing one.

**Step 5: Send Fine (Frequency = 20385)**

This stage is similar to Step 2, where a new payment notification is sent to the customer who has been added with a fine.

**Step 6: Insert Fine Notification (Insert Fine Notification)**

At this point, additional notifications are inserted into the customer's transaction history, such as "you've received an update on your fine" or "your fine has been updated." These notifications aim to keep customers informed about their status.

**Step 7: Add penalty (Insert Fine Notification)**

If the customer hasn't yet received a payment notification for their fine, this step involves adding another notification with a penalty.

**Step 8: Payment**

Finally, if the customer pays for their fine, this stage is complete. The transaction is marked as closed, and any relevant notifications are updated accordingly.

Throughout this process, various frequency parameters (e.g., 56482 for Send Fine) determine which steps occur at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly). Performance metrics (e.g., performance = 59591524.946) provide insights into the effectiveness of each stage in generating revenue from customers.

The data appears to be structured around a specific customer due diligence process, with various stages and notifications involved in managing the relationship between customers and the payment processing industry.
