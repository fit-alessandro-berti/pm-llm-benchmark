Based on the provided object-centric event log, the process can be described as follows:

1. The process begins with the registration of a Customer Order, which triggers the creation of a Transport Document.
2. Once the Transport Document is created, vehicles are booked for transport.
3. After booking the vehicles, empty containers are ordered.
4. The next step is to load the goods into the handling units.
5. Once the goods are loaded, trucks are loaded with the handling units.
6. The trucks then drive to the terminal, where the containers are weighed and placed in stock.
7. The containers are then brought to the loading bay, where they are loaded onto the vehicles.
8. After loading, the vehicles depart from the terminal.
9. The process also involves forklifts, which are used to move containers within the terminal. Forklifts bring containers to the loading bay, load them onto vehicles, and place them in stock.
10. If there are any issues with the containers, they may be rescheduled, which can lead to delays in the process.

The frequency and duration of each activity provide insights into the efficiency and bottlenecks of the process. For example, the high frequency and long duration of the "Load to Vehicle" activity for the Forklift object type suggest that this is a time-consuming and repetitive task. Similarly, the long duration of the "Order Empty Containers" activity for the Container object type suggests that this is a potential bottleneck in the process.
