Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performance times, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. Frequency of Process Variants: The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of process variants compared to the 'protected' group. This indicates that the 'unprotected' group has a higher number of individuals going through each process variant.

2. Performance Time: The performance time for most process variants is higher for the 'unprotected' group than the 'protected' group. This suggests that the 'unprotected' group may be experiencing longer waiting times or treatment durations.

3. Expert Examination: The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of process variants that include an 'Expert Examination' step, suggesting that they may be receiving more specialized or detailed examinations.

4. Thorough Examination: Both groups have process variants that include a 'Thorough Examination' step. However, the 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of these process variants, indicating that they may be undergoing more thorough examinations.

5. Treatment Success: Both groups have process variants that result in 'Treatment Successful', but the 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of process variants that include a 'Treatment Unsuccessful' step followed by a 'Treatment Successful' step. This suggests that the 'unprotected' group may be experiencing more unsuccessful treatments before achieving a successful outcome.

6. Discharge: The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of process variants that end with 'Discharge', but also a significant number of individuals who are discharged without any treatment or examination, as indicated by the 'Discharge' process variant with a frequency of 505. This could suggest that the 'unprotected' group may be prematurely discharged without receiving necessary treatments or examinations.

7. Registration: Both groups register at ER (Emergency Room) and FD (Front Desk). However, the 'unprotected' group has a significantly higher frequency of registration at both ER and FD, which could indicate a higher demand for services or a lack of access to regular healthcare services.

These differences could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and healthcare needs between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups. However, without additional context and information, it is not possible to definitively determine the causes of these differences.
