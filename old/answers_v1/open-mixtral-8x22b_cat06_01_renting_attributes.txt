In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes refer to the characteristics of individuals that could potentially lead to discrimination or bias. These attributes are often protected by law or ethical guidelines. In the given event log, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. case:citizen: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status is a concern in fairness analysis.

2. case:gender: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual. Fairness analysis often considers gender to ensure that processes and outcomes are not biased based on this attribute.

3. case:german speaking: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a German speaker or not. Fairness analysis might consider this attribute to ensure that language proficiency does not lead to discrimination.

4. case:married: This attribute indicates whether the individual is married or not. Fairness analysis might consider this attribute to ensure that marital status does not lead to discrimination.

It's important to note that the sensitivity of these attributes can depend on the specific context and the laws or ethical guidelines that apply. For example, in some contexts, it might be illegal or unethical to use certain attributes for decision-making, while in other contexts, their use might be justified.

In the context of process mining, fairness analysis would involve evaluating whether the outcomes of the process (e.g., acceptance or rejection of a rental application) are influenced by these sensitive attributes in a way that could be considered unfair or discriminatory.
