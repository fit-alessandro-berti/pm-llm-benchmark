Analyzing the process variants between protected and unprotected groups, I notice several important differences:

1. Treatment Complexity and Success Rate:
- The unprotected group tends to have more complex treatment paths, with more instances of "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" in their most frequent variants
- The unprotected group has more cases with "Treatment unsuccessful" followed by additional treatment cycles, suggesting they might face more complications or receive more persistent care

2. Initial Registration and Assessment:
- Protected group's most common variants start with simple "Register at ER/FD -> Examination" paths
- Unprotected group's most frequent variants include "Expert Examination" and "Thorough Examination" early in the process

3. Process Length and Complexity:
- Protected group's most frequent variants are shorter and simpler
- Unprotected group has more instances of longer process chains with multiple treatment attempts

4. Volume Distribution:
- Protected group's variants are more evenly distributed across different paths
- Unprotected group shows high concentration in complex paths (especially those including Expert and Thorough Examinations)

These differences might indicate:
- Potential bias in initial assessment and referral to expert care
- Different standards of care between groups
- Possible systemic barriers for the protected group in accessing more thorough medical attention
- Need for investigation into why the protected group receives simpler treatment paths more frequently

This could suggest discriminatory practices in healthcare delivery, though further investigation would be needed to confirm causation.
