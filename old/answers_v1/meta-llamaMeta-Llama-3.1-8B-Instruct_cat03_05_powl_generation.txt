Here's an example of how you can implement a POWL model for a Purchase-to-Pay process in pm4py. In this example, the process involves the following steps:

- Receive Purchase Order
- Check Availability
- Approve Purchase
- Receive Goods
- Check Invoice
- Approve Payment

Here's the Python code that creates this POWL model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_purchase_order = Transition(label="Receive Purchase Order")
check_availability = Transition(label="Check Availability")
approve_purchase = Transition(label="Approve Purchase")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
check_invoice = Transition(label="Check Invoice")
approve_payment = Transition(label="Approve Payment")

# Define choice
choose = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    Transition(label="Direct Payment"),
    Transition(label="Delayed Payment")
])

# Define loop
receive_goods_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[
    receive_goods,
    SilentTransition()
])

# Define partial order
p2p_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    Transition(label="Send Goods Receipt"),
    Transition(label="Send Invoice"),
    Transition(label="Notify Payables"),
    choose,
    receive_goods_loop
])

# Add edges to the partial order
p2p_process.order.add_edge(receive_purchase_order, check_availability)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(check_availability, approve_purchase)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(approve_purchase, receive_goods_loop)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(receive_goods_loop, send_goods_receipt)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(send_goods_receipt, check_invoice)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(check_invoice, notify_payables)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(notify_payables, choose)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(choose, approve_payment)

print(p2p_process)
```

This code will create a POWL model that represents the Purchase-to-Pay process with the specified activities and relationships. The `print(p2p_process)` statement will output the created POWL model in a string format.

Note that the above code requires you to have pm4py installed in your environment. You can install it using pip: `pip install pm4py`
