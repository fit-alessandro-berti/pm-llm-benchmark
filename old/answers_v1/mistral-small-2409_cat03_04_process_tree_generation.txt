Sure! Let's define a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process tree using the `pm4py` library. This process typically involves several activities such as ordering, receiving, inspecting, and paying for goods. Here's how you can construct a process tree for such a process in Python:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define the root of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)  # The entire process is a sequence of steps

# Define activities as leaf nodes
order_goods = ProcessTree(label="Order Goods", parent=root)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=root)
inspect_goods = ProcessTree(label="Inspect Goods", parent=root)
pay_for_goods = ProcessTree(label="Pay for Goods", parent=root)

# Add the leaf nodes to the root
root.children.append(order_goods)
root.children.append(receive_goods)
root.children.append(inspect_goods)
root.children.append(pay_for_goods)

# Define a parallel branch for the 'Receive Goods' and 'Inspect Goods' activities
receive_inspect_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
receive_inspect_parallel.children.append(receive_goods)
receive_inspect_parallel.children.append(inspect_goods)

# Replace the direct children with the parallel branch in the root
root.children.remove(receive_goods)
root.children.remove(inspect_goods)
root.children.append(receive_inspect_parallel)

# Define the final process tree
process_tree = root

# Print the process tree (for verification)
print(process_tree)
```

In this code:
1. We define the root of the process tree as a `SEQUENCE` operation.
2. We define leaf nodes for the activities: "Order Goods", "Receive Goods", "Inspect Goods", and "Pay for Goods".
3. We add these leaf nodes to the root.
4. We create a parallel branch for "Receive Goods" and "Inspect Goods", indicating that these activities can happen in any order or even concurrently.
5. We replace the direct children in the root with the parallel branch.
6. Finally, we print the process tree for verification.

This process tree can be visualized or analyzed further using the `pm4py` library.
