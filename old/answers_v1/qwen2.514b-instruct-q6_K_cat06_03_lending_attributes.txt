Sensitive attributes, also known as protected attributes or demographic variables, are those that can indicate potential bias in decision-making processes. In the context of loan application and approval processes, certain attributes might be considered sensitive because they could lead to discriminatory practices if not handled properly.

From your provided dataset, the following attributes can be considered potentially sensitive:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether a case is that of a citizen or non-citizen. Discrimination based on citizenship status could be illegal and unethical.
2. **case:gender**: Gender can be a sensitive attribute since loan approval processes should not discriminate between genders.
3. **case:german speaking**: While language proficiency might seem relevant for customer service, it is generally considered inappropriate to base decisions (such as loan approvals) on whether someone speaks the local language or not.

These attributes are often used in fairness analyses of decision-making systems because they can serve as proxies for discrimination based on nationality, gender bias, and linguistic capability. Ensuring that these factors do not disproportionately affect outcomes is crucial for maintaining a fair and unbiased process.

To further analyze the fairness of this loan application process, one would typically evaluate how different groups defined by these attributes fare in terms of loan approval rates, average performance scores (as given in your data), or time to completion. If significant disparities are found, it might indicate that there is some form of bias in the system which needs addressing.

For instance, if citizens and non-citizens have vastly different approval rates, or if males and females receive loans with significantly different terms or under different conditions, this could suggest unfair treatment based on protected attributes.
