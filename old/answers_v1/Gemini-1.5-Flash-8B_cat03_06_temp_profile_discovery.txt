**Explanation and Crucial Missing Information**

The code now extracts the activities (which is crucial for pairing).  However, the most critical part is missing: **actual timing data**.  The input data only shows the *sequence* of activities.  To calculate average and standard deviation, you need the *time* spent between each activity pair in *each* process execution.

**How to use it with real data:**

1. **Timing Data:** You need a dataset where each process execution has the timestamps of each activity.  This is usually extracted from system logs or performance monitoring tools. For example, for the first variant:

   ```
   Create Fine (timestamp=1678886400)
   Send Fine (timestamp=1678886700)
   ...
   Send for Credit Collection (timestamp=1678887200)
   ```

2. **Data Structure:**  Modify the `extract_activities` and `create_temporal_profile` functions to load and use the timing data.  For example, your process_variants_data variable might now hold actual data as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a complete process execution.

3. **Calculate Average and Standard Deviation:**  Calculate the time difference between the activity pairs for *each* process execution. Then, you calculate the average and standard deviation for *each* activity pair across all process executions.

**Example of how to structure timing data for a single variant (critical for correct calculation):**

```python
process_variant_data = [  # Example for a single process variant, replace with your format
    {
        'Create Fine': 1678886400,
        'Send Fine': 1678886700,
        'Insert Fine Notification': 1678887000,
        'Add penalty': 1678887300,
        'Send for Credit Collection': 1678887600,
    },
    {  # Another process execution
        'Create Fine': 1678886600,
        'Send Fine': 1678886900,
        # ... (rest of the activities with timestamps)
    }
]
```

Once you have this timing data, replace the placeholder calculations in the `create_temporal_profile` function with actual calculations of average and standard deviation.


Only with timing data, you can accurately populate the temporal profile.  The current example is just a placeholder, simulating the process, but won't give you valid results.
