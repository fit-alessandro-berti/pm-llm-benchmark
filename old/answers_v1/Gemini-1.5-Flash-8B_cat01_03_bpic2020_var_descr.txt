The data describes a payment request process with a significant number of possible variations and potential rejection/resubmission loops.  The core process appears to be:

1. **Employee Submission:** An employee submits a declaration.

2. **Administration Approval (or Rejection):** The declaration is reviewed by Administration.  This is a crucial step, as many variations involve the declaration being rejected at this stage.

3. **Further Approvals (or Rejection):** Depending on the variant, the declaration may require approval from a Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, or Supervisor. This stage is also highly variable, with potential for rejection and resubmission.  The process can be further complicated by a MISSING step and potentially other intermediate rejection stages.

4. **Final Approval and Payment Request:**  Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is initiated.

5. **Payment Handling:**  The payment is handled.

**Key Observations and Issues:**

* **High Variance:** The process exhibits a very large range of possible paths, from simple (direct approval by supervisor) to complex (multiple rejections and resubmissions).

* **Rejection Loops:** The process has significant potential for loops where a declaration is rejected, resubmitted, and then possibly rejected again.  This appears to be particularly common within the Administration and Employee rejection stages, and less common at the Supervisor/Budget Owner levels.

* **Performance Problems:** Performance times are extremely variable depending on the process variant.  The presence of very high performance times for rejections and multiple resubmissions suggests the potential for bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the system.  There are several outliers, and analysis would be needed to understand the individual cases leading to these extreme values.

* **Missing Step?:**  The "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" variant strongly suggests a potential systemic issue or gap in the process.

* **Multiple Approval Roles:** Multiple approval roles (Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor) are present, likely to capture different levels of authority and responsibilities over the financial declarations.

* **Declaration SAVED:**  The "Declaration SAVED" variant represents a possible action that does not proceed into the payment process, and needs further investigation.  It is an important outlier that should be understood.

* **High Frequency of Rejections:**  The sheer number of rejection scenarios suggests that either the criteria for approvals are not consistently applied, or there are flaws in the system that make it challenging to correctly and efficiently process declarations.

**Recommendations:**

* **Process Documentation:** Clearly document the expected process and approval roles.

* **Standardization:** Try to standardize the process as much as possible to reduce the number of variations.

* **Performance Analysis:** Investigate specific cases with very high performance times to pinpoint bottlenecks.

* **Reject Reason Tracking:** Track the reasons for rejection to understand patterns and address the root cause.

* **Error Detection and Prevention:** Implement mechanisms to catch errors and prevent declarations from entering the process with missing information or conflicting data.

* **Automation Considerations:** Explore the possibility of automating parts of the process to reduce manual intervention and potential human error.

* **Workflow improvements:** Examine current approval workflow for redundant steps, and streamlining.

This is a complex process requiring detailed analysis to pinpoint the underlying issues and improve efficiency. Just knowing the frequency and performance of different paths is a starting point, but further investigation is needed.
