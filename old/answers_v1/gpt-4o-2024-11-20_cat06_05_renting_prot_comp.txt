To identify the unfair differences in the treatment between the protected group and the unprotected group, we must analyze both the frequency and the performance of each process variant, as well as the steps of the process as a whole. Below, I outline the key differences and their potential implications:

---

### **1. Higher Rate of Rejection for the Protected Group**
- **Protected Group:**
  - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a **frequency of 1,036** with a performance (execution time) of **270,000.477 ms**.
  - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a **frequency of 484** with a performance of **89,999.306 ms**.
  - Combined frequency for rejections before deeper screening: **1,520.**

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a **frequency of 674** with a performance of **240,000.654 ms.**
  - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a **frequency of 365** with a performance of **80,002.688 ms.**
  - Combined frequency for rejections before deeper screening: **1,039.**

- **Key Differences:**
  - Rejection frequencies (pre-deep screening) are significantly higher for the **protected group (1,520 vs. 1,039).** This indicates unfair treatment in terms of rejection likelihood at earlier stages.
  - Performance times for rejection are generally **higher for the protected group**, which can mean either a delay in processing or inefficiency in decision-making.

### **2. Extensive Screening Occurs More Frequently for the Protected Group**
- **Frequency of Processes with Extensive Screening:**
  - **Protected Group:** 
    - Includes "Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" process variants (793 frequency) with **540,011.977 ms**, and others with extensive screening ultimately leading to either rejection or the signing of a contract.
  - **Unprotected Group:**
    - Includes "Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" process variants (1,022 frequency) with **480,013.530 ms**, along with other extensive screening cases.

- Even though frequencies of **extensive screening** for both groups are comparable, **performance times for the protected group tend to be higher** for similar routes:
    - Protected Group: 540,011.977 ms vs. 480,013.530 ms for the Unprotected Group.
  - The additional time burden suggests a potential bias, inefficiency, or difference in how cases involving the protected group are handled.

### **3. Reduced Likelihood of Long-Term Tenancy for the Protected Group**
- **Frequency of Long-Term Tenancy (More Rent Payments):**
  - **Protected Group:**
    - The longest process variant, "Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent ->..." for the protected group has the **lowest frequency (11).**
    - Several other long-term rent payment processes occur less frequently than in the unprotected group, reflecting reduced chances of sustained tenancy for the protected group overall.
  - **Unprotected Group:**
    - The longest process variant has a **frequency of 45** (significantly higher for unprotected tenants compared to 11).
    - Other long-term rent payment paths for unprotected tenants generally occur **more frequently.**

- **Observation:**
  - Protected tenants seem to have **fewer opportunities for long-term tenancy**, as indicated by the lower frequencies across extended rent payment variants compared to unprotected tenants.
  - This disparity could potentially reflect barriers such as stricter requirements, discrimination, or lack of trust in the protected group's ability to maintain long-term tenancy.

### **4. Tenant Eviction is More Common for the Protected Group**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Process Variant: "Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" occurs **6 times** with a performance of **990,084.833 ms.**

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - No eviction-related process variants are explicitly reported for the unprotected group.

- **Key Problem:**
  - The presence of tenant evictions specifically for the protected group introduces a clear disparity. This suggests increased scrutiny or stricter enforcement of rules for protected tenants, leading to adverse outcomes disproportionately affecting them.

---

### **5. Performance Times in Long-Term Processes Favor the Unprotected Group**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Performance times for longer tenant processes (e.g., "Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent ...") are significantly higher.
    - Example: For the most extensive variant (9 rent payments), the protected group has **performance of 1,440,007.833 ms** compared to 1,280,091.444 ms for the unprotected group.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Performance times are generally lower in these extended processes, indicating faster or more efficient handling for unprotected tenants.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Slower performance for the protected group could reflect systemic inefficiencies, additional administrative barriers, or biases in managing these cases, ultimately disadvantaging the protected group.

---

### **6. Protected Group Faces More Rejections After Extensive Screening**
- After undergoing the burdensome "Extensive Screening" step:
  - **Protected Group:** Higher rejection frequency ("Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant", 793 cases, **540,011 ms**).
  - **Unprotected Group:** Lower rejection frequency (1,022, **480,013.530 ms**) despite undergoing extensive screening more often.

- **Implication:**
  - Even after completing a stricter screening process, the protected group is more likely to see unfavorable outcomes, which points to systemic bias or discriminatory treatment.

---

### **Conclusion: Unfair Differences**
The key differences outlined demonstrate that the protected group faces:
1. **Higher upfront rejection rates** and **longer times for rejection** earlier in the process.
2. **More frequent and time-intensive extensive screenings.**
3. **Fewer opportunities for long-term tenancy, reflected in lower frequencies of extended rent payments.**
4. **Disproportionately higher likelihood of eviction.**
5. **Longer processing times, even for successfully completed cases.**

These disparities indicate potential biases against the protected group, reflecting unequal treatment at multiple stages of the process. These biases could stem from discriminatory practices, stricter rules imposed on the protected group, or systemic inefficiencies that disproportionately affect them. Addressing these disparities would require a detailed review of the rules, performance metrics, and decision-making processes at each stage.
