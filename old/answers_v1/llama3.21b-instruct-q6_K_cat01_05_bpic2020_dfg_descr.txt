This is a flowchart-like representation of a business approval process, with various stages and decisions that are made at each stage. Here's a high-level description of the process:

**Process Overview**

The process involves multiple stakeholders and roles, including supervisors, administrators, budget owners, and employees.

1. **Submission**: An employee submits a document (Declaration) for review.
2. **Approval Process**:
	* If approved by an administrator or administration, it's sent to a supervisor.
	* The supervisor reviews the document and makes decisions based on their authority (e.g., FINAL_APPROVED, REJECTED).
3. **Request Payment**: After approval from a supervisor or administration, the payment is requested ( Request Payment ).
4. **Payment Handling**:
	* If rejected by the supervisor or administration, the request for payment is handled ( Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ) and further processed.
5. **Rejection Loop**:
	* Repeatedly, the employee's document is submitted to another administrator or administration, which may reject it due to various reasons (e.g., REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER).
6. **Supervisor's Decision**: After rejection from an administrative role, the decision can be reviewed and approved by a supervisor ( e.g., DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR ).
7. **Final Approval**: If approved again, the process is completed with FINAL_APPROVED.
8. **Request Payment Again**:
	* A payment is requested after the final approval ( Request Payment ).

**Key Decisions**

1. Authority: The decision-making authority varies between roles and stakeholders (e.g., administrator vs. supervisor).
2. Approval Frequency: Some decisions are made at fixed frequencies (e.g., 10038), while others are based on specific events or requirements (e.g., payment handling, request for payment).
3. Rejection Criteria: Multiple criteria can lead to rejection, including the decision of a specific role or stakeholder.
4. Looping Back**: The process often loops back and forth between multiple roles and stakeholders, with varying degrees of approval and rejections.

**Stakeholders**

1. Employees
2. Supervisors
3. Administrators
4. Budget Owners
5. PRE_APPROVERs (reviewers before approval)
6. BUDGET OWNERs (reviewing final decisions)

This is a simplified representation of the process, but it should give you an idea of the various stages and decisions involved in this complex workflow.
