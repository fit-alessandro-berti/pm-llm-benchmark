To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group based on the provided process variants and their execution times, we need to focus on several key aspects:

1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of process variants involving multiple steps, especially those leading to loan denial. This suggests that protected individuals might be subjected to more rigorous scrutiny or additional requirements before loan approval.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of process variants that result in loan approval, indicating a potentially smoother process or fewer barriers to loan approval.

2. **Execution Time:**
   - The 'protected' group has process variants with relatively higher execution times, particularly those that involve multiple visits to assess collateral and request co-signers. This suggests that the processes for the protected group are more time-consuming, possibly due to additional verifications or requirements.
   - The 'unprotected' group has process variants with execution times that are generally similar but with a few variants that are notably faster, indicating a more streamlined process or fewer hurdles.

3. **Specific Steps and Outcomes:**
   - The 'protected' group has several process variants that include steps like "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and multiple visits to assess collateral, which are less common in the 'unprotected' group. This implies that protected individuals may face additional requirements or scrutiny that unprotected individuals do not encounter.
   - The 'unprotected' group has process variants that include steps like "skipped_examination," which is not present in the protected group. This could indicate a more lenient or expedited process for unprotected individuals.

4. **Loan Denial and Approval Ratios:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of loan denial outcomes compared to the 'unprotected' group, suggesting that protected individuals may face stricter criteria or more barriers to loan approval.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of loan approval outcomes, indicating a potentially more favorable evaluation process.

### Main Differences:
1. **Frequency of Loan Denials:** The 'protected' group experiences a higher frequency of loan denials compared to the 'unprotected' group.
2. **Additional Requirements:** The 'protected' group is more likely to encounter additional steps such as requesting co-signers and multiple visits to assess collateral, which are less common in the 'unprotected' group.
3. **Execution Time:** Processes for the 'protected' group tend to have longer execution times, indicating more extensive scrutiny or additional requirements.
4. **Process Streamlining:** The 'unprotected' group has a process variant that includes "skipped_examination," suggesting a potentially more streamlined and lenient process.

These differences suggest that there may be biases or unfair treatment in the loan application process, with protected individuals facing more hurdles and a longer, more scrutinized process compared to unprotected individuals.
