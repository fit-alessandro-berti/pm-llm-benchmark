Based on the detailed analysis of your process variants and the associated performance data, the root causes for the performance issues in your process can be attributed to specific factors within the process flow. Here are the key findings:

1. **Rejections Leading to Resubmissions:**

   - **Increased Cycle Time Due to Rework:** Variants where declarations are **rejected** by approvers (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER) and then **resubmitted** by employees have significantly higher performance times compared to those that are approved in the first submission.
     - *Example:* A declaration rejected by ADMINISTRATION and then resubmitted (Variant with frequency 345) has a performance time of **1,604,596**, which is substantially higher than the standard approval path (performance around **810,188**).

   - **Root Cause:** The need for rework and resubmission extends the overall process duration, causing delays in reaching the final stages like payment handling.

2. **Multiple Rejection Loops:**

   - **Exponential Increase in Duration:** Variants involving multiple cycles of rejection and resubmission show an **exponential increase** in performance times.
     - *Example:* A declaration going through three rejection-resubmission cycles (Variant with frequency 36) has a performance time of **2,542,498**, while one with four cycles (Variant with frequency 4) reaches **3,502,608**.

   - **Root Cause:** Each additional rejection loop adds significant time to the process, indicating that repeated failures to meet approval criteria are a major bottleneck.

3. **Additional Approval Steps:**

   - **Extended Approval Paths Increase Duration:** Variants that include approvals from additional roles like **BUDGET OWNER** or **PRE_APPROVER** have higher performance times due to the extra steps involved.
     - *Example:* Including the BUDGET OWNER in the approval chain (Variant with frequency 2,473) raises the performance time to **1,084,338** compared to the standard approval path.

   - **Root Cause:** Each additional approval step introduces more waiting time and potential for delays, especially if these steps are prone to causing rejections or require more time for decision-making.

4. **Impact of Missing Data or Actions:**

   - **Delays Due to Incomplete Submissions:** Variants that involve a status like **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** indicate that missing information is causing rejections and significant delays.
     - *Example:* The variant with a rejection by MISSING (frequency 40) has a performance time of **1,947,246**, which is much higher than the standard process.

   - **Root Cause:** Missing data necessitates further action to complete the declaration, leading to extended process times due to additional communication and resubmission efforts.

5. **Premature Process Terminations with High Duration:**

   - **Substantial Time Invested Before Termination:** Even when the process ends with a rejection and does not proceed to payment, a considerable amount of time is consumed.
     - *Example:* The variant ending with Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE (frequency 31) still has a performance time of **713,794**.

   - **Root Cause:** Time is being spent on processes that do not result in a completed declaration, indicating inefficiencies in early-stage evaluations or submissions.

6. **Idle Time in the Process:**

   - **Non-Active Periods Contributing to Delays:** The performance times suggest there may be significant idle times between events, possibly due to batching, workload balancing, or delays in decision-making.

   - **Root Cause:** Inefficient scheduling or lack of timely responses at various stages can cause the process to stall, increasing the total duration.

**Recommendations to Address Root Causes:**

- **Enhance Submission Quality:**
  - Provide clear guidelines and training to employees to ensure that declarations are complete and meet the required standards before submission, reducing the likelihood of rejections.

- **Streamline Approval Processes:**
  - Evaluate the necessity of each approval step. If possible, eliminate redundant approvals or consolidate roles to minimize the number of steps.

- **Improve Communication Channels:**
  - Establish efficient communication mechanisms between approvers and employees to quickly resolve issues related to rejections.

- **Address Data Missing Issues:**
  - Implement validation checks at the submission stage to ensure all required information is provided, preventing rejections due to missing data.

- **Monitor and Optimize Idle Times:**
  - Analyze time gaps between events to identify and mitigate causes of idle time, such as workload distribution or delays in action from approvers.

By focusing on these specific areas within your process, you can target the root causes of performance issues and implement data-driven strategies to enhance efficiency.
