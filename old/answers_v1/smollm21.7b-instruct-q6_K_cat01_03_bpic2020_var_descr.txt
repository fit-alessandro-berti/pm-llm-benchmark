The process mentioned in the given data is a series of steps that are undertaken by an employee to handle payment for a project or task.

1. EMPLOYEE -  The first step is initiated by an employee, and they submit a Declaration SUBMITTED request for approval from various authorities such as ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR.

2. ADMINISTRATION - This step involves the administrative authority reviewing the submitted Declaration SUBMITTED to approve or reject it before forwarding it to the next stage.

3. PRE_APPROVER - The employee may also have a preliminary review performed by an additional PRE_APPROVER if required, which can be either an EMPLOYEE or ADMINISTRATION authority. This step is optional and skipped in some cases where an APPROVAL is not necessary.

4. BUDGET OWNER - The employee's Declaration SUBMITTED is then reviewed by the Budget Owner for final approval, which can be done by either an EMPLOYEE or ADMINISTRATION authority.

5. SUPERVISOR - The final step involves a review by the supervisor who will make any necessary approval changes before forwarding it to the next stage.

6. REJECTION - If a Declaration SUBMITTED request is rejected at any point in this process, an EMPLOYEE can either submit it again or decide not to pursue it further.

The process ultimately leads to the final payment for the project or task being requested by an employee from the SUPERVISOR after they have approved all other stages of the process.
