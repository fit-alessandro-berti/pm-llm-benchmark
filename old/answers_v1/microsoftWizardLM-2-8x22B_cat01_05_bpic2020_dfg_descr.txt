 The data provided describes a multi-step approval and payment process within an organization. Each step in the process is represented by a transition between different statuses of a declaration or request, with associated frequencies and performance metrics. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Initial Submission**:
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Pre-Approval**:
   - The submitted declaration may be approved or rejected by a pre-approver (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`). If approved, it moves towards final approval; if rejected, it may return to the employee for resubmission or rejection.

3. **Administration Review**:
   - Declarations that are not pre-approved, or after pre-approval, go through an administrative review (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`). Administrators can approve, reject, or send the declaration back to the employee for resubmission.

4. **Budget Owner Review**:
   - After administrative approval, the declaration may need to be reviewed by a budget owner (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`, `Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`). This step can also result in approval or rejection.

5. **Supervisor Final Approval**:
   - Declarations approved by administrators or budget owners move to the supervisor for final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`). Supervisors can also reject declarations, which may result in the process starting over or the declaration being rejected outright.

6. **Payment Request**:
   - Once a declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is made (`Request Payment`).

7. **Missing Approval**:
   - There are instances where a declaration or payment request may be rejected due to a missing approval (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`, `Request Payment -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).

8. **Payment Handling**:
   - After a payment request is made, the payment is handled (`Payment Handled`). There is also an instance where a payment can be rejected and sent back to the request phase (`Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`).

9. **Special Cases**:
   - There are less frequent cases such as direct rejection by the supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`), which can lead to resubmission, rejection, or even a direct request for payment.
   - There are also cases where a declaration is saved without immediate submission (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`) and can later move to the payment request phase.
   - In some rare instances, a declaration can be forwarded for approval without a clear previous step (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`), which can lead to rejection due to missing approval or return to the submission phase.

10. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
    - Rejections at various stages can lead to the declaration being resubmitted by the employee, creating a loop within the process until the declaration is either approved and paid or rejected and closed.

The performance metrics likely represent the time taken for each transition in the process, indicating potential bottlenecks or areas for process improvement. High-frequency transitions with poor performance (high time taken) could be targeted for optimization to streamline the overall process.
