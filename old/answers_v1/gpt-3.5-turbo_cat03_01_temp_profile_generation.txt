Sure! Here is a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process:

temporal_profile = {
    ('Request', 'Approval'): (21600, 1800),  # Average time between requesting and approval is 6 hours, standard deviation is 30 minutes
    ('Approval', 'PO Creation'): (43200, 3600),  # Average time between approval and purchase order creation is 12 hours, standard deviation is 1 hour
    ('PO Creation', 'Delivery'): (172800, 7200),  # Average time between purchase order creation and delivery is 2 days, standard deviation is 2 hours
    ('Delivery', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400, 7200),  # Average time between delivery and invoice receipt is 1 day, standard deviation is 2 hours
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): (129600, 7200)  # Average time between invoice receipt and payment is 1.5 days, standard deviation is 2 hours
}

This temporal profile reflects the average times and standard deviations for each step in the Purchase-to-Pay process.
