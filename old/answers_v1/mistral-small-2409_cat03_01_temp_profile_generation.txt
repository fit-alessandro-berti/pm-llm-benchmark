Certainly! Below is an example of a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This profile includes various activities and their respective average times and standard deviations between them.

Assume the following activities:
- Order Placement (OP)
- Purchase Order Approval (POA)
- Supplier Order Receipt (SOR)
- Goods Receipt (GR)
- Invoice Receipt (IR)
- Payment Processing (PP)

Here's a temporal profile for these activities:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('OP', 'POA'): (7200, 1800),  # 2 hours (43200 seconds) on average, 0.5 hours (1800 seconds) standard deviation
    ('POA', 'SOR'): (3600, 900),  # 1 hour (3600 seconds) on average, 0.25 hours (900 seconds) standard deviation
    ('SOR', 'GR'): (7200, 1800),  # 2 hours (7200 seconds) on average, 0.5 hours (1800 seconds) standard deviation
    ('GR', 'IR'): (3600, 900),   # 1 hour (3600 seconds) on average, 0.25 hours (900 seconds) standard deviation
    ('IR', 'PP'): (28800, 7200), # 8 hours (28800 seconds) on average, 2 hours (7200 seconds) standard deviation
}

# Example usage of ZETA to find deviations
ZETA = 2
def find_deviations(profile, zeta):
    deviations = {}
    for (act1, act2), (avg, stdev) in profile.items():
        lower_bound = avg - zeta * stdev
        upper_bound = avg + zeta * stdev
        deviations[(act1, act2)] = (lower_bound, upper_bound)
    return deviations

deviations = find_deviations(temporal_profile, ZETA)
print(deviations)
```

In this example:
- The average time between `Order Placement` (OP) and `Purchase Order Approval` (POA) is 2 hours with a standard deviation of 0.5 hours.
- The average time between `Purchase Order Approval` (POA) and `Supplier Order Receipt` (SOR) is 1 hour with a standard deviation of 0.25 hours.
- The average time between `Supplier Order Receipt` (SOR) and `Goods Receipt` (GR) is 2 hours with a standard deviation of 0.5 hours.
- The average time between `Goods Receipt` (GR) and `Invoice Receipt` (IR) is 1 hour with a standard deviation of 0.25 hours.
- The average time between `Invoice Receipt` (IR) and `Payment Processing` (PP) is 8 hours with a standard deviation of 2 hours.

The function `find_deviations` shows how to calculate the boundaries for deviations given a ZETA value. This can help in identifying deviations in process execution times.
