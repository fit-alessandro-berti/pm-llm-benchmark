To analyze the root causes of performance issues in this process, I'll focus on specific data patterns and bottlenecks evident in the provided event log. Here are the key observations and potential root causes:

1. Long wait times for empty containers:
   The duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" is very high (368,943.92 time units). This suggests a significant delay in the availability or delivery of empty containers, which could be a major bottleneck in the process.

2. Excessive time in stock:
   The duration between "Place in Stock" and "Bring to Loading Bay" for containers is extremely long (743,380.51 time units). This indicates that containers are spending a lot of time idle in stock, which could be due to poor inventory management or scheduling issues.

3. Frequent rescheduling of containers:
   There are multiple instances of "Reschedule Container" events across different object types. This suggests planning or coordination issues, leading to inefficiencies and delays.

4. Long vehicle booking process:
   The duration between "Book Vehicles" events is quite high (295,965.56 time units), and there are many repetitions. This indicates potential issues with vehicle availability or the booking process itself.

5. Inefficient loading of trucks:
   There are many repetitions of "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" for both Truck and Container object types. This could indicate inefficient loading processes or poor coordination of goods arrival.

6. Delays in transport document creation:
   The time between "Register Customer Order" and "Create Transport Document" is long (329,005.22 time units), which could be causing downstream delays in the entire process.

7. Long wait times for vehicles after booking:
   The duration between "Book Vehicles" and "Load to Vehicle" is high (283,101.01 time units), suggesting potential issues with vehicle availability or scheduling.

8. Inefficient use of forklifts:
   There are instances of forklifts performing the same action repeatedly (e.g., "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock"), which could indicate inefficient routing or task assignment.

9. Delays in departure after loading:
   The time between "Load to Vehicle" and "Depart" is considerable (72,985.89 time units for vehicles), suggesting potential issues in final checks, documentation, or traffic management at the facility.

10. Long turnaround times for trucks:
    The duration between "Drive to Terminal" and "Load Truck" for trucks is high (84,119.09 time units), indicating potential inefficiencies at the terminal or in the overall logistics network.

These root causes are based on the patterns and durations observed in the event log. Addressing these specific issues could lead to significant improvements in the overall process performance.
