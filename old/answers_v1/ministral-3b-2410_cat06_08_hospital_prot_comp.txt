To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second), we'll look for disparities in the process variants, their frequencies, and their execution times. Here are the key differences based on domain knowledge:

1. **Frequency of Certain Process Variants:**
   - **Expert Examination:** The 'unprotected' group has higher frequencies of process variants involving expert examinations and thorough examinations (e.g., "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"). This suggests that the 'unprotected' group may undergo more in-depth examinations and treatments.
   - **Discharge:** The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency for the "Discharge" process variant without preceding steps. This could indicate that these cases were resolved more quickly or were less complex.

2. **Execution Time Differences:**
   - **Lower Execution Time:** Some process variants in the 'unprotected' group have significantly lower execution times compared to similar process variants in the 'protected' group (e.g., the "Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" variant has a performance of 220004.479 compared to 320003.346 in the 'protected' group).
   - **Higher Execution Times:** There are process variants in the 'protected' group with very high execution times, indicating more complex or lengthy treatments (e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with a performance of 420029.896).

3. **Process Sequences:**
   - **Simpler Paths:** The 'protected' group sometimes includes variants with simpler paths, such as "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge" with a performance of 260001.670, which is lower compared to more complex sequences like those in the 'unprotected' group.
   - **Complex Paths:** The 'unprotected' group more frequently includes complex treatment paths that involve additional examinations and multiple steps before resolution (e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge").

4. **Treatment Outcomes:**
   - **Successful Treatment:** The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of successful treatment variants compared to the 'protected' group. This could indicate a higher success rate of treatments in less complex cases or more efficient treatment processes.
   - **Unsuccessful Treatment:** The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of variants involving unsuccessful treatments followed by further diagnosis and treatments. This suggests a higher rate of unsuccessful initial treatments needing re-evaluation.

By comparing these process variants, we can infer that the 'unprotected' group may receive more detailed examinations and more efficient treatments, leading to higher success rates and potentially quicker resolution times. The 'protected' group might receive simpler treatments more frequently but also have higher frequencies of complex and longer processes.
