**Benefits:**

1. **Enhanced Scalability and Performance:**  
   As organizations capture ever-growing volumes of event data, directly applying process mining techniques to massive logs can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. By decomposing the process into smaller, more manageable sub-processes or segments, it becomes possible to process event data in parallel or in incremental steps. This not only reduces runtime and memory requirements but also scales more effectively as data volumes continue to increase.

2. **Improved Interpretability and Focused Analysis:**  
   Large-scale processes are often complex, involving numerous activities, variants, and paths. Decomposition allows analysts to focus on distinct sub-processes or functional areas. With smaller, more coherent process fragments, it becomes easier to identify patterns, spot anomalies, and pinpoint root causes of inefficiencies without being overwhelmed by the entirety of the systemâ€™s complexity at once.

3. **Targeted Diagnostics and Specialization:**  
   Different sub-processes may be handled by specialized teams or subject matter experts. Decomposition enables targeted diagnostics, allowing these experts to concentrate on their area of specialization. As a result, the insights derived are more contextually rich and tailored, leading to more actionable improvement recommendations.

4. **Modularized Improvement Efforts:**  
   When processes are decomposed, improvement efforts can be deployed at a modular level. By addressing issues within a smaller segment of the process before scaling solutions up, organizations can validate their interventions more effectively. This modular approach reduces the risk of unintended consequences rippling through the entire system.

5. **Parallelization and Resource Allocation:**  
   With decomposition, multiple analysts or teams can work concurrently on different process fragments. This parallelization accelerates discovery and analysis, thereby shortening the time-to-insight. It also simplifies resource allocation because different segments can be assigned to different computing environments or analyst groups without extensive coordination bottlenecks.


**Challenges:**

1. **Loss of Global Context:**  
   A key trade-off in decomposition is the risk of losing the holistic view. Interdependencies, cross-cutting constraints, or performance issues that span multiple sub-processes may become less visible. This fragmented perspective can lead to incomplete analyses if not handled carefully.

2. **Complexity of Defining Decomposition Criteria:**  
   Deciding how to partition a large process into meaningful sub-processes is non-trivial. Decompositions can be based on organizational units, process phases, activity clusters, or logical event attributes. Finding a decomposition strategy that balances interpretability, complexity reduction, and preservation of essential process relationships often requires domain expertise and iterative refinement.

3. **Challenge of Reintegration:**  
   After performing isolated analyses, organizations must consolidate insights to form a coherent global picture. Merging the findings from multiple decomposed segments can be complex. Ensuring that key indicators, metrics, and discovered patterns align across the fragments requires careful data alignment, normalization, and validation.

4. **Cross-Boundary Activity Handling:**  
   Some process elements may not neatly fall into a single decomposed fragment. Activities that span multiple phases or rely on data from different sub-processes are difficult to place or may need replication and synchronization. This can complicate data preparation and model construction, as well as interpretation of the final insights.

5. **Overhead in Management and Governance:**  
   While decomposition can simplify analysis at the local level, it introduces additional steps in management and governance. Maintaining version control over multiple subsets, ensuring consistent application of business rules, and orchestrating parallel analyses can create logistical overhead. Without robust project management and tool support, the benefits of decomposition might be overshadowed by the complexity of maintaining it.

---

In sum, decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects offer improved scalability, clarity, and manageability. They provide a pathway to more targeted analysis and modular improvements. However, these benefits come with the need to carefully define decomposition boundaries, maintain a global perspective, and reconcile fragmented insights. Achieving the right balance between manageable granularity and holistic understanding is essential for successful large-scale process mining initiatives.
