Event abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex event data by grouping related events into higher-level categories. This can help improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs in several ways:

1. Reduces data complexity: Event abstraction can help reduce the complexity of the data by grouping related events into higher-level categories. This makes it easier to understand the overall flow of events and identify patterns and trends in the data.

2. Simplifies process models: Event abstraction can help simplify process models by reducing the number of events and steps involved. This can make the models easier to understand and manage, especially for stakeholders who may not be familiar with the underlying technology or process.

3. Enhances visibility: Event abstraction can help enhance visibility into the underlying processes and operations by providing a higher-level view of the data. This can help identify areas where improvements can be made and provide insights into the performance of the system.

4. Facilitates analysis: Event abstraction can facilitate analysis of the data by grouping related events into higher-level categories. This can help identify patterns and trends in the data, which can be used to inform decision-making and improve the overall performance of the system.

Overall, event abstraction can be a powerful tool for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. By reducing data complexity, simplifying process models, enhancing visibility, and facilitating analysis, event abstraction can help organizations better understand and manage their processes and operations.
