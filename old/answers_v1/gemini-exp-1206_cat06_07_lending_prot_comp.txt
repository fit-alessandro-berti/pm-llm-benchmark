Let's analyze the differences between the protected and unprotected groups in this loan application process.

**Key Observations and Potential Unfair Differences**

1. **Appointment Denial Rate:**
    *   **Protected Group:** 599 / (599 + 960 + 229 + 227 + 217 + 138 + 104 + 88 + 84 + 40 + 39 + 37 + 33 + 31 + 26 + 26 + 17 + 15 + 15 + 13) = 599 / 2938 = 20,4%
    *   **Unprotected Group:** 363 / (363 + 2709 + 1656 + 664 + 335 + 332 + 297 + 188 + 183 + 80 + 58 + 44 + 40 + 23 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 363 / 7000 = 5,2%
    *   **Difference:** The protected group faces a significantly higher rate of appointment denials (20.4%) compared to the unprotected group (5.2%). This suggests potential discrimination at the very first step of the process, preventing many in the protected group from even proceeding with their application.

2. **Early Application Rejection:**
    *   **Protected Group:** 960 / (599 + 960 + 229 + 227 + 217 + 138 + 104 + 88 + 84 + 40 + 39 + 37 + 33 + 31 + 26 + 26 + 17 + 15 + 15 + 13) = 960 / 2938 = 32,7%
    *   **Unprotected Group:** 664 / (363 + 2709 + 1656 + 664 + 335 + 332 + 297 + 188 + 183 + 80 + 58 + 44 + 40 + 23 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 664 / 7000 = 9,5%
    *   **Difference:** After setting an appointment and handing in the credit application, the protected group has a much higher rate of "Application Rejected" (32.7%) than the unprotected group (9.5%). This indicates that even when the protected group manages to get an appointment, their applications are rejected early in the process at a disproportionately higher rate.

3. **Loan Denial Rate After Reaching Underwriter:**

    *   **Protected Group:** (229+227+217+138+104+88+84+40+37+33+26+15) / (229+227+217+138+104+88+84+40+37+33+26+15+39+31+26+17+15+13) = 1238 / 1330 = 93,1%
    *   **Unprotected Group:** (2709+335+297+80+58+23+7+1+1) / (2709+335+297+80+58+23+7+1+1+1656+188+183+44+40+12+5+1+1) = 3511 / 5268 = 66,7%
    *   **Difference:** When applications reach the "Submit File to Underwriter" stage, the protected group experiences a significantly higher loan denial rate (93.1%) compared to the unprotected group (66.7%). This suggests potential bias in the underwriter's decision-making process.

4. **"Skipped Examination" for Unprotected Group:**
    *   **Unprotected Group Only:** There's a variant unique to the unprotected group: "skipped\_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" (frequency 332). This suggests that a substantial number of applicants in the unprotected group are getting their loans approved without undergoing the standard examination process. This raises serious concerns about preferential treatment and potential circumvention of due diligence for the unprotected group.

5. **Increased Scrutiny for Protected Group (Co-Signer, Collateral Visits):**

    *   The protected group variants frequently involve "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and multiple "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" steps before either denial or (rarely) approval. This pattern indicates that the protected group faces much higher scrutiny and more stringent requirements than the unprotected group. The need for a co-signer and repeated collateral assessments suggests a lack of trust or a higher perceived risk associated with the protected group, even when their applications are ultimately denied.

**Domain Knowledge Implications**

*   **Redlining and Systemic Bias:** The observed patterns are consistent with historical practices of redlining and systemic bias in lending. Redlining refers to the discriminatory practice of denying services (like loans) to residents of certain areas, often based on race or ethnicity.
*   **Fair Lending Laws:** These disparities likely violate fair lending laws, which are designed to prevent discrimination in credit transactions based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age).
*   **Unconscious Bias:** Even without explicit intent to discriminate, unconscious biases among loan officers and underwriters can lead to these kinds of unfair outcomes.
*   **Data-Driven Discrimination:** The use of certain data points in credit scoring models can perpetuate historical biases, even if those data points are not explicitly protected characteristics.

**Conclusion**

The analysis reveals strong evidence of unfair and potentially discriminatory differences in the loan application process between the protected and unprotected groups. The protected group faces:

*   Higher appointment denial rates.
*   Higher early application rejection rates.
*   Higher loan denial rates after reaching the underwriter.
*   Increased scrutiny through co-signer requests and repeated collateral assessments.

Meanwhile, the unprotected group appears to benefit from:

*   Lower rejection rates at all stages.
*   A "skipped examination" pathway to loan approval.

These disparities raise serious concerns about systemic bias and potential violations of fair lending laws. Further investigation and corrective actions are needed to ensure a fair and equitable loan application process for all.
