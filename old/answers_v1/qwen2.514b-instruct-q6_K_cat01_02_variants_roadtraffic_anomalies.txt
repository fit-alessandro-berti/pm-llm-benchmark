To identify main anomalies in the given process variants based on their frequency and performance, we need to look at outliers in terms of either unusually high or low frequencies relative to their performance metrics. Here's a detailed breakdown focusing specifically on those criteria:

1. **High Frequency with Unusually High Performance:**
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection` (Frequency = 56482, Performance = 59591524.946)
     - This variant has a very high frequency and high performance relative to other variants with similar steps.
   
   - `Create Fine -> Payment` (Frequency = 46371, Performance = 889688.400)
     - This is the highest frequency but not as high in terms of performance compared to others.

2. **High Frequency with Unusually Low Performance:**
   - These are less evident since there aren't major discrepancies between frequencies and their performances. However, variants with many steps that have lower performance than expected given their frequency could be considered.
   
3. **Low Frequency but High Performance:**
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Payment` (Frequency = 135, Performance = 55173760.000)
     - This variant has a low frequency compared to others but extremely high performance.
   
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection` (Frequency = 108, Performance = 90716800.000)
     - Similar characteristics as above with very low frequency and extremely high performance.
   
4. **Low Frequency but Relatively Low Performance:**
   - These are also less evident unless they have a specific characteristic that makes them stand out. For instance:
     - `Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture` (Frequency = 9, Performance = 131155200.000)
       - This variant has a very low frequency and unusually high performance.
     
   - `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture` (Frequency = 126, Performance = 18823542.857)
     - While not extremely low in frequency, it has a relatively lower performance compared to similar steps variants.

In summary, the main anomalies are:

- Variants with high frequencies but exceptionally high performances (`Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection`, `Create Fine -> Payment`).
- Variants with low frequencies but extremely high performances (`Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Payment`, `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection`).
