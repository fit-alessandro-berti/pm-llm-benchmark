This data describes a process for handling employee declarations, likely expense claims or similar requests, with a focus on approvals, rejections, and ultimately payment. Let's break down the process based on the provided frequencies and performance times:

**Core Process Flow (High Frequency):**

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process begins when an employee submits a declaration. This is the starting point for the vast majority of cases.
2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION:**  The most common next step (8202 frequency) is for the declaration to be approved by the administration. This likely represents an initial review for completeness and policy compliance.
3. **Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:** Following administrative approval, the declaration often goes to a supervisor for final approval (5133 + 2788 frequency, depending on the path). This suggests the supervisor has the ultimate authority to greenlight the request. The budget owner is also involved in the approval.
4. **Request Payment:** Once the supervisor approves (FINAL\_APPROVED), a payment request is triggered (10038 frequency). This indicates that the declaration has passed all necessary checks and is ready for payment processing.
5. **Payment Handled:** Finally, the payment is processed and handled (10037 frequency). This is the successful end state for most declarations.

**Alternative Approval Paths (Medium Frequency):**

*   **Declaration APPROVED by PRE\_APPROVER:**  In some cases (685 frequency), a pre-approver reviews the declaration before it reaches the supervisor. This could be a team lead or a designated individual responsible for an initial layer of approval.
*   **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER:**  Some declarations require approval from a budget owner (2820 frequency). This suggests that certain requests may need specific authorization based on budget constraints or allocation.

**Rejection Paths (Low to Medium Frequency):**

*   **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION:** The administration can reject declarations (952 frequency). This likely happens if the declaration is incomplete, violates policy, or lacks necessary information.
*   **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE:** Employees themselves can reject declarations (1081 + other lower frequencies). This could occur if they realize an error, need to modify the request, or decide to withdraw it. The main flow shows that most of the time, if an employee rejects a declaration, they will resubmit it.
*   **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR:** Supervisors can reject declarations (60 + other lower frequencies). This might happen if they disagree with the request, find it inappropriate, or lack sufficient justification. The main flow shows that most of the time, if a supervisor rejects a declaration, the employee will reject it as well.
*   **Declaration REJECTED by PRE\_APPROVER:** Pre-approvers can reject declarations (86 frequency).
*   **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER:** Budget owners can reject declarations (59 frequency).
*   **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING:**  This is an interesting case. It suggests that sometimes a declaration gets rejected due to a missing step or an error in the process itself (86 + other lower frequencies). There is also a high performance time, meaning this step takes a while. The main flow also shows that if the declaration is rejected by a missing state, that the employee will resubmit the declaration.

**Exceptional Cases (Very Low Frequency):**

*   There are several very low-frequency paths indicating unusual scenarios, such as:
    *   Declarations being "SAVED" but not submitted.
    *   Direct transitions from "Declaration FINAL\_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" to "Payment Handled" (7 frequency), bypassing "Request Payment."
    *   A payment being handled, but then the employee rejects the declaration.
    *   Declarations stuck in "FOR\_APPROVAL" states.

**Overall Process Description:**

The process is primarily designed for employees to submit declarations, which then undergo administrative review, pre-approval (in some cases), budget owner approval (in some cases), and finally, supervisor approval. Once approved, a payment request is created, and the payment is handled. However, there are multiple rejection points at various stages, and employees can also reject their own declarations. The "REJECTED by MISSING" cases highlight potential process inefficiencies or system errors that need investigation.

**In essence, this data reveals a relatively standard approval workflow with built-in checks and balances, but also with some areas where the process could be optimized or clarified, particularly regarding the "REJECTED by MISSING" scenarios and the very low-frequency exceptional cases.**
