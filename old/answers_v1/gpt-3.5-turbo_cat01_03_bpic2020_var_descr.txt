Based on the process variants provided, we can see that the process starts with an employee submitting a declaration. The declaration then goes through various approval stages, involving different parties such as administration, budget owner, pre-approver, and supervisor. 

After the final approval by the supervisor, a request for payment is made, followed by the handling of the payment. However, there are also scenarios where the declaration is rejected at different stages by various parties, leading to the declaration being resubmitted and going through the approval process again.

The frequency and performance metrics provide insights into the volume of each process variant and their efficiency. The data suggests that most declarations are approved by the supervisor and result in payments being handled, although there are also instances of rejections and resubmissions. 

Overall, the process involves multiple approval stages, with the final outcome being the handling of payments once the declaration is approved by the supervisor.
