To identify the unfair differences in how the "protected" group and "unprotected" group were treated, we should look for patterns or significant variations that could indicate bias in processes.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive analysis of the process variants for both groups:

### Protected Group Process Variants:
1. **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant**
   - Performance: 270000.477
   - Frequency: 1036

2. **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant**
   - Performance: 540011.977
   - Frequency: 793

3. **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant**
   - Performance: 89999.306
   - Frequency: 484

4. **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant**
   - Performance: 449997.746
   - Frequency: 366

5. **etc...**

### Unprotected Group Process Variants:
1. **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant**
   - Performance: 400004.64
   - Frequency: 2490

2. **etc...**

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequency of Processing Time**:
   - The unprotected group is consistently processing significantly faster and with better performance compared to the protected group.

2. **Process Complexity vs. Speed**:
   - In the unprotected group, each process tends to be completed within a few minutes, even without any substantial additional steps like extensive screening or checks that could slow down operations.
   
3. **Performance Differences**:
   - The protected group's processing times are generally higher and show less variation in performance across different processes.
  
4. **Steps Included vs. Excluded**:
   - In the unprotected group, there seems to be a more streamlined process compared to the protected group which includes extensive screening and multiple steps, especially towards the end of the process.

### Possible Reasons for Unfair Differences:

1. **Process Optimization**: The unprotected group may have had processes optimized with less complexity, allowing for faster execution.
2. **Resource Allocation**: The protected group might not be allocating as many resources (e.g., time or computational power) to each step in their processes compared to the unprotected group.
3. **Risk Assessment**: The protected group might be performing more rigorous risk assessments upfront that add unnecessary steps and increase processing times.

### Recommendations:

1. **Review Process Complexity**:
   - Inspect whether there are any steps or components that can be simplified or eliminated without significantly affecting outcomes.

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Evaluate if resources (time, computing power) are being fairly distributed between different process variants.
   
3. **Risk Management vs. Efficiency**:
   - Determine the balance between ensuring thorough risk management and optimizing overall processing times for efficiency.

By addressing these points, organizations can improve their processes to better align with user expectations while maintaining necessary security measures.
