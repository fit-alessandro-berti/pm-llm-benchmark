To identify the main anomalies in the provided process variants, we need to examine both the frequency and performance metrics. Here are some key observations:

1. **High Frequency with High Performance Variance**:
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection" has the highest frequency (56482) and a high performance value (59591524.946). This indicates a common but potentially inefficient process.
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Payment" has a high frequency (46371) but a relatively low performance value (889688.400). This suggests a more efficient process.

2. **Low Frequency with High Performance**:
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection" has a low frequency (108) but an extremely high performance value (90716800.000). This indicates a rare but highly inefficient process.
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Appeal to Judge -> Send for Credit Collection" also has a low frequency (16) but a very high performance value (98982000.000).

3. **High Frequency with Low Performance**:
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine" has a moderate frequency (20385) and a moderate performance value (8380516.026). This suggests a relatively efficient process compared to others with similar frequencies.

4. **Processes with Multiple Payments**:
   - Variants with multiple "Payment" steps, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment -> Payment -> Payment" (frequency = 13, performance = 52810338.462), indicate potential inefficiencies or anomalies in the process flow.

5. **Appeal Processes**:
   - Variants involving appeals, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture" (frequency = 2497, performance = 36264851.582), generally have higher performance values, indicating potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the appeal process.

6. **Rare but Efficient Processes**:
   - The variant "Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine" has a low frequency (362) but a relatively low performance value (5545113.812), suggesting an efficient but rarely used process.

7. **Complex Processes**:
   - Variants with complex sequences, such as "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Payment" (frequency = 139, performance = 30608598.561), have moderate frequencies but high performance values, indicating potential areas for process improvement.

These observations highlight the main anomalies in terms of frequency and performance, suggesting areas where the process might be inefficient or where specific variants are particularly costly in terms of performance.
