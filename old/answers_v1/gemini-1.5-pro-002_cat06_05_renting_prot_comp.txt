The key differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups seem to revolve around rejection rates, screening intensity, and possibly speed of processing, although the data provided only offers performance (time) and not specific timings for individual steps.  Here's a breakdown:

**1. Rejection Rates & Points of Rejection:**

* **Early Rejection:** The protected group is rejected much more frequently *before* even viewing the property (variants starting with "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant").  This suggests potential bias in the initial screening process for the protected group. The unprotected group, while also having this variant, has significantly fewer instances of it.

* **Rejection after Viewing:** Both groups are rejected after viewing, especially after basic screening ("Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant"). However, the protected group seems subjected to "Extensive Screening" more frequently before rejection than the unprotected group, adding time and burden without necessarily changing the outcome.

**2.  "Extensive Screening" Disparity:**

* **Overuse of Extensive Screening:**  The protected group appears to undergo "Extensive Screening" far more often, even in cases where they are ultimately rejected. This suggests potential discriminatory practices, as extra scrutiny is applied without clear justification based on the provided data.  It's notable that even when the protected group makes it to the "Sign Contract" stage, many paths include "Extensive Screening," which isn't as prevalent in the unprotected group's successful paths.

**3.  Performance (Time) Discrepancies:**

* **Early Rejection Time:**  While the unprotected group is rejected earlier more often, the *time* taken for early rejection ("Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant") seems comparable or potentially slightly higher for the protected group (89999.306 vs. 80002.688). This could indicate delays even in rejection processes for the protected group.

* **Overall Processing Time:** Generally, when comparing similar variants (e.g., paths reaching "Tenant Cancels Apartment"), the protected group's performance times appear slightly higher. This might indicate general slowdowns or inefficiencies in processing their applications.

**4.  Eviction Variant:**

* **Presence for Protected Group Only:**  The protected group has a variant involving eviction ("Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant") which is absent in the unprotected group's data. This alone isn't necessarily evidence of unfair treatment, but warrants further investigation.  Are eviction rates truly higher for the protected group, or is this a data sampling issue?

**Key Questions to Investigate:**

* What criteria are used for initial screening and rejection *before* viewing appointments?
* What differentiates "Extensive Screening" from regular screening, and what justifies its use?  Are these criteria applied consistently across groups?
* Why are processing times generally longer for the protected group, even for similar process variants?
* What are the actual eviction rates for both groups, and are there systemic factors contributing to any disparities?


By focusing on these questions, you can pinpoint potential areas of unfairness and discrimination within the tenant application process.
