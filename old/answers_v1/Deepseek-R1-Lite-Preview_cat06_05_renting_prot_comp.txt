To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their frequencies and execution times. Here are the main differences observed:

### 1. **Frequency of Rejection:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The process variant where the prospective tenant is rejected early on (`Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Reject Prospective Tenant`) has a frequency of 484.
     - There are several variants where the tenant is rejected after more steps, such as after screening or extensive screening, with frequencies ranging from 366 to 1036.
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The most frequent rejection process variant is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 2490, which is significantly higher than any rejection variant in the protected group.
     - Another high-frequency rejection variant is `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant` with a frequency of 1022.

   - **Conclusion:**
     - The unprotected group is rejected more frequently and often earlier in the process compared to the protected group. The high frequency of rejection in the unprotected group suggests that they are being screened out more aggressively.

### 2. **Process Complexity and Execution Time:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The protected group has several process variants that involve more steps, such as `Extensive Screening`, `Sign Contract`, `Move In`, `Pay Rent`, and `Tenant Cancels Apartment`, with execution times ranging from 270,000 to over 1.3 million.
     - There are also variants where the tenant is rejected after extensive screening or even after moving in and paying rent, indicating a more complex and lengthy process.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has fewer process variants that involve `Extensive Screening`, and the ones that do exist have lower frequencies.
     - The rejection process variants for the unprotected group are generally shorter and involve fewer steps, with execution times ranging from 80,000 to over 1.2 million.

   - **Conclusion:**
     - The protected group undergoes more complex and time-consuming processes, including more extensive screening and even rejections after signing the contract and moving in. This suggests that the protected group is subjected to more scrutiny and a more prolonged process, which could indicate unfair treatment.

### 3. **Post-Contractual Rejections:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - There are several variants where the tenant is rejected or cancels after signing the contract, moving in, and paying rent, such as:
       - `Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment` (frequency = 29 to 14).
     - There are also variants where the tenant is evicted after missing rent payments, indicating a more complex and adverse outcome.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has fewer variants where the tenant is rejected or cancels after signing the contract and moving in, and these variants have lower frequencies.
     - The unprotected group does not have any variants involving eviction due to missed rent payments.

   - **Conclusion:**
     - The protected group is more likely to experience adverse outcomes, such as eviction, after signing the contract and moving in. This suggests that the protected group is subjected to more scrutiny and is more likely to face negative consequences even after completing the rental process.

### 4. **Overall Process Variability:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The protected group has a wider variety of process variants, including more complex and longer processes, which suggests that their treatment is less standardized and more variable.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group has fewer process variants, with a higher concentration of frequency in a few key variants, suggesting a more standardized and streamlined process.

   - **Conclusion:**
     - The variability in the protected group's process variants suggests that their treatment is less consistent and potentially more biased compared to the unprotected group.

### **Final Conclusion:**
The main differences indicate that the protected group is subjected to more scrutiny, more complex processes, and more adverse outcomes compared to the unprotected group. The unprotected group is rejected more frequently and earlier in the process, while the protected group faces more extensive screening, longer processes, and even rejections or evictions after signing the contract and moving in. These differences suggest potential unfair treatment of the protected group.
