Let's analyze the process variants you've provided to identify potential root causes for performance issues.

**Key Observations and Potential Root Causes:**

1. **High Frequency, Relatively Low Performance in Top Variants:**

    *   **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (4618 frequency, 810187.903 performance):** This is the most frequent path and a performance bottleneck. While it's the most streamlined, it's worth investigating the individual steps.
    *   **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (2473 frequency, 1084338.407 performance):** The addition of "APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" adds a significant performance decrease and should be analyzed.

2. **Rejections are Major Contributors to Slowdowns:**

    *   Variants involving rejections (by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or BUDGET OWNER) consistently exhibit significantly worse performance. These rejections trigger rework, extending the overall process time.
    *   Specifically, "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" is a recurring pain point. Any variant that includes this step generally takes much longer.
    *   "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" also contributes significantly to slowdowns, leading to a cycle of rejection by the employee and resubmission.
    *   "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" is a state in the process that can be investigated, the employee is rejecting the declaration based on a previous rejection by other roles in the process (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or BUDGET OWNER).

3. **Rework Loops Dramatically Impact Performance:**

    *   The variants with the poorest performance often involve multiple "Declaration REJECTED" and "Declaration SUBMITTED" steps. These are essentially rework loops where the declaration is going back and forth between the employee and approvers.
    *   Example:  "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (4 frequency, 3502608.250 performance)" - This has multiple rejections and resubmissions, drastically increasing the time.

4. **"Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" Adds Overhead:**

    *   When "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" is part of the flow, performance tends to be worse compared to similar variants without it. This suggests the budget approval step might be introducing delays.

5. **"MISSING" Rejections Indicate Data or System Issues:**

    *   Variants with "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" have very poor performance. The "MISSING" label suggests a potential problem: either data is incomplete, or there's an issue with how the system is tracking the rejection reason.

6. **Outliers with Extremely High Performance Issues:**

    *   "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION (5 frequency, 13805869.200 performance)" stands out with a dramatically long processing time. This specific variant might have a unique problem causing such a long delay.

**Specific Root Cause Hypotheses (Based on Data):**

*   **Inefficient ADMINISTRATION Approval Process:** The "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" step is likely a bottleneck. This could be due to manual processes, lack of resources, complex approval criteria, or system limitations.
*   **Unclear or Inconsistent Rejection Criteria:** The high frequency of rejections suggests that the criteria for approval (at various stages) might be unclear, inconsistently applied, or overly strict.
*   **Lack of Communication/Feedback in Rejection Loops:** When a declaration is rejected, the employee may not be receiving sufficient feedback to make necessary corrections, leading to repeated rejections.
*   **Budget Owner Approval Bottleneck:** The "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" step may involve manual checks, complex calculations, or a lack of real-time budget information.
*   **Data Integrity or System Errors:** The "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" cases indicate problems with how rejections are being recorded or processed, possibly caused by data errors or system bugs.

**Further Investigation:**

To pinpoint the exact causes, you'd need to investigate further:

*   **Examine the individual steps:** Measure the time spent in each step (e.g., time taken by ADMINISTRATION to approve, time taken by SUPERVISOR to approve).
*   **Analyze Rejection Reasons:** If possible, get more details on the reasons for rejections. Are there common themes?
*   **Review System Logs:** Look for errors or delays in system logs that correspond to the slow process variants.
*   **Interview Stakeholders:** Talk to employees, administrators, supervisors, budget owners, and pre-approvers to understand their perspectives and challenges.

By combining this detailed process data analysis with further investigation, you can effectively identify the root causes of performance issues and implement targeted improvements.
