To generate a temporal profile for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process, we need to analyze historical process execution data to determine the average times and standard deviations between various activity couples. The P2P process typically includes the following steps:

1. Purchase Request
2. Purchase Order Creation
3. Goods Receipt
4. Invoice Receipt
5. Invoice Approval
6. Payment Creation
7. Payment Execution

Let's assume we have data for a large number of process executions and we've extracted the inter-activity times between each couple of activities. We will calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair, considering all possible follow-ups as you've described.

For the sake of this example, I'll provide a simplified temporal profile based on hypothetical averages and standard deviations. Please note that in a real-world scenario, these values would be derived from actual process data.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order Creation'): (72, 12),  # Average time in hours, standard deviation in hours
    ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'): (48, 8),
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (24, 6),
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Approval'): (72, 15),
    ('Invoice Approval', 'Payment Creation'): (48, 10),
    ('Payment Creation', 'Payment Execution'): (72, 18),
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment Creation'): (96, 20),  # This couple considers an indirect route through 'Invoice Receipt' and 'Invoice Approval'
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Execution'): (168, 30),  # This couple considers an indirect route through 'Invoice Approval' and 'Payment Creation'
    ('Purchase Request', 'Payment Execution'): (192, 32),  # This couple goes through all intermediate steps
}

# ZETA is a threshold value that defines the acceptable range for deviation
ZETA = 2  # For example, we let the time deviate up to 2 standard deviations from the average

def is_within_deviation(avg, stddev, zeta):
    """
    Check if the observed time is within the ZETA * STDDEV from the average.
    It is considered a deviation if the observed time is lower than AVG - ZETA * STDDEV
    or greater than AVG + ZETA * STDDEV.
    """
    lower_bound = avg - zeta * stddev
    upper_bound = avg + zeta * stddev
    return lower_bound <= observed_time <= upper_bound
```

In this hypothetical temporal profile, we have defined the average time and standard deviation for each couple of activities. For instance, on average, it takes 72 hours for a Purchase Request to be followed by a Purchase Order Creation, with a standard deviation of 12 hours. If in a specific process execution, the time between these two activities is between 50 and 94 hours (72 ± 2 * 12), it is considered within the expected range.

To use this profile in practice, you would compare the observed times between activities in a process execution to the thresholds defined by the average minus ZETA times the standard deviation, and the average plus ZETA times the standard deviation. If the observed time falls outside this range, it indicates a deviation from the expected temporal profile.
