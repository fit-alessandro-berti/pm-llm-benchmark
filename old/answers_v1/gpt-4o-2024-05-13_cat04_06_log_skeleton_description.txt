Based on the provided Log Skeleton process model constraints and the rules in place, the process can be described as follows:

### Process Overview

This process seems to be related to the approval and handling of declarations (possibly expenses, projects, or requests) involving multiple roles such as EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, and potentially some automated checks (indicated by "MISSING").

### Workflow Steps

1. **Submission by Employee**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** This activity can occur 0 to 7 times, with significant roles being involved in further reviewing and decision-making steps.

2. **Approval and Rejection by Different Roles**
   - Various declarations require approval from different roles such as ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, and PRE_APPROVER.
   - Rejections can also occur from these roles (REJECTED by...) at different stages.

3. **Equivalence Constraints**
   - **For example:** If a declaration is FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION, there should be an equivalent occurrence of FINAL_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, REQUEST PAYMENT, PAYMENT HANDLED, or other equivalence relationships as defined.

4. **Sequential Constraints**
   - **Always Before:** Some activities such as FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR and FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER must always be preceded by SUBMISSION by EMPLOYEE.
   - **Always After:** Certain activities like PAYMENTS HANDLED must always follow rejections (REJECTED by EMPLOYEE).

5. **Never Together Constraints**
   - Various activities are mutually exclusive within the same case, such as SAVED by EMPLOYEE and REJECTED by EMPLOYEE cannot co-exist in the same case, etc.

6. **Activity Occurrences Constraints**
   - Specific activities have defined limits on the number of times they can occur within a case, such as:
     - SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE: up to 7 times
     - APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION: up to 4 times
     - PAYMENT HANDLED: up to 1 time

7. **Directly-Follow Constraints**
   - Some activities must directly follow another, such as FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR directly followed by REJECTED by MISSING.

### Overall Process Flow

1. **Invocation by EMPLOYEE:** The process can be initiated by an EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration. 
2. **Pre-Approvals and Preliminary Checks:** This submission may go through various stages of FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER and SUPERVISOR.
3. **Rejections or Approvals:** Depending on the checks, the declaration can be REJECTED or APPROVED by various roles.
4. **Final Approvals:** If approved by all required parties, final declaration approvals can occur, ending with possible final approval by a SUPERVISOR.
5. **Handling Payment:** Once approvals are aligned, REQUEST PAYMENT might be initiated, followed by PAYMENT HANDLED, indicating the completion of the financial aspect.
6. **Special Constraints Handling:**
   - **Mutual Exclusions:** Several steps are set to never occur together to ensure data integrity and logical consistency within the process.
   - **Direct Sequences:** Predetermined sequential order ensures certain checks/approvals/rejections happen in a designed manner.

### Summary

This process involves a complex approval and review mechanism that ensures that each declaration submitted by an employee passes through several checks and stages of approval, with multiple constraints to maintain process integrity and logical flow. The constraints ensure that the process maintains a predefined sequence, mutual exclusivity, and occurrence limits, fostering a controlled and organized pathway from submission to final decision and payment handling.
