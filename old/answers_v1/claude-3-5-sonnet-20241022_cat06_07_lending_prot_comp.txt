Analyzing these process variants, I can identify several key differences in how the protected and unprotected groups are treated in this loan application process:

1. Loan Approval Rates:
- The unprotected group has a higher proportion of approved loans (Sign Loan Agreement outcomes). For example, one of their main variants shows 1,656 approvals through a direct path.
- The protected group has significantly fewer loan approvals, with most variants ending in "Loan Denied" or "Application Rejected".

2. Process Complexity:
- The protected group tends to go through more complex paths with multiple iterations of "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" and "Request Co-Signer On Loan"
- The unprotected group more frequently follows simpler, more direct paths to decision

3. Additional Requirements:
- The protected group is more frequently asked for co-signers and multiple collateral assessments
- The unprotected group has access to a "skipped_examination" path (332 cases) which isn't available to the protected group

4. Processing Times:
- The protected group generally experiences longer processing times for similar paths
- The unprotected group tends to have more standardized processing times

5. Initial Screening:
- The protected group has a higher proportion of "Appointment Denied" (599 cases vs 363 cases for unprotected group), suggesting potential discrimination at the entry point

These differences suggest systematic bias in the loan approval process, with the protected group facing:
- More stringent requirements
- More complex approval paths
- Higher rejection rates
- Longer processing times
- More barriers to entry

This pattern could indicate institutional discrimination in the lending process.
