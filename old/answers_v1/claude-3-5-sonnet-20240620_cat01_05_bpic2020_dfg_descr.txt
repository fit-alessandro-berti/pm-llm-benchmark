Based on the provided flow data, I can describe the underlying process, which appears to be an expense declaration and payment system within an organization. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Declaration Submission:
   - An employee submits a declaration for expenses.

2. Approval Process:
   - The declaration goes through various approval stages, which may include:
     a. Pre-approver review
     b. Administration review
     c. Budget owner review
     d. Supervisor final approval

3. Rejection Handling:
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages:
     a. By administration
     b. By pre-approver
     c. By budget owner
     d. By supervisor
   - Rejected declarations are typically sent back to the employee for revision and resubmission.

4. Final Approval:
   - The supervisor gives the final approval for the declaration.

5. Payment Request:
   - Once finally approved, a payment request is generated.

6. Payment Handling:
   - The payment is processed and handled.

Key observations:

1. Multiple approval paths: There are different routes a declaration can take, possibly depending on the nature or amount of the expense.

2. Hierarchical approval: The process involves multiple levels of approval, suggesting a hierarchical structure in the organization.

3. Frequent rejections and resubmissions: There's a significant number of rejections and resubmissions, indicating a thorough review process.

4. Occasional anomalies: There are some rare paths in the process, such as declarations being rejected after final approval or payment, which might represent edge cases or error corrections.

5. Performance variations: The performance metrics (likely representing time taken) vary significantly between different steps, with some steps taking much longer than others.

6. High-frequency paths: The most common path seems to be from final approval to payment request and then to payment handling, representing the successful completion of the process.

This process appears designed to ensure proper review and approval of expense declarations before payment is made, with multiple checks and balances in place.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process or analyze any particular aspect of the data?
