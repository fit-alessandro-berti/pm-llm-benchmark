The provided data describes various process variants for handling declarations in an organizational setting. Each variant represents a sequence of different states or actions that a declaration goes through. Here is a breakdown of the process underlying this data:

### Core Process Flow

1. **Declaration Submitted by Employee**
   - The process begins when an employee submits a declaration.

2. **Declaration Approved by Administration**
   - The submitted declaration is reviewed and approved by the administration.

3. **Declaration Approved by Budget Owner (Optional)**
   - In some variants, the approved declaration is further reviewed and approved by a budget owner.

4. **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor**
   - The declaration is then reviewed and finally approved by a supervisor.

5. **Request Payment**
   - After the final approval, a request for payment is initiated.

6. **Payment Handled**
   - The payment is processed and handled.

### Process Variants

1. **Direct Approval and Final Approval**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Approved by Administration** -> **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
     - This is the most common and straightforward process variant.

2. **Additional Approval by Budget Owner**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Approved by Administration** -> **Declaration Approved by Budget Owner** -> **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**

3. **Rejection and Resubmission**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Rejected by Administration** -> **Declaration Rejected by Employee** -> **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Approved by Administration** -> **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
   - This variant involves a rejection by the administration, followed by resubmission by the employee.

4. **Rejection by Different Approvers**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Rejected by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration Rejected by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Rejected by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration Rejected by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Approved by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
   - This variant involves multiple rejections and resubmissions.

5. **Rejection by Pre-Approver**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Rejected by PRE_APPROVER** -> **Declaration Rejected by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration Approved by PRE_APPROVER** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
   - This variant involves a rejection by a pre-approver, followed by resubmission and final approval.

6. **Missing Information**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
   - This variant involves a rejection due to missing information, followed by re-submission and final approval.

7. **Rejection by Different Approvers with Multiple Resubmissions**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**
   - This variant involves multiple rejections and resubmissions.

8. **Rejection by Budget Owner**

9. **Rejection by Supervisor**
   - **Declaration Submitted by Employee** -> **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** -> **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** -> **Request Payment** -> **Payment Handled**

10. **Saved Declaration**

### Summary

The process involves several states and approvals, with various paths based on the approvals or rejections by different entities (Employee, Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor). The declarations can be rejected at any stage and resubmitted until they are finally approved and payments are handled. The frequency and performance metrics provided for each variant give insight into how often and how efficiently each variant is executed.
