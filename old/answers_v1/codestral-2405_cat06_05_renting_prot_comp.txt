The main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group in the provided data are:

1. Extensive Screening: The protected group undergoes more extensive screening processes compared to the unprotected group. This could be a factor contributing to the longer execution times for the protected group.

2. Rejection Rate: The protected group is rejected more frequently than the unprotected group. This is evident from the process variants where the last step is "Reject Prospective Tenant." The protected group has four such variants (with frequencies 1036, 793, 366, and 484) while the unprotected group has three (with frequencies 2490, 1022, and 365).

3. Tenant Cancellation: Both groups have process variants where tenants cancel their apartment rentals. However, the protected group tends to have more variants with multiple instances of "Pay Rent" followed by "Tenant Cancels Appartment." This could indicate that the protected group is subjected to more stringent rental agreements or conditions.

4. Eviction: There is a process variant for the protected group where tenants are evicted after missing a rent payment. This variant is not present in the unprotected group's process variants.

5. Performance: The execution times for the protected group's process variants are generally higher than those of the unprotected group. This could be due to the additional steps in the protected group's process variants, such as extensive screening and eviction.

These differences suggest that the protected group may be subjected to more stringent and time-consuming procedures than the unprotected group, which could potentially lead to unfair treatment.

However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the data provided and may not necessarily reflect all the factors involved. Other variables or context could also contribute to the differences observed.
