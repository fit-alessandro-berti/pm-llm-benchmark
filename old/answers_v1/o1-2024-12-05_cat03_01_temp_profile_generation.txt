Below is an example of a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. The keys are tuples representing pairs of activities that may occur in sequence (not necessarily immediately, but at some point in the process execution), and the values are tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds. These values are illustrative and meant to reflect a plausible scenario, rather than actual metrics.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Approve Purchase Requisition'): (86400, 3600),     # ~1 day avg, ±1 hour
    ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): (43200, 3600),           # ~12 hours avg, ±1 hour
    ('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): (129600, 7200),           # ~1.5 days avg, ±2 hours
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (259200, 28800),                        # ~3 days avg, ±8 hours
    ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Goods Receipt'): (345600, 43200),                 # ~4 days avg, ±12 hours
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400, 14400),                               # ~1 day avg, ±4 hours
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): (172800, 21600)                                     # ~2 days avg, ±6 hours
}
```

In this hypothetical model:

- It typically takes about one day after the requisition is created for it to be approved.
- Once approved, creating a purchase order often happens within half a day.
- However, if you consider the entire span from requisition creation directly to purchase order creation (skipping the explicit approval step in the middle), it might average 1.5 days, reflecting that sometimes the order creation might not follow immediately after approval.
- Goods are received, on average, three days after the purchase order is created, with a fairly large standard deviation to account for varying vendor lead times.
- Invoice receipt generally occurs about a day after goods receipt, with moderate variability.
- Payment is processed about two days after the invoice is received, again with some variability.

These numbers serve as a realistic yet purely illustrative example of a temporal profile for a typical Purchase-to-Pay process.
