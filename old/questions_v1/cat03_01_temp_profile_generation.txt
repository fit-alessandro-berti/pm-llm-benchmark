The temporal profile is a model describing the average and the standard deviation of the times between couples of activities eventually (not only directly) following each other in at least a process execution (so in a trace <A,B,C,D> the couples (A,B) (A,C) (A,D) (B,C) (B,D) (C,D) shall be considered). Given a positive value ZETA, a deviation occurs in a process execution when the time between two activities is lower than AVG - ZETA * STDEV or greater than AVG + ZETA * STDEV.

The temporal profile is expressed as a Python dictionary associating to some couples of activities the average and the standard deviation of the times. Example: {('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), ('B', 'C'): (3600, 3600)} indicates that the average time between A and B is 1 day, while the standard deviation is 1 hour. On the other hand, the average time between B and C is 1 hour, while the standard deviation is 1 hour.

Can you generate a temporal profile for an hypothetic Purchase-to-Pay process ?
