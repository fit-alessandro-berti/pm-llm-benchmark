A process tree is a hierarchical process model.
The following operators are defined for process trees:
-> ( A, B ) tells that the process tree A should be executed before the process tree B
X ( A, B ) tells that there is an exclusive choice between executing the process tree A or the process tree B
+ ( A, B ) tells that A and B are executed in true concurrency.
* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited).
the leafs of a process tree are either activities (denoted by 'X' where X is the name of the activity) or silent steps (indicated by tau).
An example process tree follows:
+ ( 'A', -> ( 'B', 'C' ) )
tells that you should execute B before executing C. In true concurrency, you can execute A. So the possible traces are A->B->C, B->A->C, B->C->A.

ProcessTree objects are defined in pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree
They have as properties:
- parent (the parent process tree, which is left empty for the root node)
- children (the child ProcessTree objects)
- operator (one of the pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator enumeration values: Operator.SEQUENCE, Operator.XOR, Operator.PARALLEL, Operator.LOOP)
- label (if the ProcessTree is a leaf, then it is valued with the label)
The properties are mimicked in the constructor.

Note that adding the process trees as children is not enough. Their parent should be explicitly set to the parent node. Otherwise, it does not work.

Example construction:
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=root)
seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
B = ProcessTree(label="B", parent=seq)
C = ProcessTree(label="C", parent=seq)
seq.children.append(B)
seq.children.append(C)
root.children.append(A)
root.children.append(seq)

can you generate the Python code necessary to implement in pm4py a process tree for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process?
