Given an event log describing a process with the following directly-follows graph:



Diagnosis -> Treatment ( frequency = 11746  performance = 60000.515 )
Treatment successful -> Discharge ( frequency = 9005  performance = 40000.809 )
Treatment -> Treatment successful ( frequency = 9005  performance = 60000.920 )
Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 5922  performance = 60000.484 )
Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination ( frequency = 3637  performance = 60000.837 )
Register at FD -> Expert Examination ( frequency = 2888  performance = 40000.311 )
Register at ER -> Expert Examination ( frequency = 2866  performance = 39999.839 )
Expert Examination -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 2117  performance = 60001.158 )
Examination -> Thorough Examination ( frequency = 1968  performance = 60001.727 )
Register at ER -> Examination ( frequency = 1826  performance = 39999.967 )
Register at FD -> Examination ( frequency = 1783  performance = 40000.349 )
Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 1746  performance = 40000.741 )
Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful ( frequency = 1746  performance = 60001.635 )
Examination -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 1641  performance = 60001.797 )
Treatment -> Discharge ( frequency = 995  performance = 100002.807 )
Register at FD -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 163  performance = 80001.325 )
Register at ER -> Thorough Examination ( frequency = 159  performance = 79999.434 )
Register at FD -> Thorough Examination ( frequency = 158  performance = 80001.253 )
Register at ER -> Diagnosis ( frequency = 157  performance = 80003.134 )
