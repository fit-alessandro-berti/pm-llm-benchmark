The provided SQL query is precise, efficient, and directly fulfills the requirements without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. It correctly uses a subquery to identify qualifying `case_id`s via grouping and `HAVING` with `COUNT(*) <= 6`, then performs an inner `JOIN` to retrieve all events (via `e.*`) from only those cases, excluding all others as specified. This approach avoids unnecessary data exposure, leverages standard SQL constructs compatible with DuckDB, and ensures the full set of events for retained cases is returned intact. No optimizations, edge cases (e.g., empty table or no qualifying cases), or syntactic improvements are strictly needed beyond this, rendering it flawless for the task.
