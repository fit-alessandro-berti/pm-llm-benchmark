The provided SQL query is logically correct, semantically accurate, and directly addresses the requirements without any unnecessary complexity or errors. It properly uses a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING to identify qualifying case_ids (those with COUNT(*) <= 6), then filters the full event_log table via IN to return all events from those cases. The SELECT * ensures the full set of events is returned, as specified. The explanation is concise, precise, and reinforces the query's intent without introducing ambiguities. No syntax issues, performance concerns (for DuckDB), or deviations from the task are present; it is flawless under strict scrutiny.
