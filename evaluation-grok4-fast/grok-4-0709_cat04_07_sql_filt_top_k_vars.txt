The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully addresses the prompt's requirements with precision, efficiency, and correctness. It accurately extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp ASC`, groups and counts variants correctly, selects the top K via frequency-based ranking (with sensible tie-breaking), and filters the event log to return only events from qualifying cases. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; minor assumptions (e.g., timestamp ties, K as a placeholder) are inherent to the problem and handled appropriately. The use of CTEs is clean and performant in DuckDB.
