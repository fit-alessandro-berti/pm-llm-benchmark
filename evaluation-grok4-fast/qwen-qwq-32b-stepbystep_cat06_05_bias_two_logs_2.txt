The provided answer is a model of clarity, accuracy, and logical rigor. It precisely identifies Group B as the biased process, supported by direct evidence from the logs (e.g., specific score adjustments for U001 and U003 versus U002's rejection). The manifestation of bias—preferential treatment via non-merit-based boosts—is dissected without flaw, emphasizing how it overrides objective metrics. Implications for fairness and equity are explored comprehensively yet concisely, linking to equitable treatment, legal/ethical risks, talent quality, and transparency, all grounded in the data. The contrast with Group A's merit-based neutrality reinforces the analysis without overreach. The conclusion succinctly restates the bias and offers practical remediation, fully aligning with the question's requirements. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical gaps exist; it is entirely flawless in its final form.
