The provided answer is a correct, efficient, and complete DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, joins back to the original table to filter for cases with `event_count <= 6`, and selects all columns (`e.*`) from qualifying events, ensuring full rows are returned for valid cases only. The explanation is accurate, concise, and directly addresses the problem without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
