The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query accurately achieves the task by correctly grouping events per `case_id`, filtering for counts 6, and retrieving all events from qualifying cases via a precise INNER JOIN. It leverages CTEs appropriately for clarity and efficiency in DuckDB, with no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unnecessary complexity. The explanation is concise, directly tied to the query, and reinforces the mechanics without extraneous details. Even under hypercritical scrutiny, no minor issues detract from its perfection.
