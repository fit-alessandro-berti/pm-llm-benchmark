### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem and correctly implements the core logic required: identifying cases with the exact consecutive sequence using JOINs and NOT EXISTS clauses to enforce direct succession, applying the >5-day filter on the relevant timestamp difference, and excluding all events from matching cases via a NOT IN subquery. The use of DuckDB-compatible syntax (e.g., `interval '5 days'`) is appropriate, and the final output returns all events from non-matching cases as specified. The explanatory notes add clarity, though they are extraneous for a pure query submission.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several issues prevent a higher score:
- **Unused and redundant CTE (major sloppiness)**: The `sequence_cases` CTE is fully defined but never referenced or used in subsequent CTEs or the final query. This is a clear copy-paste or drafting error, resulting in pointless computation and code bloat. It confuses the reader and indicates incomplete editing. A flawless answer would omit it entirely or correctly chain CTEs (e.g., build `filtered_cases` on top of `sequence_cases` to avoid repetition).
- **Code repetition (inefficiency and poor structure)**: The entire JOIN + NOT EXISTS logic is duplicated verbatim in `filtered_cases`, making the query longer and harder to maintain than necessary. A cleaner approach would compute the sequence once and filter timings in a follow-up CTE or subquery.
- **Lack of DISTINCT (minor logical inefficiency)**: The SELECT in both CTEs pulls `case_id` without `DISTINCT`, which could produce duplicate rows if a case has multiple valid triplets (e.g., multiple "Approve" events leading to valid sequences). While `NOT IN` tolerates duplicates, this is inefficient and risks performance issues on large logs; a precise query would use `DISTINCT` to ensure unique case_ids.
- **Unnecessary wrapper CTE (minor)**: `final_result` is an extra layer that could be inlined directly into the final SELECT, adding no value.
- **No ordering or grouping specified (minor omission)**: The problem mentions "proper grouping, ordering, and filtering," but the query returns unordered results with no explicit sorting (e.g., by `timestamp` or `case_id`). While not strictly required, this leaves the output arbitrary, potentially failing edge-case expectations for "proper" presentation.
- **Extraneous offer in notes (minor distraction)**: The closing "Let me know..." is helpful in a conversational context but irrelevant for a benchmark query submission, diluting focus.

These flaws—especially the unused/redundant elements—make the answer "good but not flawless," warranting deductions despite the correct intent and functionality. A near-perfect version would streamline to a single, non-redundant CTE for filtered case_ids and inline the final SELECT. Score reflects strong core accuracy offset by clear craft issues.
