The provided answer accurately infers and groups the 18 events into three distinct cases based on consistent patient identifiers (age and gender), logical activity sequences, chronological timestamps, and departmental continuity, with no events left unassigned or misgrouped. The structure is clear and comprehensive, including patient summaries, full event details, explanations for each case, and an overall summary that validates the approach without introducing ambiguities, redundancies, or errors. It fully addresses the task's requirements for inferring case IDs from the interleaved sequence.
