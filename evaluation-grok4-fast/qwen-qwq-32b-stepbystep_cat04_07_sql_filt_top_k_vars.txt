The provided SQL query correctly addresses all requirements of the benchmark prompt. It accurately extracts ordered activity sequences per case using STRING_AGG with the appropriate ORDER BY timestamp clause within the GROUP BY case_id. It properly groups by sequences to identify variants, counts cases per variant via COUNT(*) in the second CTE, and ranks them using ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) to determine the top K by frequency. The final SELECT efficiently filters and returns all original events (via the join to case_sequences and IN subquery on ranked variants) exclusively from cases in the top K variants, excluding others. The syntax is valid for DuckDB, with no logical flaws, ambiguities, or inaccuracies; the use of COUNT(*) in the window ORDER BY is acceptable and functional. The accompanying explanation reinforces clarity without introducing errors.
