The provided answer is nearly flawless. It delivers two correct, efficient, and equivalent SQL queries that precisely meet the requirements: identifying cases with 6 events via proper GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, then retrieving all events from those cases without including any from excluded cases. The CTE version is well-structured and performant (pre-filtering case_ids), while the IN subquery alternative is concise and avoids unnecessary column selection. The explanation is clear, accurate, and directly ties to the logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; even the minor inclusion of an unused `num_events` column in the CTE is harmless and does not impact correctness or efficiency in DuckDB.
