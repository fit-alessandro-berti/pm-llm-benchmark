10.0

The provided SQL query and explanation are fully correct, complete, and precisely address all requirements without any errors, ambiguities, or omissions. The use of `LEAD` window functions accurately detects consecutive sequences per case, the interval comparison is syntactically and semantically valid in DuckDB, the exclusion logic correctly identifies and filters entire cases, and the final output returns all events from non-excluded cases with appropriate ordering for a deterministic result. No penalties apply, as the solution is flawless.
