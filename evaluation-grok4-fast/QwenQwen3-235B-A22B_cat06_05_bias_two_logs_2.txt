9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The answer is exceptionally strong overall, with clear identification of Group B as the biased process, accurate breakdown of how the +5 cultural fit adjustment manifests (supported by precise examples like U001, U003 vs. P002), and a thoughtful comparison to Group A's neutral process. The implications for fairness and equity are comprehensively addressed, including systemic disadvantages, perpetuation of inequality, and ethical/legal risks, while offering actionable recommendations. 

Minor deductions for slight speculation (e.g., inferring a "threshold" of 65 for hiring, which is plausible but not definitively proven in the logs, as U003's adjusted 63 still results in hiring—potentially implying the boost's influence extends beyond a strict cutoff) and one small phrasing ambiguity (e.g., U003's scores are described as "lower across all metrics" compared to P002, which is true but could clarify that the personality score gap is notable yet the cultural boost overrides it). These are hyper-minor and do not undermine the core logic or accuracy, but under ultra-strict scrutiny, they prevent a perfect 10.0. The response is otherwise flawless in structure, evidence use, and depth.
