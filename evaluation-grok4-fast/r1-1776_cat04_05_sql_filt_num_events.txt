The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and clearly explained DuckDB SQL query that precisely fulfills the task requirements. The subquery accurately identifies qualifying `case_id` values using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, and the `IN` clause ensures all events from those cases are returned while excluding others. The approach, code, and explanation are logically sound, concise, and free of inaccuracies, ambiguities, or inefficiencies, with no deviations from standard SQL semantics supported in DuckDB.
