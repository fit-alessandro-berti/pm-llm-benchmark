The final process tree structure accurately captures the observed traces from the event log, including the initial sequence (RA  VF  AE), the exclusive choice after AE (direct to AD without additional VF/RMI, or entering the loop for one or more RMI followed by re-validation VF and then AD), and the final sequence (SC  AC). It handles consecutive RMI events via the loop * (RMI, tau), where tau enables silent continuation without adding extraneous events. The model ensures exact replay for all cases: Case 1 (one RMI + VF), Case 2 (no loop, no extra VF), and Case 3 (two RMI + VF), while maintaining precision by not permitting invalid sequences (e.g., AD before AE, multiple VF without RMI). Simplicity is balanced with the minimal use of operators, and tau is appropriately used for silent steps as permitted. The representation is correctly formatted and unambiguous.
