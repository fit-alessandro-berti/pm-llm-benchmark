### Evaluation Rationale
The final output is a well-formed Python dictionary that adheres to the specified structure: keys are correctly formatted as tuples of two activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), and values are tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds, consistent with the prompt's example (e.g., using multiples of 3600 for hours). It includes a representative subset of 23 pairs, blending consecutive ones (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`) with non-consecutive ones separated by multiple steps (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')`, `('OP', 'CA')`, `('RC', 'PT')`), which demonstrates complexity and follows the instruction to consider "eventually following" pairs without listing all ~90 possible ordered pairs.

However, the estimations reveal significant inaccuracies and logical flaws, warranting a deduction:
- **Unrealistic timings for supply chain context**: A global supply chain involves procurement, shipping, and distribution, where delays like order to receipt (`('OP', 'RC')` at 43200 seconds  12 hours) or distribution to after-sales (`('DT', 'AS')` at 12 hours) are implausibly short. Realistically, supplier lead times could be 1-7 days (86,400–604,800 seconds), and distribution/after-sales might span days to weeks. Most pairs use short hourly scales (e.g., 1–45 hours total for end-to-end like `('SS', 'AS')`), undermining the "estimated" plausibility for a "complex global supply chain process."
- **Inconsistent additive logic**: Non-consecutive times do not reliably sum from intermediates, indicating flawed reasoning. For example, `('SS', 'OP')` (3600s) + `('OP', 'RC')` (43200s)  46800s, but `('SS', 'RC')` is 43200s (ignores prior step). Similarly, `('RC', 'QI')` (7200s) + `('QI', 'CA')` (43200s) = 50400s, but `('OP', 'CA')` is 54000s (close but arbitrary, not derived). This suggests haphazard assignments rather than thoughtful aggregation across traces.
- **Arbitrary standard deviations**: While reasonable in scale (often 40–75% of average, modeling variability), they lack justification (e.g., no evidence of independence or summation of variances for multi-step pairs). Minor unclarities like the comment-based conversions (e.g., "±6.6h") are extraneous but harmless; however, they highlight imprecise calculations (e.g., 25920 / 3600  7.2 hours, not exactly 6.6).
- **Subset balance**: Good coverage of early-to-late pairs, but overly focused on SS/OP starters; misses some mid-chain complexity (e.g., no `('PT', 'AS')` or `('PK', 'AS')`), though this is minor as "representative subset" allows selectivity.

The output is structurally flawless and shows effort in estimation, but the core task demands "plausible" domain-specific times, and the flaws here are substantive, not minor, preventing a higher score. A near-flawless version would use realistic longer delays (days/weeks in seconds) with consistent summation and varied variability.
