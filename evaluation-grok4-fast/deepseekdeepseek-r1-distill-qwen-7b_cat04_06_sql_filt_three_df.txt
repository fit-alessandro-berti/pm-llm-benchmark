The provided answer's SQL query fails to correctly implement the required logic in multiple critical ways, rendering it non-functional and incorrect for the task. Key flaws include:

- **Incorrect sequence detection**: The `CASE` statement in the CTE only partially checks immediate predecessors (e.g., for 'Confirm Order', it verifies the prior activity is 'Create Order' but does not confirm the activity before 'Create Order' is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'). This misses ensuring direct succession of all three without intermediates. The `prev_two_activities` column produces inconsistent outputs (booleans or NULLs) and is compared to an arbitrary string in the JOIN, which is invalid.
  
- **Invalid time difference calculation**: `FILEREVERSE` is not a valid DuckDB SQL function (likely a hallucination; DuckDB uses `datediff('day', date1, date2)` or similar). The `DATEDIFF` is applied row-wise without conditioning on the relevant activities, so it computes meaningless differences across all events rather than specifically between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in the sequence. No conversion to days is properly handled.

- **Wrong filtering logic**: The query uses an INNER JOIN with conditions (`cs.time_diff > 5` and malformed sequence checks) that selects *only* events from cases meeting the criteria (i.e., the "bad" cases), directly contradicting the requirement to *exclude* them and return events from all other cases. There is no mechanism (e.g., a subquery to identify bad case_ids and LEFT JOIN with NULL exclusion or NOT IN) to filter out entire cases based on the presence of the sequence-and-timing condition anywhere within them.

- **Nonsensical subquery**: The final JOIN condition `(SELECT activity FROM case_sequence WHERE case_id = e.case_id) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition Create Order Confirm Order'` returns a single arbitrary `activity` value (undefined behavior due to no ORDER BY or LIMIT) and compares it to a concatenated string, which will always fail or error.

- **Lack of proper exclusion and completeness**: The query does not group by `case_id` to identify cases holistically (e.g., via aggregation or EXISTS checking for the full sequence in one case). It returns a subset of events (likely empty or erroneous) instead of *all events* from non-matching cases. No handling for multiple occurrences of the sequence per case or ties in timestamps.

The explanation misdescribes the code (claiming exclusion when it performs inclusion) and glosses over the flaws. Overall, the query would not execute correctly in DuckDB, produces wrong results, and does not address the prompt's core requirements. No partial credit for the high-level structure (CTE with windows), as the implementation is fundamentally broken.
