The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and fully compliant DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all requirements. It uses window functions (LAG and LEAD) appropriately to detect contiguous sequences per case, ordered by timestamp, ensuring no intervening events. The filtering logic accurately identifies cases with the exact sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition' immediately followed by 'Create Order' immediately followed by 'Confirm Order') and a time difference >5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', then excludes all events from those cases via NOT IN. The interval syntax (INTERVAL '5 days') is valid in DuckDB, and timestamp subtraction yields a comparable INTERVAL type. Edge cases (e.g., NULL LEAD/LAG at case boundaries) are handled correctly, as conditions fail safely. No grouping is needed, filtering is precise, and while output ordering isn't specified in the prompt, the query focuses correctly on selection without unnecessary ORDER BY. The accompanying explanation is clear, accurate, and reinforces the logic without extraneous content. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws exist.
