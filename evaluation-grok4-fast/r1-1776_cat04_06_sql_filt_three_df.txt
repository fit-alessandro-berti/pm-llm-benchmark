The provided answer is a complete, accurate, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all specified requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to detect consecutive activity sequences within cases, applies the time elapsed filter using interval arithmetic for exact "more than 5 days" comparison, identifies distinct cases meeting both criteria, and excludes all events from those cases in the final result. The query structure with CTEs is logical and performant, the syntax is valid for DuckDB, and the added ORDER BY ensures a coherent output without deviating from requirements. The explanation reinforces the solution without errors or omissions. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present.
