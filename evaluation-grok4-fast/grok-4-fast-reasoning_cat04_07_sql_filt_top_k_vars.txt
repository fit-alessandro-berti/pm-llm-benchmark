9.5

### Explanation of Grading
This SQL query is highly effective and aligns closely with the task requirements, demonstrating a solid understanding of DuckDB's features (e.g., `LIST_AGG` for ordered aggregation into arrays, window functions for ranking, and proper CTE chaining for modularity). It correctly:
- Extracts ordered activity sequences per `case_id` using `LIST_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`, which preserves timestamp-based ordering within each case.
- Groups by the variant (array) to identify unique sequences and counts frequencies accurately.
- Ranks variants by frequency using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)`, selecting the top K via a parameterized placeholder (`?`), which is a pragmatic way to handle the unspecified K value.
- Filters to cases in top K variants and returns all original events for those cases, excluding others, with a sensible `ORDER BY` for readability (though not strictly required).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor issues prevent a perfect 10.0:
- **Tie-handling in ranking**: `ROW_NUMBER()` arbitrarily resolves ties in frequency (e.g., if variants #3 and #4 both have the same count when K=3, it may exclude a tied variant unpredictably without additional tie-breaker like variant lexicographical order). The prompt doesn't explicitly require tie resolution, but a more robust approach (e.g., `DENSE_RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()` with `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, variant`) would be preferable for completeness, as process mining often benefits from deterministic variant selection. This is a subtle logical flaw in edge cases.
- **Parameterization**: Using `?` as a placeholder is functional but assumes external parameterization (e.g., via DuckDB's prepared statements). The prompt requests a "construct[ed] DuckDB SQL query" without specifying inputs, so hardcoding or using a variable (e.g., `LIMIT K` alternative) could be clearer, though the comment mitigates this. It's a minor clarity issue.
- **No explicit handling of edge cases**: Assumes unique timestamps per case for stable ordering (if duplicates exist, `ORDER BY timestamp` alone may not guarantee activity sequence stability without a secondary key like event ID). Also, if K exceeds the number of variants, it silently includes all, which is correct but unaddressed. These are nitpicks but warrant a deduction under "unclarities or logical flaws."

These are very minor (the query would work correctly in >99% of scenarios), so the score remains very high but not flawless. A 10.0 requires zero ambiguities.
