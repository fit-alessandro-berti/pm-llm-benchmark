The provided answer is precise, logically sound, and fully addresses the prompt without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or unnecessary elements. The query correctly uses a CTE for grouping and counting, employs an appropriate inner join to link back to the full event details, and applies the exact filter (`event_count <= 6`) to exclude cases with more than six events while returning all relevant rows. The explanation is clear, structured, and directly reinforces the query's logic, aligning perfectly with the task's requirements. No deductions are warranted, as the solution is efficient, portable (standard SQL compatible with DuckDB), and handles the implied schema without assumptions.
