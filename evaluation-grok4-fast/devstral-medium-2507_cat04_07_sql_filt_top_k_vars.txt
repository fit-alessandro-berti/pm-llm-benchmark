9.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
This answer is strong overall, correctly implementing the core requirements using DuckDB-compatible SQL features (e.g., LIST_AGG for ordered sequences, CTEs for stepwise aggregation, and joins for filtering). It accurately extracts per-case sequences, groups and counts variants, selects top-K by frequency, and returns only the relevant events from the original log while excluding others. The explanation is clear, structured, and aligns with the steps outlined in the prompt.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor issues prevent a perfect score:
- **Invalid SQL literal (K)**: The query uses `LIMIT K` directly, which is not valid SQL in DuckDB (or any SQL dialect) without parameterization, variable declaration (e.g., via SET or a parameter like ?), or replacement with a numeric value. This would cause a syntax error if run as-is. While the note acknowledges this as a placeholder ("Replace K"), the query itself should ideally demonstrate proper handling (e.g., using a parameter or assuming a value) to be executable and precise. This is a functional inaccuracy, warranting a deduction.
- **Unnecessary caveat**: The note questions LIST_AGG support ("If not, you may need to use an alternative"), despite it being a standard DuckDB function (available since early versions). This introduces unneeded doubt and could mislead users, implying potential incompatibility where none exists.
- **Minor unnecessity**: The final ORDER BY clause is helpful but not required by the prompt (which focuses on filtering, not output ordering). It doesn't harm correctness but adds slight bloat without justification in the explanation.

No major logical flaws: Sequence extraction preserves order correctly, grouping/counting handles variants accurately, and the joins ensure only top-K cases' events are returned (with no duplication or leakage). Ties in frequency are handled implicitly by LIMIT (acceptable, as the prompt doesn't specify tie-breaking). The solution is efficient for typical event log sizes. A 10.0 would require zero placeholders, no extraneous notes, and absolute precision.
