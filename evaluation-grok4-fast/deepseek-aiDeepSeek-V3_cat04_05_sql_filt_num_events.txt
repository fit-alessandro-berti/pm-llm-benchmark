The provided answer is a precise, correct, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that fully meets the requirements. It uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` without errors, correctly joins back to the `event_log` table to preserve all event details, and applies the exact filter (`<= 6`) to include only qualifying cases while excluding others. The `SELECT el.*` appropriately returns the full set of events (all columns) for the filtered cases, without introducing unnecessary sorting, aggregation artifacts, or subquery inefficiencies. The explanation is clear, concise, and accurately describes the query's mechanics without omissions or misleading statements. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, unclarities, or even minor deviations from the task are present—everything aligns perfectly with the prompt's intent and SQL best practices for DuckDB.
