### Evaluation Rationale
The final answer provides a well-structured Python dictionary that fully meets the core requirements: it uses correct tuple keys and value tuples, estimates plausible times in seconds (e.g., cumulative delays reflecting supply chain realities, like 5 days for order placement to receipt), includes a representative subset of pairs with increasing separation (direct, one-step, multi-step, and distant), and demonstrates complexity by covering non-adjacent activities across the process (e.g., ('SS', 'DT') spanning most steps). The estimates are logical and additive where appropriate (e.g., ('SS', 'RC')  7 days aligns with component sums), std devs are realistically proportional (often 20-50% of averages, capturing variability), and categorization via comments adds clarity without excess verbosity. The closing note reinforces the estimation approach and units.

Minor deductions for presentation flaws: scattered encoding artifacts (e.g., "‑" instead of hyphens, "→" arrows) introduce visual inaccuracies and potential copy-paste issues, slightly undermining polish. No major logical errors, but std devs could occasionally be more precisely justified (e.g., why exactly 1.5 days for ('SS', 'RC') variability?), though this is nitpicking given the estimation directive. Overall, near-flawless execution with strong adherence to the scenario's linear process flow.
