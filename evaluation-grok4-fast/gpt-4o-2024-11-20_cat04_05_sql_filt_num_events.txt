The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` with proper grouping and a `HAVING` clause to filter for cases with 6 events, followed by an inner join to retrieve all events from the qualifying cases. This achieves the exact requirements without extraneous operations, inefficiencies, or errors. The explanation is precise, step-by-step, and aligns perfectly with the query's logic, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. DuckDB compatibility is unproblematic, as the syntax is standard SQL. No deductions are warranted, even under hypercritical scrutiny.
