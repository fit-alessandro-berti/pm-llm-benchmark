The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` with proper `GROUP BY`, joins back to the full `event_log` to retrieve all relevant events via `SELECT e.*`, and applies the `WHERE` clause to filter precisely for `event_count <= 6`, excluding cases with more than six events as required. It handles grouping and filtering accurately without subqueries or unnecessary complexity, ensuring the result set includes only events from qualifying cases. The explanation is concise, logical, and directly aligns with the query's structure, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., no explicit `ORDER BY`, which is not mandated) do not detract, as they are irrelevant to correctness.
