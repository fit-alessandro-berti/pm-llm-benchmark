The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, joins it back to the `event_log` table to retain full event rows, and applies the precise filter (`event_count <= 6`) to exclude cases with more than six events while returning all events from qualifying cases. The syntax is valid for DuckDB, handles the grouping and filtering as required without unnecessary assumptions about additional columns, and avoids common pitfalls like subquery correlation errors or incomplete row selection. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the query's components, with no ambiguities, logical flaws, or extraneous details.
