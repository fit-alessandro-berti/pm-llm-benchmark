9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (why not lower)**: The final output is a valid Python dictionary with correct formatting—keys as tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')`), values as tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)`. Times are in seconds, consistent with the prompt's example (e.g., 86400 for 1 day). The subset (5 pairs) is representative and demonstrates complexity: includes direct/successor pairs (e.g., `('OP', 'RC')`, `('RC', 'QI')`) and multi-step pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')` separated by OP; `('CA', 'AS')` separated by PT, PK, WS, DT—clearly spans multiple steps for "ensuring complexity"). Estimates are plausible for a high-tech supply chain: short intervals for internal processes (e.g., 2 hours for QI to CA), longer for logistics (e.g., 3 days for OP to RC), and extended for end-to-end (e.g., 15 days for CA to AS, accounting for post-sale). SDs scale reasonably with averages (e.g., ~25% for short pairs, higher but defensible for variable logistics/post-sale).

- **Weaknesses (why not 10.0)**: Hypercritically, the SD for `('OP', 'RC')` (172800 sec / 259200 sec  67% of average) is disproportionately high compared to others, potentially implying unrealistic extreme variability (e.g., deliveries ranging from negative to 9+ days, which strains plausibility in a modeled process without justification). The subset is minimal (only 5 pairs across 10 activities); while "representative," it omits pairs involving later activities (e.g., PK, WS, DT) or even longer multi-step ones (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')` for full-process complexity), slightly under-emphasizing the "global supply chain" scope. No logical flaws in reasoning or structure, but these minor imbalances prevent perfection.
