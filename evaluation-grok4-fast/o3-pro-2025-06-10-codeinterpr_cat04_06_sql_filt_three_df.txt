The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LAG/LEAD) to identify immediate successors/predecessors within each case, ensuring direct succession of the three activities without intervening events. The time condition is accurately implemented with interval arithmetic (`next_ts - "timestamp" > INTERVAL '5 days'`), which is compatible with DuckDB's SQL dialect. The logic for identifying and excluding entire cases via `NOT IN` a subquery of distinct `case_id`s precisely matches the need to filter out events from matching cases while returning all others. The final `ORDER BY` clause provides the requested proper ordering without introducing unnecessary complexity. The accompanying explanation is concise, accurate, and directly reinforces the query's logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, non-unique timestamps) are handled appropriately by the window partitioning and ordering.
