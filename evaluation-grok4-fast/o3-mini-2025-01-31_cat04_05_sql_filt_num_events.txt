The provided answer is correct, complete, and precise. Both SQL queries accurately implement the required logic: they group by `case_id` to count events, filter for counts 6 using `HAVING`, and then retrieve the full event rows for qualifying cases without altering or omitting any data from those cases. The CTE approach efficiently isolates eligible `case_id`s before joining, while the subquery version uses a clean `IN` clause—both are valid, performant in DuckDB, and semantically equivalent to the task. The explanatory text is clear, concise, and directly ties back to the prompt's requirements without extraneous details or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the solution handles the grouping/filtering exactly as specified.
