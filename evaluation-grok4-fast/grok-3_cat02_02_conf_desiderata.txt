7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and coverage of most required elements, demonstrating a solid understanding of the distinction between normative rules and desiderata. It systematically analyzes each case, provides concise explanations, and offers reasonable interpretations with justifications, including overall recommendations that align well with the task. However, it contains a significant logical flaw and inaccuracy that prevents a higher score: the complete omission of "Inform Applicant" as a mandatory normative step in Case 2. This activity is explicitly required after every Loan Decision (per the strict sequence: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"), yet the log shows it is entirely skipped, constituting a clear normative violation (skipping a required step). The answer relegates this to a desiderata timing issue ("not recorded... assuming missing or delayed beyond 48 hours"), which is incorrect and undermines the analysis's rigor. This error misclassifies a core constraint violation, leading to an incomplete identification in Part 1 and flawed handling in Parts 2 and 3.

Minor issues further detract: 
- In Case 2's sequence listing (Part 1), "Inform Applicant" is implicitly omitted without comment, reinforcing the oversight.
- Desiderata summaries occasionally hedge unnecessarily (e.g., "likely fails" for Case 2's Inform Applicant, introducing uncertainty where the log is definitive).
- Interpretations for Case 2 speculate on "misrecording" without tying back strongly to the missing Inform Applicant as a separate issue.
- No explicit clarification in Part 2 that desiderata failures are "not severe" for every instance, though it's implied overall.

These flaws, especially the major one, indicate incomplete fidelity to the normative constraints, warranting a deduction from an otherwise near-perfect response (which would score 9.5+). The answer remains useful and mostly accurate, justifying a mid-high score under hypercritical standards.
