The answer comprehensively and accurately addresses all three tasks with precise calculations of durations (e.g., 25.17 hours for Case 102, correctly derived from timestamps), clear identification of delayed cases (102, 104, 105 as outliers vs. 101 and 103), and detailed root cause analysis that directly ties escalations (in 102 and 105), waiting times (e.g., 3.5 hours in 104, 28 hours in 105), and prolonged resolution phases (~19 hours consistently in delayed cases) to extended cycle times. Explanations logically link these factors to bottlenecks like handoff inefficiencies, agent availability, and issue complexity. Recommendations are practical, data-informed (e.g., SLAs for handoffs, prioritization queues), and targeted (e.g., training for Level-2, automation for triage), offering clear pathways to mitigate delays without gaps or flaws. The structure enhances clarity, and no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical errors are present.
