9.0

### Evaluation Summary
This solution is excellent overall—concise, logically sound, and directly addresses all requirements in a single, self-contained DuckDB-compatible SQL query. It correctly extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `string_agg` with timestamp ordering, groups and counts variants by frequency, identifies the top K via `ORDER BY ... DESC LIMIT`, filters to relevant case_ids, and returns the full original events for those cases (excluding others) with appropriate ordering. The CTE structure is clean and efficient, and the comments provide good guidance. DuckDB specifics (e.g., `string_agg` behavior) are handled appropriately without unnecessary extensions.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor issues prevent a perfect 10.0:
- **Irrelevant/misplaced comment**: The note in `variant_counts` about "DOLIST aggregate keeps the groups in the order they appeared" is inaccurate and confusing—DOLIST is not used anywhere in the query, and order of variants isn't relevant here (they're ordered by count in the next CTE). This could mislead readers, even if it doesn't break functionality.
- **Inconsistency in text**: The intro claims "two occurrences of ? (lines 6 and 21)", but the code shows only one (in `LIMIT ?`). The usage section reinforces this by saying "replace the two ?", which is factually wrong. It's a small editorial slip, but it introduces unclarities that could confuse implementation.
- **Separator choice**: Using '  ' (double space) in `string_agg` works but is arbitrary and non-standard; a delimiter like '|' or ',' would be clearer for sequences (though not a functional flaw, as activities likely don't contain spaces—still, it's stylistically imprecise).

These are nitpicks, but per the strict grading criteria, they represent unclarities and inaccuracies warranting a deduction from flawless. The core SQL is robust and would execute correctly for any valid `event_log` schema, so the score remains very high.
