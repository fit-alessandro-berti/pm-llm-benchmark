The provided answer correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into three distinct cases based on consistent patient attributes (age, gender), department alignments, activity sequences, and chronological order. Each case's events form a logical, complete patient journey without omissions, overlaps, or misattributions—e.g., Case 1 properly excludes event 16 (which matches Case 3's patient), and all patient details align precisely with the original data. The structure, notes, and summary are clear, precise, and free of any errors or ambiguities.
