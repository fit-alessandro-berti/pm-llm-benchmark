9.5

### Explanation of Grade
This answer is exceptionally strong in structure, thoroughness, and fidelity to the normative description. It correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with precise reasoning tied to the rules (e.g., ordering constraints, mandatory steps like packaging, and prohibitions like shipping after cancellation). The analysis of each case is accurate, resolving ambiguities logically (e.g., treating post-authorization cancellation as illogical based on the description's implications of branching directly after inventory check). References to the textual description are direct and supportive, and the summary table enhances clarity without introducing errors.

Minor deductions (0.5 point) for slight interpretive speculation in Case 3 (mentioning "possibly acceptable only with refund"), which, while not inaccurate, adds unneeded ambiguity in an otherwise evidence-based response—the description doesn't mention refunds, so it could have been omitted for stricter adherence. No other inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities; conclusions are flawless.
