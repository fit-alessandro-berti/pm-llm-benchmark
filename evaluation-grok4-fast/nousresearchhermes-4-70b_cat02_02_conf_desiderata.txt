9.8

### Evaluation Rationale
This grading is based on a hypercritical assessment of the final answer's conclusions and structure, focusing solely on accuracy, clarity, logical consistency, and completeness relative to the task. Minor deductions are applied for slight over-structuring (e.g., unrequired "Key Takeaways" and "Recommendations" sections add value but mildly dilute focus on the exact task elements) and one tiny imprecision in phrasing (e.g., "48 hours after application receipt" for Case 3's Credit Check delay should specify "approximately 49 hours" for exactness, though the intent is clear and correct). The answer is otherwise exemplary: it precisely identifies all violations with explanations tied directly to rules/desiderata, distinguishes severity levels explicitly, provides balanced interpretations without speculation beyond evidence, and maintains logical flow without flaws or omissions. No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or contradictions exist.
