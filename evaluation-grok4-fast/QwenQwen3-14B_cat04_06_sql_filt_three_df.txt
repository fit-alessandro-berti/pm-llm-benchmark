The provided answer is nearly flawless in its implementation and explanation. The SQL query correctly uses window functions (LAG and LEAD) to detect the exact consecutive sequence by examining the 'Create Order' event's immediate predecessor and successor within each case_id, ordered by timestamp. The time condition accurately computes the interval between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps using DuckDB's supported interval syntax. The exclusion logic via NOT IN with DISTINCT case_id handling is precise, ensuring all events from qualifying cases are removed while retaining others. Edge cases (e.g., incomplete sequences, multiple sequences per case, exact 5-day boundaries) are appropriately addressed without over- or under-filtering. No syntactic, logical, or semantic issues are present, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements.
