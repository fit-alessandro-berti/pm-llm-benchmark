The provided answer is accurate, comprehensive, and logically sound in its final conclusions. It correctly identifies all normative violations in Case 2 (including the skipped "Inform Applicant" step, which is indeed required and absent from the log), distinguishes them clearly from desiderata issues, and limits desiderata violations to Case 3 with precise time calculations. The interpretations are plausible without excusing violations, and the structure (including the summary table) enhances clarity without introducing errors, ambiguities, or flaws.
