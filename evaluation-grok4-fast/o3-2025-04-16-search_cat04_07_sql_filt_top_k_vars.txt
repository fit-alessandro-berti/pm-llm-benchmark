### Evaluation Rationale
This solution is excellent overall—clear, efficient, and directly addresses all four requirements of the prompt using a logical chain of CTEs in standard SQL (compatible with DuckDB). It correctly extracts ordered sequences per case via `string_agg` with an internal `ORDER BY`, groups and ranks variants by frequency, filters to top-K cases, and returns the filtered events with a sensible join. The parameter for K is handled appropriately, and the explanatory comments enhance clarity without fluff. The use of `DENSE_RANK()` for ranking is a strong choice in process mining contexts, as it preserves ties at the Kth position, ensuring fairness in variant selection (e.g., if multiple variants tie for Kth frequency, all are included, avoiding arbitrary exclusion).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, two minor issues prevent a perfect 10.0:
- **Tie handling ambiguity**: The prompt specifies "the top K variants" without addressing ties. `DENSE_RANK() <= ${K}` may select *more* than exactly K variants if ties exist at rank K (e.g., for K=3 with frequencies [10, 8, 6, 6, 5], it selects 4 variants). While this is reasonable and common, a stricter interpretation might require exactly K (e.g., via `ROW_NUMBER()` with an arbitrary tiebreaker like variant string). This introduces a subtle logical mismatch with the "top K" phrasing, warranting a small deduction.
- **Delimiter choice**: Using '  ' (double space) as the separator in `string_agg` works for distinguishing sequences but is unconventional (process mining often uses '' or ', ' for readability/compatibility). If activity names contain spaces, it risks ambiguity in reverse-engineering sequences, though this is edge-case and not a breaking flaw.

These are nitpicks on an otherwise flawless, set-based query—no inaccuracies in core logic, no unnecessary complexity, and full compliance with filtering/exclusion requirements. The optional final `ORDER BY` is a bonus for usability but doesn't detract. With no major errors, unclarities, or inefficiencies, this earns a very high mark.
