The provided answer is a nearly flawless solution to the query task. The CTE correctly groups by `case_id`, counts events per case, and applies the `HAVING` filter to include only those with <=6 events. The subsequent inner join ensures that only events from qualifying cases are returned, preserving the full row data (`el.*`) without unnecessary projections or alterations. The approach is efficient, readable, and semantically precise, with no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. The explanation accurately breaks down the components without extraneous details, directly aligning with the problem's requirements. No optimizations or alternatives are needed, as this satisfies the criteria exactly.
