### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a deep understanding of the query with precise identification of the bias (Group B due to the affiliation boost), a clear and evidence-based explanation of its manifestation (including detailed case comparisons and propagation of adjustments), and a thoughtful discussion of implications (covering meritocracy, disparate impact, legal/ethical risks, and mitigation strategies). It is logically sound, uses the provided data accurately without fabrication, and is structured for clarity with headings and bullet points.

Hypercritical deductions are minimal and only for slight imperfections:
- **Minor Assumption on Threshold (0.1 deduction)**: The answer infers a "~65 threshold" for hiring based on observed patterns (e.g., 65 for hires in Group A, 60 for rejections). This is a reasonable, data-driven inference but not explicitly stated in the logs, introducing a tiny element of interpretation that could be phrased as "apparent threshold" to avoid any hint of overstatement. No logical flaw, but strict scrutiny notes it as not 100% deductive.
- **Slight Uneven Comparison Depth (0.1 deduction)**: The U003 vs. P002 comparison highlights score differences effectively but could note more explicitly that overall profiles aren't identical (e.g., P002's higher PersonalityScore of 75 vs. U003's 65), though this is already implied and doesn't undermine the point on boost-induced inversion.

No inaccuracies (all data citations match the logs, e.g., exact scores and adjustments), unclarities (prose is concise and professional), or broader logical flaws. The discussion ties back to protected/unprotected group distinctions without overreaching, and implications are balanced and forward-looking. This is as close to flawless as possible for a human-generated response.
