7.2

### Grading Rationale
The answer effectively identifies recurring activities ("Verify Documents" in C001 and C003; "Call Customer" in C002) and provides contextually appropriate renamings for them, with the revised log preserving the original structure and enhancing readability. The justifications for these core changes are precise, directly tying names to additional context (e.g., "post-submission" from the log's description of additional documents). The key observations reinforce the goal of disambiguation.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, deductions are warranted for several flaws:
- **Over-renaming and scope creep**: The task focuses on recurrences *within the same case* to disambiguate contextual differences. The answer renames non-recurring instances (e.g., "Verify Documents - Initial" in C002, where it appears once; "Call Customer - Request Missing" in C001, a single occurrence). This extends beyond the prompt without justification, introducing unnecessary changes that could confuse rather than clarify.
- **Incomplete justification**: Naming choices for all log changes are not fully explained. For instance, the renaming of "Verify Documents" in C002 and "Call Customer" in C001 lack any rationale, despite being implemented. The justification only covers recurrences and the C003 "Call Customer" example, leaving these unaddressed—this is a logical gap, as the task requires justifying *the* naming choices.
- **Minor inconsistencies**: Applying "- Initial" uniformly to first "Verify Documents" instances (including C002) implies a broader scheme not fully supported by the analysis or prompt. Names like "Request Missing" (in C001) are abbreviated unclearly (full context is "request missing docs"), potentially reducing precision.
- **No logical flaws in core analysis**, but the extras dilute focus and introduce unclarities without adding value, violating strict adherence to instructions.

These issues, though not catastrophic, result in a mid-high score: strong execution on the primary task but penalized for extras and omissions. A flawless response would rename *only* recurrences, justify every change, and stick tightly to intra-case disambiguation.
