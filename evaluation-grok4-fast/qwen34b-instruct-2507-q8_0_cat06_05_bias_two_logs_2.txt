9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall: it directly and accurately identifies Group B as the biased log, provides a clear, structured explanation of how the bias manifests (with specific examples, tables, and comparisons), and thoroughly discusses implications for fairness and equity, including broader legal/ethical concerns and practical recommendations. The structure is logical, professional, and comprehensive, exceeding the question's requirements without unnecessary fluff. It correctly contrasts the neutral process in Group A with the affiliation-based adjustments in Group B, emphasizing structural bias tied to social networks.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there is one minor but clear inaccuracy that prevents a perfect score: in the example comparing U001 and U002, the answer states "skill score of 78 (same as U001’s 80)" and "personality score of 70 (same as U001’s 72)," incorrectly labeling the scores as "same" when they are actually close but distinct (78 vs. 80; 70 vs. 72). This is a factual slip-up that introduces a small logical flaw in the comparison, potentially misleading a precise reader about the exact equivalence of metrics. While the broader point (comparable scores leading to disparate outcomes due to the boost) holds, this error warrants a deduction, as even minor inaccuracies must significantly impact the score. No other unclarities, omissions, or flaws were noted—the analysis is otherwise nearly flawless in depth, clarity, and relevance.
