The provided solution is highly accurate and directly fulfills the prompt's requirements with a clear, efficient DuckDB-compatible SQL query using CTEs for readability. It correctly extracts ordered sequences via STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp, groups and counts variants by frequency, selects the top K via ORDER BY DESC and LIMIT K (appropriately treating K as a placeholder/parameter, as is standard in such templated queries), and filters events via INNER JOINs to include only those from top K variant cases while excluding others. The SELECT el.* returns the full original events as specified.

Minor deductions for non-determinism in LIMIT K sorting (ties in case_count could arbitrarily exclude/include variants without a stable tie-breaker like an additional ORDER BY on variant), and for LIMIT K requiring user substitution or parameterization to execute (not a self-contained literal), which introduces tiny ambiguity/implementation friction. These are edge nitpicks, but under hypercritical evaluation, they prevent perfection. The explanation reinforces correctness without flaws.
