The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact consecutive sequence within each case, filters for the timing condition (>5 days, using valid DuckDB interval syntax), identifies "bad" cases via DISTINCT to handle multiples, and excludes all events from those cases in the final result. The approach ensures direct succession with no intervening events, handles potential multiple sequences per case (excluding if any one meets both criteria), returns all columns from non-bad cases, and includes appropriate ordering. The explanation is precise, logical, and directly ties to the code without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected under hypercritical scrutiny.
