The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and complete DuckDB SQL query as the primary solution using a standard subquery with IN, which precisely identifies and filters case_ids based on event counts 6 via GROUP BY and HAVING, then returns all original event rows (via SELECT *) for those cases without introducing extraneous columns or data. The logic is sound, handles potential additional columns appropriately, and aligns exactly with the requirements for grouping, filtering, and full event retrieval. The alternative window function query is also accurate, leverages DuckDB's strengths (including EXCLUDE for clean output), and the explanation is concise yet informative without errors or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected.
