10.0

The provided answer is nearly flawless in its completeness, accuracy, clarity, and logical rigor. It systematically evaluates every case, correctly identifies deviations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 while confirming compliance in 1 and 4, and provides precise explanations grounded in the normative description's constraints and sequences. Interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., no authorization in the insufficient path, mandatory packaging before shipping) are conservative and well-justified without overreaching. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even minor phrasing is tight and directly referential. The structure enhances readability, and the summary ties everything together effectively.
