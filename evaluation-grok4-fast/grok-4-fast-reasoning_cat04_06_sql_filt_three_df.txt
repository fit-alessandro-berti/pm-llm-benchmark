The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using ROW_NUMBER() for direct succession, applies the >5-day filter precisely via interval comparison (which DuckDB supports), selects distinct bad cases to avoid duplicates, and excludes only those cases from the full event log while returning all other events. The added ORDER BY ensures proper presentation without being extraneous. No logical flaws, syntax issues, or deviations from the criteria exist; even under hypercritical scrutiny, it fully satisfies the task without omissions, ambiguities, or minor inefficiencies that would warrant deduction.
