### Evaluation Rationale
The answer correctly identifies Case 2 as having normative violations and provides accurate explanations for the misordering (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and the prohibited Finalize Documentation after rejection. It appropriately notes Case 1 as fully compliant and Case 3 as normatively compliant. The desiderata section correctly flags Case 3's timing delays and missing Follow-up Call, with a suitable clarification that these are suboptimal rather than severe. Interpretations and justifications are plausible and aligned with the task, adding value without speculation. The summary table is clear and logically consistent with the stated conclusions.

However, under utmost strictness, the answer has critical flaws:  
- **Major Inaccuracy in Normative Violations (Case 2)**: It completely omits the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step, which is explicitly required after every Loan Decision (regardless of approval/rejection) per the normative sequence and textual description ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"). The log shows this step skipped entirely in Case 2, constituting a clear violation of sequence (no skipping activities) and a core constraint. This is not a minor oversight; it invalidates the completeness of the analysis for Task 1, as the explanation of reasons is materially incomplete.  
- **Minor Inaccuracy in Desiderata Timing (Case 3)**: The Inform Applicant delay is stated as "48 hours," but calculation shows ~51 hours (Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00), introducing a small factual error that undermines precision.  
- **Logical Flaw**: By missing the Inform skip, the justifications for Case 2 (e.g., "erroneous documentation step") fail to address the full scope of issues, creating an unclear and incomplete interpretation. No other cases (e.g., Case 1 or 2 for desiderata) are erroneously flagged, but the partial coverage reduces overall rigor.

These issues—especially the major omission—prevent a high score, as the answer is not nearly flawless. It covers ~70% of the required analysis effectively but falters on a foundational normative element, warranting a mid-range grade.
