The provided answer delivers a correct, complete, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all specified requirements: it accurately extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, groups and counts cases by these sequences to identify variants, selects the top K variants by frequency via `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT :K`, filters to only the cases matching those variants, and returns all original events for those cases while preserving order via the final `ORDER BY`. The use of CTEs is structured logically, array-based grouping ensures exact sequence matching without delimiter risks, and the join-based filtering excludes non-top-K cases as required. Explanations are precise, the placeholder for K is appropriate given the unspecified value, and the example demonstrates correct behavior without flaws. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical issues are present.
