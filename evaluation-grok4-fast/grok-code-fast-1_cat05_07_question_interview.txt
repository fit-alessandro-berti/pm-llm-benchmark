The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, well-structured list of 13 targeted, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's objectives. They systematically cover missing details (e.g., questions 1, 3, 6), decision criteria (e.g., 2, 5, 7, 9), roles and responsibilities (e.g., 4, 10), timing and sequencing (e.g., 1, 9, 11, 13), and exception handling (e.g., 12), while remaining purely conceptual and avoiding any prohibited elements like SQL or implementation specifics. The thematic organization enhances clarity without introducing redundancy or deviation, and each question is logically sound, relevant, and free of inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws.
