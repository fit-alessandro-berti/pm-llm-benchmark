The provided code and accompanying explanation accurately and completely construct the POWL model as required, faithfully capturing all elements of the scenario: sequential dependencies (e.g., SR  CS, CS  DA/ACI, DA/ACI  loop, loop  XOR, XOR  final PO), concurrency (no edge between DA and ACI; no edge between QA and SA), the LOOP operator for the repeatable configuration phase (BNC as the main body, D&R as the loop-back), and the XOR operator for the exclusive deployment choice. Nesting of POWL models (e.g., final_tasks as a sub-PO within the main PO) is correctly handled per the POWL definitions, with no extraneous silent transitions or operators. Labels match the scenario precisely, and no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present in the final construction or summary.
