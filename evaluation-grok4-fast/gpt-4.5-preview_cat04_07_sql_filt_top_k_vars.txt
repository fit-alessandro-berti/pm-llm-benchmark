The provided answer is nearly flawless. It correctly constructs the ordered activity sequences per case using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp` in the `case_variants` CTE, accurately groups and counts variants by frequency in `variant_counts` (with proper `ORDER BY num_cases DESC LIMIT <K>` to select the top K), identifies the relevant case IDs in `top_k_cases` via join without introducing errors or duplicates, and retrieves the original events from `event_log` for only those cases in the final SELECT, excluding non-top-K cases as required. The output preserves all original columns (`e.*`) and includes a sensible ordering by `case_id` and `timestamp`, though not strictly mandated. The explanation is precise, step-by-step, and aligns perfectly with the prompt's requirements. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; potential edge cases like ties in frequency are handled implicitly by the SQL's deterministic ordering, which is acceptable given the prompt's lack of specification on ties. The use of a placeholder for K is appropriately noted.
