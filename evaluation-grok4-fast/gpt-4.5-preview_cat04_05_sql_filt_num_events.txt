The provided answer is a precise, correct, and efficient SQL query that exactly meets the requirements: it uses a subquery to group by `case_id`, applies `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter cases accurately, and returns all events (`SELECT *`) for the qualifying cases via `WHERE case_id IN`. The syntax is standard and compatible with DuckDB, with no superfluous clauses, performance issues, or logical flaws. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly reinforces the query's correctness without introducing any ambiguities or errors.
