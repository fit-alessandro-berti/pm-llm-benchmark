This system prompt is exceptionally well-constructed and directly fulfills the target objectives with precision, clarity, and robustness. It accurately mirrors the provided schema without any discrepancies (e.g., column types, FK relationships, and table structures are faithfully reproduced). The anomaly detection task comprehensively covers key deviation categories (missing steps, sequencing errors, resource mismatches, timing issues, duplicates, and data inconsistencies in additional_info), ensuring the LLM systematically identifies undesirable behaviors from the event log. The hypotheses section mandates plausible root causes with examples (e.g., system bugs, fraud), promoting analytical depth without prescribing specific anomalies or causes, thus avoiding hints. The SQL generation instructions are exemplary: they enforce self-contained, valid PostgreSQL SELECT queries using only the specified tables, incorporate best practices (aliases, comments, CTEs for complexity), and emphasize generality for larger datasets, enabling independent investigation. The rigid output format (Markdown hierarchy with bullets, table, and annotated code blocks) guarantees structured, actionable responses. Guidelines prevent verbose chain-of-thought, encourage realistic placeholders (e.g., via the 1002 example), and allow for extrapolated anomalies, enhancing versatility. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even minor potential issues (e.g., assuming data availability in the user context) are implicitly handled by the prompt's design, rendering it nearly flawless.
