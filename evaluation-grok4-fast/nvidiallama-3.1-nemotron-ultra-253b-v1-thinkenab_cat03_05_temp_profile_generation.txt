The provided answer delivers a precise, well-structured Python dictionary that fully adheres to the requirements. It includes a representative subset of 15 pairs, balancing direct consecutive activities (e.g., ('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC')) with indirect, multi-step pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'RC'), ('SS', 'AS'), ('QI', 'DT')), ensuring the necessary complexity. All estimates are plausible for a global supply chain context, with average times and standard deviations logically scaled by process stage (e.g., longer procurements vs. quicker inspections) and distance between activities (e.g., full process at 37 days with higher variability). Values are correctly expressed in seconds, matching the example format, and the progressive summation for indirect pairs maintains internal consistency without contradictions. The optional comments enhance clarity without detracting from the core output. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or ambiguities are present; the response is comprehensive and flawless.
