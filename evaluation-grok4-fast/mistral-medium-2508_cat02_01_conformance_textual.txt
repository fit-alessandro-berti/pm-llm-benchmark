### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is nearly flawless in its adherence to the task requirements, demonstrating precise interpretation of the normative description, accurate identification of violations across all cases, and clear, structured explanations without introducing inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. It resolves interpretive elements (e.g., implying inventory sufficiency from payment authorization in Case 3) logically and directly references the description's constraints. The analysis is comprehensive yet concise, with no omissions (all cases covered), no overreach (violations tied explicitly to textual rules), and effective use of tables/summaries for clarity. Minor formatting quirks (e.g., run-on sequences in bold) do not detract from substance, as they do not cause unclarities. Under hypercritical scrutiny, it earns full marks for rigor and fidelity.
