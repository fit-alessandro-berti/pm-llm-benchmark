The provided SQL query is correct, precise, and directly fulfills the requirements. It uses a subquery to identify qualifying `case_id` values via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then filters the main table accordingly with `WHERE case_id IN (...)`. This approach is semantically accurate, efficient for the task, and compatible with DuckDB. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or deviations from the prompt.
