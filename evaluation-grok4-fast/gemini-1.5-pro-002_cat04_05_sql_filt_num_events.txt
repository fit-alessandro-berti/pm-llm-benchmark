The provided answer is nearly flawless in its assessment and improvement of the original benchmark prompt. It accurately identifies a valid enhancement (adding an example table and expected output for clarity and validation) without introducing any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. The revised prompt integrates the example seamlessly, ensures the sample data correctly demonstrates the filtering logic (case 1: 3 events 6; case 2: 7 events >6; case 3: 3 events 6; case 4: 2 events 6), and the expected output description is precise and helpful. No errors in data, formatting, or reasoning; the addition of "The order of the rows in the output does not matter" further improves robustness. This directly elevates the prompt's quality for benchmarking SQL generation tasks.
