9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong: it directly identifies Group B as the biased log, provides a clear, structured comparison, accurately describes the manifestation through specific examples from the logs (e.g., exact score boosts for U001 and U003), and thoughtfully discusses implications for fairness (procedural justice) and equity (network entrenchment, skewed metrics). The analysis correctly interprets the group labels (Protected vs. Unprotected) in the context of potential disparate treatment, with balanced nuance on outcomes and risks. Logical flow is impeccable, and it avoids overgeneralization by noting the "potential" disparate impact.

Hypercritical deductions: 
- Minor unclarity in phrasing "base Cultural Fit score (implied from the initial assessment data)"—the base scores (60 and 58) are explicitly stated in the CulturalFitCheck rows, not merely implied, which slightly weakens precision.
- The hypothetical threshold example (e.g., "if the hiring threshold... was 62") is illustrative but speculative, introducing a tiny logical risk of assuming unstated criteria without caveating it as such; it doesn't flaw the core argument but isn't needed for rigor.
- The legal/ethical section is insightful but marginally overreaches by assuming "Group A is a legally protected class (e.g., based on race, gender, disability)"—the logs tie protection to "LocalResident" status (FALSE/TRUE), which could proxy for protected attributes but isn't explicitly equated, risking a subtle interpretive stretch.

These are very minor (collectively ~0.5 deduction from perfection), but per strict instructions, they prevent a full 10.0. The answer is otherwise flawless in accuracy, completeness, and critical depth.
