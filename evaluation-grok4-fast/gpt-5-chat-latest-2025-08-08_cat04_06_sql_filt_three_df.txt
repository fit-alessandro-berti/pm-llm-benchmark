8.0

### Evaluation Summary
This answer demonstrates strong logical understanding of the problem, correctly interpreting the requirements to identify consecutive sequences via row numbering and self-joins, apply the >5-day filter using a date difference function, and exclude *entire cases* (not just the sequence block) from the final result set. The plan is clear and step-by-step, the query structure is efficient and leverages DuckDB-appropriate features like window functions, and the explanation ties back to the requirements effectively. The final output returns all relevant events with sensible ordering (though not strictly required). These elements make it a solid, functional solution in intent.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are notable flaws that prevent a perfect score:
- **Critical syntax inaccuracy**: The `DATE_DIFF` function is invalid in DuckDB. The correct function is `datediff('day', start_timestamp, end_timestamp)`, which computes the integer day difference. The uppercase `DATE_DIFF` with underscore would cause a runtime error (function not found). This renders the query non-executable as written, a major logical/implementation flaw despite the correct conceptual use of date differencing. Even though the explanation describes the intent accurately ("measures full days"), the code must be precise for a benchmark prompt.
- **Unnecessary extraneous content**: The closing question about "removing only the specific matching block" introduces confusion, as the prompt explicitly requires excluding *whole cases* and their *all events*. This suggests a momentary doubt about the requirements, diluting the focus and clarity of the response. It also implies the answerer might not be 100% confident in the interpretation, though the query itself aligns correctly.
- **Minor unclarities/assumptions**: The query assumes timestamps are sortable without ties (ROW_NUMBER() behavior on ties is non-deterministic without additional ORDER BY clauses like ASC NULLS LAST, but the prompt doesn't specify duplicates, so this is low-impact). The `DATE_DIFF` (even if corrected) uses string 'day', which is fine, but doesn't handle potential timezone or sub-day precision explicitly (e.g., if timestamps include time-of-day, datediff('day') floors to whole days, which matches "more than 5 days" intent but could be ambiguous without clarification). No explicit handling for incomplete cases or multiple sequences per case (though the requirements imply *any* matching sequence triggers exclusion, and DISTINCT handles multiples correctly).

Overall, the logic is nearly flawless (90%+ alignment), but the syntax error alone warrants a deduction of ~1-2 points for unreliability in a SQL benchmark context. Minor polish issues chip away further. A 10.0 would require executable, verbatim-correct code with zero extraneous noise.
