The primary query using the aggregate subquery and join is logically flawless: it correctly identifies qualifying `case_id`s via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, joins back to retrieve the full original rows (via `SELECT e.*`), and applies an optional but appropriate `ORDER BY` without altering the required output schema. This fully matches the task's requirements for filtering cases and returning the "full set of events" (original columns only).

The window-function alternative is functionally correct in filtering but introduces a minor logical flaw: `SELECT *` from the subquery includes the extraneous `n_events` column in the output, which exceeds the "full set of events" (implying original table columns) and subtly mismatches the task's intent for unaltered event rows. The claim of it being "equivalent" is thus inaccurate, as the schemas differ. The unqualified `ORDER BY` works but is less explicit than the first query's. This imperfection warrants a deduction despite the overall high quality and provision of two valid approaches (exceeding the "a query" request without harm). No syntax errors, inefficiencies, or DuckDB incompatibilities noted.
