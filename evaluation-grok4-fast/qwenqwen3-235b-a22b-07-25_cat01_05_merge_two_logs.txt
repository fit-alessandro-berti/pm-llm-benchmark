7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This grade reflects a strong overall response that meets most core requirements: it produces a clear, chronological merged log with enriched attributes, handles unmatched events appropriately (e.g., Quality Check and Item Delivered), indicates sources, and provides detailed event-by-event reasoning. The output is well-structured (table format aids clarity), chronological (using Log A's timestamps as primary), and comprehensive in integrating attributes from Log B where merged. The conclusion and summary tables add value by documenting decisions and offering recommendations, aligning with the need to "document your reasoning."

However, under utmost strictness, several logical flaws and inaccuracies prevent a higher score:
- **Timestamp Tolerance Violations (Major Flaw)**: The prompt specifies a "small timestamp tolerance... e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds." The response explicitly adopts a ±2-second window but inconsistently applies it. Specifically:
  - Order Received (2 seconds) and Item Shipped (2 seconds) are borderline (=2 seconds, not strictly <2), but this could be overlooked as minor if consistently justified.
  - Payment Processed (5 seconds) is clearly outside any reasonable interpretation of "<2 seconds" and lacks confidence for matching per the prompt ("if you cannot confidently match... leave separate"). The "contextual justification" (e.g., notes on delay) is a subjective overreach; while semantically plausible, it violates the explicit timing-based rule without evidence that the events are identical beyond assumption. This introduces uncertainty and could lead to incorrect merging in a real audit scenario.
- **Minor Unclarities and Inconsistencies**:
  - Unified event types are mostly from Log A (appropriate as primary), but the reasoning inconsistently describes naming mappings (e.g., "PaymentCheck" to "Payment Processed" is justified semantically but tied to the flawed 5-second match).
  - Timestamps: Only Log A's is used in the final table (fine per "select one as primary"), but the prompt allows "include both" for slight differences; omitting Log B's entirely for merged events reduces transparency without explanation.
  - No explicit handling of potential non-overlapping events beyond the listed ones, though the logs are small and all are addressed.
- **No Major Structural Issues**: The response is complete, with no missing events, correct order_id consistency, and proper enrichment. Earlier verbose elements (if any) are ignored per instructions, focusing on final conclusions.

A near-flawless score (9.0+) would require strict adherence to the <2-second tolerance without subjective overrides, explicit notation of both timestamps for merged events, and zero ambiguities. Deductions are significant (dropping ~2.5 points total) for the matching rule breaches, as they undermine the task's emphasis on confident, rule-based alignment.
