This query is nearly flawless in addressing the requirements. It correctly uses ROW_NUMBER() to establish event ordering within cases, identifies the exact consecutive sequence via self-joins on ranks (ensuring no intervening events), applies the >5-day filter precisely on the relevant timestamps for those sequences, and excludes entire cases with at least one violating sequence (a reasonable and defensible interpretation of the prompt's criteria, as it targets cases containing such a pattern). The use of CTEs is clear and modular, the GROUP BY in CasesToExclude effectively deduplicates case_ids without aggregates, DuckDB syntax (e.g., INTERVAL) is appropriate, and the final output returns all specified events from non-violating cases with sensible ordering. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities; even hypercritical scrutiny finds no issues warranting deduction—minor stylistic choices (e.g., GROUP BY vs. DISTINCT) are equivalent and inconsequential.
