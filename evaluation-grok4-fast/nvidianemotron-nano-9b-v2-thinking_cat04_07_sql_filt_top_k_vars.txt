The provided answer is a strong, well-structured response that correctly addresses the core requirements of the prompt. The SQL query uses appropriate DuckDB syntax (e.g., STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp for per-case sequencing), properly groups and counts variants by frequency, identifies the top K via LIMIT, and filters the original event log to return only events from matching cases via joins. The approach description and explanation are clear and align with the task steps. The use of CTEs ensures modularity and readability.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, minor logical and structural issues prevent a perfect score:
- The `top_k_variants` CTE applies `LIMIT K` without explicitly repeating `ORDER BY case_count DESC`. While DuckDB typically respects the ordering from the upstream `sequence_counts` CTE (making it work in practice), this reliance on CTE ordering semantics introduces a subtle non-portability risk and potential optimizer dependency. A flawless query would include the ORDER BY directly in `top_k_variants` (e.g., `SELECT activity_sequence FROM sequence_counts ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K`) to unambiguously ensure the top K are selected post-counting.
- The final join recomputes the full `sequence_per_case` aggregation unnecessarily for filtering (as sequences are already computed), leading to minor inefficiency. An optimal variant would first derive a set of top-K case_ids (via an additional CTE joining `sequence_per_case` to `top_k_variants`), then directly join the event log to that case_id set—avoiding redundant sequence computation while maintaining equivalence.
- The separator `'->'` in STRING_AGG is a reasonable convention but arbitrary (the prompt doesn't specify representation); if activity names contain `'->'`, it could distort sequences (though unlikely, this is an unaddressed edge case).

These are small inaccuracies (correctness is preserved), but per the strict grading criteria, they warrant a deduction from 10.0, as the solution is excellent but not entirely flawless.
