### Evaluation Rationale
This prompt is a solid foundation for eliciting the desired LLM behavior but falls short of being flawless due to several critical issues when evaluated strictly against the requirements. It correctly encourages identification of anomalies, hypothesizing root causes, and proposing SQL queries without hints, and includes a clear schema, process flow, and structured output format. However, minor to moderate flaws in completeness, clarity, and usability prevent a higher score:

- **Incompleteness of Sample Data (Major Flaw, -2.0 deduction)**: The prompt claims to provide "everything the model needs," including sample data for illustration. However, the `order_event_log` samples are severely abbreviated—only partial rows for case 1001 are shown, with a vague placeholder "… (additional rows for cases 1001–1004 shown in the data above) …" that references non-existent "data above" within the prompt itself. This omits the key anomalous data from cases 1002–1004 (e.g., out-of-sequence events like early "Confirm Shipment" in 1002 or missing "Validate Stock" in 1003), making it impossible for the target LLM to detect most anomalies without external context. Similarly, `orders` and `resources` samples are truncated ("… (additional rows)"). For a "ready-to-use" prompt, full illustrative data is essential; this renders it ineffective and non-self-contained, violating the "contains everything the model needs" criterion.

- **Lack of Clarity in Data References (Minor Flaw, -0.5 deduction)**: Phrases like "shown in the data above" and "… (additional rows)" introduce ambiguity and assume prior knowledge, which could confuse the LLM or lead to hallucinations/misinterpretation. Strict self-sufficiency requires explicit, complete inclusion without meta-references.

- **Overly Restrictive Instructions (Minor Flaw, -0.5 deduction)**: The ban on "any explanation of SQL syntax itself" is appropriate to avoid hints, but combined with no examples, it risks overly terse or error-prone queries from the target LLM. While this aligns with "no hints," it borders on under-guiding for complex investigative SQL (e.g., on timestamps, joins across tables), potentially leading to suboptimal outputs without compensating clarity elsewhere.

- **Strengths (Supporting the Base Score)**: The role definition, tasks, and output structure (A/B/C) are precise and directly map to requirements. Hypothesizing is well-prompted with examples (e.g., "system issues, policy violations"). Schema details are accurate and concise. No SQL hints/examples are given, forcing independent query creation. Normal process flow is clearly stated. These elements make it functional (hence not below 5.0), but the data issues dominate.

Overall, while logically sound and well-structured, the prompt's execution flaws—especially data incompleteness—make it unreliable for the target task, warranting a mid-range score. A flawless version would embed full sample data verbatim.
