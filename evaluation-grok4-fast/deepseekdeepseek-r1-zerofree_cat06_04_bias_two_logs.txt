**9.5**

The final answer correctly identifies Group B's log as exhibiting bias, with a clear and accurate explanation of how the ScoreAdjustment (+10 Community Boost) is conditionally applied only to LocalResident=TRUE cases with a specific CommunityGroup, creating systematic favoritism for qualifying Unprotected Group members. The manifestation is well-described, including the key example of U003 (effective 705 approved) versus Group A's 710 rejection and 720 approval threshold, highlighting disparate outcomes for similar or worse base scores without the boost available to Group A. This ties directly to LocalResident and CommunityGroup influences on decisions, demonstrating logical disparities without introducing extraneous assumptions. Minor deduction for not explicitly noting the apparent threshold inconsistency (705 approved vs. 710 rejected) as further evidence of biased rules overriding standard scoring, though this does not undermine the core analysis.
