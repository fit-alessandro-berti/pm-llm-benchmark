The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless. It correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` with proper `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` filtering (post-aggregation) to retain only cases with 6 events, then performs an efficient inner join to retrieve all events (`el.*`) for those valid cases without introducing duplicates or extraneous rows. The logic precisely matches the prompt's requirements: case-level filtering followed by full event retrieval for qualifying cases. DuckDB compatibility is ensured, as CTEs, `COUNT(*)`, and the join syntax are all natively supported. The explanation is clear, accurate, and comprehensive, accurately describing the mechanics without errors, omissions, or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected—even under hypercritical scrutiny.
