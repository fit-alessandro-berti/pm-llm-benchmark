7.0

### Explanation of Grading
I evaluated the answer with utmost strictness, focusing on accuracy, clarity, logical soundness, and fidelity to the prompt's requirements. The core logic for extracting ordered sequences, grouping/counting variants, selecting top K, and filtering/returning events is correct and well-structured using CTEs. The use of `string_agg` with internal `ORDER BY`, `DENSE_RANK` (excellent for handling ties), and the final joins to filter events precisely match the task. The output ordering and exclusion of non-top-K cases are handled properly. Explanations, step-by-step breakdown, and suggestions (e.g., array alternative) add value without detracting.

However, significant deductions for flaws:
- **Fatal execution error in parameterization (major logical flaw, -2.0)**: The `PREPARE top_k AS SELECT 5 AS K;` followed by `(SELECT K FROM top_k)` is invalid in DuckDB. Prepared statements cannot be queried as tables like this; `top_k` isn't accessible via SELECT, causing a runtime error. This breaks the "single statement" claim and renders the query non-executable as written. A correct fix (e.g., `WITH params AS (SELECT 5 AS K), ... WHERE rnk <= (SELECT K FROM params)`) is simple, but the error indicates incomplete testing or oversight—unacceptable for a benchmark-level answer.
- **Including extra column in SELECT (-0.5)**: The final SELECT adds `cv.variant` (optional, but alters the "all events from the original event log" schema). While harmless and useful, it deviates from "return all events" without strict necessity, introducing minor unclarity.
- **Presentation issues (-0.5)**: The "single statement" label is misleading due to the separate PREPARE (which requires execution outside the query). Comments and table are clear, but the PREPARE integration feels bolted-on and error-prone.

The answer is strong overall (80% flawless), but these issues—especially the non-runnable query—prevent a high score. A near-perfect version would hardcode K or use a valid subquery/CTE for it, omit the extra column unless justified, and ensure pure executability.
