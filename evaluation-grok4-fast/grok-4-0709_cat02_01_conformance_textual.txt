The provided answer is exemplary and nearly flawless in its execution. It precisely identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while correctly classifying compliant ones (1 and 4), with explanations that directly reference and quote the normative description's key constraints (e.g., sequencing for fulfillment/cancellation paths, prohibitions on post-cancellation fulfillment, and prerequisites like packaging before shipping). Interpretations of ambiguities are handled conservatively and logically, aligning with the description's intent without introducing unsupported flexibility. The structure is logical and comprehensive, covering all cases without omissions, redundancies, or inaccuracies; even minor details like the illogic of mixing paths or skipping mandatory steps are hyperbolically precise. No unclarities, logical flaws, or deviations from the task's requirements exist—this merits the maximum score under strict evaluation criteria.
