The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and precisely targeted SQL query that fully addresses the task. It accurately identifies qualifying `case_id`s via grouping and `HAVING`, then retrieves all events from those cases using a subquery with `IN`. The structure is clear, the explanation is precise and error-free, and there are no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. The query is syntactically valid for DuckDB and achieves the exact filtering behavior required without extraneous operations or assumptions.
