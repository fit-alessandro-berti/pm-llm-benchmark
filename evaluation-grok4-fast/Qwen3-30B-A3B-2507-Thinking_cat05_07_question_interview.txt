10.0

The provided answer delivers a precise, comprehensive list of 11 open-ended questions that directly address the prompt's requirements. Each question is tightly derived from the process description, probing key ambiguities (e.g., documentation gaps in Q1, compliance specifics in Q2), decision criteria (e.g., weighting factors in Q3, discount criteria in Q8), roles and responsibilities (e.g., coordination in Q9, validation in Q2), timing and sequencing (e.g., delays in Q5, escalation paths in Q6), and exception handling (e.g., special cases in Q7, disagreements in Q4). No questions veer into prohibited areas like SQL or technical implementations, staying purely conceptual and workflow-focused. The grouping enhances readability without redundancy, and the optional rationale succinctly validates coverage without introducing flaws. The entire output is logically sound, free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or bloat, making it exemplary.
