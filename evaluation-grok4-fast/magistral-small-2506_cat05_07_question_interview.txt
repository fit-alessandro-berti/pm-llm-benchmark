The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, well-structured list of 18 open-ended questions organized into 10 logical categories that precisely target the key elements of the property onboarding process as described. Each question effectively probes for missing details (e.g., common document issues, tools for tracking), decision criteria (e.g., manager assignment factors, trade-offs in inspections), roles and responsibilities (e.g., division between coordinator and manager), timing and sequencing (e.g., average duration, parallel vs. sequential steps), and exception handling (e.g., custom solutions, fast-tracking). The questions remain strictly conceptual, avoiding any technical or implementation specifics like queries or systems design. The closing statement succinctly reinforces the questions' purpose without introducing extraneous content. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws are present; the response is thorough, focused, and directly aligned with the prompt's objectives.
