### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating a clear understanding of the task by identifying key recurring activities (primarily "Verify Documents" across all cases and "Call Customer" in C002), interpreting contextual shifts based on position, resources, and additional notes, and providing a revised log with disambiguated names. The justifications are brief yet precise, tying directly to contextual clues (e.g., timing relative to uploads, calls, or adjustments). The inclusion of a summary table and conclusion adds analytical depth without straying from requirements, enhancing process insight as implied by the prompt.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several minor issues prevent a perfect score:
- **Inconsistency in naming specificity (logical flaw, deduct 0.5)**: The justification and summary table generalize the second "Verify Documents" as "Re-Verify Documents" for all follow-up instances, emphasizing a broad "follow-up check" after new information. Yet the revised log deviates by using "Re-Verify Documents After Adjustment" specifically for C003 (post-account change), while C001 uses the simpler "Re-Verify Documents" (post-upload). This introduces subtle ambiguity—why not standardize (e.g., "Re-Verify Documents" everywhere) or justify the extra detail in C003? It risks implying the contexts are not uniformly "follow-up" (C001 is document-focused, C003 adjustment-focused), undermining the disambiguation goal.
- **Over-renaming non-recurring activities (minor overreach, deduct 0.2)**: "Submit Additional" and "Adjust Account" appear only once per case and are not flagged as intra-case recurrences in the prompt's focus. Renaming them is helpful for clarity but slightly exceeds the core task ("for each activity that recurs"), potentially diluting emphasis on true ambiguities. The summary table includes them without noting this, creating a minor logical imbalance.
- **Missed opportunity for cross-case consistency (unclarity, deduct 0.1)**: "Initiate Request" recurs across cases with distinct channels (WebPortal vs. BranchReception), altering context (online vs. walk-in). While not intra-case, the prompt notes activities "carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur," and resources/additional context highlight this. Not renaming (e.g., "Online Initiate Request" vs. "Branch Initiate Request") is defensible but leaves potential disambiguation untapped, especially since the log's structure invites it.

No major inaccuracies (e.g., all renames align with provided contexts, timestamps/resources unchanged), and presentation is clear/professional. These nitpicks reflect strict evaluation—even small variances in rigor or completeness warrant deduction—but the answer remains exceptionally thorough and faithful to the task.
