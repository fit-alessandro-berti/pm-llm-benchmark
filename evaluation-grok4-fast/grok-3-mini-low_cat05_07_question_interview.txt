The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, precisely targeted list of 15 open-ended questions that directly address the specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., documentation types, database fields, marketing content), understanding decision criteria (e.g., manager assignment factors, tenant weighting, pricing adjustments), clarifying roles and responsibilities (e.g., coordinator vs. manager, leasing agent involvement, audit contributors), verifying timing and sequencing (e.g., timelines, dependencies, negotiation impacts), and handling exceptions (e.g., documentation issues, inspection resolutions, custom requirements). The questions are conceptually focused, free of any implementation details like SQL, and phrased neutrally to elicit detailed responses from the interviewee. Thematic organization enhances clarity without introducing redundancy or irrelevance, and the concluding statement reinforces the intent without adding extraneous content. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the coverage is thorough yet concise, fully aligning with the process description while probing its nuances effectively.
