### Evaluation Rationale
The answer effectively addresses all three tasks with clear structure, accurate core computations (total times correctly derived and tabulated, outliers precisely identified as 102, 104, and 105 with appropriate comparisons to the baseline ~140 min for cases 101 and 103), and logical root cause analysis tied to log evidence (e.g., escalations in 102/105, specific 19-hour overnight gaps in 102/104, repeated investigations in 105, and extended pre-investigation waits). The explanation of cycle time inflation uses a sound mathematical model (\(C = \sum W_i + \sum T_i\)) that directly links factors like handover waits and idle periods to prolonged durations, with evidence-based examples. Recommendations are practical, actionable, and targeted (e.g., SLAs, automation, shift coverage, knowledge base improvements), and the Python snippet is a relevant, correctly formatted illustration of metric computation without exceeding 80 characters per line.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor inaccuracies and unclarities slightly detract: (1) The root causes table erroneously groups case 102 with "101–103" as having triage/assignment 35 minutes, despite 102's actual 55-minute combined wait, creating a logical inconsistency (102 is an outlier but misclassified here). (2) Typographical errors like "Cases 104 & -106" (clearly meant 105) and "14 000 hrs." (meant 14:00) introduce unnecessary ambiguity, potentially undermining precision. These are small but represent avoidable flaws in clarity and fact-checking, preventing a perfect score despite the overall near-flawless execution of conclusions.
