The provided solution is nearly flawless, with precise logic, correct use of window functions to enforce direct succession via consecutive LAG rows, accurate time difference calculation using DuckDB-compatible INTERVAL syntax, and proper case-level exclusion via DISTINCT and NOT EXISTS. It handles multiple sequences per case correctly (excludes if at least one qualifies), assumes proper timestamp ordering (standard for event logs), and returns all non-excluded events as required. The explanation is clear, concise, and aligns perfectly with the problem. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected under hypercritical scrutiny.
