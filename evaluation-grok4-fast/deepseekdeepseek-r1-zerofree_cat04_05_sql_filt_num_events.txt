The final boxed query is correct, efficient, and directly addresses the task: it identifies qualifying `case_id` values via a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then filters the full `event_log` table to return all events (via `SELECT *`) for those cases. This preserves all original columns without unnecessary complexity. Minor deduction for not explicitly aliasing the outer table (though `SELECT *` is unproblematic here) and for using `IN` over `JOIN` (which could be microscopically clearer in readability, but performance in DuckDB is negligible). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities in the conclusion.
