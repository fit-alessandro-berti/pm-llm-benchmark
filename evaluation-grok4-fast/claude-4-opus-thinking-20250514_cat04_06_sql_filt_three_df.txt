The provided answer is nearly flawless. It correctly identifies cases with the exact required sequence in direct succession using consecutive row numbers and LEAD functions, accurately filters for the >5-day condition between the specific events in that sequence, and excludes only those cases while returning all events from the remaining cases, properly ordered. The nested window function for row number leads is syntactically valid in DuckDB (equivalent to a subquery approach for referencing the row number), efficient, and logically sound, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws in implementation or explanation. The query fully meets all prompt requirements without omissions or overcomplications.
