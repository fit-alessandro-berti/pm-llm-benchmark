10.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This response is nearly flawless and fully aligns with the prompt's requirements. It delivers a well-structured list of 10 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe the process description without veering into prohibited areas like SQL or technical implementation. Each question effectively uncovers missing details (e.g., Q2 on document sign-off), decision criteria (e.g., Q4 on assignment factors), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q9 on clause documentation), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q5 on move-in dates), and exception handling (e.g., Q6 on escalations, Q10 on real-world examples). The questions are interviewee-focused, conversational, and build logically on the provided narrative, revealing potential vulnerabilities (Q1), interdependencies (Q3, Q8), and feedback mechanisms (Q8). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present—all are precise, relevant, and free of assumptions or leading bias. Minor stylistic strengths, like varying phrasing for engagement, further enhance it, but even without them, it merits maximum score under strict criteria.
