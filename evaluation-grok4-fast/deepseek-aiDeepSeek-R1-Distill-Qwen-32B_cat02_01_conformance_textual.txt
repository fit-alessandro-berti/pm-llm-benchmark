9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Accuracy and Completeness**: The answer correctly identifies all three deviating cases (2, 3, and 5) and omits the compliant ones (1 and 4), aligning with the task. Explanations reference the normative description accurately and resolve ambiguities by sticking to the explicit sequences (sufficient vs. insufficient inventory paths). However, for Case 3, the explanation is incomplete: it only addresses "Ship order" after "Cancel order," but omits the violation of authorizing payment after "Check inventory" instead of proceeding *directly* to "Cancel order" (per the branch for insufficient inventory). This implies an erroneous assumption of sufficiency, constituting an additional rule violation. This omission is a minor but notable gap in exhaustiveness, warranting a deduction under hypercritical standards.
  
- **Clarity and Structure**: The response is well-organized with numbered cases, bullet-point violations, and a concise summary. Language is precise, avoiding vagueness or over-interpretation of ambiguities (e.g., it doesn't speculate on "extraordinary circumstances" for cancellations). No logical flaws or contradictions.

- **Strictness Applied**: No factual errors in the identified violations, but the partial explanation for Case 3 prevents a perfect score. If flawless (complete coverage of all implied violations per case), it would be 10.0. Overall, it's strong but not exhaustive.
