7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is well-structured, comprehensive, and addresses all three tasks directly, with clear tables, logical flow, and relevant insights into complexity as the primary driver of delays via document requests. The identification of slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) is accurate, and total case durations are calculated correctly (minor approximations like 27.0 hours are acceptable). The root cause analysis correctly links higher complexity to multiple document requests and external waiting times, downplaying resource/region as secondary (a fair deduction given the data). Explanations are plausible (e.g., customer response delays), and mitigations are practical, actionable, and tied to the analysis (e.g., automated reminders, pre-emptive data collection).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are notable inaccuracies and logical flaws that prevent a higher score:
- **Calculation errors in delay times**: The table in Section 2.B claims 17.5 hours for Case 2002 (last request at 2024-04-01 14:00 to approval at 2024-04-02 10:00), but this is exactly 20 hours (10 hours to midnight + 10 hours to 10:00). For Case 2005, it claims 41 hours (last request at 2024-04-03 15:00 to approval at 2024-04-04 10:00), but this is 19 hours (9 hours to midnight + 10 hours to 10:00). The 41-hour figure appears to mistakenly reference the gap from the second request (2024-04-02 17:00), ignoring the third request as the "last." These errors undermine the precision of the "primary driver of delay" claim, as they misrepresent the waiting periods and could mislead on the scale of external bottlenecks.
- **Minor unclarity in resource analysis**: The finding that resources like Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike "tend to be more complex/vague" is speculative without evidence (e.g., no comparison of their handling of low-complexity cases, both of which were fast and handled by others). Region analysis is vague ("less pronounced"), correctly noting no strong correlation but not exploring why Region B has two slow cases vs. A's one.
- **Overemphasis on "last" request gap**: While insightful, this ignores cumulative delays from multiple requests (e.g., gaps between requests themselves, like 2024-04-02 17:00 to 2024-04-03 15:00 in Case 2005, ~22 hours of internal processing/waiting). This creates a logical incompleteness in quantifying total waiting time.
- **Small formatting/precision issues**: Duration for Case 2004 is listed as 1.42 hours (should be 1.42 or 1.4 for consistency with approximations); table headers like "HH:MM" show 01:30 but not for all.

These issues—factual errors in core metrics, speculation, and incomplete delay breakdown—are not minor; they introduce inaccuracies in the analytical foundation, warranting a significant deduction from a potential 9.5 (for strong overall coverage). The response is strong but not "nearly flawless," hence 7.5.
