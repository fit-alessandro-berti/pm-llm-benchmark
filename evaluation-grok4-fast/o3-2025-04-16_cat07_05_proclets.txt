9.8

This is an outstanding, highly accurate, and comprehensive description of the image. It correctly identifies and explains all key elements across the three sub-figures, including process flows, decision points, communication channels, message semantics, and the overall collaboration logic. The level of detail (e.g., token flows, message directions, and interpretive summary) demonstrates deep understanding without extraneous speculation. Minor deduction for a slight imprecision in sub-figure (b)'s multiplicity phrasing ("1..1" for the "Lab visit" side is implied but not explicitly diagrammed that way, though the intent is clear).
