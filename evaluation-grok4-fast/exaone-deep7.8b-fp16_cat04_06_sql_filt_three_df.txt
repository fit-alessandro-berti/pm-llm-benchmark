3.5

### Grading Rationale
The provided answer's core logic is sound and correctly interprets the requirements: it uses row numbering to detect consecutive events for the specified sequence, incorporates the >5-day filter on the relevant timestamps, and aims to exclude all events from qualifying cases while returning the rest of the event log. The approach and explanation sections are clear, comprehensive, and align well with the problem without introducing extraneous elements or misinterpretations (e.g., it properly handles potential multiple trios per case via DISTINCT).

However, under hypercritical evaluation, the solution code contains a fatal syntax error in the final SELECT query: the WHERE clause reads `WHERE NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)`, which is invalid SQL—it omits the necessary column reference (should be `WHERE event_log.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)` or equivalent). This renders the query non-executable in DuckDB (or any SQL dialect), failing the basic requirement of producing a working query. Additionally, minor unclarities include:
- No explicit handling of potential timestamp ties (ROW_NUMBER() arbitrarily orders ties, which could disrupt "direct succession" if ties occur, though the prompt implies unique timestamps).
- The NOT IN clause risks issues if excluded_cases contains NULLs (unlikely but unaddressed; EXISTS would be safer).
- No ORDER BY on the final result or input to ROW_NUMBER() for ties (e.g., ORDER BY timestamp, some secondary key), though not strictly required.

These issues—especially the syntax error—prevent a high score, as the answer must be nearly flawless for 9+ (executable, precise, robust). The logic earns partial credit, but execution flaws drag it down significantly.
