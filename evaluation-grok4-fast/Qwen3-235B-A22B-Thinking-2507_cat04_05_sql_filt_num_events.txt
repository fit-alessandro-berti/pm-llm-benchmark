The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and clear DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it identifies event counts per `case_id` via GROUP BY and COUNT(*), filters cases using HAVING to retain only those with 6 events, and returns the full set of events for those cases via a subquery in the WHERE clause with IN. The SELECT * appropriately retrieves all columns for the valid events. The explanation accurately describes the subquery's role in filtering groups and the main query's role in event retrieval, with no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. The approach is standard, readable, and performant for the described task.
