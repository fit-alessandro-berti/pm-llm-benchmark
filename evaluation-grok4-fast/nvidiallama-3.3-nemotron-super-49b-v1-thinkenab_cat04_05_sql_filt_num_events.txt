The provided SQL query precisely and correctly solves the problem. It accurately identifies `case_id` values with 6 or fewer events via the subquery (using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`), then retrieves all events for those cases using an `IN` clause filter on the main table. This ensures only qualifying cases' full event sets are returned, with no extraneous data or incorrect exclusions. The syntax is standard SQL, fully compatible with DuckDB, and there are no logical, semantic, or performance issues in the final implementation.
