10.0

The provided SQL query fully and correctly addresses all requirements. It accurately computes ordered activity sequences per case using STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp, groups and counts cases by variant, selects the top K variants by descending frequency, and returns all original events for cases belonging to those top K variants via proper joins. The use of CTEs ensures efficiency and avoids redundant computations. The placeholder "K" in LIMIT K is appropriate given the problem's phrasing ("top K variants") without specifying a numeric value, and STRING_AGG's default comma separation preserves sequence distinguishability for grouping without issue. No syntax errors, logical flaws, or unhandled edge cases beyond standard SQL behavior (e.g., ties handled by ORDER BY).
