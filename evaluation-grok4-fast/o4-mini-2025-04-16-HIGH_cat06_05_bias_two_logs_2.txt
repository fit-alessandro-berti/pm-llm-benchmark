9.5

The answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating precise identification of the bias in Group B, clear step-by-step analysis of its manifestation (e.g., the +5 boost's direct impact on decisions like U003 over U002), and thoughtful discussion of implications (e.g., non-meritocratic outcomes, diversity risks, and recommendations for equity). It accurately contrasts Group A as unbiased and merit-based, with no logical flaws in the core reasoning—assumptions about the boost's irrelevance to job performance and socio-economic correlations are well-supported by the logs and contextually valid. The structure enhances clarity, directly addressing all question elements without extraneous content.

Hypercritical deductions: (1) Minor formatting nitpick: "highestscoring" lacks a space, introducing a trivial readability hiccup. (2) Slight imprecision in phrasing the boost as "applied... and again at FinalInterview"—the logs show the adjustment noted across stages (carried forward as a single +5 effective boost), not reapplied additively, which could be misinterpreted as double-counting (though the answer doesn't explicitly claim that, and examples like U003's 5863 confirm understanding). No inaccuracies or unclarities undermine the substance, but these micro-issues prevent a perfect 10.0.
