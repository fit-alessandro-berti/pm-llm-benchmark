### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong and addresses nearly every requirement with precision, clarity, and correctness. It uses appropriate DuckDB SQL features (e.g., STRING_AGG with ORDER BY, which is fully supported), constructs the variants accurately as ordered sequences, correctly aggregates/counts by variant, ranks and limits to top K by frequency, and filters the event log to return only events from qualifying cases while excluding others. The CTE structure is logical, efficient, and readable, with a final join that preserves the original event structure (all columns via `e.*`). The global `ORDER BY e.timestamp` is acceptable as the prompt does not specify output ordering beyond maintaining sequence extraction (which is already handled internally), though per-case ordering (e.g., `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp`) could have been a minor enhancement for completeness— this is a hypercritical nitpick and does not warrant a major deduction.

Strengths (supporting high score):
- **Accuracy and Completeness**: Perfectly extracts ordered sequences per case, groups/aggregates variants with counts, identifies top K via ranking, and returns filtered events only from those cases. No logical flaws; handles the "complete activity sequence" as a unique key via concatenation.
- **Clarity and Structure**: Step-by-step explanation aligns directly with the prompt's numbered tasks. The query is self-contained, with notes explaining the K placeholder (essential since the prompt leaves K generic) and DuckDB compatibility.
- **Edge Cases**: Assumes standard event log structure (one event per row, timestamps sortable); the approach robustly handles variable-length sequences without errors. Example with K=3 adds practical value.
- **No Extraneous Issues**: No syntax errors, no unnecessary complexity, no deviations from DuckDB dialect. Exclusion of non-top-K cases is explicit and correct via the join.

Minor Deductions (strict/hypercritical lens, preventing a perfect 10.0):
- **K Placeholder**: Using `LIMIT K` is fine for generality, but in executable SQL, it requires substitution (noted, but could have been parameterized or assumed, e.g., via a variable—slight unpolished feel).
- **Sequence Representation**: STRING_AGG with `' -> '` is effective for uniqueness but assumes no delimiter conflicts in activity names (e.g., if an activity contains `' -> '`, it could theoretically malform; a more robust option like LIST_AGG(CAST(activity AS VARCHAR)) or JSON aggregation exists, but this is an extreme edge case unlikely in process mining contexts and not specified—still, hypercritically, it's not "bulletproof").
- **Output Ordering**: Global timestamp order mixes cases chronologically, which is logically sound but could ambiguously interleave events from different cases if timestamps overlap; prompt implies returning "events" without stipulation, so no real flaw, but a per-case sort would be more interpretable.

Overall, this is a near-flawless response: professional, prompt-adherent, and production-ready with trivial tweaks. Any lower score would be unjustifiably harsh given the excellence.
