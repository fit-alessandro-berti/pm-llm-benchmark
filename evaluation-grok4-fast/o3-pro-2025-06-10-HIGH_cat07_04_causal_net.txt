This answer is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. It correctly identifies and describes all key elements of the Petri-net workflow (tasks, places, flows, branching, synchronization, decision outcomes, and the feedback loop) while faithfully explaining the legend's routing constructs (XOR, AND, OR splits/joins) in the context of Petri-net semantics. The only minor deduction is for slightly verbose phrasing in spots (e.g., the branching description could be more concise), but it doesn't detract from the overall clarity or correctness.
