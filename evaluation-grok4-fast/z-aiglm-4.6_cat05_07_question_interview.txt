### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under the strict criteria demanded. It fully adheres to the prompt by producing a targeted list of 13 open-ended questions that systematically uncover missing details (e.g., Q1 on common delay-causing documents, Q8 on tenant application steps), probe decision criteria (e.g., Q2 on factor weighting, Q7 on tenant prioritization hierarchy), clarify roles and responsibilities (e.g., Q10 on auditors' authority, Q11 on evaluating custom clauses), verify timing and sequencing (e.g., Q6 on pre-inspection marketing, Q9 on audit timelines), and explore exception handling (e.g., Q3 on policy disagreements, Q4 on inspection disputes). The questions are conceptual only, avoiding any mention of SQL, technical implementations, or non-process elements.

The structure is logical and reader-friendly, with a concise introductory sentence framing the response and thematic groupings that mirror the process stages without redundancy or gaps. Coverage spans the entire description—from initial contact to final audits—while including overarching themes like bottlenecks (Q12) and communication (Q13). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws exist; every question is precisely phrased, directly tied to the provided process narrative, and free of leading assumptions or yes/no traps. Minor potential nitpicks (e.g., Q5's focus on tenant negotiation flexibility slightly anticipates post-activation dynamics but still validly clarifies pre-activation pricing) do not detract, as they enhance conceptual depth without straying. This is a model response warranting the maximum score.
