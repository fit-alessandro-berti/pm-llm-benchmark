### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is nearly flawless under the strictest scrutiny. It directly fulfills the prompt by producing a targeted list of open-ended questions that systematically deepen conceptual understanding of the process, without any mention of SQL, implementation, or unrelated details. The questions precisely address the required areas: missing details (e.g., Q1 on contact channels, Q2 on rejection criteria), decision criteria (e.g., Q7 on weighing factors, Q9 on tenant selection), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q4 on decision-makers, Q6 on screening roles), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q10 on parallelism, Q11 on bottlenecks, Q12 on audit timing), and exceptions (e.g., Q13 on custom clauses, Q14 on inspection failures). The grouping enhances clarity and logical flow, and the big-picture Q15 aptly extends to process evaluation without straying. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present—all questions are relevant, precise, and phrased to elicit elaboration (e.g., "walk me through," "what determines"). The introductory phrasing is polite and contextual without excess, and the minor "a few" vs. 15 questions is negligible phrasing, not a substantive issue. This warrants the maximum score.
