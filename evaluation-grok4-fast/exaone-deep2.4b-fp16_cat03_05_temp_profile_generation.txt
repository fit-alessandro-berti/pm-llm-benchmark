### Evaluation Rationale
The final output delivers a well-formatted Python dictionary that precisely matches the required structure: tuple keys for activity pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`) and tuple values for `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds, aligning with the example format (e.g., using values like 7200 for ~2 hours). It includes a representative subset of 11 pairs, covering the main process flow (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS) with 9 direct/consecutive pairs and 2 indirect pairs (SS to DT; OP to WS) that span multiple steps, fulfilling the complexity requirement without overwhelming the subset. Estimates are plausible for a supply chain context—short internal delays (1-4 hours) escalating to cumulative times (~15-16 hours)—and SDs are logically scaled (typically 25-50% of averages, indicating variability from factors like lead times or complexity). The explanation concisely justifies the choices, reinforcing adherence to the task.

Minor deductions for hypercritical scrutiny: (1) Some estimates (e.g., WS to DT at 1 hour; total SS to DT at 16 hours) appear overly optimistic for high-tech electronics supply chains, where distribution/storage might realistically span days, potentially underestimating "typical factors" like network efficiency delays. (2) Inconsistent comment for the first pair (claims "1.5h SD" but value is 3600 seconds = 1 hour). (3) The last pair lacks a comment, breaking uniformity. These are small flaws in an otherwise flawless execution; no logical errors, inaccuracies in structure, or unclarities in the core deliverable.
