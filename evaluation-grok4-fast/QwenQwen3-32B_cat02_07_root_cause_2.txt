7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The response is well-structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three tasks with clear headings, bullet points, and a logical flow. It accurately identifies durations for most cases (e.g., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005) and correctly links performance issues to complexity and document requests, with appropriate analysis of regions and resources as secondary factors. Explanations are insightful, emphasizing waiting times over processing times, and mitigations are practical and targeted (e.g., checklists, AI tools, training). The summary ties everything together effectively.

However, under utmost strictness, a significant factual inaccuracy undermines the foundation: the duration for Case 2003 is incorrectly stated as 58 hours 20 minutes, when the actual calculation (from 2024-04-01 09:10 to 2024-04-03 09:30) is 48 hours 20 minutes. This error misrepresents the case's length (exaggerating it by 10 hours), potentially skewing the perception of its severity relative to others (e.g., making it seem closer to 2005's 77 hours than it is). While the sub-analysis (e.g., 23-hour delay between last request and approval) remains correct and the overall conclusions hold, this core miscalculation in Task 1 is a logical flaw that erodes precision and reliability. No other major issues, but this alone prevents a higher score, as the response is not "nearly flawless."
