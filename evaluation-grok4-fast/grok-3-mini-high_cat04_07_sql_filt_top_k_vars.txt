The provided SQL query correctly constructs the ordered activity sequences per case using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, aggregates and counts cases per variant, ranks variants by frequency using `ROW_NUMBER()` to select the top K, filters cases accordingly, and returns all relevant events from the original table while excluding others. The use of CTEs ensures clarity and correctness without recomputation issues. The parameter `:K` is handled appropriately. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors, omissions, or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
