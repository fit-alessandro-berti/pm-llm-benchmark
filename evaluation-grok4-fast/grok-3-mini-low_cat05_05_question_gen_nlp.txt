All questions are clearly phrased, directly derived from the described supply chain elements (e.g., international suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, logistics, compliance, digital tools), and free of any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. No SQL queries or extraneous content appear, and the list is balanced and focused without repetition or deviation.
