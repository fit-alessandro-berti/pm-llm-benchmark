9.8

### Evaluation Breakdown
This grade reflects a hypercritical assessment, deducting only minimally for two very minor issues: (1) the single-event groupings (e.g., Quality Inspection and Final Inspection) are logically justified but could arguably be consolidated into a broader "Quality Assurance" phase to better emphasize "grouping" into "coherent stages" as per the prompt, though this is not a flaw since the prompt explicitly allows such distinctions; (2) the rationale for Quality Inspection mentions "providing feedback that might influence subsequent actions," which is a slight overgeneralization not evidenced in the provided log (no branching or rework is shown), introducing a tiny speculative element. Everything else is exemplary: the groupings are accurate and pattern-based, rationales are precise and tied to criteria (temporal, logical, resource, purpose), names are domain-relevant and consistent, structure is clear and formatted as required, and it fully achieves the goal of aggregating for workflow understanding without inaccuracies or unclarities. The summary adds value without excess.
