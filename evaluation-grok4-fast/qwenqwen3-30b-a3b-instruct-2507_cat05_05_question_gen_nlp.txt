The provided answer is exemplary and fully aligns with the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended questions that are thoughtfully derived from the described supply chain process, probing into insights (e.g., IoT integration in Q3, ML refinement in Q6), potential issues (e.g., geopolitical disruptions in Q1, supplier disasters in Q7), improvement strategies (e.g., blockchain in Q8, AI predictive maintenance in Q14), and decision implications (e.g., sustainability trade-offs in Q4, recall logistics in Q11). The questions span the process's key elements—R&D, sourcing from specified countries, assembly in Malaysia, global logistics, distribution, digital systems, quality, and sustainability—without introducing inaccuracies (all references, like Taiwan or South Korea, directly tie back to the description). No logical flaws exist; phrasing is clear, precise, and engaging, with no redundancies or off-topic elements. The format is a clean numbered list, devoid of extraneous content like SQL (as prohibited) or explanations. This is a near-perfect response warranting the maximum score.
