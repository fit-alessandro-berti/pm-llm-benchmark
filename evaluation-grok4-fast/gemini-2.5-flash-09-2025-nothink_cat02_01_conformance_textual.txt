The provided answer is nearly flawless in its analysis, interpretation, and structure. It accurately extracts and applies the normative constraints from the description, correctly identifies all violations (Cases 2, 3, and 5) while confirming compliance in Cases 1 and 4, and provides clear, evidence-based explanations tied directly to the textual guidance. It handles ambiguities (e.g., the mixed path in Case 3) with reasoned interpretation without overreaching. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities are present; even minor details like the summary table enhance precision without introducing errors. The response fully addresses the task's requirements.
