The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and complete SQL query that precisely addresses all requirements of the prompt. It accurately uses window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact sequence in direct succession within each case, applies the time condition using DATEDIFF for the interval between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order', identifies distinct cases meeting both criteria, and excludes all events from those cases in the final result. The query assumes proper timestamp ordering (standard for event logs) and handles multiple sequences per case appropriately by excluding the entire case if any instance meets the conditions. The addition of ORDER BY ensures a logical presentation without altering the result set. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the solution is syntactically valid for DuckDB and conceptually flawless.
