The provided answer correctly infers three distinct cases based on patient age/gender as unique identifiers, with all 18 events precisely grouped and no overlaps or omissions. Each case's sequence is chronologically ordered and logically coherent (e.g., ER flows for Cases 1 and 2, surgical flow for Case 3), departments align consistently, and additional info is accurately extracted from source events. The explanation of grouping logic is clear, concise, and without flaws.
