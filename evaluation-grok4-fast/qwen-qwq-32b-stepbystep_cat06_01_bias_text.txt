The provided answer is a strong, comprehensive response that precisely identifies the sources of bias in Steps 3 and 4, elucidates the mechanisms (explicit score boosts, subjective underwriting), and rigorously evaluates justifiability against ethical and equity principles. It accurately highlights unproven assumptions, lack of transparency, disparate impact risks, and systemic exclusion without introducing inaccuracies or overgeneralizations. The structure enhances clarity, the counterarguments to potential justifications are logically sound, and the conclusion ties implications to fairness/equity implications effectively. Minor deduction for the slight vagueness in referencing "marginalized groups (e.g., recent migrants)" as a potential proxy without tying it more tightly to the text's "non-protected demographic segments," though this is a negligible issue given the context.
