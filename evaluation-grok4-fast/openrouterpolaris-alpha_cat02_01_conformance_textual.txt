The provided answer is exemplary: it accurately interprets the normative description into a strict, consistent set of constraints without introducing extraneous rules or ambiguities; methodically applies them to every case with precise sequencing; identifies exactly the correct violating cases (2, 3, 5) and compliant ones (1, 4); offers clear, reference-backed explanations for each violation that directly tie back to the textual description (e.g., payment before packaging, shipping after cancellation, missing mandatory steps); handles interpretive elements like path mixing in Case 3 logically and conservatively; and concludes with a concise summary. No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, omissions, or overreaches—truly flawless under strict evaluation.
