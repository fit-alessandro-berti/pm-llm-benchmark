7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is a solid effort overall, producing a relevant list of 11 open-ended questions that effectively target key aspects of the prompt: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q1, Q5), decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q7), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q4, Q8, Q9), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q9), and exceptions/communication (e.g., Q10, Q11). The questions are derived logically from the process description, remain conceptual in focus for most, and avoid any SQL-related requests. The closing summary sentence appropriately frames the intent without adding extraneous content.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, the answer incurs significant deductions for logical flaws and direct violations of the prompt's boundaries:
- **Implementation details in multiple questions**: Q2 probes database structure (e.g., "specific fields or categories," "who has access"), Q6 explicitly asks about "specific tools or algorithms," and Q11 inquires about "specific tools or systems." These cross into forbidden "implementation details," shifting from conceptual deepening to technical specifics. This is not minor—it's a repeated breach (3/11 questions affected), undermining the prompt's clear prohibition and potentially derailing the interview toward unproductive tangents.
- **Minor unclarity and overreach**: Q2's focus on access controls feels tangential to core process understanding, introducing a security/access layer not emphasized in the description. The list's length (11 questions) is acceptable as a "series," but it risks overwhelming without tighter prioritization, slightly diluting focus.
- **No major inaccuracies in content derivation**, but the flaws above prevent near-flawlessness. A score above 8.0 would require zero such violations; this is strong in coverage but compromised in adherence, warranting a mid-high grade rather than excellence.
