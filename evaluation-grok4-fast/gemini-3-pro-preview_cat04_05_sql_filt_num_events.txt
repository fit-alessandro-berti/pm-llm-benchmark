The provided answer is nearly flawless: it delivers a correct, efficient, and idiomatic DuckDB-specific query using the QUALIFY clause, which precisely achieves the required filtering by partitioning on `case_id`, counting events per case, and retaining only rows from qualifying cases (6 events). The explanation is accurate, concise, and directly ties to the query components without extraneous details. The alternative standard SQL subquery is a helpful bonus that reinforces compatibility without detracting from the primary solution. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, unclarities, or inefficiencies are present; even under hypercritical scrutiny, it fully satisfies the prompt's requirements for grouping, filtering, and returning the full event set.
