### Evaluation Rationale
This prompt is exceptionally well-crafted and aligns almost perfectly with the requirements to encourage the target LLM to identify anomalies, hypothesize root causes, and propose investigative SQL queries without providing hints, solutions, or extraneous guidance. It faithfully reproduces the schema, nominal process flow, and all provided sample event log data (across the four cases) in a structured, readable format, ensuring the LLM has all necessary context without invention or omission. The tasks are explicitly mapped to the desired outputs, and the strict output format promotes organized, focused responses. Additional guidance (e.g., on SQL dialects, CTEs, and interval arithmetic) enhances usability without biasing analysis or revealing insights.

Hypercritical deductions (-0.2 total):
- **Minor formatting inconsistencies in tables**: Subsequent data blocks (e.g., for case_id 1002, 1003, 1004) omit repeated column headers, relying on context from the first table. While readable, this could cause slight parsing ambiguity in a strict text-based LLM prompt, potentially leading to minor misinterpretation of columns in edge cases.
- **Omitted sample data for non-event-log tables**: The original description includes tabular sample rows for `orders` and `resources`, but the prompt only includes their schemas (correctly, as the focus is event_log anomalies). However, this omission is not a flaw per se, but strictly speaking, it deviates from the full "example event log data" reference by not mirroring the auxiliary samples exactly—though the instruction emphasizes event_log, this could be seen as a tiny completeness gap.
- **No explicit prohibition on inventing data**: The guidance says "Rely solely on the information provided above; do not invent extra schema or data," which is strong, but it doesn't reiterate "without any hints" from the meta-instructions as a reminder— a hyper-minor reinforcement opportunity.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws: All data is transcribed verbatim (e.g., timestamps, additional_info values), hypotheses are grounded in business context without examples, and SQL design encourages hypothesis-testing queries across tables without pre-solving them. The prompt is concise (avoids bloat) yet thorough, using plain language, and positions the LLM as an "experienced process-mining and data-forensics analyst" to prime expert-level output. Only a perfect 10.0 would require zero deviations, but this is as close as possible without being overly prescriptive.
