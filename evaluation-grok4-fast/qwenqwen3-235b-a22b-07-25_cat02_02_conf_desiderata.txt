7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This grade reflects a strong overall structure and coverage of the task (clear sections for Parts 1-3, use of tables for summaries, explanations of reasons/impacts, clarification of desiderata as suboptimal, and plausible justifications), but deducts significantly for a critical inaccuracy in Part 1: the answer fails to identify the complete skipping of the mandatory "Inform Applicant" activity in Case 2's event log. This is a normative violation (per the explicit rule: "Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome," and "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"), as the log shows Loan Decision at 09:30 followed directly by Finalize Documentation at 10:00 and Close Case at 10:30, with no Inform Applicant recorded. Assuming the log is authoritative (as per the task), this is a clear sequence skip, equivalent in severity to the other two violations identified. The answer only speculates in Part 2 that it "likely occurred" (treating absence as a possible delay rather than a confirmed omission), which misinterprets the provided evidence and undermines the strict normative analysis. This logical flaw propagates to the summary table (listing only two violations) and overall conclusions for Case 2, making the response incomplete and not "nearly flawless."

Minor deductions for:
- Unclear/verbose phrasing in justifications (e.g., speculating "weekend processing lags" for Case 3 without confirming 2024 dates, introducing slight ambiguity; and assuming "data entry error" for Case 2 without tying directly to constraints).
- Over-emphasis on extra "Recommendations" section (helpful but not required, slightly dilutes focus on core task).
- In Part 2 for Case 2, imprecise timing calculation (states Credit Check "40 minutes after Risk Assessment," but from application to Credit Check is ~1 hour, though sequence invalidates it anyway—minor but shows lack of precision).

No penalties for structure, accurate identification of other violations (e.g., order reversal and post-rejection finalization in Case 2; delays in Case 3), correct desiderata handling (suboptimal framing), or solid justifications where provided. A flawless response would explicitly flag the missing Inform as a third normative violation in Case 2, with no speculative assumptions about unlogged events.
