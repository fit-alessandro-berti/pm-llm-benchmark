### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of the response)

**Strengths (contributing to score):**
- **Anomalies Identification (Strong, ~9/10):** Accurately pinpoints the core contradiction between `existence` of `C` and `noncoexistence` of `E` and `C`, correctly linking it to violations of the intended flow (e.g., allowing closure without evaluation). The second anomaly ties back to process logic undermining, though the titling ("Invalid Precedence") is imprecise—the precedence rule itself is valid, but its combination with noncoexistence is the issue. No major logical flaws in conclusions; covers key conflicts without extraneous errors.
- **Hypotheses (Excellent, ~9.5/10):** Comprehensive and directly aligned with prompt examples (misinterpretation, incremental changes, technical issues, expedite pressure). Well-phrased, plausible, and varied; no inaccuracies or repetitions.
- **Verification Approaches (Good but Flawed, ~7/10):** Queries correctly target the main anomalies (closure without eval, coexistence of E/C, E without A), with logical SQL structures that would work in PostgreSQL. They use appropriate joins, subqueries (NOT EXISTS), and focus on claim_events filtering by activity. The third query verifies the responded_existence rule under a reasonable interpretation (A must precede E).

**Weaknesses (deducting points, strict penalties):**
- **Missed Integration of Adjusters Table (~1.5 deduction):** Prompt explicitly requires queries "on the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables" and examples include checking "evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters" (e.g., matching specialization or region). No query involves `adjusters`; all are limited to `claims` and `claim_events`. This is a clear omission of schema scope, undermining completeness.
- **SQL Sloppiness (~0.5 deduction):** Third query has a redundant JOIN to `ce2` (not used in WHERE or EXISTS), which is unnecessary and could confuse execution (though harmless). Second query risks duplicates without DISTINCT or GROUP BY, minor but unprofessional in a verification context. First query is clean, but overall polish lacks.
- **Minor Unclarity in Anomalies (~0.3 deduction):** Second anomaly's focus on "precedence" overstates the issue—the rule is correct, but the noncoexistence creates the invalid path. This is semantically fuzzy, not a fatal error but hypercritically imprecise.
- No other major inaccuracies (e.g., correct interpretation of model rules, no invented constraints). Flow is independent and structured as required, ignoring <think> as instructed. Score reflects near-flawless core logic but penalizes omissions and polish strictly per guidelines.
