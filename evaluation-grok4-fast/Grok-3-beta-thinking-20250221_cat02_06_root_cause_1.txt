The provided answer is a comprehensive, accurate, and logically sound response to the task. It correctly calculates all resolution times with precise breakdowns (e.g., 1510 minutes for Case 102, 2945 minutes for Case 105) and derives the average of 1224 minutes (20.4 hours) without error. The identification of Cases 102, 104, and 105 as significantly longer is well-justified, with relative comparisons (e.g., 140% over average for Case 105) that align with the prompt's emphasis on performance issues, treating even modest exceedances (18–23%) as notable given the small dataset and context of delays.

Root causes are meticulously identified through activity-level timing analysis, correctly pinpointing escalations (e.g., 28-hour delay in Case 105), the consistent 19-hour overnight pattern across Cases 102, 104, and 105 (with exact timestamp correlations), and pre-investigation delays (e.g., 3.5 hours in Case 104). These are free of inaccuracies and clearly tied to process factors like resource availability and scheduling constraints.

The explanations of how these factors inflate cycle times (e.g., escalations doubling durations in extreme cases, systemic overnight waits adding fixed overhead) are precise and evidence-based. Recommendations are actionable, directly addressing the bottlenecks (e.g., enhancing Level-2 staffing, optimizing schedules), and provide meaningful insights without speculation. The structure is clear, concise, and fully responsive to all three subtasks, with no unclarities, repetitions, or logical gaps. This is a model of thorough, flawless analysis.
