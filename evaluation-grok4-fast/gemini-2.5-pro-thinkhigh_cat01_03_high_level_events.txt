### Evaluation Summary
This answer is exemplary and nearly flawless under the strictest scrutiny. It directly addresses all instructions with precision, clarity, and logical rigor: identifying high-level steps (four coherent stages covering all 12 events per case), providing detailed, evidence-based rationales tied to the prompt's suggested criteria (e.g., temporal closeness, logical flow, resource types), and assigning domain-relevant names. The structure—overview, detailed breakdowns, and a mapping table—exceeds the required "structured representation" without unnecessary verbosity. All groupings are accurate, non-overlapping, and fully account for the log's patterns across cases (implicitly via consistency). No inaccuracies (e.g., events are correctly attributed and sequenced), unclarities (language is precise and jargon-free), or logical flaws (criteria are consistently applied, even handling resource transitions thoughtfully). Minor potential nitpicks, such as the single-event final step or table focusing on one case, are not flaws—they align with the prompt's intent and the log's uniformity. This transforms the granular log into a insightful, high-level workflow view, fully achieving the goal.
