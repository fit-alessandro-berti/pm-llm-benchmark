### Explanation of Grade
The provided answer demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the problem, correctly identifying the need to use window functions (LAG/LEAD) to detect direct succession in sequences per case, filtering for the specific activities, checking the >5-day interval via timestamp subtraction against INTERVAL '5 days' (valid DuckDB syntax), and excluding entire bad cases via NOT IN with DISTINCT case_id. The logic accurately ensures no intervening events (via immediate LAG/LEAD) and handles the "at least one such sequence per case" requirement. The addition of ORDER BY timestamp addresses the prompt's call for proper ordering, and the explanation is clear and aligned with the solution.

However, under utmost strictness, the query has a critical syntax error: the derived table in the subquery lacks an alias (e.g., it should be `FROM (SELECT ...) AS windowed_events`), making it invalid SQL that won't execute in DuckDB (or standard SQL). This isn't a minor oversight—it's a fundamental flaw rendering the query non-functional, despite the sound logic. No other inaccuracies (e.g., interval handling is correct, no logical gaps in sequence detection), but this alone prevents a higher score. A flawless version would require the alias fix, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
            LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS windowed_events  -- Missing this alias
    WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
      AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND next_timestamp - timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
ORDER BY timestamp;
```
