### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating a clear, structured, and accurate analysis that directly addresses the task's requirements. It identifies the correct compliant cases (1 and 4) and non-compliant cases (2, 3, and 5), with explanations that faithfully reference and interpret the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequencing rules for authorization, packaging, shipping, and cancellation). The distillation of rules in the summary is precise, logical, and comprehensive, resolving ambiguities (e.g., implying mandatory steps in the "happy path" like packaging before shipping) without overreaching. The format is readable and case-by-case, making it easy to follow.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are minor flaws that prevent a perfect 10.0:
- **Slight unclarity in phrasing for Case 3**: The "Questionable payment authorisation" point is accurate but hedges with "questionable" and "even if we tolerated," which introduces minor subjectivity instead of definitively framing it as a violation (the description implies direct branching to Cancel after Check for insufficient inventory, making authorization illogical/violative, not just questionable). This could be more assertive for precision.
- **Logical emphasis in Case 2**: The statement "Everything that follows is built on this wrong order" is a bit interpretive and assumes cascading invalidity without explicitly tying later steps (e.g., Ship after unauthorized Package) back to specific rules, though the core violation is correctly identified.
- **Omission of deeper ambiguity resolution**: The task notes potential ambiguities (e.g., "whether it’s ever acceptable to authorize payment before certain conditions"), and while the answer interprets well, it doesn't explicitly acknowledge or resolve this in Case 3's authorization step, missing a chance for fuller engagement.

These are very minor (no factual errors or major logical gaps), but per the strict instructions, they warrant a deduction from perfection. The answer is otherwise nearly flawless in accuracy, completeness, and fidelity to the description.
