10.0

The provided answer accurately identifies all key anomalies in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004, with precise references to timestamps and activities that deviate from standard P2P sequencing (e.g., payment before invoice/receipt, PO before requisition approval, goods receipt before PO issuance). It omits no major issues, correctly ignores the normal Case 1001, and provides logical, business-relevant explanations for the risks (financial exposure, control bypasses, unauthorized actions) without inaccuracies, ambiguities, or extraneous details. The structure is concise, focused, and directly addresses the task.
