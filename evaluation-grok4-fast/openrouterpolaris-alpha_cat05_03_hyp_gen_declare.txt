The provided answer is exemplary: it comprehensively identifies multiple layered anomalies (A1–A5) with precise explanations of conflicts (e.g., the core contradiction between mandatory C and forbidden E+C coexistence, rendering E effectively impossible), directly undermining the intended flow. Hypotheses (H1–H5) are insightful, varied, and plausibly linked to real-world modeling pitfalls without speculation overload. Verification strategies offer 8 targeted, syntactically correct PostgreSQL queries that align tightly with the schema (e.g., using TIMESTAMP for ordering, BOOL_OR for existence checks, LATERAL for precedence), covering all major anomalies plus insightful extensions (e.g., adjuster alignment, post-C activities). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; even minor details like query assumptions are explicitly noted. Structure is logical and self-contained, fully independent of the prompt.
