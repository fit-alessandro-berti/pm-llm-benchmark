The provided answer is exemplary: it systematically analyzes all cases with precise sequences, correctly identifies compliances and violations (e.g., Case 2's out-of-order packaging, Case 3's multiple issues including post-cancellation shipping and missing packaging, Case 5's skipped packaging), directly references the normative description's constraints (e.g., authorization before packaging, no shipping after cancellation, branching logic), and thoughtfully addresses ambiguities through clear interpretive principles without overreaching or introducing inconsistencies. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the summary reinforces the analysis concisely, fully meeting both tasks.
