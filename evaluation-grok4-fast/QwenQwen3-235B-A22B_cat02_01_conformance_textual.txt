The provided answer accurately identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as the violating cases, with precise explanations tied directly to the normative constraints (e.g., ordering of Authorize Payment and Package Items in Case 2; invalid post-authorization cancellation and post-cancellation shipping in Case 3; mandatory packaging before shipping in Case 5). Cases 1 and 4 are correctly noted as compliant. The structure is clear, the summary table reinforces key points without redundancy, and interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., no provision for post-authorization cancellation) logically align with the description's emphasis on branching solely after inventory check and absolute bans on fulfillment after cancellation. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
