The provided SQL query is logically correct, syntactically valid for DuckDB, and precisely fulfills the prompt's requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. It accurately computes event counts per `case_id` using aggregation, applies the correct filter (6 events) via `HAVING` to retain qualifying cases, and then retrieves the full event details for those cases via a subquery join. The use of a CTE is efficient and readable, `e.*` ensures all original columns are returned, and there are no unnecessary operations, assumptions about additional columns, or performance issues. No deductions are warranted, as it is entirely flawless.
