### Evaluation Rationale
The final Log Skeleton dictionary correctly structures the response as a Python dictionary with all required keys and appropriate set/dict values, accurately modeling the linear sequence of activities (RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP) using direct constraints. The `activ_freq` is flawless, enforcing exactly one occurrence per activity, which aligns perfectly with the mandatory, single-pass nature of the process. `never_together` as an empty set is correct, as no activities are mutually exclusive—all coexist in the same case. `directly_follows` correctly captures immediate successions without extras or misses.

However, deductions for inaccuracies and incompletenesses:
- **Equivalence**: Incomplete and arbitrary. All activities occur exactly once (per `activ_freq`), so every pair should have "the same occurrences" per the definition (e.g., ('RO', 'RI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('D', 'RP'), etc.). Limiting to only RO, CA, IC, RP ties unrelated groups (e.g., initial receiving vs. final invoicing/payment) without justification, ignoring mid-process activities like RI, PI, QC. This logically flaws the model by under-enforcing equivalence across the full process.
- **Always Before** and **Always After**: Limited to direct pairs, which is insufficient for a strict sequence. The definitions require enforcement for *all* relevant pairs, not just adjacent ones (e.g., Always After should include ('RO', 'RI'), ('RO', 'PI'), etc., as if RO occurs, RI/PI must follow after RO; similarly for Always Before, ('PI', 'RO') or ('PI', 'CA') to ensure if PI occurs, RO/CA preceded it). Direct-only risks allowing skips (e.g., RI after RO without CA) unless transitivity is assumed (not guaranteed in declarative Log Skeletons). This is a logical gap in fully modeling the "must be processed through a series" dependency chain.
- Minor: No enforcement of indirect branches or variations (e.g., could QC/PO order vary slightly?), but the scenario implies strict linearity, so this is neutral. Presentation is clear, but the equivalence selection introduces unclarity.

Overall, the core sequence is well-captured (70-80% effective), but the flaws in scope and completeness prevent a higher score under hypercritical standards—it's functional but not "nearly flawless."
