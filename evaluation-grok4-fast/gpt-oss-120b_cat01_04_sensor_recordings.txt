The provided answer performs an exemplary analysis of the event log, correctly identifying and grouping all events into logical phases based on observable patterns in the sensor data (e.g., temperature spikes for heat-intensive activities like cutting and welding, vibration increases for mechanical operations, tool position changes for progression, and energy fluctuations for power demands). The groupings are precise and sequential, aligning with timestamps: events 1-3 and 13-15 as idle (baseline readings), 4-6 as cutting (rising heat, vibration, flow, and tool advancement), 7-8 as assembling (stabilized moderate conditions with pressure increase and reduced flow/vibration), 9 as welding (peak heat, vibration, and energy with no flow), and 10-12 as inspection/cooling (declining heat, minimal activity, slight tool shift). Rationales are detailed, evidence-based, and directly tied to sensor trends, with no unsubstantiated claims—each explanation justifies the label through specific numeric correlations (e.g., "friction-generated heat" for cutting's 50-58°C rise). The output format is clear, using tables for phases, activities, and mappings, plus a concise process flow, fully meeting the task's requirements for labeled activities and deductions without omissions, ambiguities, or errors.
