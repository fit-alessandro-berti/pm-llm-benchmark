9.0

### Evaluation Summary
The provided SQL query is logically sound, correctly implements the required sequence detection using window functions (LEAD) to ensure direct succession without intervening events, accurately filters cases based on the >5-day condition between the specific events in the triplet, and excludes the entire cases as specified while returning all events from qualifying cases. The use of CTEs is clean and efficient for this purpose, and the final ordering by `case_id` and `timestamp` ensures a proper, readable result set as implied by the prompt's mention of "proper ... ordering."

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there is a notable inaccuracy in DuckDB-specific syntax: the function is written as `DATE_DIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp)`, but DuckDB uses `datediff('day', start, end)` (lowercase, no underscore). This would cause a syntax error and prevent the query from executing correctly in DuckDB, making it non-functional as-is. This is not a trivial oversight for a DuckDB-targeted query—it's a clear inaccuracy that undermines reliability, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise flawless logic and structure. Minor positives like the precise explanation do not fully offset this. A 10.0 would require zero such issues.
