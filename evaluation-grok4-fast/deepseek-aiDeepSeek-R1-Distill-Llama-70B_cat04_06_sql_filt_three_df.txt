The provided answer is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. The SQL query correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using row numbers and self-joins, computes the precise time difference for the relevant pair in each sequence instance (>5 days via timestamp subtraction and INTERVAL comparison, valid in DuckDB), and excludes all events from cases where at least one such sequence meets the timing condition via NOT IN. Handling of multiple sequences per case is accurate (excludes if any qualify). The CTE structure is logical and efficient, the explanation is clear and directly matches the code, and no ordering is mandated (though absent, it does not violate requirements). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; minor stylistic choices (e.g., joining c3 to c1 instead of chaining to c2) are equivalent and correct.
