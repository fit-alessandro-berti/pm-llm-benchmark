The provided answer accurately identifies all violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while correctly excluding non-violating ones (1 and 4). Explanations are precise, directly referencing normative constraints (e.g., order of authorization before packaging, prohibition on shipping after cancellation, requirement for packaging before shipping). Interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., inventory status in Case 3) are logically consistent with the description, noting inconsistencies without unfounded assumptions. Structure is clear, with violations itemized and summarized effectively. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
