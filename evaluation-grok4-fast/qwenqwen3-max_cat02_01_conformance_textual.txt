The provided answer is nearly flawless: it accurately identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with precise, evidence-based explanations that directly reference and interpret the normative description without introducing errors or unsupported assumptions. The structured breakdown of rules, case-by-case analysis, and summary are clear, logical, and comprehensive, resolving ambiguities (e.g., mutual exclusivity of paths) in a manner fully aligned with the text. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even the "immediately follow" phrasing in rules is contextually appropriate given the log's sequences.
