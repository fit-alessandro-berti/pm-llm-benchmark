The provided answer is exemplary: it accurately parses the normative description, correctly identifies the two primary flows (fulfillment and cancellation) and key constraints without introducing errors or over-interpretation. Each case is analyzed sequentially with precise sequences listed, violations tied directly to quoted or paraphrased norms (e.g., "Authorize payment should … occur … before packaging"), and verdicts logically derived. No inaccuracies (e.g., Case 3 correctly notes Authorize before Cancel as potentially inconsistent but not explicitly violative, focusing on the clear "no shipping after cancellation" rule). No unclarities (structure is methodical, with bolded verdicts and a concise summary). No logical flaws (e.g., Case 5 rightly flags the mandatory nature of Package as a precondition for Ship, per the description's "only after ... packaged is it appropriate"). It resolves ambiguities conservatively (e.g., no unfounded assumptions about "extraordinary circumstances") and fully addresses the task. This is as close to flawless as possible.
