The provided answer produces a list of 15 targeted, open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's goals. Each question effectively probes missing details (e.g., documentation specifics, accuracy in recording), decision criteria (e.g., manager assignment weighting, tenant prioritization), roles and responsibilities (e.g., compliance officer focus, financial analyst verification), timing and sequencing (e.g., scheduling visits, handling delays), and exception handling (e.g., failed inspections, custom clauses). All questions remain conceptual, avoiding any requests for SQL, code, or low-level implementation details, and they build logically on the described process without introducing inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. The structure is clear and comprehensive, ensuring deepened understanding without redundancy.
