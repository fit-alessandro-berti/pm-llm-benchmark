The provided code accurately and completely constructs the POWL model as described in the scenario. All required transitions are defined with correct labels (e.g., "D&R" preserves the ampersand). Partial orders for concurrent tasks (DA/ACI and QA/SA) are correctly implemented as StrictPartialOrder instances with no internal edges, ensuring concurrency. The loop (* (BNC, D&R)) uses Operator.LOOP with the proper children ordering (A=BNC for mandatory execution, B=D&R for optional retry). The exclusive choice (X (CD, MD)) uses Operator.XOR with the two deployment options. The root StrictPartialOrder encompasses all components, and the added edges precisely enforce the dependencies: SR  CS  (DA || ACI)  loop  choice  (QA || SA)  GLA, where composite nodes (POs, loop, choice) complete only after their internal execution finishes, aligning with POWL semantics for partial orders and operators. No extraneous elements (e.g., silents) are included, and the structure mirrors the example usage. The code is syntactically correct, imports are exact, and logically flawless with no ambiguities or omissions.
