The provided SQL solution is nearly flawless, accurately implementing all requirements of the prompt with precise logic, correct DuckDB syntax, and efficient structure using CTEs. It correctly identifies direct sequential patterns via ranking and joins, filters for the >5-day condition using DATE_DIFF, excludes only the qualifying "bad" cases via NOT IN, and returns all events from remaining cases with appropriate ordering. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even potential edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, timestamp ties in ranking) are handled appropriately per the problem's intent.
