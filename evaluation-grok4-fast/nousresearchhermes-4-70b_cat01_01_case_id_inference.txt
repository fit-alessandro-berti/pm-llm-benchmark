The provided answer accurately identifies three distinct cases based on patient demographics (age and gender as unique identifiers), departmental alignments, and chronological/logical sequencing of activities. All 18 events are correctly assigned without omissions, duplications, or misattributions: Case 1 (45M ER: events 1,4,7,12,15), Case 2 (62F ER: events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17), and Case 3 (28M Surgery: events 3,6,9,13,16,18). Each case demonstrates a coherent patient journey (e.g., registration to discharge with intermediate tests/treatments), with no temporal or attribute conflicts. The key observations succinctly justify the groupings using the event attributes, confirming parallel processing without cross-case interference. The presentation is structured, precise, and comprehensive, fully addressing the task.
