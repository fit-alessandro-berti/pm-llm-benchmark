The answer correctly identifies Group B as the log exhibiting bias, accurately attributing it to the +5 cultural fit boost for LocalBusinessLeadersClub affiliates, which is absent in Group A. The manifestation is clearly explained with relevant references to process steps and specific cases (e.g., U001 and U003 adjustments), highlighting how it compensates for potentially lower scores in other areas. Implications for fairness and equity are thoughtfully discussed, emphasizing systemic favoritism based on social capital over merit, with a practical recommendation for mitigation. The structure is logical, concise, and directly addresses the query.

Minor deductions for: (1) a slight factual imprecision in the example (attributing SkillScore=78 to boosted cases like U001/U003, whereas U001 is 80 and U003 is 75, with 78 belonging to the non-boosted U002); (2) interpretive phrasing like "tipping their final decision from 'Not Hired' to 'Hired,'" which infers causality without explicit log evidence of pre-boost outcomes, though this is a reasonable inference from the data. These are small issues but warrant a non-perfect score under hypercritical evaluation.
