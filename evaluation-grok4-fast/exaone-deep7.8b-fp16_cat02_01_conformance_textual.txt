The answer correctly identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violating the normative process while implicitly confirming Cases 1 and 4 as compliant. Explanations are precise, directly referencing the description's constraints (e.g., ordering of Authorize and Package; prohibition of fulfillment after Cancel; mandatory Package before Ship). Interpretations of branching logic are logically sound and resolve ambiguities without introducing errors (e.g., authorizing implies sufficient inventory, making subsequent cancel illogical). Structure is clear, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws in conclusions.
