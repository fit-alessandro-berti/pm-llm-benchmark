The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly constructs ordered sequences per case using ROW_NUMBER() on timestamp (with a reasonable tiebreaker on activity, as the prompt does not specify tie-handling), aggregates them into lists for variant representation, groups and counts variants accurately via string conversion (a valid and efficient method in DuckDB for sequence comparison), identifies the top K via ranked selection with deterministic ordering, filters cases precisely to those in the top variants, and returns the full original events for only those cases while excluding others. The final ordering enhances clarity without altering semantics. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; minor assumptions (e.g., activity-based tiebreaking) align with standard practices and do not deviate from the prompt. The query is concise, executable in DuckDB, and fully self-contained aside from the <K> placeholder.
