The provided solution accurately identifies cases with the required consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions, correctly filters for the >5 day condition on the specific timestamps within that sequence, excludes those cases entirely, and returns all events from the remaining cases. The query is syntactically valid for DuckDB, handles edge cases like multiple sequences per case by excluding if any qualifying sequence exists, and includes appropriate ordering as suggested in the prompt. The explanation reinforces the logic without introducing errors.
