### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong and aligns nearly flawlessly with the prompt's requirements. It produces a well-organized list of 14 targeted, open-ended questions that systematically probe key aspects of the process—roles and handoffs, decision criteria, sequencing/timing, exceptions, and quality checks—without venturing into prohibited areas like SQL or technical implementation. Each question is directly grounded in the provided process description, uncovering plausible gaps (e.g., thresholds for "outdated" documents, weighting of tenant factors, escalation paths) while seeking conceptual depth through phrases like "what is the precise point," "how are factors weighted," and "can you elaborate." The sectional structure enhances clarity without introducing redundancy or irrelevance, and all questions are logically sequenced to build understanding progressively. There are no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; even minor formatting quirks (e.g., subsection numbering) do not detract from the substantive excellence. This merits the maximum score for its precision, comprehensiveness, and fidelity to the task.
