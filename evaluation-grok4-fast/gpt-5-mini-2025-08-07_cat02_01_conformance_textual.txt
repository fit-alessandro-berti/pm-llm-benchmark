The provided answer is nearly flawless: it accurately identifies the compliant (1, 4) and violating cases (2, 3, 5) without omission or error; explanations are precise, directly reference and paraphrase the normative rules with fidelity; interpretations handle ambiguities logically and consistently (e.g., treating post-Check cancellation as signaling the insufficient-inventory branch, which aligns with the description's intent); structure is clear and comprehensive; no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist, even under hypercritical scrutiny—minor interpretive latitude in Case 3 is explicitly justified and rule-based, not speculative; the optional offer for extensions adds value without detracting.
