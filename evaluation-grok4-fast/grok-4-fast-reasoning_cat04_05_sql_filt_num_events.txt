This query precisely meets the requirements: it accurately groups by `case_id` to compute event counts, filters to retain only cases with 6 events using HAVING, and then joins back to retrieve the full events for those cases. The use of a CTE is efficient and readable, the INNER JOIN ensures correct filtering without data loss for qualifying cases, and `SELECT el.*` appropriately returns the complete event rows. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws; it is logically sound, standard SQL (compatible with DuckDB), and optimally structured without unnecessary computations or potential errors like incorrect aggregation or over-filtering.
