9.5

### Explanation of Grade
This is a strong, well-structured response that accurately identifies the deviating cases (2, 3, and 5) and non-deviating ones (1 and 4), with clear, text-referenced explanations for each violation. The distillation of rules in Step 1 effectively interprets the normative description without overstepping ambiguities, and the explanations in Step 3 directly tie to specific descriptive constraints (e.g., sequencing dependencies for packaging and shipping). The analysis is logical, comprehensive, and avoids unsubstantiated claims.

Minor deductions for:
- In Case 3's Violation 2, the explanation of "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" as a potential violation is interpretive but slightly stretches the description (which doesn't explicitly forbid it in an insufficient scenario, though it's illogical); it's flagged as secondary, so not a major flaw, but introduces minor unclarity in a hypercritical lens.
- The summary reiterates conclusions effectively but could be terser, though this doesn't impact accuracy.

Overall, it's nearly flawless in fidelity to the task, with no factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or overlooked violations.
