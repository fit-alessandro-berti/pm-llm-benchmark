### Evaluation Summary
This answer is nearly flawless under the strictest scrutiny. It directly fulfills the prompt by producing a targeted list of 14 open-ended questions that systematically probe the specified areas: missing details (e.g., Q1, Q5), decision criteria (e.g., Q3, Q6, Q7, Q8), roles and responsibilities (e.g., Q4, Q9, Q11), timing and sequencing (e.g., Q2, Q5, Q12), and exception handling (e.g., Q2, Q6, Q10). Each question is logically derived from the provided process description, avoids any request for SQL queries or technical implementation details, and focuses purely on conceptual clarification. There are no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws—the questions are precise, non-redundant, and progressively build depth without overlap or irrelevance. The optional closing sentence enhances the response without detracting from it, succinctly tying back to the goals. No minor issues detract; this is exhaustive yet concise, warranting the maximum score.
