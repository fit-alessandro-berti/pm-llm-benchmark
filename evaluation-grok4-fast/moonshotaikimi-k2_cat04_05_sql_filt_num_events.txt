10.0

The provided SQL query is correct, concise, and directly addresses the requirements without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. It properly uses a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING to identify qualifying case_ids (those with COUNT(*) <= 6), then filters the full event_log to return all events for those cases. This is standard, efficient SQL compatible with DuckDB, and the explanation is clear, accurate, and mirrors the query's mechanics without extraneous details. No minor issues are present; it is flawless.
