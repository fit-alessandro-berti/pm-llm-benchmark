6.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer is structured well, covers the required tasks (1: normative violations, 2: desiderata failures, 3: interpretations/justifications), and includes a clear summary table. It accurately identifies the out-of-order activities in Case 2 (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and the inappropriate Finalize Documentation after rejection, correctly deems Case 1 and Case 3 normatively compliant, and handles desiderata appropriately (e.g., Case 3's delays and missing follow-up; no desiderata issues in Cases 1-2 beyond what's already normative). Interpretations are reasonable and aligned with the problem's constraints, emphasizing process errors without overstepping. The clarification that desiderata violations are "suboptimal but not severe" is spot-on.

However, under utmost strictness, the answer has a critical flaw: It completely overlooks a major normative violation in Case 2—the entire absence of "Inform Applicant" after the Loan Decision. This skips a required sequence step (Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Close for rejections), directly contradicting the "Key Normative Constraints" and "What is Not Allowed" (no skipping activities). This omission undermines the completeness of Part 1 and propagates to the summary table, making the analysis inaccurate on a core element. Minor redundancies (e.g., referencing order in Case 2's desiderata section, where it's strictly normative) add slight unclarity but are not the primary deductor.

The answer is strong overall (accurate on ~85% of points) but not "nearly flawless" due to this logical gap, warranting a mid-range score rather than high (e.g., 8+).
