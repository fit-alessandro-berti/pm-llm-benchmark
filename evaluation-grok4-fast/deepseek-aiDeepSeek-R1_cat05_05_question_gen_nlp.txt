### Evaluation Rationale
The response delivers exactly 20 open-ended questions that are highly relevant to the described supply chain process, effectively probing insights (e.g., data analytics biases in Q8), potential issues (e.g., geopolitical risks in Q2), improvement strategies (e.g., diversification in Q2, adaptive buffers in Q5), and decision implications (e.g., trade-offs in shipping modes in Q4). All questions are thought-provoking, logically structured, and free of factual inaccuracies or logical flaws—they build directly on the process elements like international sourcing, logistics, compliance, and technology without introducing extraneous or closed-ended elements. No SQL queries are present, adhering to the core instruction.

Minor deductions stem from non-essential additions: the introductory phrase ("Here are 20 thought-provoking...") and the concluding sentence, which slightly deviate from the strict directive to "just list the questions." These are verbose flourishes that, while not incorrect or unclear, introduce unrequested framing, warranting a small penalty under hypercritical scrutiny. The questions themselves are nearly flawless in coverage, depth, and openness, justifying a high score despite this.
