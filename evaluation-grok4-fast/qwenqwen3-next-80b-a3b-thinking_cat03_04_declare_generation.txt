### Evaluation Notes (Hypercritical Analysis)
- **Strengths (leading to high score)**: The final dictionary includes all required keys exactly as specified in the prompt. The structure for unary constraints (existence, absence, exactly_one, init) is precise: single activities as keys with correct nested dicts containing 'support': 1.0 and 'confidence': 1.0. Absence is appropriately empty. Init correctly limits to 'IG'. For binary constraints, tuples (e.g., ("IG", "DD")) are used consistently, correcting the prompt's logical error (which implied single activities, impossible for constraints like response). All support/confidence values are 1.0 as expected. Constraints logically fit the scenario: response/precedence/succession pairs capture the sequential flow (e.g., IG  DD  TFC/CE  PC); coexistence handles parallels (TFC/CE, LT/UT) well; chain variants focus on plausible immediate steps (AG  MP  FL) without overreach. Empty dicts for unused/unneeded keys (e.g., alt*, non*) are correct, avoiding fabrication.
- **Minor Issues (deducting 0.5)**: Coexistence includes sequential pairs (AG-MP, MP-FL), which is technically valid (both must occur) but redundant since response/precedence already enforces it, and coexistence ignores order—slightly unclear/unoptimized modeling, though not logically flawed. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws; the model is comprehensive yet faithful to the process description. If coexistence were limited to true parallels, it would be flawless.
