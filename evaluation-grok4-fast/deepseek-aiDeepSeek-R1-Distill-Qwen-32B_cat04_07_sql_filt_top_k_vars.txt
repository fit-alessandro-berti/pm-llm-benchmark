9.5

### Grading Rationale
The provided solution is nearly flawless in its structure, logic, and adherence to the prompt's requirements, earning a very high score. It correctly uses CTEs to break down the problem into logical steps: extracting ordered sequences per case via `array_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` (accurate for defining variants), counting frequencies, selecting top K variants via `ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT K`, and joining back to filter and return all relevant events from `event_log` while excluding non-top-K cases. This fully satisfies the four task components without aggregation errors, ordering issues, or unintended data leakage. DuckDB compatibility is strong (`array_agg` works as expected).

Minor deductions (0.5 points total) for hypercritical scrutiny:
- **Placeholder for K**: The SQL uses literal `K` in `LIMIT K`, which is invalid syntax without parameterization (e.g., DuckDB supports `:K` or session variables, but it's not implemented). This is a small presentation flaw, as the prompt treats K as a variable, but it could cause runtime errors if executed as-is.
- **Tie-handling ambiguity**: In cases of frequency ties, `LIMIT K` may arbitrarily select variants due to unstable sorting without a secondary `ORDER BY` (e.g., on sequence itself). The prompt implies frequency-based ranking, but this nondeterminism is a subtle logical edge case, though not explicitly required.

No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: sequences are correctly ordered and compared as arrays, joins preserve all event details without duplication, and the output matches the exact requirement (events from top-K cases only). The explanation reinforces but does not detract from the code.
