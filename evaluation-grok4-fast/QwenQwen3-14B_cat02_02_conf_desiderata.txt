7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The answer is structured well, directly addressing all three tasks with clear sections, bullet points, and a summary table for readability. It correctly identifies the core normative violations in Case 2 (out-of-order activities and post-rejection finalization) and confirms no such issues in Case 3. Desiderata deviations are appropriately distinguished as suboptimal rather than severe, with accurate timing calculations for Case 3. Interpretations are provided as requested and remain neutral/reasonable without overstepping. The summary table effectively consolidates findings.

However, deductions are warranted for the following issues, evaluated hypercritically:
- **Inaccuracy in normative violation description (major flaw, -1.5):** For Case 2, the bullet states "*Credit Check performed before Risk Assessment.*" followed by an explanation that correctly describes the reverse (Risk Assessment at 08:20 before Credit Check at 09:00). This contradictory wording creates confusion and misstates the violation in the header, undermining logical clarity in the final conclusions. Even if the explanation clarifies it, the initial phrasing is a factual error.
- **Unjustified assumption on desiderata for Case 2 (minor but notable overreach, -0.5):** Attributing a "Missing Follow-up Call" to Case 2 is speculative. The event log lacks any entry for it (as with Case 1), but the user's tabular data *explicitly notes* this only for Case 3 via "*(No Follow-up Call)*". Treating it as a violation for Case 2 infers absence without evidence, potentially confusing desiderata application. While the desiderata encourage the call, the answer should align strictly with provided data highlights.
- **Incomplete coverage of Case 1 (minor unclarity, -0.5):** Case 1 is not discussed in the main sections (only implied in the table as "None"). The task involves three cases from the log; explicitly confirming compliance (normative and desiderata) would make it more comprehensive, especially since Case 1's log also lacks a Follow-up Call entry (though not flagged by the user).
- **Hypercritical note on desiderata clarification:** The answer states deviations "are not a normative violation" and frames them as "deviation from the recommended best practice," which aligns with the task's emphasis on non-severity. However, it could more explicitly reiterate "these are considered 'desiderata' rather than hard rules" per the prompt for perfect adherence—no logical flaw, but misses a chance for verbatim reinforcement.

The answer is strong overall (accurate on 80-90% of content, corrects any <think> ambiguities in finals), but the misphrasing and assumption prevent a near-flawless score. A 10.0 would require zero such errors.
