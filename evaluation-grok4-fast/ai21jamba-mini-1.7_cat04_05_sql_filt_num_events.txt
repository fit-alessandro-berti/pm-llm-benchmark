7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This proposed draft prompt is a solid refinement of the original, improving readability and structure through numbered objectives, explicit column mentions in the output description, and emphasis on key SQL concepts like grouping and filtering. It maintains the core intent of testing the ability to write a correct DuckDB SQL query for case-based event filtering, while providing clear context about the table and columns. The addition of descriptive phrases (e.g., for `activity` and `timestamp`) enhances clarity without over-explaining, leaving appropriate room for SQL expertise as noted.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several minor but notable flaws prevent a higher score:
- **Inaccuracy in column handling**: The original prompt specifies the table has "at least" the listed columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`), implying potential additional columns, and the goal is to "return the full set of events" (i.e., all columns for filtered rows). The proposed version shifts to "includes the following key columns" and explicitly states the output "should include all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`)", which ambiguously suggests these are the *only* columns or limits the output to them. This could mislead respondents into writing a query that omits other possible columns (e.g., via `SELECT *` or full row selection), introducing a logical flaw in fidelity to the original task. In a benchmark context, this risks evaluating incomplete solutions as correct.
- **Unclarity in output scope**: The phrase "full details of the events" is strong, but immediately qualified by the parenthetical column list, creating subtle tension. It doesn't explicitly encourage returning *all* table columns (as `SELECT * FROM ...` would), which the original implies via "full set of events." This could result in varied interpretations, reducing benchmark consistency.
- **Minor stylistic/logical tweaks without justification**: Changes like "Your task: Please craft..." to "Your objective is to: [numbered list]" are improvements for flow, but the numbering slightly over-structures the task, potentially guiding the thought process too explicitly (e.g., step 1 mirrors the needed subquery logic). While not a flaw, it borders on hand-holding, which might dilute the test of independent SQL reasoning.
- **No explicit handling of edge cases**: Neither prompt addresses potential issues like ties, NULLs, or timestamp ordering, but the proposed version's added guidance on "filtered set of events for each valid case" is fine—yet it doesn't elevate beyond the original, missing an opportunity for stricter precision (e.g., confirming ORDER BY timestamp if needed, though not required).

These issues are not catastrophic but are significant enough in a strict benchmark context to warrant deductions: the column ambiguity alone is a logical inconsistency that could invalidate query validations. A nearly flawless version would preserve the "at least" nuance, specify "all original columns" without listing, and avoid any prescriptive overreach. At 7.5, this earns credit for overall polish and utility but falls short of perfection.
