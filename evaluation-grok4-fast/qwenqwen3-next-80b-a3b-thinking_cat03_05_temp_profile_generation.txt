The provided final answer is a valid Python dictionary that meets all requirements. It includes a representative subset of 12 activity pairs, with a mix of direct consecutive pairs (e.g., ('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC')) and non-consecutive pairs separated by multiple steps (e.g., ('SS', 'PT') spanning five intermediate activities, ('RC', 'DT') spanning six). The keys use correct tuple format with activity labels from the scenario. The values are tuples of positive integers representing estimated average times and standard deviations in seconds, with logical consistency (e.g., cumulative times align, such as 1,296,000 for 15 days in ('SS', 'RC') approximating the sum of shorter intervals, and standard deviations scaling appropriately with process complexity). No syntax errors, no extraneous elements, and no deviations from the specified structure.
