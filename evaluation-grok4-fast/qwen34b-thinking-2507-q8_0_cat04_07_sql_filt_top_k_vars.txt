The provided answer delivers a precise, complete, and logically sound DuckDB SQL query that fully addresses all specified requirements without inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. The use of CTEs efficiently structures the sequencing, grouping, counting, top-K selection, and filtering steps. The array_agg with ORDER BY timestamp correctly captures ordered sequences per case_id; grouping by the array identifies unique variants; counting and LIMIT K select top variants by frequency; and the final IN subquery accurately filters the original event_log to return only events from the relevant cases. The explanation is concise, accurate, and reinforces the query's correctness. The placeholder K aligns perfectly with the prompt's "top K" phrasing, treating it as a parameterizable element suitable for a benchmark query. No penalties apply, as the solution is flawless.
