The provided answer is exemplary: it accurately distills the normative logic without introducing extraneous assumptions, methodically evaluates each case against the described constraints (resolving any interpretive ambiguities, such as path exclusivity and strict sequencing, in favor of the explicit guidelines), identifies the correct violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with precise, evidence-based explanations tied to the textual description, and avoids any logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. The structure enhances readability, and the summary reinforces the analysis without redundancy. No deviations from the task or the process rules are overlooked, rendering it flawless under strict scrutiny.
