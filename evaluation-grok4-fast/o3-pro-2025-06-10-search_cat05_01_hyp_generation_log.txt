### Evaluation Rationale
This "answer" (the reusable prompt) is an exceptionally well-crafted tool that directly and comprehensively addresses the core requirements of the underlying task: encouraging a target LLM to identify anomalies in the event log, hypothesize root causes, and propose investigative SQL queries without providing any hints, guidance, or pre-solved elements. It is open-ended, data-driven, and structured to elicit high-quality, independent reasoning from the LLM. The tone is professional and audit-ready, aligning perfectly with the constraints.

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Completeness and Alignment**: The prompt mirrors the target objectives precisely. Section A covers anomaly detection (inspection, description, explanation of divergence, and business impact). Section B handles root-cause hypotheses (plausible reasons, ranking/categorization, assumptions). Section C focuses on SQL proposals (one or more per anomaly/hypothesis, PostgreSQL-valid, executable, with comments—no results or execution). No extraneous elements; it sticks to the schema, tables, and example data provided.
- **Open-Endedness and Independence**: Phrases like "Without receiving any additional guidance," "rely on your own reasoning," and "Do not provide canned solutions" explicitly resist hinting at specific anomalies (e.g., it doesn't mention out-of-order events in case_id 1002 or missing credit checks). This encourages genuine analysis based solely on the data.
- **Structure and Usability**: The output format (headings, numbering for traceability) ensures clarity and traceability. Constraints reinforce data-driven thinking (e.g., "Do not reveal or rely on any information beyond what is in the schema and example rows," "Avoid speculative accusations"). It's concise yet precise, making it easy to copy-paste and use with any LLM.
- **Technical Precision**: SQL instructions specify PostgreSQL syntax, valid references to provided columns/tables, and use of placeholders (e.g., for dynamic filtering). It promotes investigative depth (e.g., "gather evidence, measure frequency, confirm the issue") without over-specifying.
- **Professionalism**: Maintains an objective, neutral tone; marks assumptions clearly; focuses on business impacts and plausible causes (e.g., policy violations, system glitches).

**Hypercritical Deductions (Minor Flaws Preventing a Perfect 10.0):**
- **Formatting Nitpick**: In the "happy path" description, the bullet points are inconsistently rendered as "• Register Order  Perform Credit Check..." (concatenated without line breaks or proper spacing between activities). This could cause minor readability confusion in plain text (e.g., appears as one run-on sentence). While not a logical flaw, it's a small presentation issue that might slightly hinder parsing in some LLM interfaces—deducting 0.2 for polish.
- **Assumption Clarity**: The prompt says "note any assumptions you are making" in B, but doesn't explicitly require marking them in A or C (though implied). This is a tiny gap in exhaustiveness, as anomalies/impacts might embed unstated assumptions—deducting 0.0 further, as it's not unclear or flawed.
- No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities: All elements are precise, executable, and free of contradictions. Hypotheses are framed as "plausible" and "data-driven," avoiding speculation. No over-reliance on external knowledge.

Overall, this is nearly flawless—rigorous, effective, and directly solvable for the task. A 10.0 would require pixel-perfect formatting and zero implied gaps, but it's exemplary for practical use.
