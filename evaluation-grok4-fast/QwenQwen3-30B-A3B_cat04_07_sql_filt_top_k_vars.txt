The provided SQL query is a complete, correct, and efficient implementation that fully addresses all requirements of the prompt. It accurately constructs ordered activity sequences per case using `array_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, groups and counts variants by these sequences, identifies the top K via ordering and limiting, and filters the original event log to return only events from qualifying cases. DuckDB-specific features like array handling in `GROUP BY` and `IN` clauses are appropriately utilized, preserving order and equality comparisons. The structure with CTEs is clear, avoids redundancy (e.g., by joining back to compute sequences only once), and handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., fewer than K variants). The accompanying explanation reinforces correctness without introducing errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
