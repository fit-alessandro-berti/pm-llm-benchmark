The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, well-structured list of 22 open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's objectives. They systematically probe missing details (e.g., documentation handling, exception management), decision criteria (e.g., workload quantification, tenant selection metrics), roles and responsibilities (e.g., photographer selection, department coordination), timing and sequencing (e.g., bottlenecks, audit frequency), and exception handling (e.g., landlord refusals, custom clauses). The categorization enhances clarity without introducing redundancies or off-topic elements. No requests for SQL queries or implementation details appear; even references to "tools" or "data sources" remain conceptual, focusing on process integration and decision-making rather than technical specifics. The questions are logically sequenced, free of inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws, and effectively build on the described process to elicit deeper insights.
