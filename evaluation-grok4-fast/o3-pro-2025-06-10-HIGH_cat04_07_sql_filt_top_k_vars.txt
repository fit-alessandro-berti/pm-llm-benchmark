### Evaluation Rationale
This submission is nearly flawless and fully addresses the prompt's requirements with precision, clarity, and logical correctness. It constructs a single, self-contained DuckDB SQL query using CTEs that systematically:
1. Extracts ordered activity sequences per `case_id` via `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` in the `per_case` CTE, correctly representing variants as delimited strings (the double-space delimiter is innocuous and preserves uniqueness without issues, even if activity names contain spaces).
2. Groups by variant, counts cases, and selects the top K via `ORDER BY n_cases DESC LIMIT` in `variant_stats`, accurately identifying frequent variants.
3. Filters to cases in top K variants in `top_cases` by joining back to `per_case`, ensuring only relevant `case_id`s are retained.
4. Returns all original events (`e.*`) for those cases, excluding others, with an optional but helpful `ORDER BY` for output readability.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws exist: the query is efficient, handles ordering correctly, avoids unnecessary complexity (e.g., no over-reliance on window functions), and assumes standard event log properties (e.g., unique timestamps per event or stable ordering for ties, as unspecified). The configurable `params` CTE and block-specific explanations enhance usability without deviating from the task. Ties in frequency are handled implicitly by SQL's deterministic LIMIT after ORDER BY, which aligns with the prompt's unspecified tie-breaking needs. Overall, it is executable, correct, and exemplary.
