The provided answer is exemplary in its accuracy, clarity, and logical structure, demonstrating a deep understanding of the normative description while resolving its minor ambiguities through direct, evidence-based interpretation (e.g., treating "should" and "only after" as prescriptive constraints on sequence and presence of activities). It correctly identifies the deviating cases (2, 3, and 5) without false positives or omissions, references specific textual elements for each violation, and explains the deviations with precision and relevance—no inaccuracies, overinterpretations, or unaddressed logical gaps. Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spaces instead of arrows in sequences) are negligible and do not impede comprehension, as the bolding and context make everything unambiguous. The response fully meets the task requirements without extraneous content, making it effectively flawless under strict scrutiny.
