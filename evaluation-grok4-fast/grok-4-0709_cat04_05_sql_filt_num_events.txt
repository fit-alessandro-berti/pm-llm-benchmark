### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness of Logic (High Marks)**: The query accurately identifies cases with 6 events using a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`), which assigns the per-case count to every row in that case. The `WHERE` clause then correctly filters out all rows from cases exceeding 6 events, returning only the qualifying events. This achieves the exact goal of grouping, counting, filtering cases, and returning their events. No logical flaws here—it's efficient and leverages SQL windowing appropriately for DuckDB.

- **SQL Syntax and Compatibility (High Marks)**: Valid DuckDB SQL. The CTE is properly structured, window function is supported, and the query executes without errors assuming the table schema.

- **Completeness of Output (Deduction)**: The prompt specifies returning the "full set of events" from qualifying cases, and the table has "at least" the listed columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`), implying potential additional columns (e.g., other attributes common in event logs like `resource` or `status`). Using `*` in the CTE captures all columns, but the final `SELECT` explicitly lists only three, discarding any others. This is incomplete and fails to deliver the "full" events if extras exist—a minor but clear inaccuracy per the "at least" qualifier. A flawless version would use `SELECT *` in the final output to ensure completeness.

- **Clarity and Efficiency (High Marks)**: Well-formatted, readable CTE with descriptive alias (`event_count`). Avoids unnecessary subqueries or joins; window function is performant for this filtering task. No redundancies or overcomplications.

- **Adherence to Requirements (Minor Deduction)**: Fully addresses grouping (`PARTITION BY case_id`), counting, filtering (>6 events excluded), and returning events. No extraneous output (e.g., no aggregate summary added). However, the explicit column list (vs. `*`) ties into the completeness issue above, making it not "nearly flawless."

Overall, this is a strong, functional solution with one avoidable flaw in output scope, warranting a high-but-not-maximal score under hypercritical scrutiny. A perfect 10.0 would select `*` for guaranteed fullness.
