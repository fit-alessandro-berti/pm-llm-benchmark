The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and clear SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it identifies cases with 6 events via a grouped subquery with HAVING, then filters the full event set using IN, returning all events (via SELECT *) for qualifying cases only. The explanation accurately breaks down the logic without errors or ambiguities, and the key features section reinforces correctness without overclaiming (e.g., efficiency is reasonably described as using grouping and semi-join, which aligns with standard optimizations). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; the solution is concise yet comprehensive and handles the task flawlessly.
