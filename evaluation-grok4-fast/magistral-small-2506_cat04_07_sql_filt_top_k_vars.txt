The provided SQL query fully and correctly addresses all specified requirements without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`, aggregates these into variant strings via `STRING_AGG` grouped by `case_id` (maintaining order via the position), counts cases per variant, ranks and limits to the top K via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT ?`, identifies qualifying `case_id`s through a join, and returns all events from the original `event_log` for those cases only (via a join excluding non-top-K cases), with an appropriate final ordering. The parameterization of K and the overall structure are precise and efficient for DuckDB.
