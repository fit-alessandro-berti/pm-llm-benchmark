The provided answer is comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured, directly addressing all task components without inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It correctly identifies normative violations solely in Case 2 (with precise explanations of ordering reversal, skipped Inform Applicant step, prohibited finalization post-rejection, and invalid closure logic) while confirming compliance in Cases 1 and 3. For desiderata, it appropriately notes suboptimal failures across cases (e.g., universal lack of Follow-up Call, Case 3's confirmed timing delays >24/48 hours, Case 1's isolated Follow-up omission, and Case 2's partial compliance on Credit Check timing despite normative issues), emphasizing their non-severe nature. Interpretations offer plausible, constraint-aligned justifications (e.g., operational delays for Case 3, human error for Case 2) without speculation or overreach. Tables enhance clarity, and explanations are concise yet thorough.
