### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, with accurate identification of deviating cases (2, 3, and 5) and a logical, structured explanation that effectively distills and applies the normative rules. The case-by-case analysis is clear, comprehensive, and directly references the description's constraints (e.g., sequencing, mutual exclusivity of branches). It resolves ambiguities reasonably by interpreting the branches as strictly mutually exclusive and emphasizing post-check ordering.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor inaccuracies and unclarities prevent a perfect score:
- **Case 3 explanation**: The phrasing "Authorize payment appears beforehand" is imprecise and potentially confusing—it implies Authorize precedes the branch entry, but the sequence is Check  Authorize  Cancel, so Authorize occurs *after* Check but initiates an invalid mix of branches. While the intent (violation of mutual exclusivity) is captured via Rule C, this wording introduces a logical flaw in sequencing description.
- **Case 5 explanation**: Citing Rule D-2 ("Package items may occur only after Authorize payment") as violated is inaccurate, as D-2 governs when Package *can* occur, but the issue is Package's *absence*, which indirectly violates prerequisites for Ship (better tied solely to D-3). This is a minor misattribution but represents an unnecessary stretch.
- **General**: The rule distillation (A–D) is excellent and faithful to the text, but Rule B ("before anything else") slightly overstates by omitting the explicit "after Receive order" precondition, though this doesn't impact analysis. No major omissions (e.g., all cases covered, Close as final verified implicitly).

These are small issues—mostly phrasing and citation precision—but per instructions, they warrant deduction from flawless (10.0). The answer is otherwise exemplary: no factual errors in case identification, no overlooked violations (e.g., correctly flags Ship after Cancel in Case 3), and explanations are concise yet thorough without speculation.
