The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and precise DuckDB SQL query that fully satisfies the requirements. It accurately identifies cases via consecutive row-numbered events matching the exact sequence, filters those with a time difference exceeding 5 days using valid DuckDB interval syntax, and excludes all events from such cases while returning the rest. The CTE structure is logical, the self-joins ensure direct succession with no intervening events, and the use of DISTINCT handles multiple sequences per case appropriately (excluding the case if any qualifying sequence exists). Edge cases like short cases or non-qualifying sequences are implicitly handled correctly. The notes appropriately acknowledge a minor assumption about timestamp uniqueness without introducing errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the query is executable and produces the exact intended result set without unnecessary ordering (as none is specified in the prompt).
