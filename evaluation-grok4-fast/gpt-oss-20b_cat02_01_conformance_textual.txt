The answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and well-structured, correctly identifying violations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 while clearing Cases 1 and 4, with precise references to the normative description and sound interpretations of implied constraints (e.g., authorizing payment before cancellation in Case 3 as a violation given the cancellation's implication of insufficient inventory). The partial ordering formalization is precise and aids clarity without introducing errors. Minor deduction for slight verbosity in the table's phrasing (e.g., redundant emphasis on "both" constraints in Case 2, though factually correct) and the optional use of LaTeX, which, while effective, is not strictly necessary for this textual analysis task. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities mar the final conclusions.
