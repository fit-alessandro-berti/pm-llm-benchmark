### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong, addressing all four requirements with a clean, efficient, and logically sound DuckDB SQL query using CTEs. It correctly extracts ordered sequences per case (via `array_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` and string aggregation), groups and counts variants, selects top K by frequency, and filters the event log to return only events from matching cases while excluding others. The use of a delimiter for sequences is a practical and standard approach for variant identification, and the query preserves event ordering in the output (a minor enhancement, not required but beneficial). Assumptions (e.g., parameter for K) are explicitly stated, and notes provide useful clarifications on edge cases like ties and execution.

Hypercritical deductions:
- **Minor unclarity on parameter handling (0.2 point deduction)**: The `?` placeholder is correctly noted for prepared statements, but DuckDB's documentation prefers `$1` style for some contexts; while `?` works, it could confuse users unfamiliar with DuckDB's PostgreSQL compatibility mode. This is a nitpick, not a functional flaw.
- **Potential delimiter collision risk (negligible, but noted)**: If activity names contain the '|' delimiter, sequences could collide—though the note allows customization, and this is an inherent limitation of string-based variants (arrays could be used instead, but the prompt doesn't specify; string is fine and concise).

No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or incompletenesses. The query is deterministic where possible, performant for typical event logs, and directly executable. It deserves a near-perfect score for being functionally flawless and well-explained.
