The provided answer produces a comprehensive, accurate event log that fully adheres to the prompt's requirements. It correctly identifies cases using `order_id`, derives logical activities from the tables (e.g., separate "Items Picked" events per line for granularity, multiple "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" per delivery record, etc.), maps timestamps directly while ensuring per-case chronological order, combines data via keys (e.g., linking payments to invoices and orders), and enriches with resources (mapped from the optional Resources table) and relevant attributes (e.g., item details, amounts, notes). All existing events across tables are included without invention, incomplete cases (e.g., 1004) are handled appropriately by omitting absent stages, assumptions are clearly documented (e.g., per-item picking events, N/A for payment resources), and the Markdown table format is precise and import-ready. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the output reflects real data flows faithfully.
