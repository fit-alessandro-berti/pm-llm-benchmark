9.5

The final list delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that directly align with the supply chain process described, covering key areas like sourcing, logistics, compliance, technology, risk management, and sustainability. They emphasize insights, issues, strategies, and implications without introducing irrelevant elements or SQL queries. Phrasing is clear and engaging, prompting deeper analysis. Minor deductions for the bolded category titles (unnecessary embellishment beyond a plain list) and one slightly compound question (e.g., #5 combining two sub-ideas, risking minor unclarity), but these do not undermine the overall quality or relevance.
