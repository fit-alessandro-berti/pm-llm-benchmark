1.0

This "answer" is not an answer at all—it is merely a verbatim repetition of the original request/prompt provided in the query, without any substantive content, analysis, or response to the DECLARE model's description, step-by-step process explanation, constraint discussions, real-world motivations, or speculation on consequences. It fails to engage with the prompt in any meaningful way, exhibiting zero relevance, accuracy, clarity, or logical structure. Under hypercritical evaluation, this is a complete non-response, warranting the minimum score for total inadequacy.
