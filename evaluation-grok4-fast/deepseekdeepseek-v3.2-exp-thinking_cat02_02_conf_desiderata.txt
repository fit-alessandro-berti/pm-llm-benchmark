### Evaluation Rationale

This answer is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a thorough, accurate, and well-structured analysis that directly addresses all three tasks with precision. It correctly identifies normative violations (e.g., Case 2's reversed order, unauthorized Finalize Documentation, and missing Inform Applicant) and desiderata deviations (e.g., Case 3's timing delays and all cases' lack of Follow-up Call), while clearly distinguishing their severity levels. Explanations reference specific rules and log timestamps, calculations are precise (e.g., ~49 and ~51 hours for Case 3), and justifications are insightful without speculating beyond the provided context. The addition of an "Overall Insights" section enhances completeness without straying from the task.

Hypercritical deductions: 
- Minor unclarity in Case 2's desiderata section: While it correctly notes that normative issues overshadow desiderata, it briefly assesses Credit Check timing as "acceptable" without explicitly stating that the missing Inform Applicant prevents full desiderata evaluation—this could be tighter but does not introduce error.
- No explicit summary sentence at the end of section 1 listing "Cases 1 and 3 compliant, Case 2 non-compliant," though per-case clarity compensates fully.
- Recommendations in section 3 (e.g., training, monitoring) are helpful but slightly interpretive beyond "suggest interpretations or justifications," potentially bordering on expansion; however, they align closely with the task.

These are negligible issues in an otherwise flawless response, warranting only a slight deduction from perfection.
