**Grade: 2.0**

The provided answer is severely incomplete, consisting only of a brief introductory heading and a partial sentence for Task 1 without any actual content, data, analysis, or conclusions for Tasks 1–3. This fails to address the core requirements of identifying cases with longer times, determining root causes (e.g., escalations, waiting times), explaining their impact on cycle times, or offering recommendations. No calculations, patterns, or insights are presented, rendering the response non-functional and logically void. Even minor completion would warrant a slightly higher score, but this level of truncation is a critical deficiency, justifying the minimal grade under strict evaluation.
