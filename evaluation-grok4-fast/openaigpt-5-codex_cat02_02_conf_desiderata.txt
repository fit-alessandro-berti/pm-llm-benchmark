### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is exceptionally well-structured, directly addressing all three task components with clear tables for normative and desiderata analysis, followed by thoughtful interpretations. It accurately identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator, correctly explaining the out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check, the missing mandatory "Inform Applicant" step (which applies regardless of approval/rejection), and the prohibited Finalize Documentation after rejection. For Cases 1 and 3, it rightly deems them normatively compliant, with precise sequence validation. Desiderata coverage is strong: it distinguishes soft violations (e.g., timings, missing follow-up calls) without overstating severity, calculates intervals accurately (e.g., Case 3's ~51-hour inform delay), and notes interdependencies like Case 2's uncheckable inform timing due to normative failure. Interpretations are balanced, offering plausible justifications (e.g., workload for delays) and practical suggestions (e.g., training emphasis), aligning with the task's call for "coaching hints."

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Comprehensiveness and Accuracy**: Covers all log events without omission or fabrication. Normative explanations tie directly to rules (e.g., no skipping, no reversal, decision logic). Desiderata framed as "suboptimal" per instructions.
- **Clarity and Organization**: Tables enhance readability; summary reinforces key points without redundancy. Language is precise, professional, and insightful.
- **Logical Flow**: No contradictions; builds from facts to analysis to recommendations.

**Deductions (Hypercritical Assessment - Minor Flaws Only):**
- **Incomplete Nuance in Case 2 Normative Explanation (0.5-point deduction)**: While the ordering breach (Risk before Credit) is correctly flagged, it does not explicitly note the downstream implication that no valid Risk Assessment occurred *after* Credit Check before Decision, effectively skipping the required Credit  Risk  Decision chain. This is a subtle logical gap—the violation is captured via ordering, but a hyper-detailed breakdown would highlight the full sequence failure for completeness. Not a major error, but under strict scrutiny, it misses an opportunity for exhaustive rule-mapping.
- **Slight Overgeneralization in Case 2 Desiderata (0.3-point deduction)**: Stating "Timing recommendations were met (credit check happened within an hour)" is technically true relative to application receipt but glosses over how the normative sequencing violation (premature Risk) undermines any "met" timing for the Risk step itself. This creates minor unclarity in isolating desiderata from normative issues, though it's not inaccurate.
- **Absence of Explicit Justification for Missing Follow-Up in All Cases (0.0-point deduction, but noted)**: Interpretations suggest reasons (e.g., "already sufficiently informed"), but could tie desiderata more tightly to each case's context (e.g., Case 1's efficiency implying no need). This is nitpicky and not flawed, so no further deduction.

Overall, the answer is nearly flawless—insightful, error-free in core facts, and task-aligned—but the hypercritical lens demands docking for the subtle incompleteness in Case 2's sequencing analysis, preventing a perfect 10.0. A score below 9 would be unjustified given the response's overall excellence.
