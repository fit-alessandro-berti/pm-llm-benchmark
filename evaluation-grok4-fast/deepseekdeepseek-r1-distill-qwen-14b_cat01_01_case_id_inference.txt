The provided answer correctly identifies and groups all 18 events into three distinct, coherent cases based on matching patient demographics (age, gender), departmental consistency, resource alignments, and chronological activity flows. Each case follows a logical hospital process sequence (e.g., registration  triage/consultation  diagnostics/procedures  discharge), with no events misplaced, omitted, or duplicated. The presentation is clear, structured, and directly addresses the task without extraneous content in the final conclusions.
