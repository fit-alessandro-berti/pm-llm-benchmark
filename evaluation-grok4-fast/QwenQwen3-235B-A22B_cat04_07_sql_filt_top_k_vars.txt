### Evaluation Rationale

This answer provides a correct, complete, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that fully addresses all four requirements of the prompt. The use of `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` accurately captures the ordered activity sequence per `case_id`, grouping by `variant` correctly identifies unique process variants, the `COUNT(*)` with `ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10` properly ranks and selects the top K by frequency (with a clear note for parameterization), and the `INNER JOIN`s effectively filter the original `event_log` to return only events from cases in the top K variants, excluding others as required. Array equality in the `JOIN` condition is valid in DuckDB, and the query avoids row duplication while preserving all original columns via `SELECT el.*`.

The structure is logical, with CTEs building progressively, and no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities in the final query or conclusions. The minor deduction (0.2 points) is for hardcoding `10` instead of using a DuckDB variable (e.g., `SET k_var = 10; LIMIT k_var`) or placeholder (e.g., `?`), which would make it more flexible for arbitrary K without manual replacement— a small but notable improvement for strict parameterization. No other issues; explanatory notes enhance clarity without detracting.
