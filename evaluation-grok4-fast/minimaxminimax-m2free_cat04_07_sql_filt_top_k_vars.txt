9.2

### Grading Rationale
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem, correct use of DuckDB-specific features (e.g., `ARRAY_AGG` with `ORDER BY`, window functions like `RANK()`, and array equality for grouping), and a logical, modular structure via CTEs. It fully addresses all requirements: extracting ordered sequences per case, grouping/counting variants, ranking for top K, filtering cases, and returning original events. The explanation is thorough, breaking down each CTE and usage notes, which enhances clarity.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor flaws prevent a perfect score:
- **Placeholder for K**: The query uses a literal `K` in `WHERE rank <= K`, which would cause a syntax error if executed as-is (DuckDB would interpret it as an invalid identifier). While the explanation instructs to replace it, a more robust approach could use DuckDB's parameter syntax (e.g., `?` or `$1` with binding) or a subquery for flexibility. This is a small execution barrier, docking 0.5 points.
- **Redundant `DISTINCT` in `top_cases`**: Since `case_id` is unique in `case_sequences` (grouped per case), `DISTINCT` is unnecessary and adds minor overhead without benefit. It's harmless but reflects slight inefficiency, docking 0.2 points.
- **Tie handling**: `RANK()` includes all ties at the Kth position, potentially returning more than K variants if frequencies tie. The prompt says "the top K variants," which could be interpreted strictly as exactly K (e.g., using `ROW_NUMBER()` or `LIMIT K` without ranking ties). While `RANK()` is defensible and common, it's a subtle ambiguity not addressed, docking 0.1 points.

No major inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities exist—the query is functionally correct, efficient for typical use, and faithful to DuckDB syntax. With these tweaks, it would be flawless.
