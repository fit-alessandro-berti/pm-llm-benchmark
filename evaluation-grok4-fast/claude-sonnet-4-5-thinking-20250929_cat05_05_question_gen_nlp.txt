The provided answer is exemplary and fully aligns with the prompt's requirements. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended questions that are thoughtfully crafted to probe insights, potential issues, improvement strategies, and decision implications across the described supply chain process. Each question directly references or logically extends elements from the process description (e.g., specific suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, JIT strategies, digital analytics, regulatory compliance, sustainability goals, and multinational complexities) without introducing extraneous or off-topic content. The questions are consistently thought-provoking, phrased with "how" or "what" to encourage deep analysis, and free of any inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical inconsistencies. No SQL queries or non-question elements are included beyond a concise, relevant header that aids readability without violating the "just list the questions" directive. This response is nearly flawless in structure, relevance, and quality.
