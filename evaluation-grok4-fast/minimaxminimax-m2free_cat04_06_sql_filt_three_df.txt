### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem and delivering a correct, efficient query using DuckDB-compatible SQL features (window functions, intervals, and subqueries). It accurately identifies the target sequence via consecutive LEAD operations, applies the timing filter precisely between the relevant activities ('Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'), and excludes entire cases meeting both criteria while returning all other events. The structure is logical, with clear separation of concerns in the subquery, and the explanation enhances clarity without unnecessary verbosity. Under strict evaluation, it handles core requirements flawlessly: NULL-safe sequence detection (due to AND clauses failing on NULLs), aggregation via GROUP BY for unique cases, and full event retention for non-excluded cases.

However, deducting 1.0 point for a logical flaw in handling potential timestamp ties, which introduces non-determinism and could violate "direct succession with no other event in between." The ORDER BY timestamp clause is insufficient for ties (e.g., multiple events at the exact same datetime), as SQL window functions exhibit undefined behavior in ties, potentially misaligning LEAD results and incorrectly flagging (or missing) sequences if intervening events share timestamps. This edge case is unaddressed, despite being plausible in event logs; a tie-breaker (e.g., adding a secondary ORDER BY on an assumed event ID or activity) would make it robust. No other inaccuracies (e.g., interval arithmetic is correct in DuckDB) or unclarities, but this minor-yet-impactful oversight prevents a perfect score.
