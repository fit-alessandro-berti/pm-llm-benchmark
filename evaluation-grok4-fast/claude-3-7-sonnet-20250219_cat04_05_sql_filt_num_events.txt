The provided answer is nearly flawless: it correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per case_id with proper GROUP BY, joins back to the original table to preserve all event details (via SELECT e.*), applies the exact filter (event_count <= 6, equivalent to excluding >6), and returns the full set of qualifying events without data loss or extraneous output. The approach is efficient, readable, and adheres strictly to SQL standards supported by DuckDB. The optional ORDER BY enhances usability without altering semantics or adding unrequested elements. The accompanying explanation is precise, accurate, and directly addresses the requirements without fluff or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected—even under hypercritical scrutiny.
