The provided SQL query is highly accurate and logically sound overall, correctly implementing the requirements for identifying cases with the exact consecutive sequence via timestamp-ordered joins and NOT EXISTS subqueries to enforce direct succession (no intervening events). It properly filters for the >5-day condition using DuckDB-compatible interval arithmetic and excludes matching cases via a LEFT JOIN anti-pattern, returning all events (`el.*`) from non-matching cases as specified. This handles cases with the sequence but 5 days correctly (retained) and cases with multiple potential sequences by including the case if at least one valid consecutive triple exceeds 5 days, which aligns with a reasonable interpretation of "contains the sequence" with the timing property.

However, minor deductions for: (1) lack of `DISTINCT` in `FilteredCases`, which could lead to redundant rows in the CTE if a case has multiple qualifying sequences (logically correct but inefficient and unnecessary duplication in intermediate results); (2) absence of an explicit `ORDER BY` (e.g., by `case_id` and `timestamp`) in the final SELECT, despite the prompt's mention of "proper ... ordering," leaving the result set order undefined in SQL semantics. These are small issues but warrant a slight reduction under hypercritical scrutiny, as they prevent absolute flawlessness. No major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws in core logic, filtering, or DuckDB compatibility.
