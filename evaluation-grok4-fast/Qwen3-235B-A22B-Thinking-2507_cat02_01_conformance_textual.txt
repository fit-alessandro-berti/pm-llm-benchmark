The provided answer is exceptionally accurate, comprehensive, and logically rigorous. It correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and compliant ones (1 and 4), with precise references to the normative description that directly quote and interpret key constraints without distortion. Violations are explained with causal dependencies and branch exclusivity in mind, resolving ambiguities (e.g., mandatory packaging, no path mixing) strictly in line with the text's intent ("must," "only after," "never"). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws exist in the final conclusions or analysis—explanations are unambiguous, evidence-based, and free of overreach or leniency. The summary table and principles reinforce clarity without redundancy. This is a model of strict adherence to the task.
