9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating thorough analysis, accurate calculations, clear structure, and practical recommendations. It directly addresses all three tasks with logical flow and evidence-based insights. However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor issues prevent a perfect score: (1) slight inconsistency in duration phrasing (e.g., "2h15m" vs. precise minute breakdowns elsewhere, though calculations are correct); (2) the table's date formatting (e.g., "20240301" omits hyphens for readability, potentially causing minor parsing ambiguity); and (3) a subtle logical overgeneralization in part 2 by grouping "overnight gaps" as a universal cause without quantifying that not all cases (e.g., 101, 103) avoid them due to early completion—while true, it could more precisely note this as a conditional factor tied to timing. These are small flaws but warrant a deduction from flawless (10.0) status, as the instructions demand significant penalties for even minor issues. The content remains highly accurate, insightful, and free of major errors or unclarities.
