7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Correctness of Logic (Core Functionality)**: The query accurately uses CTEs to count events per `case_id`, filter to those with `event_count <= 6`, and join back to retrieve the relevant events. This correctly excludes cases with more than six events and returns events from qualifying cases. No logical flaws in grouping, filtering, or joining. DuckDB syntax is appropriate. (+9/10)
- **Completeness of Output**: The prompt specifies returning the "full set of events" for the remaining cases, implying all columns from `event_log` (noted as having *at least* `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`, but potentially more). The query explicitly selects only three columns, which fails to deliver the complete rows/events if additional columns exist. This is a significant omission for a "full set," requiring `SELECT e.*` or `SELECT *` to ensure completeness. (-1.5 points)
- **Clarity and Structure**: The query is well-structured with clear CTE names and indentation. The explanation is thorough, step-by-step, and directly addresses the task without unnecessary details. The added `ORDER BY` clause enhances usability (logical event sequencing) without altering correctness, though it's not required by the prompt. (+1 for explanation quality, no deduction here)
- **Efficiency and Best Practices**: Efficient use of CTEs avoids subqueries in the main join, which is performant for DuckDB. No redundant computations or unnecessary operations. However, if the table has many columns, the explicit selection could be seen as incomplete but not inefficient.
- **Overall Strictness**: This is a strong, nearly flawless solution for the core logic, but the column selection inaccuracy prevents a top score. Under hypercritical evaluation, this flaw—directly impacting the "full set" requirement—warrants a meaningful deduction, as it could lead to incomplete results in real scenarios. Minor positives (e.g., ordering) don't fully offset this.
