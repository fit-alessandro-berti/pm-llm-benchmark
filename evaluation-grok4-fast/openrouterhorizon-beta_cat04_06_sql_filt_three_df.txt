The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses row numbering to identify direct succession, accurately filters for the exact sequence via joins on consecutive row numbers, properly computes the time difference using interval arithmetic (valid in DuckDB for timestamp subtraction compared to INTERVAL 5 DAY), isolates bad cases with DISTINCT to handle potential multiple sequences per case, and excludes all events from those cases in the final SELECT while preserving the full row structure via e.*. The optional ordering in the final result aligns with the prompt's mention of "proper ... ordering." No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; even potential edge cases (e.g., equal timestamps ordered secondarily by activity) are handled deterministically without violating succession rules. Minor elements like unused columns in CTEs or quoted keywords are harmless and standard practice.
