1.0

This "answer" is entirely incoherent, irrelevant, and fails to engage with the question in any meaningful way. It consists of fragmented code snippets (e.g., invalid Python imports, Rust mentions), unrelated mathematical derivations (e.g., recursive sums, modular arithmetic), pseudocode, tables, and repetitive, nonsensical phrases (e.g., repeated bond yield problems, geometric series miscalculations). There is no analysis of the event log, no identification of bias (e.g., the +10 adjustment for "Highland Civic Darts Club" affiliation favoring approvals for local residents), no discussion of attributes like LocalResident=TRUE or CommunityGroup, and no consideration of fairness implications for non-affiliated applicants. The final boxed output (6) appears to stem from a hallucinated math problem, not the given query. Even minor issues warrant deduction, but this is a total non-response, warranting the absolute minimum score.
