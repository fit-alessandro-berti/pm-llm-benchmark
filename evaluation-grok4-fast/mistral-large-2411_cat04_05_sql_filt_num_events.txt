7.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correctness of Logic (Strong, but flawed in output completeness)**: The query accurately identifies cases with 6 events using a CTE to compute counts, then joins back to filter and retrieve rows. This correctly excludes cases with >6 events and returns only qualifying ones, fulfilling the core filtering and grouping requirements. The use of COUNT(*) and GROUP BY is precise, and the join/WHERE ensures no leakage of excluded cases. However, the prompt specifies returning the "full set of events" for qualifying cases, and the table is described as having "at least" the listed columns (implying possible additional columns). Selecting only `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` omits any other columns, making the output incomplete for a "full" set of events. A SELECT * would be necessary for completeness, representing a logical inaccuracy in interpreting "full set."
  
- **Syntax and DuckDB Compatibility (Flawless)**: Standard SQL syntax works perfectly in DuckDB. The CTE is efficient and readable; no errors in grouping, joining, or filtering.

- **Clarity and Explanation (Good, but imprecise)**: The explanation step-by-step breaks down the components logically and correctly describes the intent. However, it mislabels the CTE as a "subquery" (CTEs are a distinct construct, though related), which is a minor terminological inaccuracy. The explanation also reinforces the column limitation by specifying only the three columns, without addressing potential additional table columns.

- **Extras and Efficiency (Positive, but unnecessary)**: The ORDER BY clause is a nice touch for usability (chronological ordering within cases), but it's not required by the prompt and could be seen as extraneous. It doesn't break anything, but strict evaluation notes it as unasked-for addition without justification.

- **Overall Strictness**: This is a solid, functional query that solves the problem for the minimal specified columns, but the incompleteness in output (not full events) and the small terminological slip prevent a near-flawless score. Under hypercritical scrutiny, these issues—especially the logical output gap—warrant a deduction to 7.0, indicating high competence with targeted flaws rather than perfection. A version with SELECT * and corrected terminology would score 9.5+.
