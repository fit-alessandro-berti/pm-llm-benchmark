8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is functionally correct and achieves all core requirements: it extracts ordered sequences per case using `GROUP_CONCAT` (which properly handles intra-case ordering via its internal `ORDER BY timestamp`), groups and counts variants, selects top K by frequency, and filters the event log to return only events from matching cases. The final result excludes non-top-K cases, as required. The use of CTEs is logical and readable, and the joins correctly propagate the filter without errors.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several minor but notable issues prevent a near-flawless score (e.g., 9.0+):
- **Hardcoded K value**: The prompt specifies "top K variants" as a general parameter, but the query assumes `K=10` with a LIMIT clause and a comment to adjust manually. This lacks parameterization (e.g., using DuckDB variables like `SET k=10; ... LIMIT k` or a placeholder for generality), making it inflexible and not fully aligned with the prompt's abstract "K". This is a logical flaw in adaptability, warranting deduction.
- **Unnecessary and misleading OrderedEvents CTE**: The global `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is redundant because `GROUP_CONCAT`'s internal `ORDER BY` already enforces per-group ordering from the raw table. This CTE adds no value, slightly harms efficiency (unneeded sorting of the entire dataset), and the explanation inaccurately credits it for "establish[ing] the correct activity sequence" (the sequence is established by `GROUP_CONCAT`, not this CTE). VariantSequences could be rewritten directly on `event_log` for simplicity.
- **Potential edge cases unaddressed**: 
  - `GROUP_CONCAT` defaults to comma separator without specification (e.g., `GROUP_CONCAT(activity ORDER BY timestamp SEPARATOR ',')`). If activity names contain commas, variants could parse incorrectly, though the prompt doesn't specify this risk—still, explicitness would improve robustness.
  - Ties in frequency aren't handled (e.g., `ORDER BY count DESC, variant` for stable tie-breaking), but the prompt doesn't require it—minor omission.
  - No handling for equal timestamps within a case (order becomes arbitrary beyond timestamp), but the prompt assumes timestamp sorting defines order—acceptable, but not flawless.
- **Extra content**: The explanation is clear and accurate overall but propagates the minor inaccuracy about OrderedEvents. The "How to use" section with sample data and table creation is helpful but extraneous to the core task (construct the query), slightly diluting focus without adding analytical value.

These are not fatal errors—the query runs correctly in DuckDB and produces the expected output—but they represent avoidable inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and incomplete generality. A 10.0 requires zero such nits; this is strong but not pristine.
