The provided SQL query precisely meets all requirements: it correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using row numbering and self-joins on consecutive ranks, computes the timestamp difference accurately for the relevant pair in each triple (compatible with DuckDB's interval handling), excludes only the distinct cases where at least one such sequence exceeds 5 days, and returns all events from the remaining cases in the specified order. The explanation reinforces the logic without errors or ambiguities, confirming the output aligns with the exclusion criteria. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities are present.
