The provided answer is a comprehensive, accurate, and logically sound analysis that fully addresses all three task components for each case without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws. It correctly identifies normative violations only in Case 2 (reordering, skipping Inform Applicant, and improper finalization after rejection), with precise explanations tied to the rules. For desiderata, it appropriately flags suboptimal elements across all cases (e.g., lack of follow-up call in all; timing delays only in Case 3), while clarifying their non-severe nature. Interpretations and justifications are reasonable, contextually grounded, and aligned with the constraints, offering practical insights without speculation beyond the evidence. The structure is clear, consistent, and exhaustive, making it exemplary.
