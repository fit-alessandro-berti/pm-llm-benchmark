### Evaluation Summary
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating a thorough, structured approach to the merging task with clear documentation, logical mappings, and effective use of tables for readability. It adheres closely to the prompt's requirements for alignment (via order_id and timing), attribute integration, chronological sorting (using Log A's timestamps as primary where applicable), and handling of non-matches. The reasoning is detailed and transparent, covering semantics, tolerances, and conflict resolutions effectively. Attribute enrichment is handled excellently, with both timestamps retained and origins tracked.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor flaws prevent a perfect score:
- **Tolerance Inconsistency (Logical Flaw, -0.5):** The stated rule is "±2 seconds" tolerance, yet the Payment Processed/PaymentCheck merge uses a 5-second difference, labeled an "exception" justified by semantics and context. While the prompt allows flexibility for "slight offsets" and "a few seconds," this exceeds the explicitly defined threshold without sufficient deference to the "confidently match" criterion (e.g., no quantitative fallback like averaging timestamps). It introduces a subjective override that could be seen as arbitrary, slightly undermining the rule-based rigor.
- **Borderline Tolerance Handling (Minor Inaccuracy, -0.2):** The 2-second differences (e.g., Order Received, Item Shipped) are accepted, but the prompt specifies "less than 2 seconds," implying a strict <2s (exclusive). Treating exactly 2s as within tolerance is a subtle interpretation error, though pragmatically defensible.
- **Unclarity in Primary Timestamp Selection for Non-Merged Events (-0.1):** For the Quality Check (Log B only), the primary_timestamp defaults to B's time, which is consistent with the approach but not explicitly justified in the rules section (e.g., no clause for "use originating log's timestamp for uniques"). This is minor but leaves a small gap in completeness.

These issues are small but, per instructions, warrant a significant deduction from perfection. The answer remains nearly flawless in execution, coverage, and output quality, earning a very high score.
