The final dictionary follows the required Python format with tuple keys and (average_time, standard_deviation) values in seconds, and it provides a reasonable subset of 10 pairs that includes both direct transitions (e.g., ('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC')) and multi-step separations (e.g., ('SS', 'AS'), ('OP', 'DT'), ('RC', 'AS')), demonstrating some complexity as specified. The average times are plausibly estimated based on supply chain realities (e.g., ~7 days for order-to-receipt, cumulative scaling to ~14 days for end-to-end), with correct second conversions (e.g., 604800 for 7 days).

However, the standard deviations contain significant logical flaws and inaccuracies, particularly for multi-step pairs, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation. For long-interval pairs like ('SS', 'AS') (14 days average) and ('RC', 'AS') (~7 days), the SDs (7200s  2 hours) are unrealistically low and fail to account for accumulating variability across multiple steps— in a temporal profile, SD should increase roughly with the square root of summed variances, leading to much larger values (e.g., days of deviation for global supply chains involving suppliers and logistics). This inconsistency undermines the model's validity for detecting deviations as described in the prompt. Shorter SDs (e.g., 600s for ('SS', 'OP')) are appropriate, but the non-cumulative pattern across pairs indicates flawed estimation logic. Minor unclarity in subset selection (e.g., omitting any direct late-stage pair like ('DT', 'AS') while emphasizing early-to-late) adds to the issues, though the accompanying text correctly frames it as a "representative subset." Overall, while structurally sound and effortful, the inaccuracies prevent a higher score.
