The provided answer is exemplary: it systematically analyzes all cases, accurately identifies violations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 while confirming compliance in Cases 1 and 4, and offers precise explanations grounded in the normative description without introducing ambiguities or errors. The structure is clear, logical, and references key constraints (e.g., ordering rules, branching logic, mandatory steps) directly and effectively. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; interpretations of the process (e.g., inferring cancellation paths and the implications of missing steps) are consistent and well-justified. The summary reinforces the conclusions succinctly.
