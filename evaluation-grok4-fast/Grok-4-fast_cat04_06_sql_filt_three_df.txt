10.0

The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the benchmark prompt with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It correctly identifies cases with the exact required sequence in direct succession using LEAD() functions on row-numbered events ordered by timestamp, accurately filters for the >5-day elapsed time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' via interval arithmetic (compatible with DuckDB), excludes those entire cases via a LEFT JOIN anti-join pattern, and returns all events from the remaining cases with appropriate ordering. No minor issues detract from its precision, efficiency, or adherence to the requirements.
