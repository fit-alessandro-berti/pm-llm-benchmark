7.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer is well-structured, comprehensive, and accurate in its analysis of normative violations (Task 1), correctly identifying no issues in Case 1 and multiple clear breaches in Case 2 (including the overlooked missing "Inform Applicant" event, which is a strong point), while properly clearing Case 3. Task 3 provides reasonable, constraint-respecting interpretations and actionable recommendations, with good nuance (e.g., acknowledging potential data-entry errors or external communications without excusing violations). The use of tables enhances clarity, and the summary/recommendations tie everything together effectively.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, Task 2 contains a significant inaccuracy: it incorrectly states that Case 1 has "None" desiderata failures, claiming the absence of a follow-up call "does not constitute a violation" and that "all recommendations [are] met." The process description explicitly encourages (as a desideratum) a follow-up call "sometime before closing the case" for all processes, and the log shows no such activity for any case (Case 3's log even highlights it explicitly). This represents a suboptimal behavior that should be identified as a soft failure across **all** cases, per the task's instruction to "identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions" and clarify them as non-severe deviations. Omitting this for Case 1 misrepresents the analysis, creating an inconsistency (it is noted as a failure for Cases 2 and 3) and failing to fully address the "encouraged—but not strictly required" aspect uniformly. This logical flaw and incomplete identification, while not catastrophic, warrants a deduction from a higher score, as the response must be nearly flawless for 9+.

Minor issues include slight verbosity in explanations (e.g., imprecise timestamp phrasing like "08:20 + 40 min" when the log clearly shows 09:00) and the summary table reinforcing the Case 1 error by marking it as fully compliant on desiderata. These compound to prevent a top-tier grade, but the overall response is strong and correct on the majority of content.
