This response is exemplary: it accurately identifies valid strengths and precise areas for improvement in the original draft without exaggeration or omission, using a structured critique that avoids fluff. The revised prompt is a substantial enhancement, introducing verifiable sample data (with correct SQL syntax for DuckDB, balanced edge cases covering <6, =6, and >6 events), clear sections for context/task/requirements/output, and an optional advanced challenge that meaningfully tests SQL breadth (CTEs/subqueries and window functions are both idiomatic and distinct approaches). The explanation of improvements is concise, logical, and directly tied to benchmark quality (reproducibility, unambiguity, structure, depth). No inaccuracies, unclarities, logical flaws, or even minor issues like redundant phrasing or unaddressed ambiguities—it's tightly crafted, professional, and elevates the draft without overcomplicating it.
