7.5

### Explanation of Grade
The provided answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the normative constraints and desiderata, correctly identifying the key violations in Case 2 (ordering of Risk Assessment and Credit Check; inappropriate Finalize Documentation after rejection) and appropriately distinguishing Case 1 as compliant with no normative issues. It also accurately flags the timing deviations in Case 3 as desiderata failures while clarifying their non-severe nature, and notes the absence of Follow-up Calls without treating them as hard violations. The interpretations/justifications are reasonable and align with the task, offering plausible explanations like human error or staffing delays.

However, under hypercritical evaluation:
- **Major inaccuracy (significant deduction):** The answer completely overlooks a clear normative violation in Case 2: the absence of "Inform Applicant" entirely, which is strictly required after Loan Decision regardless of approval/rejection status (per the sequence and rules). This is not mentioned in the analysis, issues summary, or conclusions, making the identification of normative violations incomplete and logically flawed for Case 2 (there are effectively three violations, not two).
- **Minor unclarities/logical issues (further deduction):** The desiderata summary for Case 3 treats the lack of Follow-up Call as "not a problem" without explicitly framing it as a "failure to meet" the recommended condition (though it mentions it), slightly under-emphasizing the task's requirement to identify such deviations. Timings are correctly assessed, but Case 1's compliance with desiderata (e.g., timely Credit Check and Inform) is assumed without explicit verification. The boxed "Final Answer" is unhelpfully vague ("See analysis above"), lacking a concise, structured summary of conclusions as implied by the task.
- **Strengths mitigating to 7.5:** The core analysis is mostly thorough and correct where addressed, with no contradictions or misinterpretations of rules. Initial verbose reasoning is ignored per instructions, focusing on final conclusions. No criminal or off-topic issues.

This is a strong but flawed response; a flawless one would catch all violations explicitly and structure conclusions more crisply, warranting 9+ only for near-perfection.
