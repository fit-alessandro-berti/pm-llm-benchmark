3.0

The provided SQL query contains fundamental logical flaws that prevent it from correctly fulfilling the requirements, warranting a low score despite some superficial structure (e.g., use of CTEs and a basic exclusion logic). Key issues include:

- **Failure to enforce direct succession**: The `problematic_cases` CTE uses self-joins on timestamps but does not verify that there are no intervening events between the three activities within the same case. For instance, the join conditions (e.g., `e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp` without checking for the absence of other rows in between) allow for non-consecutive sequences, such as Approve  (other activity)  Create  (other activities)  Confirm. This directly violates requirement 1, leading to over-identification of "problematic" cases.

- **Incorrect join logic in `problematic_cases`**: The COALESCE subqueries (e.g., `COALESCE((SELECT min(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE case_id = e1.case_id AND activity = 'Create Order'), '9999-01-01')`) are malformed and ineffective. They fetch the minimum timestamp for 'Create Order' across the entire case without restricting to events after `e1.timestamp`, potentially referencing events before the Approve or irrelevant ones. This makes the join condition arbitrary and fails to isolate the immediate successor, resulting in incorrect or null matches.

- **Flawed time difference calculation in `long_duration_cases`**: Even assuming `problematic_cases` worked, the joins to `create_order` and `confirm_order` do not link back to the specific instances from the sequence (e.g., the Create immediately after the Approve). Instead, it arbitrarily pairs any 'Create Order' with any later 'Confirm Order' in the case, ignoring the sequence context. This could exclude cases based on unrelated event pairs, violating the precise timing condition on the specific sequence (requirement 2).

- **Incomplete handling of multiples**: The query does not account for cases with multiple instances of the activities, potentially matching non-sequence pairs or missing the exact trio.

- **Overall result inaccuracy**: The final SELECT excludes based on these erroneous identifications, so it would incorrectly filter out (or retain) events from cases, failing requirement 3. While the exclusion via NOT IN and ordering are conceptually sound, they propagate the upstream errors.

Minor positives (e.g., DuckDB-compatible INTERVAL syntax, DISTINCT usage) do not offset these core inaccuracies, as the query would produce wrong results on any non-trivial dataset. A correct solution would require row numbering or LAG/LEAD within partitioned cases to confirm exact consecutiveness, followed by targeted timestamp diffs on those rows.
