The final POWL model is precise, syntactically correct, and faithfully captures the process semantics as described in the POWL documentation. It accurately models the mandatory sequential prefix (OR  MS  QS), the optional multi-iteration loops for quality checks (AS-IQC and TST-RT using the exact LOOP operator semantics), the exclusive choice for the optional LB activity (using XOR with a silent transition), and the strict postfix sequence (PK  [LB?]  DP  D) via a total-order StrictPartialOrder. No concurrency is implied, aligning with the sequential timestamps. The structure generates all valid traces from the event log (treating the anomalous double IQC in Case 3 as a likely data artifact, consistent with the process description of "repeated if needed" post-AS), without introducing extraneous paths. Validation against cases is explicit and comprehensive. The code is executable and adheres to pm4py POWL classes without errors.
