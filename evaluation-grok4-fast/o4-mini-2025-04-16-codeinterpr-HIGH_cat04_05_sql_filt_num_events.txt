9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is excellent overall, demonstrating strong SQL proficiency for DuckDB (which shares standard SQL semantics). Both queries correctly achieve the core objective: identifying cases with 6 events via aggregation (GROUP BY/HAVING or window function) and filtering to return only events from qualifying cases. This avoids returning events from oversized cases, matching the prompt precisely. The use of CTE + JOIN in the first query is efficient and readable, while the window function alternative is clever and avoids a self-join, showcasing versatility. The explanation is clear, structured, and educational, breaking down the logic step-by-step without unnecessary verbosity. Adding optional ORDER BY for chronological output per case is a thoughtful enhancement, not a flaw.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor deductions are warranted for the following issues:
- **Column selection inaccuracy (primary flaw, -1.0)**: The prompt requires returning "the full set of events" for filtered cases, implying all columns from the table (which has "at least" `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp` but potentially more). Both queries explicitly select only those three columns, omitting others (e.g., no `SELECT *` in the main query). While the explanation notes this as a "subset" that can be adjusted, the code itself does not deliver the "full" set, introducing a subtle logical gap. In a benchmark context, this prevents a perfect score, as it assumes unspecified columns and requires user modification.
- **Unnecessary parenthetical in explanation (-0.0, but noted for completeness)**: The aside "(or a subset—you can add/remove columns as needed)" slightly undermines the code's completeness by deferring responsibility, though it's not a major clarity issue.

No logical flaws (e.g., incorrect filtering, grouping errors, or DuckDB-specific incompatibilities) or major unclarities exist—the queries are syntactically valid, performant for typical event logs, and provably correct. This is nearly flawless, justifying a high score despite the strict column nitpick. For a 10.0, the code would need `SELECT *` (e.g., in the first query's main SELECT or second query's outer SELECT) to fully align without caveats.
