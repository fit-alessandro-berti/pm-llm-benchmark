The provided "answer" completely fails to address the core task specified in the draft prompt, which explicitly requires crafting a DuckDB SQL query to filter and return events from cases with six or fewer events. Instead, it outputs a rephrased version of a benchmark prompt, which is irrelevant and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the request. This is a total non-response to the query-writing objective, introducing no technical solution, no SQL code, and no logical execution of the filtering/grouping requirements. Even minor alignment with the task is absent, rendering it unusable and warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
