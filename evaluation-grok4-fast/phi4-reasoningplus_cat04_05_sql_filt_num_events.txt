The provided answer delivers two correct, efficient, and semantically equivalent SQL queries that precisely meet the requirements: identifying cases with 6 events via aggregation (GROUP BY with HAVING) and returning all events for those cases without alteration. Both approaches handle grouping and filtering accurately, support DuckDB's syntax, and preserve the full row data (including unspecified columns). The explanations are concise, accurate, and directly tie to the query logic without introducing extraneous details or errors. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present.
