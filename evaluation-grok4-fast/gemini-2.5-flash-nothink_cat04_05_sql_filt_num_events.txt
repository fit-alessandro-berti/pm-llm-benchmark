10.0

This breakdown is exemplary in its structure, accuracy, and completeness, demonstrating a flawless logical progression for crafting the benchmark prompt without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws. It meticulously dissects the problem, anticipates key SQL mechanics (e.g., GROUP BY, HAVING, subquery with IN), ensures alignment with the prompt's requirements (e.g., precise filtering logic for 6 events), and refines the wording for optimal clarity and guidance— all while avoiding spoilers that would undermine the benchmark's purpose. No deductions are warranted; it is a model of rigorous, hypercritical prompt engineering.
