The provided answer generates exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that directly align with the supply chain process description. Each question is phrased to elicit insights (e.g., on forecasting accuracy and data sources), potential issues (e.g., challenges in global logistics), strategies for improvement (e.g., continuous improvement metrics and risk mitigation), and implications (e.g., trade-offs in replenishment strategies and sustainability-cost balances). All questions are clearly derived from key elements of the process, such as R&D collaboration, supplier management, assembly operations, transportation coordination, distribution strategies, inventory tracking, digital integration, analytics, compliance, and resilience, without introducing extraneous or inaccurate details. No SQL queries are included, and the list format is clean and focused, with the brief closing sentence serving only to contextualize without detracting from the core output. The response is precise, logically structured, and free of any inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws.
