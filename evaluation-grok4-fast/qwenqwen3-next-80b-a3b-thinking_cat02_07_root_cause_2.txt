9.8

### Grading Rationale
This answer excels in structure, accuracy, and depth, directly addressing all three tasks with evidence from the event log. It correctly identifies Cases 2003 and 2005 as the primary performance issues (with precise duration calculations and a justified exclusion of Case 2002 as "less extreme"), analyzes attributes insightfully (e.g., strong link to complexity via multiple document requests, dismissal of region/resource as non-factors based on patterns), and provides logical explanations tied to process flaws. Mitigation suggestions are practical, actionable, and rooted in the analysis (e.g., upfront checklists, automation), with quantified expected impacts adding value. Minor deduction for slight over-generalization in "no evidence of resource inefficiency" (data is limited, so it's interpretive rather than absolute), but this is negligible as the overall reasoning is sound, clear, and flawless in logic and evidence use.
