The provided answer is a precise, correct, and efficient SQL query that fully addresses the task. It uses a subquery to identify valid `case_id` values with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the original table using `IN` to retrieve all events for those cases. The explanation accurately describes the logic without errors, ambiguities, or unnecessary complexity, and the code is syntactically valid for DuckDB. No logical flaws, performance issues, or deviations from the requirements are present.
