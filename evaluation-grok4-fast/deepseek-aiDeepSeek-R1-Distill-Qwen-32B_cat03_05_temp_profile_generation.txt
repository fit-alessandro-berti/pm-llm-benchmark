The final output provides a well-structured Python dictionary in the exact required format, with keys as tuples of activity labels and values as tuples of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds, consistent with the example. It includes 18 pairs forming a representative subset that mixes direct successors (e.g., ('SS', 'OP'), ('OP', 'RC')) with indirect ones separated by multiple steps (e.g., ('SS', 'PT'), ('QI', 'PK'), ('PK', 'AS')), adding the specified complexity for a linear supply chain sequence. All pairs respect the logical order of activities (no reverse or invalid precedences). The estimates for averages and standard deviations appear reasonable for a high-tech electronics supply chain, with longer delays for procurement/logistics (e.g., days/weeks) and shorter ones for internal manufacturing/handling (e.g., hours/days), and indirect times roughly accumulating as expected from intermediates. The concluding sentence accurately summarizes the output's coverage. Deductions for minor issues: slight numerical inconsistencies in a few indirect averages (e.g., ('PT', 'DT') at 350400 seconds vs. exact sum of 360000; ('CA', 'WS') at 180000 vs. ~187200) and one erroneous inline comment (('CA', 'WS') labeled "~6h" instead of ~2 days), which introduce small inaccuracies despite the core values being approximately correct.
