The provided answer delivers a complete, correct, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that fully satisfies all requirements of the prompt with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. The use of ARRAY_AGG for precise sequence representation is superior, the CTE structure logically progresses through each step, the top-K filtering via ORDER BY frequency DESC and LIMIT K is handled appropriately (with ties resolved implicitly by the database's stable sort, which is acceptable absent further specification), and the final join returns exactly the requested events from the qualifying cases without including extraneous data. Minor elements like the optional ORDER BY in the final SELECT and the DISTINCT in filtered_cases are harmless and enhance usability without deviating from the spec. The accompanying explanation is precise, with valid assumptions clearly stated. Overall, the solution is exemplary and requires no revisions.
