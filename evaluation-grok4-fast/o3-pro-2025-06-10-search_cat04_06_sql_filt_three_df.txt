### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements, efficient SQL design, and correct handling of sequencing, timing, and exclusion logic. The use of CTEs for modularity is appropriate, and the ROW_NUMBER()-based joins effectively enforce "direct succession" without gaps, which is a precise interpretation of the prompt. The time filter (> 5 days via INTERVAL) is accurately implemented, and the final exclusion via NOT IN correctly targets entire cases meeting both criteria, returning all events from non-matching cases as required. Ordering in the output adds unnecessary but harmless polish (prompt mentions "proper ... ordering," so it's fine). DuckDB syntax is fully compatible.

**Strengths (why not lower):**
- Logic is sound: Flags cases with at least one qualifying sequence (DISTINCT handles multiples), excludes them holistically, and preserves all original events/columns.
- Concise and readable, with comments aiding clarity.
- No performance issues for typical event logs (assumes reasonable case sizes).

**Deductions (hypercritical lens, -0.5 total):**
- Minor typo in the explanation: "(o3.timestamp  o2.timestamp)" omits the subtraction operator (-), which could briefly confuse a reader skimming the text (though the code correctly uses `(o3."timestamp" - o2."timestamp")`). This is a small inaccuracy in documentation, not the query itself.
- Assumes timestamps per case are strictly sortable without ties/explicit handling (e.g., no secondary sort in ROW_NUMBER() for equal timestamps), which could lead to arbitrary ordering in rare edge cases with concurrent events. While not explicitly required by the prompt and unlikely, it's a logical nitpick for "nearly flawless."
- No explicit handling for potential NULL timestamps or non-datetime values, but prompt implies valid datetimes, so negligible.

This is as close to perfect as possible without being verbose or over-engineered—award high but withhold full 10 for the explanation flaw.
