### Evaluation Rationale
The final answer delivers a well-structured Python dictionary in the exact required format: keys as tuples of activity pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), values as tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds. It appropriately focuses on pairs where the first activity precedes the second in the implied linear process flow (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS), including both direct/consecutive pairs (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`) and multi-step separated pairs (e.g., `('SS', 'AS')`, `('OP', 'DT')`), which fulfills the requirement for complexity and eventual succession without assuming non-linear branches unsupported by the scenario.

Estimates are logically derived from supply chain realities for high-tech electronics: early procurement stages show longer averages with higher variability (e.g., `('SS', 'RC')`: ~1 week avg, 3-day std), mid-process manufacturing is shorter and tighter (e.g., `('QI', 'CA')`: ~2 hours), and late/post-sale phases extend variably (e.g., `('DT', 'AS')`: ~4 months). Conversions to seconds are accurate (e.g., 604800s = 7 days, 15552000s = ~180 days). Standard deviations are plausibly scaled (often 25-50% of average, reflecting factors like logistics variability), and the trailing explanation reinforces real-world basis without extraneous details.

Minor deductions for strictness:
- **Subset completeness**: While "representative" is specified, the selection omits some logical multi-step pairs (e.g., `('RC', 'CA')`, skipping the QI step; `('CA', 'PK')`, bridging PT; `('OP', 'AS')`), reducing exhaustiveness in demonstrating *all* eventual successions across traces. This creates a slight gap in coverage for a "complex" profile, though not a fatal flaw.
- **Estimation consistency**: A few std devs feel slightly formulaic (e.g., exactly half the avg in `('SS', 'OP')`, `('CA', 'PT')`), potentially understating unique variabilities (e.g., global distribution `('WS', 'DT')` at 1-week std might warrant more for international delays). No major inaccuracies, but hypercritically, this borders on arbitrary patterning.
- **No logical flaws**, but the inline comments in the dict (e.g., "# ~1 day average") add minor verbosity not requested, though they don't invalidate the code.

Overall, the response is strong, coherent, and directly task-aligned—flawless in structure and intent, with only subtle gaps preventing a perfect 10.0.
