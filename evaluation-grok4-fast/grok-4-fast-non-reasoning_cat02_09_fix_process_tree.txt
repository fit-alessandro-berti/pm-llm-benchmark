The provided answer is nearly flawless in its structure, accuracy, and completeness, directly addressing all three task components with precision and depth. It correctly diagnoses the underfitting issues rooted in the permissive parallelism, proposes a logically sound and domain-aligned fix via a strict sequence that mirrors the prompt's intended linear flow, and offers a clear, evidence-based explanation of conformance benefits. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even the nuanced handling of dependencies (e.g., avoiding over-introduction of operators like XOR while enforcing the given standard sequence) is impeccable, making it a model response.
