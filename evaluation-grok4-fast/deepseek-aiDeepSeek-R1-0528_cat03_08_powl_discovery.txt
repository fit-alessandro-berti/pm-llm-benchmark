9.5

### Grading Rationale
The final POWL model accurately captures the process's sequential structure, loops for iterative assembly/quality checks (handling arbitrary IQC repetitions via the nested loops and allowing zero IQC in simpler cases like Case 4), optional labeling via XOR, and testing/re-testing via a simple loop. The partial order enforces the necessary sequencing without introducing unfounded concurrency, aligning perfectly with the event log traces. All paths in the validation reproduce the observed behaviors (e.g., consecutive IQCs in Case 3 via the inner silent-loop body; direct AS-to-TST in Case 4 by exiting the outer loop immediately; skipped LB in Case 2 via the XOR silent branch). The textual notation closely follows the prompt's style, using inline operators for compound nodes and explicit --> edges for ordering.

Minor deductions (preventing a 10.0): 
- Slight notational inconsistencies in the validation section (e.g., Case 2's `()DPD` is ambiguous/typo-prone, implying `DP D` but concatenated; empty comma in inner loop explanation `* ( IQC, )` is unclear). 
- The nodes list redundantly repeats full operator expressions in edges, which is verbose and risks reader confusion without explicit variable naming (as hinted in the prompt's example), though it remains logically sound and self-contained. 
No logical flaws or inaccuracies in the model itself—behavioral equivalence to the log is preserved without over- or under-generalization.
