7.2

### Grading Rationale
The response is well-structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three tasks with clear sections, bullet points, and logical flow. It correctly identifies the delayed cases (102, 104, 105) with accurate total resolution times and appropriate comparisons to the baseline cases. Root causes are thoughtfully categorized (escalations, waiting times, prolonged investigations), with case-specific examples that mostly align with the log. Explanations of how factors increase cycle times (e.g., handoff inefficiencies, workload issues) are insightful, and recommendations are practical, actionable, and targeted (e.g., SLAs, automation, training).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are notable inaccuracies and logical flaws in time calculations for investigation durations, which are central to the analysis:
- For Case 102, the investigation duration is stated as 21.5 hours (from escalation, not investigation start), but the actual span from "Investigate Issue" (14:00 Day 1) to "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 Day 2) is 19 hours. This misattribution inflates the perceived investigation time and blurs escalation vs. investigation delays.
- For Case 105, the investigation duration is erroneously listed as 31 hours (14:00 Day 2 to 09:00 Day 3), but it is 19 hours; similarly, resolution time after escalation is given as 31 hours, but it is approximately 47 hours. These errors suggest sloppy recomputation and undermine the precision required for delay analysis, potentially misleading on the severity of bottlenecks.
- Minor unclarity: The 10–20x multiplier for delays understates Case 105 (37x vs. Case 103), and Case 104's investigation delay is not quantified in Section C, leaving the "prolonged investigation" category imbalanced.
- No mention of potential external factors (e.g., non-business hours, as hinted in the log's overnight gaps), which could have enriched root causes without speculation.

These issues, while not fatal to the overall conclusions, represent factual and logical inconsistencies in a time-sensitive task, warranting a deduction from an otherwise strong score (8.5+). The summary insight is solid but inherits the flaws.
