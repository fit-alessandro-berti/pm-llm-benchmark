8.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer effectively structures its response with clear tables, summaries, and sections that directly address all three tasks: (1) identifying normative violations per case with precise explanations tied to the rules (e.g., correctly flagging Case 2's out-of-order steps, missing "Inform Applicant," and illegal finalization, while confirming no issues in Cases 1 and 3); (2) identifying desiderata failures with clarification of their suboptimal (non-severe) nature (e.g., properly noting Case 3's timing delays and omitted follow-up as recommendations only, and deeming Case 2's N/A due to priority of normative fixes); and (3) providing plausible interpretations and justifications (e.g., system glitches, backlogs, or training issues) with actionable suggestions, aligning well with the constraints.

Strengths include logical flow, use of evidence from the log (e.g., timestamps for violations), and emphasis on severity differences. It is comprehensive without irrelevance, and conclusions are accurate overall.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, there is a minor but clear factual inaccuracy in Case 3's desiderata table: the credit check delay is stated as ">72 h," but calculation from 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 yields approximately 49 hours (not 72). This misstates the deviation's magnitude, even though the core identification (>24 h violation) remains correct. The interpretation's "three-day lag" is also slightly loose (it's ~2 days), introducing minor unclarity. These prevent a flawless score, warranting a deduction despite the answer's strong overall quality and self-correction potential (if any early flaws existed, they are absent here).
