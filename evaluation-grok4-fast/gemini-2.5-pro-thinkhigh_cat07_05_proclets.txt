This answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and well-structured, providing a clear, detailed breakdown of all three diagrams while using appropriate terminology (e.g., BPMN, UML) and correctly interpreting the flows, relationships, and example without any significant errors or omissions. The summary effectively integrates the parts into a cohesive overview. Minor deduction for slight interpretive phrasing (e.g., "Judge[s] results" could be more precisely "Judges results" as depicted), but it doesn't detract from the overall excellence.
