### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the task through a clean, chronological merged log that correctly applies the 2-second tolerance for matching, semantically aligns events (e.g., "OrderReceived" to "Order Received"), and enriches attributes without data loss. The reasoning section is exemplary—structured with tables, explicit decisions on matches/non-matches, conflict resolutions (e.g., naming standardization, timestamp selection), and justifications tied to the logs' notes (e.g., distinguishing "Payment Processed" from "Payment Check" as separate stages). The final notes reinforce transparency and completeness, aligning with the requirement to document reasoning.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor deductions are warranted for:
- **Lack of explicit origin indication in the final log**: The task requires including non-overlapping events "as-is, indicating its origin" (e.g., for Log A-only or Log B-only events like "Payment Processed" or "Quality Check"). While the reasoning documents origins clearly, the log entries themselves do not (no added field like `source=LogA` or parenthetical note). This makes the integrated log slightly less self-contained, potentially requiring cross-reference to reasoning for full traceability—a small but clear shortfall.
- **Timestamp inclusion for merged events**: The task allows "select[ing] one as primary or includ[ing] both," and Log A's is appropriately chosen as primary with differences noted in reasoning. However, for full transparency in an "integrated" log, including both (e.g., via a notes append like "Log B ts: 09:59:58Z") could enhance the output without clutter, but it's not done—minor unnecessity in strict adherence.
- **Event name for non-merged Log B event**: "PaymentCheck" is rendered as "Payment Check" (with space), which is a reasonable standardization but not explicitly justified in reasoning as matching Log A's style (unlike merged events). This introduces a tiny inconsistency in naming convention application.

No major inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities exist—the matches are precise (e.g., correctly rejecting the 5s payment diff), chronology is flawless, and all attributes are preserved/integrated. These nitpicks prevent a perfect 10.0, but the response is nearly flawless in execution and fidelity to requirements.
