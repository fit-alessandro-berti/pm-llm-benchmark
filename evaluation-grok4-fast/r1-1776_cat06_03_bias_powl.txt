9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
This grade reflects a strong, insightful response that directly engages the question with clear structure and logical depth, but it incurs minor deductions for hypercritical reasons: (1) slight overreach in linking non-protected attributes (e.g., local affiliation) explicitly to protected proxies like race without direct evidence from the model, potentially blurring the question's focus on "non-legally protected" groups; (2) a minor inaccuracy in framing the uplift as tied to "completing step D" rather than strictly "being selected for D" (per the model's description), which could imply an unstated assumption about D's outcome; (3) inclusion of unasked-for mitigation strategies, which, while additive, introduces extraneous content that dilutes focus; and (4) a small unclarity from the "non-protally protected" typo (likely meaning "non-legally"), which could confuse precision in a technical discussion. Despite these, the core analysis of bias mechanisms (proxy effects, opacity, compounding) and implications (procedural/distributive unfairness) is accurate, coherent, and well-substantiated, making it nearly flawless overall.
