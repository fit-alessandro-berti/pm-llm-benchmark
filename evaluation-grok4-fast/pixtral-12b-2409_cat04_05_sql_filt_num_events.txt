The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query precisely achieves the required filtering by computing event counts per `case_id` via CTE, then joining back to the full `event_log` and applying the exact `<= 6` condition to exclude unwanted cases while returning all events from qualifying cases. It handles grouping and filtering correctly without extraneous clauses, assumes no indexing issues (appropriate for the task), and works in DuckDB's SQL dialect. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the query components with no logical flaws, ambiguities, or omissions. No inaccuracies or minor issues detected under strict scrutiny.
