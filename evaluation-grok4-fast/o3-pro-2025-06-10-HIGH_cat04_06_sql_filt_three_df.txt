The provided SQL query is logically sound, efficient, and correctly implements the requirements: it accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using window functions (LEAD), properly calculates the time difference between the second and third activities (ts_2 - ts_1 > INTERVAL '5 days'), flags those cases for exclusion via DISTINCT, and returns all events from non-matching cases using a LEFT JOIN with NULL filtering. The use of partitioning by case_id and ordering by timestamp ensures correct handling of sequences without self-joins, and the final ORDER BY provides a clean, grouped output (though not strictly required). DuckDB syntax is appropriate, column quoting is consistent, and edge cases (e.g., insufficient events leading to NULL LEAD values) are implicitly handled by the WHERE conditions failing to match.

However, the accompanying explanation contains a minor but notable inaccuracy in point 3: it states that included cases are those that "have it but with 5 days between ‘Create Order’ and ‘Confirm Order’," which ambiguously implies exactly 5 days rather than 5 days (the correct inclusion criterion, as the SQL excludes only >5 days). This could confuse readers about the timing threshold, representing a clarity flaw despite the SQL being correct. No other issues (e.g., performance, syntax, or logical errors), but per the strict evaluation criteria, this unclarified wording prevents a perfect score.
