The final dictionary provides a syntactically correct Python structure with tuples as keys and (average, stddev) tuples as values, covering all sequential adjacent pairs in the described process order. However, it fails the core requirement to include a representative subset of pairs that are not only directly connected but eventually follow each other, such as non-adjacent examples (e.g., ('SS', 'RC'), ('OP', 'QI'), ('CA', 'DT')) to demonstrate complexity and separation by multiple steps—none are present, making it simplistic and non-compliant. The estimated times are arbitrary, unrealistically small, and inconsistent with a global supply chain context (e.g., procurement delays like SS to RC should be on the order of days/weeks in seconds like 86400+, not 100; stddevs like 0.001 are implausibly precise and irrelevant to process variability). No justification or realism in estimates, violating the instruction to produce meaningful approximations without explicit prompt numbers. Minor issues like missing AS in direct sequence context are compounded by these major logical and completeness flaws.
