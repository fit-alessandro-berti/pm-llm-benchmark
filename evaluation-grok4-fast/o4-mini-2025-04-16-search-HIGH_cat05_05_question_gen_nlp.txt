10.0

The provided answer is an exemplary response to the prompt. It delivers exactly 20 distinct, open-ended questions that are thoughtfully derived from the described supply chain process, emphasizing insights (e.g., Q6 on forecasting), potential issues (e.g., Q3 on stockouts), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q5 on digital visibility, Q20 on methodologies), and implications (e.g., Q4 on trade-offs, Q10 on currency effects). Each question is precise, relevant to specific elements of the process (e.g., suppliers, transportation, compliance, digital systems, after-sales), and free of any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws—such as misalignments with the description, vague phrasing, or irrelevant tangents. No extraneous content (e.g., no SQL queries, no introductions or explanations) is included; it is a clean, numbered list as required. This level of fidelity and depth warrants the maximum score.
