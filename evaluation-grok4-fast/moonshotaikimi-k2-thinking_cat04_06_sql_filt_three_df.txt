The provided SQL query correctly implements the requirements using a CTE to identify and exclude entire cases based on the exact consecutive sequence and timing condition. It employs LEAD window functions partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to verify direct succession without intervening events, accurately computes the timestamp difference between the second and third activities in the sequence, and filters out matching cases entirely from the final result set while preserving all events from non-matching cases. The syntax is valid for DuckDB, including interval handling and window definitions, and the ordering ensures a logical output. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical errors are present.
