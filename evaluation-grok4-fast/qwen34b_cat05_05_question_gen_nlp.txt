### Evaluation Rationale
The generated list delivers 20 relevant, open-ended questions that thoughtfully probe insights (e.g., Q5 on data analytics), potential issues (e.g., Q2 on disruptions), improvement strategies (e.g., Q7 on logistics optimization), and decision implications (e.g., Q20 on long-term sustainability). They align closely with the supply chain description, covering stages like R&D, sourcing, assembly, transportation, distribution, quality, ethics, and digital tools without any SQL queries or extraneous content beyond the list.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny:
- **Formatting and clarity flaw**: A garbled fragment ("1 qualities of the company’s supply chain?") appears between Q10 and Q11, disrupting the clean numbering and readability. This introduces unnecessary confusion, violating the "just list the questions" directive for a pristine output.
- **Minor repetition**: Q3 and Q18 both address quality consistency across international suppliers (one on ensuring it, the other on challenges), showing slight redundancy in theme despite subtle differences in phrasing.
- **Logical precision**: A few questions (e.g., Q4) could more explicitly tie to "time zones" mentioned in the process description for sharper insight, but this is nitpicking on scope rather than error.

These issues prevent a flawless score, docking points for polish and uniqueness, but the core content is strong, insightful, and on-topic, warranting a high mark.
