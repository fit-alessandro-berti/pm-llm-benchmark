## Final Solution
To extract all unique keys from a list of dictionaries in Python, you can use a set to collect the keys efficiently, as sets automatically ensure uniqueness. Once all keys are gathered, convert the set to a list to match your desired output format. This method is simple, efficient, and works well for most cases.

### Approach
1. **Initialize a Set**: Create an empty set to store unique keys.
2. **Iterate Over Dictionaries**: Loop through each dictionary in the list.
3. **Update the Set**: For each dictionary, add its keys to the set using the `update()` method, which handles adding multiple keys at once.
4. **Convert to List**: After processing all dictionaries, convert the set to a list and return it.

This approach has O(m + k) time complexity, where m is the number of dictionaries and k is the total number of keys across all dictionaries, making it efficient even for large inputs.

### Solution Code
```python
def get_unique_keys(dict_list):
    """
    Extracts a list of unique keys from a list of dictionaries.
    
    Parameters:
    dict_list (list): A list of dictionaries.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of unique keys.
    """
    unique_keys = set()
    for d in dict_list:
        unique_keys.update(d.keys())
    return list(unique_keys)

# Example usage
list_d = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 3, 'c': 4}, {'b': 5, 'd': 6}]
keys = get_unique_keys(list_d)
print(keys)  # Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] (order may vary in Python < 3.7)
```

### Explanation
1. **Function Definition**: The function `get_unique_keys` takes a list of dictionaries (`dict_list`) as input.
2. **Set Initialization**: An empty set `unique_keys` is created to hold the keys without duplicates.
3. **Loop and Update**: The for loop iterates over each dictionary `d`. The `d.keys()` method retrieves the keys of the current dictionary, and `unique_keys.update()` adds them to the set. If a key already exists in the set (e.g., 'a' from the first and second dictionaries), it is ignored.
4. **Conversion to List**: `list(unique_keys)` converts the set to a list. In Python 3.7+, sets preserve insertion order, so the output will likely be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` based on first appearance. For strict order preservation in older Python versions, consider using `collections.OrderedDict` instead.

This solution handles empty lists (returns an empty list) and dictionaries with no keys gracefully. If you need the keys sorted, add `return sorted(list(unique_keys))` at the end.
