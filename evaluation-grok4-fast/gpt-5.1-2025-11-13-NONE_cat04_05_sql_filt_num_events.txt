### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is excellent overall, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements with a correct, efficient, and standard SQL implementation that works seamlessly in DuckDB. It accurately identifies qualifying `case_id`s via a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then retrieves all events for those cases using an inner `JOIN`, ensuring no events from excluded cases are returned. The query is concise, logically sound, and produces the exact desired output: the full set of events from cases with 6 events total.

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Correctness**: The logic flawlessly filters cases (>6 events excluded) and returns all relevant events via `e.*`. The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` precisely matches "six or fewer."
- **Efficiency**: Subquery + `JOIN` is performant for this task, avoiding unnecessary scans or window functions.
- **Clarity**: Code is readable with meaningful aliases (`e` and `c`). The brief explanation directly ties to the query components, confirming intent without verbosity.
- **Completeness**: Handles the core grouping, filtering, and selection as specified. DuckDB compatibility is implicit (standard SQL).

**Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens)**:
- The `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp` clause is logically correct and enhances usability (e.g., for log analysis), but it's not required by the prompt, which only asks to "return the full set of events" without specifying ordering. This adds an unrequested element, potentially implying the output needs sorting when it's extraneous— a small overreach that could confuse if the benchmark expects exact minimalism. The explanation mitigates this by calling it "optional," but it still warrants a tiny deduction for not being purely responsive to the spec.
- No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: No syntax errors, no missed columns, no incorrect filtering (e.g., it doesn't accidentally include/exclude events), and the explanation avoids fluff.

This is nearly flawless; a perfect 10 would omit the `ORDER BY` entirely for stricter adherence, but the addition is harmless and arguably improves the query's practicality.
