2.0

### Grading Rationale
The answer fails catastrophically in preserving the required DECLARE dictionary format, introducing invalid, non-standard keys (e.g., "CheckApplicantRace" as top-level entries, duplicated keys, incorrect nesting like {"BiasCheck": {"StartApplication": {"Support": 1.0}}}), mismatched capitalization ("Support" vs. "support"), and extraneous invented keys (e.g., "ChainResponse", "CheckRequestAdditionalInfo") that do not exist in the specified DECLARE language. It alters the original structure (e.g., "exists" instead of "existence", missing or misplaced original constraints) without any valid additions that follow binary/unary rules. The purported bias-mitigating constraints are logically incoherent, do not enforce fairness (e.g., no proper use of precedence/response/non-succession to prevent biased sequences), and introduce undefined activities ("BiasCheck") without integration. The explanation is superficial, inaccurate (e.g., misrepresents how constraints handle "attributes present"), and omits per-constraint rationales as instructed. While it nods to bias reduction, it achieves none effectively, rendering the output unusable and unrelated to the task. Minor intent to address bias prevents a 1.0, but the flaws are pervasive and disqualifying.
