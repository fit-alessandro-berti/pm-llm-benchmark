### Evaluation Rationale
The final boxed answer directly addresses all three tasks with clear structure, accurate identification of long-duration cases (102, 104, 105) based on their multi-day spans versus the same-day resolutions of 101 and 103, and correct attribution of times without computational errors. Root causes are logically tied to observable patterns in the log (escalations in relevant cases, overnight gaps, and specific inter-activity waits like the 3.5-hour example), effectively explaining contributions to cycle times through process interruptions and non-working hours. Recommendations are practical, targeted, and directly mitigate the identified factors, providing actionable insights without fluff. Minor deductions for slight brevity in explicitly linking each factor's impact on cycle times (e.g., quantifying how escalations add ~28 hours in Case 105) and not defining "significantly longer" threshold explicitly, but no major inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws undermine the response.
