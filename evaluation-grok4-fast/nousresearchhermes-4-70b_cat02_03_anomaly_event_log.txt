### Evaluation Rationale
The final answer accurately identifies all key anomalies in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 while correctly deeming Case 1001 normal (implicitly, by omission). It relies on standard P2P knowledge (e.g., approval before PO, three-way matching before payment, goods receipt before or concurrent with invoicing/payment) without fabrication. Explanations are precise, directly tied to timestamps, and logically explain risks (e.g., fraud, financial loss, compliance issues) without overgeneralization or irrelevance.

Strengths (supporting high score):
- **Completeness:** Covers the primary deviations: skipped/mis-timed approval (1002), premature payment without verification (1002, 1003), and reversed goods/PO sequence (1004). No false positives.
- **Clarity and Structure:** Numbered points, issue statements, and problem explanations are concise, unambiguous, and reader-friendly. Summary reinforces impacts without redundancy.
- **Logical Flow:** Each anomaly links sequence violations to real-world business consequences, demonstrating sound reasoning.

Minor Deductions (strict/hypercritical lens):
- In Case 1002, it omits explicit mention of goods receipt *after* payment (a clear reversal), though the "payment before goods" point covers it indirectly; this is a tiny gap in exhaustiveness, not an inaccuracy.
- No explicit note on Case 1002's approval occurring *after* PO/payment, but the "missing approval before PO" phrasing implies the bypass effectively.

Overall, the answer is nearly flawless—precise, evidence-based, and directly responsive to the task—with only negligible room for deeper enumeration of secondary issues in one case.
