The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements: it uses a subquery to group by `case_id`, applies `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify qualifying cases, and then filters the full `event_log` to return all events from those cases via `WHERE case_id IN (...)`. The syntax is standard and fully compatible with DuckDB. The optional explanation accurately describes the logic without introducing errors or extraneous details. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws detected.
