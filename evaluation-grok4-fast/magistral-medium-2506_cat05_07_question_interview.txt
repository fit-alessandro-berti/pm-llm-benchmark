The provided answer delivers a comprehensive, well-organized list of 23 open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's objectives. They systematically probe missing details (e.g., common deficiencies, inspection failures), decision criteria (e.g., tenant selection factors, pricing alignment), roles and responsibilities (e.g., approval authority, compliance teams), timing and sequencing (e.g., typical timeframe, handoffs), and exception handling (e.g., non-standard terms, disputes) across relevant process stages. The categorical structure enhances clarity without introducing irrelevancies, and no questions solicit SQL queries or technical implementation details—focusing instead on conceptual insights like workflows, protocols, and adaptations. The closing summary succinctly reinforces the questions' purpose in mapping the process, and the meta-note on follow-ups logically extends the exploratory intent without detracting from the core output. No inaccuracies, redundancies, ambiguities, or logical inconsistencies are present; the response is precise, exhaustive, and flawlessly tailored to the scenario.
