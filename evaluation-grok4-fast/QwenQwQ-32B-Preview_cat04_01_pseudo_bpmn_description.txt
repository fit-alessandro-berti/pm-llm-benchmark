### Evaluation Summary
The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the business process as depicted in the pseudo-BPMN, focusing on the final structured sections (bullet-point purposes, differences between request types, and triggers for approvals/rework). It effectively covers the purpose of each major step, interprets gateways correctly (e.g., XOR as exclusive decision points for branching based on conditions like request type or feasibility; AND as a parallel split for simultaneous checks with an implied join), and describes path convergence (e.g., standard and custom paths merge at the post-processing XOR gateway for approval check, leading to shared tasks G and I) and looping (rework via Task H redirects specifically to E1 for custom or D for standard to allow adjustments without restarting the entire process). Differences between standard (validation, parallel checks, delivery calculation) and custom (feasibility analysis, potential quotation vs. rejection) paths are clearly delineated, emphasizing efficiency for standard and deeper assessment for custom. Triggers for approvals (post-initial processing via the "Is Approval Needed?" XOR, potentially for complex or high-value cases, though not explicitly detailed in the diagram) and rework (only if approval denied, enabling targeted re-evaluation) are well-explained, aligning closely with the representation.

Minor deductions for: (1) slight speculation on approval triggers ("custom requests might always require approval, or... above a certain value"), which introduces unsubstantiated conditions not present in the diagram, creating a small logical overreach; (2) implicit but unaddressed nuance that rejected custom requests (via E2) bypass invoice/confirmation entirely, though this is correctly noted as ending early without penalty in the narrative. These are trivial but warrant strict reduction from perfection; the response is otherwise precise, logical, and thorough without ambiguities or omissions.
