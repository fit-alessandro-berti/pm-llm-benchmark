The provided answer is a flawless solution to the prompt. The SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id` via `GROUP BY` and `COUNT(*)`, then performs an efficient INNER JOIN back to the `event_log` table to retrieve all rows (via `event_log.*`) for qualifying cases, with the `WHERE` clause accurately filtering for `event_count <= 6`. This precisely excludes cases with more than six events while returning the full set of events for the rest, adhering strictly to the requirements without unnecessary complexity, assumptions, or errors. The breakdown is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the query's logic, adding value without introducing any inaccuracies or unclarities. No logical flaws, inefficiencies, or deviations from the task exist—even under hypercritical scrutiny.
