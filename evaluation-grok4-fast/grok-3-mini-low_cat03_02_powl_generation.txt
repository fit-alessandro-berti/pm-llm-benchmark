The provided code accurately constructs the POWL model, faithfully representing the scenario's sequential dependencies, concurrent blocks (DA/ACI and QA/SA with no intra-edges), loop (BNC as the main body, D&R as the optional re-do with correct Operator.LOOP semantics), and exclusive choice (CD vs. MD with Operator.XOR). All transitions use precise labels matching the scenario. The root StrictPartialOrder includes all sub-nodes, and edges enforce the exact prerequisites (e.g., parallel blocks complete fully before successors). No unnecessary silent transitions are introduced. The accompanying explanation is clear, precise, and aligns perfectly with the code and POWL definitions.
