The provided answer is exemplary and flawless in its execution. It accurately groups all 18 events into three distinct cases based on patient demographics (age and gender as unique identifiers), departmental consistency, temporal sequencing, and logical clinical workflows, with no omissions, misattributions, or contradictions. Each case's events form a coherent patient journey: Case A follows a standard ER trauma pathway (registration  triage  imaging  consultation  discharge); Case B aligns with an ER diagnostic/treatment flow (registration  triage  lab request/completion  consultation  prescription  discharge); Case C matches a scheduled surgical progression (registration  consultation  preparation  procedure  recovery  discharge). The rationale succinctly justifies the inferences without redundancy or error, and the presentation is clear, structured, and precise, enhancing readability while preserving all relevant attributes. No minor issues, ambiguities, or logical gaps exist.
