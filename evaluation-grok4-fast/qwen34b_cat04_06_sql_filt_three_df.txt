The provided answer is nearly flawless in its implementation and interpretation of the prompt. It correctly uses a CTE with `ROW_NUMBER()` to order events per case, self-joins to identify any three consecutive events matching the exact sequence (not restricted to the start of the case), applies the >5-day filter precisely on the relevant timestamps, and excludes entire matching cases via `NOT IN` while returning all events from non-matching cases. The DuckDB syntax (e.g., `INTERVAL '5 days'`, window functions) is appropriate, the explanation is accurate and concise, and there are no logical flaws, inefficiencies, or ambiguities. Minor stylistic notes (e.g., potential for `LAG` as an alternative but unnecessary) do not detract, as this meets all requirements strictly.
