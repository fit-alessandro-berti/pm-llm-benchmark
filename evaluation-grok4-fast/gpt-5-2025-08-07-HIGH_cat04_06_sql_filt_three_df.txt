The provided SQL query is a near-flawless implementation of the requirements. It correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using LEAD functions partitioned and ordered by case_id and timestamp, ensuring no intervening events. The timing filter accurately computes the interval between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that sequence using DuckDB-compatible datetime arithmetic and interval comparison. The exclusion logic via NOT EXISTS on distinct case_ids properly filters out entire cases meeting both criteria, while returning all columns from qualifying cases. The final ordering by case_id and timestamp is logical and aligns with the prompt's call for proper ordering. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; all edge cases (e.g., incomplete sequences yielding NULL LEAD values, multiple sequences per case) are handled implicitly and correctly by the window functions and DISTINCT.
