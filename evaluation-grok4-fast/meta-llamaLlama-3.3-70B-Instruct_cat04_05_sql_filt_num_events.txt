The provided answer is correct, clear, and logically sound with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. The SQL query precisely achieves the task using standard, efficient grouping (GROUP BY), aggregate filtering (HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6), and subquery-based selection (IN clause), ensuring only events from qualifying cases are returned. The explanation accurately describes the mechanics without extraneous details or errors, aligning perfectly with the prompt's requirements. No optimizations are strictly needed beyond this, and the approach is DuckDB-compatible.
