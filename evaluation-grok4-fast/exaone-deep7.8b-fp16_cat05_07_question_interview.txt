The provided answer delivers a highly structured, comprehensive list of 16 open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's objectives. It systematically uncovers missing details (e.g., document criteria in Q2), probes decision criteria (e.g., prioritization in Q8), clarifies roles and responsibilities (e.g., training in Q14), verifies timing and sequencing (e.g., bottlenecks in Q13), and explores exception handling (e.g., specialized needs in Q11). The sectional organization enhances readability without redundancy, and all questions remain conceptual, avoiding any prohibited elements like SQL or technical implementation. Minor thematic overlaps (e.g., compliance in Q6 and Q15) reflect thorough coverage rather than flaws, and phrasing is consistently clear, targeted, and engaging for an interviewee. The concluding summary reinforces the intent without extraneous content.
