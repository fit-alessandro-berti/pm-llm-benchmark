### Explanation of Grade
The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and the compliant ones (1 and 4), with generally clear structure, use of tables, LaTeX for sequence notation, and references to the normative text. The explanations for Cases 2 and 5 are accurate and comprehensive, directly tying deviations to specific rules (e.g., ordering constraints and mandatory steps).

However, the explanation for Case 3 is incomplete and thus inaccurate. It only addresses the "Ship order" after "Cancel order" (a valid violation), but overlooks a critical additional deviation: "Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory" but before "Cancel order," which implies the inventory was insufficient (per the normative branching rule tying cancellation to insufficient stock). The description explicitly states that payment authorization "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and should occur only in the sufficient-inventory path—yet here it precedes cancellation, violating the post-check branching logic and the constraint against authorizing payment in insufficient scenarios. This omission means the full set of violations in Case 3 is not explained, representing a logical flaw and failure to fully interpret the normative conditions. Under hypercritical evaluation, this significant inaccuracy (missing a key rule violation central to the process branching) prevents a higher score, despite the otherwise strong organization and partial correctness.
