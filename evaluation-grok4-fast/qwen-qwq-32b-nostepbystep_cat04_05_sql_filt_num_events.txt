The provided answer delivers a correct and efficient SQL query that precisely meets the task requirements: it uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the main query with `IN` to return all events from those cases only. This handles grouping, counting, and filtering accurately without unnecessary complexity, and it preserves all original columns (via `SELECT *`).

The explanation is clear, structured, and logically sound, breaking down the subquery and main query components effectively. The key points reinforce the approach's efficiency and correctness.

A minor deduction is applied for imprecise wording in the final sentence ("valid cases (with 6 events)"), which omits "or fewer" despite the query and earlier explanation correctly specifying `<= 6`. This is a small clarity flaw but does not impact functionality.
