9.0

### Grading Rationale
This answer is strong in structure, evidence-based analysis, and coverage of the question's requirements (identifying bias in Group B, explaining its manifestation via the +5 adjustment mechanism with specific log examples, and discussing implications for fairness/equity). It uses tables and sections for clarity, contrasts Group A effectively as unbiased, and provides a logical conclusion with recommendations. The core reasoning is sound, demonstrating a deep understanding of algorithmic bias in hiring.

However, under hypercritical evaluation:
- **Minor logical imprecision (penalized -1.0)**: In Section 1 and 2b, the answer claims U002 has a "higher" raw CulturalFit score (60) than U001/U003's raw scores, citing "(60 vs. 58)". This is inaccurate for U001, where 60 equals 60 (it's only higher than U003's 58). While the overall point about disadvantage holds (due to the lack of boost), this phrasing introduces a subtle factual error in comparison, undermining precision. It could confuse readers about the exact threshold effects.
- **Slight unclarity in phrasing (penalized -0.0, but noted)**: The table in Section 1 has a formatting glitch ("60  65" instead of "60  65"), but this is cosmetic and doesn't affect comprehension.
- No other inaccuracies, gaps, or flaws; the rest is flawless in accuracy, logic, and completeness.

This earns a high but not perfect score—excellent work with one avoidable slip that a flawless response would eliminate.
