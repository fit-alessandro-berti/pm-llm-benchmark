This answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and insightful. It systematically breaks down every key element of the diagram (objects, volumes, activities, flows, timings, starts/ends) with precise details that align perfectly with the visual. The summary interpretation adds meaningful value by highlighting patterns like bottlenecks and path differences without speculation or errors. Minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning a couple of arrow colors (e.g., dark blue for PurchaseOrderItem) in the "at a glance" section, but this doesn't detract from the overall excellence.
