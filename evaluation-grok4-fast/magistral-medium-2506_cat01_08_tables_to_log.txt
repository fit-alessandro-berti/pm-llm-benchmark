### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is comprehensive in integrating data across tables, correctly identifying cases via `order_id`, deriving logical activity names (e.g., separate "Item Picked" events per line item, multiple "Order Dispatched"/"Order Arrived" for split deliveries, and linking invoices/payments appropriately), mapping timestamps, and enriching with resources (e.g., sales persons, pickers, carriers, billing clerks) and attributes (e.g., quantities, notes, amounts, methods). All events from the tables are included without omission, even for incomplete cases like 1004 (no delivery/invoice, so only creation and picking). Assumptions are explicitly documented and reasonable (e.g., separate events for multi-item picks and split deliveries). The Markdown table format is clean and structured as required.

However, under strict scrutiny, there is a significant logical flaw in chronological ordering within Case ID 1002: the second "Order Dispatched" event (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z) is listed after the first "Order Arrived" event (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z), despite its earlier timestamp. This violates the prompt's explicit requirement to "ensure that the chronological order reflects the real process flow" and to place events "in sequence," potentially misleading process mining analysis (e.g., implying dispatch after arrival, which disrupts causal flow). All other cases are correctly sequenced, and data linkages are accurate, but this inaccuracy in presentation for one case (with multiple sub-events) prevents a higher score. Minor unclarities, such as truncating the delivery note for 1005 ("Fragile items" vs. full "Fragile items, handle with care") and not including `customer_id` in "Other Attributes" (though optional), are noted but not heavily penalized as they do not affect core correctness. Overall, the answer is strong but not nearly flawless due to the sequencing error.
