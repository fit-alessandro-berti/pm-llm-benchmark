The provided answer is strong overall, with clear, correct SQL for the primary query using a CTE and JOIN, which precisely meets the requirements: it identifies cases with 6 events, filters appropriately, and returns exactly the original event columns (`el.*`) without extras. The explanation accurately describes the logic and benefits. The ORDER BY clauses are sensible additions (though not strictly required) and correctly reference the schema.

However, the alternative window function query introduces a minor but notable flaw: the outer `SELECT *` includes the extra `events_per_case` column, altering the output schema beyond "the full set of events" from the original table. This violates the intent of returning unmodified event data, creating an inaccuracy in the alternative approach. While the first query is flawless and the explanation notes efficiency correctly, presenting a non-exact alternative without addressing the schema difference warrants a deduction under hypercritical evaluation. No other logical errors, but this prevents a perfect score.
