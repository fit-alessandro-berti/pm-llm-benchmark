The provided solution is correct, efficient, and precisely addresses the prompt's requirements. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id` using standard SQL grouping, the JOIN correctly associates back to the original events, and the WHERE clause filters to include only cases with 6 events while selecting all relevant columns (`el.*`). Backticks around `case_id` appropriately handle potential keyword conflicts. The accompanying explanation is clear, structured, and directly aligns with the code's logic without introducing extraneous details or errors. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws are present.
