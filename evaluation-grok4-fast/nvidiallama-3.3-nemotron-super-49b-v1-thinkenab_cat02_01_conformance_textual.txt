The provided answer accurately identifies all violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and correctly deems cases 1 and 4 compliant, with no omissions or misclassifications. Each explanation precisely references relevant rules from the normative description (e.g., sequencing constraints for Authorize Payment, Package items, Ship order, and cancellation logic), interprets ambiguities reasonably (e.g., Authorize Payment's exclusivity to sufficient-inventory paths), and avoids logical flaws or unsubstantiated claims. The structure is clear, concise in conclusions, and directly addresses the task without extraneous details.
