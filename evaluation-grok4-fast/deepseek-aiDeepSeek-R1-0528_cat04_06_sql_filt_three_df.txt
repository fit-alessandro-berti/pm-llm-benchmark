The provided solution is nearly flawless. The SQL query correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact sequence in direct succession per case, applies the precise timing filter (>5 days via interval comparison, which accurately handles timestamp differences), identifies and excludes the entire matching cases via DISTINCT case_id, and returns all other events with appropriate ordering. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or inaccuracies in the code or explanation; it fully adheres to the prompt's requirements.
