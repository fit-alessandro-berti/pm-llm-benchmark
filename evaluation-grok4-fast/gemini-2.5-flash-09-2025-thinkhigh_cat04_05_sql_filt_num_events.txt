The provided answer is nearly flawless: both solutions correctly implement the required two-step logic (grouping/counting with filtering via HAVING or window function, followed by retrieval of full events for qualifying cases). They accurately use DuckDB-compatible SQL, select only the specified columns, handle grouping precisely, and produce the exact desired output without extraneous data or errors. The brief explanations are clear, accurate, and highlight key aspects (e.g., performance notes in Solution 2 are valid for DuckDB's optimizer). No inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities exist; providing two valid approaches enhances completeness without redundancy or confusion.
