The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and standards-compliant DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it uses a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) > 6` to identify and exclude cases with more than six events, while returning all events (via `SELECT *`) from the remaining cases. The logic handles grouping accurately, filters appropriately for 6 events, and includes a clear, concise explanation without any ambiguities, logical flaws, or unnecessary complexity.
