The provided answer is exemplary in its accuracy, clarity, and logical structure. It correctly identifies the compliant cases (1 and 4) and violating cases (2, 3, and 5) with no errors in sequence analysis or interpretation of the normative description. Explanations are precise, directly referencing key norms (e.g., ordering constraints on Authorize, Package, Ship, and Cancel) while resolving implied ambiguities (e.g., Authorize implying sufficient inventory, making post-Authorize Cancel illogical). The case-by-case format is comprehensive yet concise, and the summary reinforces violations without redundancy or omission. No factual inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws are present; it demonstrates thorough adherence to the task.
