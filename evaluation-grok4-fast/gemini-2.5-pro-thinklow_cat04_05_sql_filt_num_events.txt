### Evaluation Rationale
This response is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a deep understanding of benchmark design principles for SQL tasks. It transforms the original draft into a more robust, testable prompt while maintaining fidelity to the core requirements. The additions (e.g., sample data, expected output, structured sections) directly address common pitfalls in ambiguous prompts, making it ideal for AI evaluation or automated testing in DuckDB. The critique is insightful, balanced, and evidence-based, highlighting genuine improvements without unnecessary criticism.

**Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens):**
- **Wording Inconsistency (-0.1):** The opening calls the original an "excellent draft" and "very clear and well-defined," but later suggests elevating it "from a good prompt to an excellent" one. This subtle shift could imply the original was merely "good," creating a tiny logical tension, though it's not misleading.
- **Over-Specification Edge (-0.1):** The revised prompt mandates a "single" SQL query, which the original did not. While this encourages concise solutions (e.g., via CTEs or subqueries), it might slightly constrain creative but valid multi-query approaches if the benchmark evolves. However, this is a nitpick, as the original implied a single query implicitly.

No inaccuracies in SQL syntax, logic, or sample data—everything executes correctly in DuckDB (verified mentally: counts are accurate, filters work as intended, output matches 3+6=9 rows excluding B). No unclarities; the structure is pristine. This merits a near-perfect score for its precision and utility.
