The provided answer is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements with utmost precision. It correctly employs window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact consecutive sequence across cases, accurately computes the time difference between the relevant events using DuckDB-compatible syntax, and excludes entire cases meeting both criteria via a clean LEFT JOIN anti-pattern, returning all events from non-excluded cases without extraneous operations. The explanation is clear, logical, and directly supports the code without inaccuracies or ambiguities. Minor stylistic notes (e.g., no explicit final ORDER BY, though not required) do not detract, as the solution is efficient, correct, and fully compliant.
