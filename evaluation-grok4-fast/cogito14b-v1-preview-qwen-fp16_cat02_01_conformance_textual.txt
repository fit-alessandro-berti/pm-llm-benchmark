7.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and non-violating ones (1 and 4), aligning well with the normative description's constraints on sequencing (e.g., authorize before package, ship only after package and never after cancel, close as final). This shows solid overall comprehension.

However, under hypercritical evaluation:
- **Case 2 explanation**: Accurate and directly references the description without flaws.
- **Case 3 explanation**: Correctly highlights the key violation (ship after cancel), but is incomplete—it overlooks the illogical "Cancel" after "Authorize payment" (which implies sufficient inventory per the branching logic) and the absence of "Package items" before "Ship." This creates a logical gap in fully interpreting the process ambiguities.
- **Case 5 explanation**: Contains a factual inaccuracy by claiming the case "skips [authorization] entirely" and "proceed[s] directly from checking inventory to shipping." The log shows authorization occurs after check and before ship; the true violation is skipping "Package items" between authorize and ship. This misstates the sequence, undermining the explanation's reliability despite correctly flagging the case as violating.
- Minor issues: The "Cases Without Violations" section is concise but could more explicitly reference the description for completeness. No broader logical flaws or unclarities in structure, but the inaccuracies prevent a flawless score.

The answer is strong on identification (deserving of high marks) but flawed in precise, comprehensive explanations, warranting a deduction for not being "nearly flawless."
