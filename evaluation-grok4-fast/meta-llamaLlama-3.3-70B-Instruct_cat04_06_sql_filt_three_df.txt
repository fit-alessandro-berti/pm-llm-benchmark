The provided answer is nearly flawless in its correctness, clarity, and completeness. It accurately interprets the requirements, constructs a logically sound SQL query using CTEs to identify the exact sequence via timestamp-ordered joins and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries (ensuring no intervening events for direct succession), computes the time difference correctly for DuckDB (using interval comparison), and excludes the matching cases as specified while returning all events from non-matching cases. The explanation is precise, step-by-step, and reinforces the query's intent without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even potential edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case) are handled via `DISTINCT`. Minor optimizations (e.g., for performance) are irrelevant here, as the focus is on functional correctness.
