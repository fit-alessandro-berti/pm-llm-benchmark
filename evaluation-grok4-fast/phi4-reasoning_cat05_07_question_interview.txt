10.0

The provided answer delivers a precise, well-organized list of 11 targeted, open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's goals. Each question effectively probes for missing details (e.g., verification steps), decision criteria (e.g., prioritization metrics), roles and responsibilities (e.g., decision-makers for exceptions), timing and sequencing (e.g., timelines for issue resolution), and exception handling (e.g., custom requirements). The categorical structure enhances readability without introducing unnecessary implementation details, and the concluding sentence reinforces the conceptual focus without detracting from the core output. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
