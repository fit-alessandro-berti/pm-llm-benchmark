The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly identifies cases with the specified consecutive sequence of activities using window functions (LEAD) partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp, ensuring direct succession with no intervening events. It accurately filters for the time condition (>5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps) within that sequence and excludes all events from matching cases, returning the rest from the original table. Syntax is appropriate for DuckDB, including INTERVAL handling, and there are no logical flaws, ambiguities, or unnecessary operations.
