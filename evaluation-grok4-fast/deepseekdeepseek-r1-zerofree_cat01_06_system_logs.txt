7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting higher score):** The final table is a clean, complete transformation of all 26 log events into a standard event log format with required attributes (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp). Cases are logically grouped by document/window, creating coherent per-file narratives suitable for process mining (e.g., Document1.docx spans initial editing, pause, and resumption). Timestamps are preserved accurately, and the overall structure is analyst-friendly, with events in chronological order. Activity names are mostly meaningful and elevated from raw logs (e.g., "TYPING" to "Edit Document"), inferring higher-level steps like document editing or email handling.
  
- **Weaknesses (strict deductions for flaws):** Even focusing only on the final table (ignoring <think> verbosity), there are logical inconsistencies and inaccuracies: (1) Activity names lack full standardization (e.g., multiple "Edit Document" variants but app-specific "Scroll Email" vs. "Scroll PDF"; overly verbose "Open Email about Annual Meeting" vs. generic "Open Document"). (2) Inconsistent case starts (e.g., no "Open" activity for Report_Draft.pdf or Email - Inbox, unlike FOCUS-based opens for Word/Excel). (3) Misnamed refocus as "Open Document" (e.g., second Quarterly_Report.docx event). (4) SWITCH events awkwardly embedded as case activities (e.g., "Switch To Email Inbox" ends Document1.docx prematurely, distorting flow). (5) Abrupt case endings (e.g., PDF case lacks closure, jumping to Excel). (6) No required explanation/summary in the final output (task mandates it post-table; boxed response omits it, making the answer incomplete). These are not minor— they undermine coherence and analytical utility, preventing a near-flawless score. A single overarching session case could have been more narrative-driven, but per-document is plausible yet flawed in execution.
