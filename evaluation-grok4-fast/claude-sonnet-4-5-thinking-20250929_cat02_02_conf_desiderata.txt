### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured analysis that directly addresses all three tasks with precision and depth. It correctly identifies normative violations (e.g., Case 2's ordering issue, missing "Inform Applicant," and prohibited finalization) and desiderata failures (e.g., Case 3's precise delay calculations and missing follow-up across cases), while providing balanced interpretations and justifications without speculation beyond the evidence. The inclusion of impacts, a summary table, and actionable recommendations enhances clarity and utility, aligning with the task's spirit.

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Accuracy:** All factual claims match the event log and rules (e.g., Case 2 has exactly three distinct normative violations; timings in Case 3 are calculated correctly as 49h and 51h excesses).
- **Completeness:** Covers every case for both normative and desiderata sections, clarifies desiderata as "not severe" (e.g., "suboptimal" phrasing), and offers plausible interpretations (e.g., systemic errors for Case 2, capacity issues for Case 3).
- **Clarity and Structure:** Logical flow with bolded violations, bullet points, and a table; explanations are concise yet explanatory.
- **Logical Rigor:** No contradictions; distinguishes strict rules from recommendations effectively (e.g., notes Case 2's desiderata as "overshadowed" by normative issues).

**Hypercritical Deductions (Minor Flaws Preventing a Perfect 10.0):**
- **Unclarities (0.1 deduction):** In Case 1's normative summary, "Credit Check (09:30) > Risk Assessment (10:00)" uses ">" ambiguously (implies mathematical comparison rather than sequence); context makes it clear, but it's imprecise wording.
- **Minor Overreach (0.1 deduction):** In Case 3's interpretation, speculating on "weekend or holiday intervening (Jan 12 was Friday, Jan 14 was Sunday/Monday?)" introduces a factual quibble—2024-01-14 is a Sunday, but the "?" adds unnecessary hedging without evidence; it's a reasonable justification but verges on unsubstantiated assumption.
- These are trivial and do not undermine the core analysis, but under hypercritical standards, they warrant a slight reduction from flawless.

Overall, this is nearly impeccable—rewarding a very high score for thoroughness and fidelity to the prompt.
