### Evaluation Rationale
This query is strong overall, correctly addressing the core requirements: it extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `row_number()` tied to timestamps (with a stable tie-breaker via `activity`), represents variants as aggregated sequences for grouping, counts cases per variant, ranks and limits to the top K by frequency (with deterministic tie-breaking), filters cases accordingly, and returns all original events for those cases in a logical order. It uses standard DuckDB SQL features effectively and is parameterized for K.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor but notable issues prevent a perfect score:
- **Separator vulnerability in `string_agg` (major deduction trigger)**: Using `'->'` as the delimiter assumes activity names do not contain `'->'`. If an activity name includes this substring (possible, as the prompt doesn't restrict names), sequences could concatenate incorrectly (e.g., activities "A->B" and "C" might produce ambiguous strings like "A->B->C"), leading to incorrect variant grouping or counting. A more robust approach (e.g., `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` for exact sequence comparison without separators, or a guaranteed-unique delimiter like `CHR(1)`) would avoid this logical flaw. This is a significant inaccuracy in handling arbitrary data.
- **Unused computation**: The `n_events` column in the `ordered` CTE is calculated but never referenced, introducing unnecessary overhead (minor inefficiency, but flagged as a pointless addition that could confuse readers or imply incomplete intent).
- **Tie-breaking in ordering**: The `row_number()` uses `ORDER BY timestamp, activity` for determinism, which is reasonable but goes beyond the prompt's strict "sorting by timestamp" (ties could be undefined or stable by primary key if available). This is a minor overreach, though harmless.
- **Lack of explicit handling for edge cases**: No consideration for empty cases (zero events, yielding empty `variant_seq`) or K=0 (returns nothing, which is fine but unstated). Ties in frequency are broken lexicographically on `variant_seq`, which is deterministic but not specified in the prompt (acceptable, but could lead to non-intuitive top-K if sequences are long strings).

The query is nearly flawless in structure and logic for typical clean data, executing correctly in DuckDB without syntax errors. It earns a high score but loses 1.0 point primarily for the separator flaw (a logical inaccuracy that could fail on real-world data) and 0.0 for the unused column (nitpicky but per strictness).
