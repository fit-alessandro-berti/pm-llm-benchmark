The provided answer is a correct, efficient, and complete DuckDB SQL query that precisely addresses all requirements. It uses window functions (ROW_NUMBER) and self-joins to identify consecutive events in the specified order per case, applies the exact timing filter (>5 days using valid DuckDB INTERVAL syntax), collects distinct case_ids to exclude, and returns all events from non-matching cases. The structure with CTEs is clean, avoids unnecessary complexity, and handles potential duplicates appropriately. The accompanying explanation accurately describes the logic without errors or omissions. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even minor aspects like column handling and assumption of timestamp ordering for event logs align perfectly with the event log context.
