The provided answer constructs a valid and comprehensive temporal profile dictionary that aligns closely with the prompt's requirements. It includes a representative subset of 16 pairs (9 direct and 7 non-consecutive), capturing complexity through multi-step separations (e.g., ('SS', 'AS') spanning the full process). Estimates are realistic and logically derived from supply chain domain knowledge, with averages and standard deviations in seconds (e.g., 10-day lead time for ('OP', 'RC') at 864,000 seconds, and propagated variances for non-consecutive pairs using sqrt(sum of squares), rounded appropriately). The linear process assumption is reasonable given the scenario's description of sequential steps. The explanation reinforces the methodology without introducing contradictions.

Minor deduction for inline comments within the dictionary literal, which render it syntactically invalid Python (comments must be outside the dict structure); removing them would yield flawless code. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
