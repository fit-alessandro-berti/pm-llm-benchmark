10.0

This SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely addresses the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately identifies qualifying `case_id`s via aggregation in the subquery (`GROUP BY` with `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`), then retrieves the full event rows for those cases using a standard inner join, ensuring only events from cases with six or fewer events are returned. No unnecessary columns, filters, or conditions are introduced, and the syntax is valid for DuckDB. Even under hypercritical scrutiny, there are no minor issues—such as potential performance concerns (the double scan is inherent and acceptable for this logic) or edge cases (e.g., empty table, single-event cases, or ties at exactly six events)—that detract from its perfection.
