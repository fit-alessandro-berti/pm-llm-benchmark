The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless, accurately addressing all requirements of the prompt with precise logic, correct use of window functions for direct succession, proper time interval filtering, and exclusion of matching cases while returning all events from non-matching cases in the specified order. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even minor potential concerns (e.g., timestamp tie-handling) are not issues given the prompt's assumptions.
