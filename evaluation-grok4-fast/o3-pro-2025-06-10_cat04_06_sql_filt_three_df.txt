### Evaluation Summary
This solution is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a deep understanding of the requirements with precise use of window functions (LEAD) to enforce direct succession without gaps, accurate timestamp differencing for the >5-day condition, and correct exclusion logic at the case level. The query is efficient, readable, and DuckDB-compatible (e.g., INTERVAL syntax). The accompanying explanation reinforces the logic without redundancy or error. It fully satisfies the prompt: identifies qualifying sequences, applies the timing filter, excludes matching cases entirely, and returns all non-excluded events with sensible ordering.

### Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens)
- **0.1 deduction for potential edge-case handling**: The query assumes strict timestamp ordering per case_id with no ties (e.g., if two events share the exact timestamp, LEAD might not behave as "direct succession" intends, potentially misclassifying). While rare and not explicitly addressed in the prompt, a hypercritical review notes the lack of explicit handling (e.g., via ROW_NUMBER() for ties), though this doesn't break correctness in standard event logs.
- **0.1 deduction for over-specification**: The final ORDER BY is beneficial but not required by the prompt ("proper ordering" is vague); it adds unnecessary computation for large logs, though minor.

No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities—only these nitpicks prevent a perfect 10.0. The answer is nearly flawless and warrants top-tier scoring.
