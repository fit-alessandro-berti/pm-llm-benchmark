9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This answer is strong overall, providing a correct and efficient primary solution using a correlated subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, which precisely meets the requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with 6 events and returns the full set of events (via `SELECT *`) for those cases only. The query is syntactically valid for DuckDB (which supports standard SQL), logically sound, and avoids unnecessary complexity. The accompanying comment clearly explains the logic, enhancing clarity.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several minor issues prevent a perfect score:
- **Second query incompleteness (major deduction point)**: The alternative window function approach is conceptually valid and potentially more performant for large datasets (as noted), but it explicitly selects only `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` rather than all columns (e.g., via `SELECT *`). The problem specifies returning the "full set of events" from a table with "at least" those columns, implying all available columns should be included to represent complete events. The comment "Add other columns if necessary" acknowledges this but does not implement it, leaving the query as-written incomplete and non-compliant. This is a logical flaw, as it could omit data (e.g., if columns like `resource` or `cost` exist).
- **Unnecessary aliasing and minor verbosity**: In the first query, aliasing the outer table as `t1` is fine but slightly redundant since it's not joined; a simpler `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (...)` would suffice without loss of clarity. The second query's CTE includes the `event_count` column in the intermediate step but excludes it in the final `SELECT` (correctly), but the phrasing "excluding 'event_count' if it's not needed" introduces slight ambiguity about output requirements.
- **Performance claim unsubstantiated**: The alternative is touted for "potentially better performance on very large datasets," but this is not universally true in DuckDB (subqueries can be optimized similarly via its vectorized engine). While not inaccurate, it's a vague assertion without evidence, which could mislead in a strict technical context.
- **No explicit ordering or handling of edge cases**: Neither query addresses potential needs like ordering by `timestamp` (common for event logs) or handling NULLs in `case_id`, but the problem doesn't require it. Still, hypercritically, this misses an opportunity for robustness in a real-world event log scenario.

These are not fatal errors—the primary query is nearly flawless and solves the problem correctly—but the issues (especially the second query's column selection) warrant a deduction from perfection. A score above 9.0 would require both solutions to be impeccably complete and the answer to avoid any interpretive wiggle room.
