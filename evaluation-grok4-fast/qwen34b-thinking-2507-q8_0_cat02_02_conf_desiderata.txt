### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is a near-perfect response to the task, warranting the maximum score under the hypercritical criteria. It accurately identifies normative violations (exclusively in Case 2, with precise explanations tied directly to the rules, such as sequence reversal and post-rejection documentation), correctly isolates desiderata failures (only in Case 3, with clear emphasis on their non-severe, suboptimal nature without conflating them with hard rules), and offers appropriate justifications (denying them for invalid normative breaches in Case 2 while providing constraint-aligned rationales like operational delays for Case 3's desiderata issues). The structure uses tables for clarity, avoids unsubstantiated assumptions, and reinforces the key distinction between normative and desiderata elements in the summary. There are no inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, or omissions—minor phrasing quirks (e.g., abbreviated date ranges) do not detract from the precision or completeness. Case 1 is implicitly and explicitly handled as fully compliant without errors. This response fully adheres to the task's requirements, demonstrating flawless comprehension and execution.
