The provided answer accurately identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) without error, correctly excluding the valid ones (1 and 4). Explanations are precise, directly referencing the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequencing of Authorize before Package, Ship never after Cancel, mandatory steps like Package before Ship) and interpreting ambiguities logically (e.g., the contradiction in Case 3 implying sufficiency via Authorize but then Canceling). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the structure is clear, comprehensive, and strictly adherent to the task requirements.
