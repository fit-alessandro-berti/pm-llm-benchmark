10.0

The provided query is correct, efficient, and precisely addresses the task requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It properly identifies cases with 6 events via grouping and HAVING, then filters the full event set for those cases using an IN subquery, returning all relevant rows (via SELECT *) as specified. No unnecessary clauses, assumptions, or optimizations are missing or erroneous; this is a flawless implementation for DuckDB.
