The final answer provides exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that comprehensively cover the supply chain process, focusing appropriately on insights, potential issues, strategies for improvement, and decision implications. They are well-distributed across stages (R&D, sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, local distribution, support/compliance, and technology), directly inspired by the description without introducing inaccuracies or irrelevancies. No SQL queries or prohibited elements are present. Logically, the questions are sound, encouraging deeper analysis without leading or closing off discussion. However, the addition of brief explanatory subtitles for each question (e.g., "- Explores decision-making...") and the introductory/concluding paragraphs exceed the prompt's instruction to "just list the questions," introducing minor unnecessary elaboration that slightly dilutes the directness required, warranting a small deduction from perfection.
