10.0

The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless, accurately fulfilling all requirements with precise CTE-based logic, correct use of DuckDB-supported functions (e.g., STRING_AGG with WITHIN GROUP for ordered sequences), proper grouping and counting of variants, selection of top K by descending frequency, filtering to relevant case_ids, and returning the full events for those cases only. The string representation of sequences is a standard and effective approach for variant identification, assuming no edge cases like comma-containing activities (unaddressed in the prompt). Ordering in the final result enhances clarity without being mandated. Minor positives include the explicit replacement note for K and comprehensive explanation. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected under strict scrutiny.
