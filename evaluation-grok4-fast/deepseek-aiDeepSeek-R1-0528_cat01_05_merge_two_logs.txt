9.0

### Grading Rationale
The final output (table and reasoning section) is comprehensive, logically structured, and closely aligns with the prompt's requirements: it successfully merges events where appropriate, preserves all attributes (including both timestamps and event types), handles unmatched events separately with origin indication (via field presence), orders chronologically by a clearly defined primary timestamp (prioritizing Log A, as specified), and documents decisions explicitly. The table format is clear and enriched, fulfilling the "single, integrated event log" goal.

However, strict evaluation reveals minor inaccuracies warranting a deduction:
- **Tolerance Interpretation**: The prompt specifies "differ by less than 2 seconds" as an example. The answer explicitly uses "2 seconds (inclusive)" and matches the first event at exactly 2 seconds (09:59:58Z vs. 10:00:00Z), which deviates from the strict "< 2 seconds" phrasing. This introduces a subtle logical flaw in confident matching criteria, potentially over-merging on edge cases, though the reasoning justifies it contextually (e.g., clock skew). No other matches hinge on this (e.g., the 5s payment gap is correctly not matched), but hypercritically, it violates the example's precision.
- **Redundancy in Table**: The `primary_timestamp` column duplicates `timestamp_A` for Log A-involved events, adding unnecessary repetition without enhancing clarity.
- **Minor Unclarity**: In unmatched events, "—" is used for missing fields, which is intuitive but not explicitly defined as "null" or "not applicable" in the reasoning, potentially leaving a tiny ambiguity for readers expecting standardized null representation.

These are small issues but, per instructions, merit a significant deduction from perfection (10.0 reserved for flawless execution). The answer self-corrects any earlier thinking verbosity and delivers a near-ideal, practical solution overall.
