7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong in structure, clarity, and overall logic, effectively addressing all four tasks with a clean, self-contained DuckDB SQL query using CTEs. The progression from extracting sequences to counting variants, filtering top-K, and returning filtered events is logical and efficient. The use of `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` correctly maintains sequence order per case. Grouping and ranking with `dense_rank()` handles frequencies well, including ties appropriately (fairer than `row_number()` for "top K"). The join to filter events by case is precise, excluding non-top-K cases as required. The optional `ORDER BY` in the final SELECT enhances readability without affecting correctness. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the CTEs, making the solution easy to understand and run (with `:K` parameterization).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are logical flaws that prevent a near-flawless score:

- **Major inaccuracy in sequence representation (step 1)**: Using `string_agg(activity, '' ORDER BY timestamp)` concatenates activities *without a separator*, which fails to uniquely identify variants if activity names can form ambiguous concatenations (e.g., activities "Pay" and "ment" yield "Payment", colliding with a single "Payment" activity). In process mining, activity names are arbitrary strings (e.g., "Register User", "Approve Request"), so this risks incorrect grouping, overcounting, or misidentifying variants in `variant_counts`. A robust fix would be `string_agg(activity, '|' ORDER BY timestamp)` (or similar delimiter not present in names) to ensure uniqueness. This is not edge-case speculation—it's a fundamental flaw in guaranteeing "unique process variants," directly undermining steps 2–3.

- **Minor unclarity**: The explanation glosses over potential ties in `dense_rank()` (e.g., it may return >K variants if frequencies tie at the Kth position), but the prompt implies strict "top K" without specifying tie-handling. While `dense_rank` is defensible, explicitly noting this (or using `row_number()` for exactly K) would clarify. No issue in DuckDB syntax, but ties could lead to more events returned than expected.

These issues—especially the concatenation flaw—introduce real risk of incorrect results, warranting a deduction from 10.0. The solution is effective for simple cases but not generally flawless, landing at 7.0 (solid but critically flawed). A 9+ would require the separator fix and tie clarification for robustness.
