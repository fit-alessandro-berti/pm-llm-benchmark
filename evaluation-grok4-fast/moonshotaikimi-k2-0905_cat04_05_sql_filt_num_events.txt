This query is correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements without any inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It properly uses a subquery to identify qualifying `case_id`s via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the main table to return all events from those cases using `IN`. No unnecessary clauses, assumptions, or deviations from standard SQL semantics applicable to DuckDB.
