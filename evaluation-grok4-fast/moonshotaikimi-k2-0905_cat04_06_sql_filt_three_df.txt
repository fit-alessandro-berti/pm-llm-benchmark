8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This SQL query is strong in structure, logic, and adherence to the core requirements, demonstrating a clear understanding of windowing for sequences, temporal filtering, and case-level exclusion. However, it falls short of perfection due to a notable inaccuracy in the output specification and minor assumptions that could lead to edge-case issues. Below is a hypercritical assessment:

#### Strengths (Supporting High Score)
- **Sequence Detection (Criterion 1)**: The `numbered` CTE correctly uses `ROW_NUMBER()` partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to establish chronological positions. The self-joins in `sequence_candidates` (on `n + 1`) precisely enforce *direct succession* with no intervening events, matching the "exact order, with no other event... in between" requirement. Activity filters are correctly applied. This handles multiple potential sequences per case by identifying all instances.
- **Timing Filter (Criterion 2)**: The `bad_cases` CTE accurately computes the interval (`ts_confirm - ts_create > INTERVAL '5 day'`), which is valid DuckDB syntax for timestamp subtraction yielding an interval comparable to `INTERVAL '5 day'`. The `DISTINCT` ensures case-level uniqueness, correctly refining to cases where *at least one* such sequence exceeds 5 days.
- **Exclusion Logic (Criterion 3)**: The final `WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases)` excludes entire cases meeting *both* criteria, returning events only from non-matching cases. This aligns perfectly with "exclude them from your final result" and "consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."
- **Overall Query Efficiency and Clarity**: CTEs are logically sequenced and self-documenting. The explanation section is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the prompt, aiding verifiability. Ordering by `case_id, timestamp` ensures a logical, reproducible result set without overcomplicating.
- **DuckDB Compatibility**: All syntax (e.g., `INTERVAL`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, joins) is standard and efficient for DuckDB.

#### Weaknesses (Deductions for Strictness)
- **Output Columns Inaccuracy (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The final `SELECT` explicitly names only `case_id, activity, timestamp`, but the prompt specifies the table has "*at least* the following columns" (implying potential additional columns like user, resource, etc., common in event logs) and requires returning "*all events*" from qualifying cases. This omits any extra columns, failing to fully "return all events from `event_log`." A flawless query would use `SELECT *` to ensure completeness regardless of schema extensions. This is not a minor oversight—it's a direct mismatch with "all events," potentially breaking downstream use cases.
- **Edge-Case Assumptions (Minor Deductions: -0.5 points total)**:
  - Timestamp ties: `ROW_NUMBER()` orders by `timestamp` but doesn't specify tie-breaking (e.g., via event ID if available). If multiple events share a timestamp in a case, the "direct succession" might arbitrarily group them, though this is rare for datetimes and not explicitly addressed in the prompt. Hypercritically, an `ORDER BY timestamp, some_unique_id` would be more robust.
  - No handling for incomplete sequences or non-consecutive matches: Correctly ignored per prompt, but if a case has overlapping or multiple partial sequences, the query still works as intended—however, it assumes all timestamps are non-NULL and sortable, which isn't guarded against (e.g., via `WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL` in `numbered`).
  - Interval precision: `> INTERVAL '5 day'` uses whole days, but if timestamps include time-of-day, this correctly captures elapsed time. No fractional-day handling is needed per prompt, but strictness notes it's not explicitly using `EXTRACT` for sub-day precision if intended (though prompt says "more than 5 days," implying calendar days).
- **Unclarity in Explanation (Minor Deduction: -0.0 points, but noted)**: The explanation is excellent and flawlessly mirrors the query, with no logical gaps. No deduction here, but hypercritically, it could explicitly mention potential multi-sequence cases (e.g., "if any sequence in the case meets the time threshold").

#### Overall Justification
- **Score Rationale**: 8.0 reflects a nearly flawless solution (9+ would require `SELECT *` and edge-case hardening). The core logic is impeccable and directly solves the problem without extraneous code. Deductions are strict but targeted: the column omission is a clear inaccuracy warranting a significant drop (from ~9.5 potential), while minor assumptions prevent a perfect 10.0. This query would work correctly in most practical scenarios but isn't "hyper-robust" or fully schema-agnostic.
- **Would This Pass in Production?**: Yes, with a quick fix to `SELECT *`. It's thoughtful and efficient, outperforming simpler approaches like LAG/LEAD (which wouldn't enforce exact triples as cleanly).
