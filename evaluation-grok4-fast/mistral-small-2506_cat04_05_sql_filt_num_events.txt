The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query correctly uses a CTE to group and filter cases by event count (with accurate `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to exclude >6 events), joins back to retrieve full event rows for qualifying cases, and returns all columns as required (`e.*`). It leverages standard SQL features fully supported in DuckDB without any syntax errors, inefficiencies, or logical flaws. The optional `ORDER BY` enhances readability without altering the core result (and is explicitly justified in the explanation). The explanation is precise, step-by-step, and directly addresses the task without extraneous details or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or issues whatsoever.
