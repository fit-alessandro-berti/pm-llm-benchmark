The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and standard SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it identifies case_ids with 6 events via a subquery using GROUP BY and HAVING, then retrieves all events for those cases using IN. The syntax is valid for DuckDB, handles edge cases (e.g., exactly 6 events included, >6 excluded), and the explanation accurately describes the query's logic without errors or omissions.
