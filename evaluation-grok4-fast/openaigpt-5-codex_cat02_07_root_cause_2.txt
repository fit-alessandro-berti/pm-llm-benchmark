The provided answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and logically sound, fully addressing all task components with precise calculations, evidence-based analysis, and practical recommendations. Durations are correctly computed (e.g., 25h55m for Case 2002 accounts for exact timestamps across days; 77h05m for Case 2005 includes multi-day spans). Case identification as outliers is unambiguous and justified against baselines. Attribute analysis (Resource, Region, Complexity) is tightly correlated to delays, with clear evidence (e.g., multiple "Request Additional Documents" in high-complexity cases; Manager_Bill's 19–23h waits vs. Manager_Ann's near-instant approvals). Explanations are causal and rooted in process dynamics (e.g., rework loops from incomplete initial reviews), while mitigations are actionable, multi-faceted, and targeted (e.g., pre-submission checklists to reduce complexity-driven delays; workload balancing for Bill). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws—tables enhance readability, narrative flows coherently, and summary reinforces insights without redundancy. This is a model response.
