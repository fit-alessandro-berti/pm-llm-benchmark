The provided answer delivers a precise, correct, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that fully satisfies all requirements. It accurately constructs ordered activity sequences per case using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, groups and ranks variants by frequency with `ROW_NUMBER()` for the top K, and returns exactly the events from qualifying cases via a join and subquery filter. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist; minor stylistic choices (e.g., '->' separator, :K parameter) are appropriate and do not impact correctness. The explanation is concise yet complete, aiding understanding without excess verbosity.
