### Evaluation Rationale
This query is highly effective and logically sound, correctly achieving the core objective by using a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filtering the main table with `IN` to return all events (`SELECT *`) from those cases. It preserves the full row structure as implied by the prompt. The use of DuckDB-compatible SQL is standard and appropriate.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny:
- The added `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is not specified in the prompt, introducing an unrequested operation that could subtly alter runtime behavior or output ordering without justification. While logically harmless (and potentially beneficial for event log readability), it represents a minor deviation from the exact task of "filtering and returning" without additional transformations. This alone warrants a slight deduction, as the prompt emphasizes precision in grouping and filtering without mentioning sorting.
- No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws: The subquery is efficient, correctly grouped, and handles the "full set of events" requirement without data loss or over-filtering. Edge cases (e.g., exactly 6 events, empty cases) are implicitly handled correctly.

A 10.0 would require absolute fidelity to the prompt with zero extras; this is nearly flawless but not entirely minimalist.
