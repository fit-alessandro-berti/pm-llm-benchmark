The provided answer is correct, complete, and well-structured. Both SQL queries accurately implement the required logic: they first identify valid `case_id`s with 6 events via grouping and `HAVING`, then retrieve the full event rows for those cases. The syntax is standard and fully compatible with DuckDB. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly addresses the task's requirements without introducing any errors, ambiguities, or unnecessary complexity. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or even minor issues are present.
