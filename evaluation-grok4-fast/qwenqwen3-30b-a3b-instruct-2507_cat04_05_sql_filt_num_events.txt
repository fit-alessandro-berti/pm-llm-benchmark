This query is logically flawless and precisely matches the requirements: it correctly identifies cases with 6 events via a subquery using GROUP BY and HAVING, then filters the full event set to only those cases using a standard IN clause. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or inefficiencies; it assumes standard SQL semantics valid for DuckDB and returns the "full set of events" (via `e.*`) without extraneous columns, sorting, or limitations.
