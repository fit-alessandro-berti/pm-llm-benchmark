The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and complete DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all requirements: it identifies cases with the specified direct-succession sequence using LEAD window functions (ensuring no intervening events via timestamp ordering), applies the >5 days timing filter via DATEDIFF on the relevant timestamps, excludes those cases entirely using NOT IN against a DISTINCT case_id subquery, and returns all events from the remaining cases. The explanation is clear, accurate, and directly supports the query without extraneous elements affecting the logic. No inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws are present.
