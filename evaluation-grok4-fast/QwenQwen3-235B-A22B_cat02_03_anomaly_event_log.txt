### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer correctly identifies all key anomalies across Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004, with accurate descriptions of deviations from standard P2P flows (e.g., requisition approval before PO issuance, goods receipt before payment, three-way matching, and PO issuance before goods receipt). Explanations tie directly to business risks like fraud, financial loss, and compliance issues, demonstrating solid understanding of P2P best practices. The structure is clear, with per-case breakdowns, a risks summary table, and practical recommendations, enhancing completeness. Case 1001 is appropriately omitted as normal.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there is a notable inaccuracy in Case 1002: the answer incorrectly states the PO issuance timestamp as "07:00 on 2024-02-03" (confusing it with the invoice receipt time), when the log shows it as 2024-02-01 08:40. This factual error in detailing the timeline undermines precision, even though it does not alter the overall conclusion that the PO preceded approval. No other logical flaws or omissions are present, but this detail-oriented mistake prevents a near-perfect score. The response is strong but not flawless.
