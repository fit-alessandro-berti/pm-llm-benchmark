The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely meets the requirements of the prompt. It accurately uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, applies the `HAVING` clause to filter for cases with 6 events (correctly excluding those with >6), and then joins back to the full `event_log` table to retrieve all events (`e.*`) for the qualifying cases via an `INNER JOIN` on `case_id`. This ensures no extraneous rows are returned and preserves the full structure of the events for valid cases.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present: the grouping is proper, the filter logic is exact, and the output matches the specification (full events from filtered cases). The unused `event_count` alias in the CTE is harmless and does not affect functionality or performance in any meaningful way. The query is standard SQL compatible with DuckDB and handles the task without assumptions about additional columns or edge cases beyond what's specified.
