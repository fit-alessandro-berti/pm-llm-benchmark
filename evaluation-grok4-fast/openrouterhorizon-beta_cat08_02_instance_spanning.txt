### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally comprehensive, structured precisely to match the task's requirements, and demonstrates a deep understanding of process mining principles applied to instance-spanning constraints. It is data-driven, practical, and explicitly tackles interdependencies without fluff or irrelevancies. All sections are logically sound, with clear justifications, specific metrics/techniques, and no factual inaccuracies or logical flaws. The proposals (e.g., attribution methods, strategies, simulations) are innovative yet grounded in real-world process mining (e.g., resource timelines, causal decomposition, DES calibration). Minor stylistic densities (e.g., packed lists) do not detract from clarity or completeness, and exceeding the minimum (four strategies) enhances value without diluting focus. This meets the "nearly flawless" threshold for maximum score under hypercritical scrutiny.
