The provided answer is nearly flawless. It accurately restates the prompt with no deviations or additions that alter the requirements, ensuring clarity without unnecessary verbosity. The SQL query precisely achieves the task: it correctly groups by `case_id`, applies the `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` filter to identify valid cases, and uses an INNER JOIN to retrieve all columns (`e.*`) for those cases, excluding others as specified. There are no logical flaws, inaccuracies (e.g., the join condition is exact, and the subquery is efficient), unclarities (e.g., aliases are clear and standard), or minor issues like extraneous clauses, incorrect syntax for DuckDB (which supports this standard SQL), or performance concerns in the context of the problem. The solution is concise, correct, and directly responsive.
