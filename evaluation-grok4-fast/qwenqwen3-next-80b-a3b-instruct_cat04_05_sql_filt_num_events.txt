The provided answer is exemplary: the SQL query precisely meets the requirements by correctly identifying and filtering cases based on event counts using a subquery with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then retrieving all events for qualifying cases via an efficient `INNER JOIN`. It preserves all original columns without alteration, handles grouping accurately, and avoids any unnecessary operations. The explanation is thorough, logically structured, and directly ties back to the query's mechanics, with no ambiguities, inaccuracies, or superfluous details. This solution is optimal for DuckDB, readable, and free of logical flaws or edge cases (e.g., it correctly includes cases with exactly 6 events). No deductions are warranted.
