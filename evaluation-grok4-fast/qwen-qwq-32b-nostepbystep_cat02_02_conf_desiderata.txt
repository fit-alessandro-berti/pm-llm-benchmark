### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is well-structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three tasks with clear sections, explanations, and a helpful summary table. It correctly identifies normative violations in Case 2 (including the insightful and accurate catch of the missing "Inform Applicant" step, which is indeed a skipped mandatory activity based on the log and rules) and none in Cases 1 and 3. Desiderata violations are appropriately distinguished as suboptimal (e.g., by labeling them "desideratum" and not escalating to normative), with correct listings for missing Follow-up Calls across all cases (logically inferred since none are recorded, and explicitly noted for Case 3). Interpretations are reasonable, task-aligned suggestions (e.g., human/system errors for normative issues, administrative delays for desiderata), emphasizing non-severity where required.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, two minor but factual inaccuracies in Part 2 for Case 3's desiderata timing calculations undermine flawlessness: the Credit Check delay is stated as "44 hours" (actual: ~49 hours from 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00), and the Inform Applicant delay as "57 hours" (actual: ~51 hours from 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00). These errors do not negate the overall violation identification (which aligns with the log's notes of delays exceeding recommendations), but they introduce unclarities in precision for a quantitative aspect of the desiderata. No other logical flaws, omissions, or unclarities, but these warrant a deduction from a higher score.
