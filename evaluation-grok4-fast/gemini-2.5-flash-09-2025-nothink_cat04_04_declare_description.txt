1.0

The provided "answer" is an exact duplication of the input prompt itself, with no actual response to the core request. It fails to deliver any step-by-step description of the loan approval process, any analysis of the DECLARE constraints, no discussion of real-world motivations, and no speculation on consequences of deviations. This is not an answer at all—it's a non-response that ignores the task entirely, rendering it utterly inaccurate, unclear, and logically flawed in purpose. Under strict evaluation criteria, it warrants the minimum score for complete irrelevance and non-compliance with the query.
