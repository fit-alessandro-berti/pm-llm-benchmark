The provided answer is exemplary and meets the prompt's requirements with near-perfect execution. It delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that directly engage with the described supply chain process, emphasizing insights (e.g., Q16 on digitalization), potential issues (e.g., Q4 on JIT downsides), improvement strategies (e.g., Q5 on analytics for logistics), and decision implications (e.g., Q7 on currency risks). All questions are relevant, drawing from key elements like global suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, logistics, regulations, sustainability, and digital tools, without any deviations into unrelated topics or prohibited elements like SQL. Phrasing is clear, precise, and logically sound, with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or flaws—even minor ones. The list format is clean and professional, fostering deep analysis without unnecessary commentary.
