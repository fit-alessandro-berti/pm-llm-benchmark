7.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer correctly identifies the deviating cases (2, 3, and 5) and the non-deviating ones (1 and 4), aligning with the normative process. The explanations reference key rules from the description (e.g., authorization before packaging, shipping only after packaging and never after cancellation, close as final). However, under hypercritical evaluation:

- **Strengths (supporting higher score):** Core conclusions are accurate and complete for Cases 1, 2, 4, and 5. For Case 2, the violation (packaging before authorization) is precisely tied to the normative rule. For Case 5, the missing packaging before shipping is correctly flagged. The summary and final answer concisely restate the deviations without fluff, focusing on the required outputs.

- **Weaknesses (deducting from perfection):** For Case 3, the explanation is incomplete and thus flawed. It identifies the critical "ship after cancel" violation and notes the undocumented sequence, but fails to explicitly address two clear additional deviations implied by the normative description: (1) the illogical progression of "Authorize payment" (which assumes sufficient inventory) immediately followed by "Cancel order" (which assumes insufficient inventory), violating the branching logic after "Check inventory"; and (2) the complete absence of "Package items" before "Ship order," which breaches the fulfillment sequence constraint ("Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping"). These omissions mean the explanation does not fully "reference the textual description for guidance" or resolve all implied conditions, introducing partial unclarity in interpreting ambiguities (e.g., improper branching). Even though the case is correctly flagged as deviating, the incomplete violation breakdown reduces depth and precision, warranting a deduction. No logical flaws in identified points, but the gaps prevent a "nearly flawless" score.

Overall, the answer is strong and functional (above average), but strict scrutiny on completeness and thoroughness caps it at 7.5. A 9+ would require exhaustive coverage of all violations in Case 3 without any interpretive shorthand.
