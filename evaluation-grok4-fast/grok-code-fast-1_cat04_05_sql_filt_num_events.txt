The provided SQL query correctly implements the required filtering logic using a CTE to identify valid `case_id`s with 6 or fewer events via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then joins back to the full `event_log` table to return all events for those cases. The `SELECT *` retrieves the complete rows (including `activity` and `timestamp`), and the approach is efficient, standard SQL compatible with DuckDB, and precisely matches the task without extraneous elements, errors, or ambiguities. The explanation accurately reinforces the query's structure and intent.
