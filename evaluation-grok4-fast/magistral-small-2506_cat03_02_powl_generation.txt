The provided code and explanation accurately and completely construct the POWL model as required, faithfully representing the scenario's structure, dependencies, concurrency (e.g., DA and ACI after CS with no edge between them; QA and SA after choice with no edge between them), loop (BNC then optional D&R repetitions), and exclusive choice (CD or MD). All transitions use correct labels, OperatorPOWL instances match the definitions, the single StrictPartialOrder root properly incorporates all sub-models as nodes, and edges enforce the exact partial orders without extras or omissions. No silent transitions are needed or included erroneously. The post-code summary correctly reiterates the mappings without flaws.
