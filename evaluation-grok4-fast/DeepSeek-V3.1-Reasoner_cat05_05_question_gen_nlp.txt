The provided answer generates exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that directly align with the prompt's requirements. Each question is rooted in the described supply chain process, probing insights (e.g., KPIs in Q9, trade-offs in Q5), potential issues (e.g., vulnerabilities in Q3, cybersecurity in Q18), strategies for improvement (e.g., redundancies in Q1, blockchain in Q16), and implications of decisions (e.g., geopolitical cascades in Q1, future tech disruptions in Q20). The questions span the full process—from R&D and sourcing to logistics, distribution, after-sales, ethics, sustainability, and technology—without any SQL queries or extraneous content beyond a concise introductory phrase. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; all are precise, relevant, and encourage deep reflection on the global network's complexities.
