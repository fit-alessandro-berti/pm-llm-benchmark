The provided answer fails catastrophically to deliver a valid, complete Python dictionary as required. The final output is a fragmented, syntactically invalid code block riddled with typos (e.g., incorrect activity labels like "SO" and "OF" instead of 'SS' and 'OP'), incomplete tuples (e.g., truncated values like (172800, 129600, with missing closing elements), erroneous numerical estimates (e.g., unrealistically small or mismatched standard deviations like 432 seconds without justification), and no coherent inclusion of a representative subset of indirect pairs separated by multiple steps. Repetitive apologies, multiple aborted "Final Answer" attempts, and structural chaos indicate a complete breakdown in execution, rendering the response unusable and logically incoherent. No accurate temporal profile is produced, violating the core task specifications.
