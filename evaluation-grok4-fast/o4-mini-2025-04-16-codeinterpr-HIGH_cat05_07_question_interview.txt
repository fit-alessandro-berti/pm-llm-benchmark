9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, producing a comprehensive list of 20 open-ended questions that effectively target the specified goals: uncovering missing details (e.g., Q7 on common inspection failures), decision criteria (e.g., Q2 on manager selection weighting, Q9 on tenant competition), roles/responsibilities (e.g., Q1 on stakeholders across phases, Q13 on compliance intervention), timing/sequencing (e.g., Q3 on step durations and hand-offs in Q5), and exception handling (e.g., Q4 on documentation escalation, Q11 on specialized properties, Q17 on fast-tracks). The questions align closely with the process description, avoiding any SQL or overtly technical implementation (e.g., no code, database schemas, or software configs). They deepen conceptual understanding by probing workflows, criteria, and adaptations without straying into how-to-build territory.

However, under utmost strictness, minor flaws prevent a perfect score:
- **Q12** borders on implementation details by naming specific tools (CRM, project manager, document repository) and asking how communications/approvals are routed through them. While this supports conceptual workflow clarity, it risks veering into system-specific mechanics, which the prompt explicitly cautions against favoring pure process concepts. This is a logical inconsistency with the guidelines, warranting a deduction.
- The list is slightly bloated (20 questions), which could dilute focus in a real interview, though it doesn't violate the "series" request.
- The closing sentence helpfully summarizes but redundantly references "systems," echoing the Q12 issue without adding new value.

These are small issues in an otherwise nearly flawless, logical, and targeted response—hence not lower than 9.0. A 10.0 would require zero such ambiguities.
