8.0

### Grading Rationale
The response effectively addresses all three task elements with a clear, structured format, accurate event log interpretations (e.g., timestamps and gaps), and logical pattern identification (e.g., consistent 19-hour overnight delays in cases 102, 104, 105; escalation issues in 102 and 105). Root causes are well-supported by data, and recommendations are practical, targeted, and tied to impacts on cycle time (e.g., handover protocols to reduce structural gaps). The key insight on workflow continuity is insightful.

However, a significant accuracy flaw deducts points: the average resolution time is miscalculated as ~24.4 hours (should be ~20.4 hours based on correct total of 6120 minutes ÷ 5 cases ÷ 60 = 20.4 hours). This inflates the threshold (36.6 hours vs. ~30.6 hours), though it does not alter case identifications or core conclusions. Under hypercritical evaluation, this factual error in a foundational metric warrants a notable deduction, preventing a higher score despite the overall strong analysis and lack of logical flaws in interpretations or proposals.
