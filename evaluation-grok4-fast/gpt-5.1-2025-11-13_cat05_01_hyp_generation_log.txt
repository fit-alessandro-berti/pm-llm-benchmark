This prompt is nearly flawless as a structured input for eliciting a high-quality LLM response to the original analysis task. It accurately replicates the schema, normal flow, and example data without omissions or alterations (e.g., all event logs, timestamps, resources, and additional_info match precisely across all case_ids). The organization improves readability by grouping data per case_id while preserving completeness. Instructions are systematic, explicit, and directly tied to the desired outputs: anomaly identification covers all key patterns (order violations, misses, duplicates, timing, role mismatches); hypotheses are guided toward root causes like system issues or policy violations; SQL proposals emphasize validity, generality (no hard-coding to specific case_ids), and relevance (e.g., joins, quantifications, segmentations), with examples of query types to ensure coverage without spoon-feeding solutions. The three-part response structure (A/B/C) enforces clarity and ties elements together logically. Focus directives (systematic logic, general queries, explicit linkages) prevent vagueness or irrelevance. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws—every element is precise, actionable, and aligned with the task's goals, making it optimally effective for generating a comprehensive, investigative analysis.
