The provided query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LAG) to detect the exact sequence in direct succession per case, filters for the >5-day condition between the specific events in that sequence, identifies and excludes only the qualifying "bad" cases entirely (returning all events from non-bad cases), and includes appropriate ordering. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; minor stylistic choices (e.g., quoting column names) are appropriate for DuckDB compatibility, and the INTERVAL syntax is valid. The approach handles edge cases like multiple sequences per case or intervening events correctly by design.
