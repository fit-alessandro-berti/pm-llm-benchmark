10.0

The provided SQL query and explanation are nearly flawless, accurately addressing all requirements with precise logic, correct use of window functions (LAG) to detect direct succession, proper interval comparison in DuckDB syntax, and exclusion of entire cases based on the combined sequence and timing criteria. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even edge cases (e.g., multiple sequences per case, non-consecutive events) are handled correctly by the design. The ordering in the final SELECT aligns with the prompt's guidance, and the step-by-step explanation reinforces clarity without introducing errors.
