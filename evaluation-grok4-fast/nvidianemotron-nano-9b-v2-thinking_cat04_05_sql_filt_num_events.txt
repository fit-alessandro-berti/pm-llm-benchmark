The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and syntactically valid DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it identifies case_ids with 6 events via a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING, then uses WHERE IN to select all events from those cases, returning the full event rows. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly ties to the query's components without extraneous details or errors. No logical flaws, ambiguities, or inaccuracies are present.
