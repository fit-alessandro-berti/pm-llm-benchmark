9.5

### Grading Rationale
The answer is highly accurate, clearly structured, and directly addresses the core question by explaining the XOR's bias mechanism (score uplift favoring those routed to D, linked to local affiliation as a potential proxy for non-protected groups) and thoroughly discussing implications (proxy discrimination, disparate impact, transparency issues, ethical inequities, and regulatory risks). Conclusions are logical, evidence-based from the model description, and include practical takeaways without introducing unsubstantiated claims. Minor deductions for slight phrasing ambiguities (e.g., "D is more likely to be true" could more precisely say "qualifying via D is more likely") and tangential expansion on protected groups' disadvantages, which, while relevant to broader fairness, slightly dilutes focus on the specified non-protected advantage. Overall, it is nearly flawless in depth, relevance, and critical insight.
