The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and idiomatic SQL query that precisely meets the requirements: it uses a subquery to identify `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`, then filters the full `event_log` rows using `IN` to return all events from qualifying cases. The query syntax is valid for DuckDB, handles grouping and filtering accurately without unnecessary assumptions (e.g., no unwarranted ordering or column restrictions), and preserves the full event data integrity for valid cases. The overall structure, including the optional notes on alternatives like CTEs, adds value without deviating from the task.

However, a minor inaccuracy in the explanation slightly detracts: in the "Main Query" section, it describes the filtered cases as "(i.e., cases with 6 events)", which omits the "or fewer" aspect despite the query correctly using `<= 6` and earlier text acknowledging "6 or fewer". This is a small logical inconsistency and unclarity in wording that could mislead a careful reader, warranting a deduction for not being entirely flawless.
