The provided SQL query and its accompanying explanation are correct, efficient, and precisely aligned with the task requirements. The CTE accurately computes event counts per `case_id` with proper grouping. The subsequent JOIN correctly retrieves all relevant events from the filtered cases, and the `WHERE` clause enforces the <=6 threshold without errors or inefficiencies. The query assumes standard SQL semantics compatible with DuckDB, selects the minimally required columns, and avoids unnecessary operations. The explanation is concise, accurate, and directly addresses the query's logic without extraneous details or ambiguities. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
