The provided solution is a precise, correct, and efficient implementation of the requirements. It accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence via row numbering and self-joins, applies the >5-day filter correctly using DuckDB-compatible INTERVAL syntax, excludes matching cases entirely as specified, and returns all events from non-matching cases. The final ordering enhances readability without altering correctness. The explanation is thorough, logical, and free of errors, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws detected—even under hypercritical scrutiny. Minor potential concerns (e.g., handling timestamp ties) are unstated in the prompt and not violated here.
