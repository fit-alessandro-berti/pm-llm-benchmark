10.0

The provided answer is nearly flawless in its completeness, accuracy, clarity, and logical structure. It directly addresses all three tasks with precise adherence to the problem's details, including the event log timestamps, normative constraints (e.g., correctly identifying the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step as missing in Case 2, which is explicitly required post-decision regardless of outcome), and desiderata (e.g., exact hour calculations like ~49 and ~51 hours for Case 3). Explanations are concise yet thorough, distinguishing violations from recommendations without ambiguity. Part 3 offers balanced, speculative justifications that align with the task's "when possible" qualifier, avoiding endorsement of violations while providing contextual insights. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; even minor details (e.g., noting desiderata flexibility in Case 2 despite normative issues) are handled correctly. This warrants the maximum score under hypercritical evaluation.
