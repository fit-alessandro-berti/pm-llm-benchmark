8.5

### Grading Rationale
This answer is strong overall in structure, logic, and adherence to the prompt, earning a high score for its clear CTE-based approach, correct ordering via `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)`, proper grouping/counting of variants, accurate top-K selection via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT :K`, and final filtering/join to return only relevant events from `event_log` (with appropriate ordering). The explanation is concise and directly maps to the requirements, demonstrating solid understanding of process variant extraction in SQL.

However, under hypercritical strictness, several minor issues prevent a near-perfect score (9+):
- **Inaccuracy in parameterization setup**: The comment suggests using `PRAGMA my_top_k = 5` to set K, but this is incorrect—DuckDB's `PRAGMA` is for database configuration (e.g., memory limits), not user-defined variables or parameters. Proper alternatives include hardcoding the literal (as suggested secondarily), using `WITH k AS (SELECT 5)`, or relying on DuckDB's parameter binding via `PREPARE`/`EXECUTE` for `:K`. This misleads users and introduces unnecessary confusion, warranting a deduction for factual error.
- **Unclarity in delimiter choice**: `LIST_AGG(activity, '->')` creates a string representation of sequences, which works for grouping but assumes activity names contain no `->` substrings (potential for collisions if they do, e.g., an activity named "start->end"). While common in process mining queries, a more robust approach (e.g., aggregating to an array via `LIST_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` and grouping on the array) would avoid this edge case entirely. This is a minor logical fragility, not a flaw, but strict evaluation flags it as suboptimal.
- **Minor unclarities**: The query assumes `activity` is string-typed (implicitly fine), but doesn't explicitly handle potential NULLs/ties in ranking (e.g., if frequencies tie at the Kth position, `LIMIT` arbitrarily selects, which is correct per the prompt but could be clarified). The final `ORDER BY` is good but not explicitly required by the prompt, adding no harm but slight bloat.

These are not fatal (the core query executes correctly and meets all functional requirements if `:K` is resolved), but they represent avoidable inaccuracies and unclarities. A 10.0 requires zero such issues; this is "very good" but not flawless.
