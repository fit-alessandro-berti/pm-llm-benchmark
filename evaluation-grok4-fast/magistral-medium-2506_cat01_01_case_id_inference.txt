The provided answer accurately infers the three distinct cases by correctly grouping all 18 events based on patient demographics (age and gender as unique identifiers), logical activity sequences, departmental consistency, and chronological ordering within each case. All events are fully accounted for without overlap, omission, or misattribution, and the sequences align precisely with standard hospital workflows (e.g., registration to discharge). The final output is clear, comprehensive, and directly reproduces the event details as required, with no ambiguities or errors.
