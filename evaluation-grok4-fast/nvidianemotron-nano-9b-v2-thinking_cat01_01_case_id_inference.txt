8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The answer correctly identifies three distinct cases based on unique patient demographics (45M, 62F, 28M), with logical sequences that align well with typical hospital workflows, departmental consistency (e.g., ER for acute cases, Surgery for elective procedures), and chronological timestamps. All sequences are coherently described, and the key inferences accurately highlight the grouping criteria without introducing extraneous or overlapping events. The structure is clear, comprehensive, and directly addresses the task of inferring case groupings from the interleaved sequence.

However, deducting 1.5 points for a single but notable inaccuracy: Event 10 (Lab test completed for 62F) is logically part of Case 2, as it directly follows and completes the lab request in Event 8 for the same patient, fitting the timeline (08:16:10Z to 08:20:27Z) and ER diagnostic flow. Its omission leaves Case 2 incomplete (only 6 events listed instead of 7) and results in one ungrouped event overall, contradicting the claim of "without ... missing events." This is a minor logical flaw but, per strict evaluation criteria, warrants a deduction, preventing a perfect score. The answer remains nearly flawless in scope and reasoning otherwise.
