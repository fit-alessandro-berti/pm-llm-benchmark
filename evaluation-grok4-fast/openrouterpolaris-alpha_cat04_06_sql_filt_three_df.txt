The provided SQL solution is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence via row-numbered joins, enforces the >5-day interval filter on the relevant pair, excludes all events from matching cases in the final result, and includes sensible ordering without introducing unnecessary complexity. Minor quibbles (e.g., activity as a tiebreaker in ROW_NUMBER() is non-problematic but arbitrary if timestamps tie; DuckDB's INTERVAL syntax is valid without quotes) do not detract from its precision, efficiency, or logical soundness. The explanatory notes further clarify intent without extraneous detail.
