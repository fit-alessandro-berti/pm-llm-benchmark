8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (Filtering Logic)**: Both queries accurately identify cases with 6 events using standard SQL constructs (window function in Option 1, aggregation with HAVING in Option 2). They correctly exclude cases with >6 events and return only qualifying events. No logical flaws in grouping, partitioning, or joining. This aspect is flawless (full credit).
  
- **Output Precision**: Option 2 is perfect—it selects `e.*`, returning only the original event columns (e.g., `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) without extras. Option 1, however, uses `SELECT *` on a subquery that includes `e.*` plus the derived `case_size` column, unnecessarily adding an extra column to the output. The problem specifies returning "the full set of events," implying the original event data without additions. This is a minor but clear inaccuracy in completeness—equivalent to bloating the result set. Deduction for this unaddressed issue in one option.

- **Efficiency and Clarity**: Both are concise, readable, and efficient for DuckDB (no unnecessary computations; window function is appropriately lightweight, CTE+JOIN is logically separated). Comments like "(concise)" and "(clear separation)" add helpful context without verbosity. No performance flaws or DuckDB-specific oversights (queries are standard SQL, compatible with DuckDB). Minor positive, but doesn't offset the output issue.

- **Completeness and Extras**: The answer provides two valid, equivalent approaches (barring the output difference), exceeding the single-query requirement. However, claiming "two equivalent" is slightly imprecise due to the extra column in Option 1. The added `ORDER BY case_id, timestamp` is logical for event logs and harmless (not required by the problem), but it introduces an unrequested element that could imply over-assumption about output format. No errors, but hypercritically, it's unnecessary customization.

- **Strictness Notes**: This is nearly flawless execution, but the extra column in Option 1 (a tangible output mismatch) and minor imprecision in equivalence qualify as "minor issues" warranting a significant deduction per instructions (from a potential 10.0 to 8.5). No criminal/jailbreak concerns; evaluation is purely technical. If Option 1 had excluded `case_size` (e.g., via explicit column selection), this would be 10.0.
