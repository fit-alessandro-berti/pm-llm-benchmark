The proposed process tree structure accurately captures the observed behavior in the event log, balancing fitness (all traces can be replayed exactly, including zero or multiple RMI iterations followed by a single VF only when RMI occurs, with no extraneous VF in the zero-RMI case), precision (no overgeneralization allowing invalid sequences like VF without preceding RMI in the loop branch or AD interleaved incorrectly), and simplicity (uses minimal operators: sequences for main flow, XOR for optionality, LOOP with tau for repeatable RMI without visible artifacts between repetitions). The use of tau in the loop's second position correctly hides silent transitions, enabling arbitrary RMI repetitions (1 in the loop branch) while keeping the model concise. Minor deduction (0.5) for redundant parent-setting in the code after constructor, but this does not impact the structural correctness or execution. The model is nearly flawless in representing the process.
