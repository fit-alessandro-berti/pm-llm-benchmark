The provided SQL query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to detect the exact consecutive sequence without intervening events, accurately filters for the >5-day condition between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps, excludes the qualifying cases via NOT IN subquery, and returns all events from non-excluded cases with appropriate ordering by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity and consistency with event log expectations. The CTE structure is efficient and readable, the explanation is precise and aligns perfectly with the logic, and there are no syntax errors, logical flaws, or ambiguities specific to DuckDB (e.g., interval handling is proper). No deductions are warranted under hypercritical scrutiny.
