### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer includes a correct SQL query that precisely meets the prompt's requirements: it uses a subquery with `GROUP BY case_id` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to identify valid cases, then filters the original `event_log` table via `WHERE case_id IN (...)` to return all events from those cases. This approach is efficient, leverages standard SQL (fully compatible with DuckDB), and correctly preserves the full set of events for qualifying cases without aggregating or altering the data. The explanation accurately describes the query's components and intent, confirming that it excludes cases with >6 events while including all others.

However, the example section introduces a significant inaccuracy: the sample data shows cases with 3, 3, and 1 events (all 6, so all should be included), yet the text falsely claims cases 1 and 2 "each has exactly six events" and implies case 3 is excluded (which it should not be). This misrepresents both the data and the query's output, creating confusion and undermining the response's reliability. Under hypercritical evaluation, this logical flaw in the illustrative component—despite the core query being flawless—warrants a deduction, as it could mislead users and indicates carelessness in validation. A score above 8.0 would require the entire response, including examples, to be nearly flawless.
