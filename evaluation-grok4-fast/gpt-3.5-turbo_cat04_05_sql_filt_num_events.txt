10.0

The provided SQL query is correct, efficient, and precisely matches the requirements. It uses a subquery to identify qualifying `case_id`s via `GROUP BY` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`, then filters the main table with `IN` to return all events (`SELECT *`) for those cases. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; it handles edge cases (e.g., empty results, multiple columns) appropriately without unnecessary complexity. This is a flawless implementation for DuckDB or standard SQL.
