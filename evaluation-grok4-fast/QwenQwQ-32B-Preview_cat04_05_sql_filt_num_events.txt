The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and well-structured SQL query using a CTE with a window function that precisely achieves the required filtering: it identifies cases by event count per `case_id`, excludes those with more than six events, and returns all qualifying events. The query is syntactically valid for DuckDB, leverages standard SQL features supported by the engine, and includes a clear, accurate explanation without logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities. The inclusion of the `event_count` column in the output is a minor stylistic choice that does not alter the correctness or completeness of the event data returned, as it preserves the full original row information while adding diagnostic detail. No penalties apply.
