The provided SQL query correctly identifies cases containing the exact consecutive sequence of activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition' followed immediately by 'Create Order' followed immediately by 'Confirm Order') using LEAD window functions to ensure no intervening events, as the partition is ordered by timestamp within each case_id. It accurately filters those cases where the timestamp difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days (using valid DuckDB INTERVAL syntax). The final SELECT then excludes all events from those specific cases, returning all other events as required. The query is efficient, logically sound, and directly addresses all criteria without extraneous operations, ambiguities, or flaws.
