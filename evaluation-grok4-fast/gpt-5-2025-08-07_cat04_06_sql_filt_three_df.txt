The provided query is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly uses window functions to detect the exact direct sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition' immediately followed by 'Create Order' immediately followed by 'Confirm Order') within each case, partitioned and ordered by timestamp (with a reasonable tiebreaker on activity). The timing filter accurately computes the interval between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in that specific sequence triplet, using DuckDB-compatible syntax (INTERVAL 5 DAY). The exclusion logic properly identifies and removes entire cases meeting both criteria via a NOT IN subquery on distinct bad case_ids, while returning all events from remaining cases in a stable, logical order (case_id, timestamp, activity). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; it handles potential multiples (e.g., multiple sequences per case) correctly by flagging the case if any instance matches. Minor assumptions (e.g., activity name tiebreaking) are unavoidable and align with standard SQL practices for event logs, without violating the "direct succession" intent.
