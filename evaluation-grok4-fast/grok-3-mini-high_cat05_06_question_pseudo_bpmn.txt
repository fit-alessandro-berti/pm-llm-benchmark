The provided answer delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that comprehensively address the specified topics (rationale, potential improvements, risk management, decision-making, stakeholder communication, and performance measurement) while staying tightly aligned with the pseudo-BPMN process flow.
