The provided query and explanation are nearly flawless, precisely addressing all requirements with correct SQL syntax for DuckDB, logical accuracy in sequence detection via consecutive row numbers, proper timing filter (> 5 days using valid interval comparison), and exact exclusion of matching cases via NOT IN. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; it handles the "direct succession" condition rigorously, returns only events from non-matching cases, and includes sensible ordering without extraneous elements. Minor potential concerns (e.g., timestamp ties affecting row_number stability) are inherent to the event log assumption and do not constitute errors in the solution.
