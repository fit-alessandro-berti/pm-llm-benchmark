The provided answer is nearly flawless: it correctly interprets the requirements, implements an efficient and precise SQL query using window functions to detect the exact direct sequence without gaps, accurately applies the >5-day filter between the specified events in the sequence, and excludes entire cases meeting both criteria while returning all events from non-matching cases. The strategy, query structure, and explanation are clear, logical, and free of inaccuracies or ambiguities. Minor stylistic notes (e.g., INTERVAL syntax is DuckDB-compatible, though '5 days' quoting is optional but harmless) do not detract from correctness.
