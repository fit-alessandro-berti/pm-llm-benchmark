The final grouping into three cases is accurate, with all events correctly assigned based on unique patient demographics (age/gender pairs are distinct across the sequence), logical activity progression (e.g., registration  triage  diagnostics  treatment  discharge), department coherence (ER-centric for Cases 1/2, Surgery-centric for Case 3), and timestamp ordering within each case. Additional info aligns seamlessly (e.g., X-ray body_part and diagnosis for Case 1; test_type/results and prescription for Case 2; procedure details for Case 3). No overlaps, omissions, or mismatches; all 18 events are covered without logical flaws. The structure and explanations are clear and precise.
