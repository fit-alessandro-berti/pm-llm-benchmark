The provided answer delivers a correct, complete, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all requirements. It accurately identifies cases with the specified consecutive sequence using `LEAD` window functions partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`, ensuring direct succession without intervening events. It then filters those cases where the timestamp difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in the triplet exceeds 5 days via interval arithmetic `(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY`, which is valid DuckDB syntax. The final selection excludes all events from matching cases using `NOT IN`, returning only events from non-matching cases as required. The approach handles edge cases (e.g., incomplete triplets via NULL `LEAD` values, multiple triplets per case) implicitly and correctly, with no logical flaws, ambiguities, or extraneous elements. The explanation is concise, accurate, and aligns perfectly with the code.
