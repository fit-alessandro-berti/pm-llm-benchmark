The provided answer delivers a correct, precise, and complete DuckDB SQL query that fully addresses the prompt's requirements without any inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical flaws. The use of row numbers to enforce consecutiveness, the interval comparison for the timing condition, and the NOT IN exclusion of entire cases are all implemented flawlessly. The structure assumes reasonable data properties (e.g., unique timestamps per event, as implied by the prompt's datetime specification), and no extraneous elements (e.g., unnecessary ordering) are added. The accompanying breakdown and notes enhance clarity but do not introduce errors. This is an exemplary solution.
