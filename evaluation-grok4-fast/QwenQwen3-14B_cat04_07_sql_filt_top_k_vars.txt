### Grading Rationale
The provided answer delivers a functionally correct DuckDB SQL query that accurately fulfills all core requirements: it extracts ordered activity sequences per `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` with proper ordering, groups and counts variants by frequency, identifies the top K via `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, and filters the original `event_log` to return only events from qualifying cases. The structure with CTEs is efficient and logical, and the final output matches the specification (all events from top K variant cases, excluding others). Explanations clarify the components without introducing errors.

However, under hypercritical evaluation:
- The `LIMIT K` uses an undefined placeholder (`K`), rendering the query non-executable as written without user modification (e.g., to a literal like `5` or a parameter like `?1`). While the explanation suggests replacing it, this is a logical flaw in the "final" query presentation, as the problem implies a complete, adaptable solution for "top K" without specifying a value. This minor incompleteness warrants a deduction, as it could lead to runtime errors in DuckDB without parameterization.
- No handling for potential ties in frequency (e.g., if multiple variants share the K-th count, `LIMIT` arbitrarily selects based on unspecified secondary ordering, potentially inconsistent with "top K by frequency"). The problem doesn't mandate tie-breaking, but strictness demands explicit acknowledgment or resolution (e.g., via `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()`) to ensure reproducibility.
- The delimiter `'->'` risks collisions if activity names contain it (e.g., an activity like "A->B" could parse ambiguously), though the problem doesn't specify safe assumptions about data—still, a more robust approach (e.g., a non-conflicting separator like `CHR(1)` or JSON aggregation) would be preferable for flawlessness.

These issues are minor but prevent a perfect score; the solution is otherwise robust, well-documented, and free of major inaccuracies or flaws.
