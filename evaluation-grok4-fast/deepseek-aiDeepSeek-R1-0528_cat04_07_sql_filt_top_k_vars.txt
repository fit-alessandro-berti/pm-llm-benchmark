The provided answer delivers a precise, efficient, and correct DuckDB SQL query that fully addresses the prompt's requirements. It accurately extracts ordered activity sequences per case using `array_agg` with proper sorting (including deterministic tie-breaking for timestamps via `activity`, which enhances reliability without violating the specification). Variants are grouped and counted correctly, with top K selection via `ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant_arr LIMIT K` ensuring exactly K variants (with deterministic tie-breaking). The final filtering retrieves all original events for matching cases, excluding others, while preserving all columns. The explanation is clear, concise, and aligns perfectly with the query's logic. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the solution is robust, performant in DuckDB, and handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., fewer than K variants).
