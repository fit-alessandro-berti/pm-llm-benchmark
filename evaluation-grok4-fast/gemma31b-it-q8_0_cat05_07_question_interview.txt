### Evaluation Summary
This answer is strong overall, producing a well-structured list of 13 open-ended questions that effectively target the prompt's goals: clarifying roles/responsibilities (e.g., questions 1–3), uncovering missing details and decision criteria (e.g., questions 4, 7, 9), verifying timing/sequencing (e.g., questions 2, 10, 11), and exploring exceptions (e.g., questions 5, 8–9, 11, 13). The questions are conceptual, avoid SQL or technical implementation, and draw directly from gaps in the provided process description (e.g., probing daily workflows, inspection impacts, and communication flows). Categorization aids clarity without detracting, and the closing note reinforces intent without violating the prompt.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor flaws prevent a perfect score:
- **Logical/accuracy issues**: Question 8 ("tenant’s application is rejected") logically fits tenant screening but introduces slight unclarity in "addressing the situation"—it vaguely implies conflict resolution (e.g., appeals or notifications) without tying tightly to onboarding's conceptual core, potentially eliciting off-topic responses. Question 5 flips the description's dynamic (coordinator requests docs) to "property owner requests additional," which is a valid exception probe but risks minor misalignment, assuming owner-initiated requests that aren't explicitly described.
- **Unclarity/borderline prompt violation**: Question 6 asks to "describe the system... beyond just the database," which edges toward implementation details (e.g., specific tools or integrations) rather than purely conceptual support for stages, contravening the "no implementation details" rule. The parenthetical explanations (e.g., "(This gets a sense of...)") add interpretive fluff that's unnecessary for the "list of questions" output, creating minor bloat and logical redundancy.
- **Comprehensiveness gap**: While strong on exceptions and roles, it under-emphasizes pure sequencing/timing (e.g., no direct question on overall timeline durations or handoffs between phases), leaving a small conceptual hole despite touches in questions 2 and 10.

These are subtle issues but warrant a deduction from flawless (10.0), resulting in a high-but-not-maximal score for near-excellence. With polishing (e.g., rephrasing 6 for pure conceptual flow, trimming notes), it would hit 10.0.
