The provided answer delivers a correct, complete, and efficient DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all specified requirements. The sequence detection via row-numbered joins ensures direct succession with no intervening events, the time calculation accurately measures elapsed days using DuckDB's EPOCH function, and the NOT IN exclusion targets entire cases while returning all qualifying events. The added ORDER BY enhances readability without altering semantics, and the explanation clearly validates the logic, including edge cases. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present.
