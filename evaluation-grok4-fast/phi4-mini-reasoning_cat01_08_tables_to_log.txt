The final output fails to deliver a comprehensive event log, providing only a partial, erroneous example for one case (1001) while using placeholders for the rest, violating the requirement to include every event for every order_id. Factual inaccuracies persist: the Order Created timestamp for 1001 is incorrectly listed as 2024-01-02T12:30Z (it should be 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z from the Orders table), and the resource is wrongly assigned as Bob Smith (SP-002) instead of Alice Brown (SP-001). No events are shown for orders 1002–1005, despite their data in all tables, including multiple deliveries for 1002 (which should generate separate Dispatched/Arrived events per delivery record, ordered chronologically per case). The notes explicitly describe a flawed methodology—"ordered globally by timestamp rather than per case instance"—which undermines process mining validity, as traces must be sequential per case ID, not globally interleaved. Other attributes (e.g., item_id, quantity for picking; carrier for delivery; payment_method) are omitted entirely, and resources are inconsistently mapped (e.g., no carrier names from Resources table for deliveries). Chronological order is not demonstrated correctly even in the partial example, as picking events precede creation in the table despite timestamps. This renders the output unusable for process mining, with no evidence of full data integration or logical inference from tables.
