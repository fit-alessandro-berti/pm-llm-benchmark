9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is strong overall, correctly addressing all core requirements of the prompt with a functional, single DuckDB SQL query that extracts ordered sequences per case, identifies and counts variants, selects top K by frequency, filters cases accordingly, and returns the relevant events from the original log. It uses appropriate DuckDB syntax (e.g., `string_agg` with internal `ORDER BY` for sequencing, parameter `:K`), handles ordering correctly within groups, and excludes non-top-K cases via a precise join. The final result preserves event structure and adds sensible global ordering (though not strictly required). The notes clarify key elements like the aggregator and parameterization.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, minor flaws prevent a perfect 10.0:
- **Redundant CTE (`ordered_events`)**: This CTE performs a global `ORDER BY case_id, "timestamp"` on the entire table, which is unnecessary and potentially misleading. The subsequent `variants` CTE's `string_agg` already enforces per-group ordering via its internal `ORDER BY "timestamp"`, so selecting directly from `event_log` would suffice and be more efficient (avoiding an unneeded sort on potentially large data). This introduces slight inefficiency and reduces clarity, as it implies the global order is required for aggregation when it's not.
- **Arbitrary tiebreaker in `top_k_variants`**: The `ORDER BY case_count DESC, variant` uses alphabetical sorting on `variant` for ties, which is deterministic but unspecified in the prompt (ties could be handled arbitrarily or by another criterion). It's not wrong but adds an unneeded assumption.
- **Assumes no edge cases**: No explicit handling for empty logs, cases with zero/duplicate timestamps (though `string_agg ORDER BY` would still work, order among ties is undefined), or activities containing `'->'` (which could collide variants, but this is a common limitation of string-based sequencing not addressed).

These are minor (the query executes correctly and meets specs), but per instructions, even small issues like redundancy and unclarified assumptions warrant docking from perfection. No major inaccuracies, logical flaws, or unclarities (e.g., it correctly groups by full sequences, counts frequencies, and filters events). A more optimized version without the redundant CTE would be flawless.
