This answer is fundamentally flawed and fails to address the prompt's requirements on every level. It is not a valid DuckDB SQL query (syntax errors include misplaced `AS meets_condition;` in the WHERE clause, which cannot alias a condition like that; the overall structure treats a filter as an alias, rendering it unparseable). It hardcodes irrelevant `case_id` values (1 and 2), ignoring dynamic sequence detection across any `case_id`. It does not identify sequences of three specific activities in direct succession (no use of LAG/LEAD, ROW_NUMBER, or joins to enforce order and consecutiveness). The timing filter uses `DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 5 DAY)` to check recency, not the elapsed time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events (>5 days). It filters individual rows instead of excluding entire cases meeting both criteria, and it includes rather than excludes the bad cases. No grouping, ordering, or case-level logic is present. This is closer to gibberish than a functional query, warranting the minimum score.
