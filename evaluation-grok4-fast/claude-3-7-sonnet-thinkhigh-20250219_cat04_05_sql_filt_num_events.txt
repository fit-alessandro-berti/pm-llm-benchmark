### Evaluation Breakdown
This answer is strong overall, providing a correct primary query, a clear explanation, and useful alternatives, which demonstrates solid understanding of the problem. The core subquery approach is flawless: it correctly uses `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to identify qualifying `case_id`s (6 events) and filters the full event set without altering the schema, matching the prompt's requirement to "return the full set of events" from filtered cases. The explanation accurately describes the logic, and DuckDB compatibility is implicit (as the SQL is standard).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are two notable issues that prevent a near-perfect score:
1. **Inaccuracy in the alternatives' claim**: The answer states that "All three approaches will produce the same result." This is logically flawed. While the first two (subquery and JOIN) output identical results (original columns only), the window function approach outputs an extra `event_count` column in the result set. This alters the schema, violating the intent of returning the "full set of events" without additions. It's a minor implementation oversight in the third query but a significant logical error in the blanket claim of equivalence—SQL "results" include both rows and columns.
2. **Unnecessary complexity without caveats**: Introducing alternatives is helpful but risks confusion without noting the schema difference. The prompt asks for *a* query, not multiples; the extras add value but introduce the flaw without mitigation (e.g., no `SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp` to exclude the extra column).

These are not fatal (the primary solution works perfectly), but they introduce unclarities and a logical inconsistency, warranting a deduction. A flawless response would stick to one perfect query or qualify the alternatives explicitly. No other issues: no syntax errors, correct grouping/filtering, and it handles the event-per-case logic precisely.
