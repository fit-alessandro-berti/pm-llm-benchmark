### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer demonstrates a strong conceptual understanding of the task, correctly breaking it down into steps using CTEs to extract ordered activity sequences per case, count variant frequencies, rank and select the top K variants, and filter/join back to the original event log to return only relevant events. The logic is sound: it preserves timestamp ordering via the aggregate function, groups properly by variant, uses window functions for ranking, and ensures the final output excludes non-top-K cases while returning all original columns/events.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, there are notable inaccuracies that prevent a higher score:

- **Syntax Incompatibility with DuckDB**: The core aggregation in the `variants` CTE uses `group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)`, which is not valid DuckDB syntax. DuckDB uses `string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp ASC)` for ordered string concatenation (PostgreSQL-compatible). The `group_concat` function exists in DuckDB as an alias in some versions but does not support the `WITHIN GROUP` clause—this is MySQL/Oracle-style syntax that will cause a runtime error. This is a critical flaw, as the query as written would fail to execute in DuckDB, undermining its usability despite the correct intent.

- **Minor Unclarity in Parameter Handling**: The use of `:K` as a placeholder is appropriate for parameterized queries, but the answer does not explicitly note how to substitute it (e.g., via DuckDB's parameter binding or literal replacement). While not a fatal error, this adds slight ambiguity for direct implementation.

- **Potential Edge Cases Not Addressed**: The query assumes unique timestamps per case (no ties in ordering), which could lead to non-deterministic sequences if duplicates exist—though the prompt implies timestamp-based sorting handles this implicitly. Additionally, if activities contain the delimiter `'->'`, variants could be malformed, but this is a nitpick not required by the prompt.

- **Overall Readability and Completeness**: The explanation is clear and step-by-step, mapping well to the task's requirements. No extraneous elements or logical flaws in the flow (e.g., the join correctly filters cases without duplicating events). The delimiter `'->'` is a nice touch for variant representation but not essential.

This is a solid, nearly correct solution that captures the essence flawlessly at a high level, but the syntax error is a significant execution barrier, warranting a deduction from what would otherwise be an 8.5–9.0. With the aggregate function fixed, it would be exemplary.
