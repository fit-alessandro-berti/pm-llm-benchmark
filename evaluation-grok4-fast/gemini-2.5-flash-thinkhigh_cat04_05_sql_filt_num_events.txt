The provided SQL query is logically sound and efficiently achieves the core objective using a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`) to compute event counts per case without requiring a separate GROUP BY and JOIN or IN subquery. This correctly filters rows to retain only those from cases with 6 events, returning the appropriate set of events while excluding others. The structure is clear, the subquery alias and comment are appropriately descriptive, and it adheres to standard SQL syntax supported in DuckDB. No performance or logical flaws are present; it handles grouping and filtering accurately.

However, deducting 1.0 point for a minor but notable inconsistency and potential incompleteness: the inner subquery comment explicitly states "Select all original columns from event_log," but the outer SELECT explicitly lists only the three specified columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`), potentially omitting any additional columns that the table "has at least" (as per the prompt). While the prompt does not mandate returning all columns and focuses on the "full set of events" (rows), strictly interpreted, this limits output unnecessarily when `SELECT *` (excluding the count column) or a correlated approach could ensure completeness without extra effort. This is a small clarity/precision issue but warrants a deduction under hypercritical evaluation.
