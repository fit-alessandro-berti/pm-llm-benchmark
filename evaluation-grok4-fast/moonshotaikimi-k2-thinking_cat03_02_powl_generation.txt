The provided code accurately constructs a POWL model that faithfully represents the described process scenario. All transitions are correctly defined with appropriate labels. The loop operator is properly applied to BNC and D&R, capturing the repeated configuration phase with exit condition. The XOR operator is correctly used for the exclusive choice between CD and MD. The root StrictPartialOrder includes all necessary nodes, and the added edges precisely enforce the required ordering constraints: sequential SR to CS; concurrent DA and ACI after CS; loop after both DA and ACI; deployment choice after loop; concurrent QA and SA after deployment; GLA after both QA and SA. No extraneous elements (e.g., unnecessary silent transitions) are introduced, and the semantics align with POWL definitions. The code is syntactically correct and executable assuming the pm4py library context.
