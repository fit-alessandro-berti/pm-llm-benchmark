### Evaluation Rationale
This response is exceptionally strong, delivering precisely 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that directly align with the prompt's requirements. They probe insights (e.g., Q3 on analytics), potential issues (e.g., Q1 on geopolitical risks), improvement strategies (e.g., Q7 on sustainability), and implications (e.g., Q14 on recalls and reputation). All questions are tightly relevant to the described supply chain process, drawing from elements like suppliers, assembly, logistics, regulations, digital systems, and global challenges without introducing extraneous topics. There are no inaccuracies, as the questions faithfully reflect the process description (e.g., no fabrication of unmentioned details). Logically, they build coherently, avoiding redundancy while covering a broad spectrum without overlap.

Clarity is outstanding: Each question is concise, well-phrased, and free of ambiguity or jargon that could confuse. The numbering and bolding aid readability, though not explicitly required.

Minor deduction (0.2 points): The introductory phrase ("Certainly! Here are...") slightly deviates from the strict "just list the questions" directive, adding polite framing that, while harmless and professional, isn't purely a bare list. Under hypercritical scrutiny, this is a trivial but present imperfection—no other flaws exist, making it nearly flawless overall.
