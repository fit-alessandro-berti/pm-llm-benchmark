The provided query is nearly flawless and fully satisfies the prompt's requirements with precise logic, correct DuckDB SQL syntax, and no detectable inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws. It accurately identifies consecutive sequences via row numbering and joins, filters for the exact activity sequence and >5-day interval condition, excludes matching cases entirely from the result set, and returns all events from non-matching cases while applying a sensible (though not strictly required) ordering for clarity. Minor elements like unused selected columns in the `triples` CTE or secondary sorting by `activity` in row numbering are harmless optimizations or reasonable assumptions, not flaws.
