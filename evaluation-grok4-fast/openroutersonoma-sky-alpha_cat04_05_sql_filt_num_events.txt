This query is precisely correct and directly fulfills the requirements without any deviations. It efficiently identifies qualifying case_ids via a subquery with proper GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, then returns all events for those cases using a straightforward IN filter. No extraneous logic, no performance issues in this context, and it aligns verbatim with the task's intent for DuckDB (as it's standard SQL).
