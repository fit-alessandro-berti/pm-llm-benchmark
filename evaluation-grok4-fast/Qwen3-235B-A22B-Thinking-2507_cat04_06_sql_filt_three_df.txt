The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and complete SQL query that precisely meets all requirements: it identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence using LEAD window functions, applies the strict >5 days filter on the relevant timestamp difference, collects distinct qualifying case_ids for exclusion, and returns all events from non-qualifying cases via a clean NOT IN subquery. The interval comparison syntax is DuckDB-compatible, the window partitioning and ordering ensure direct succession based on timestamps, and the explanation accurately summarizes the logic without introducing errors or ambiguities. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present.
