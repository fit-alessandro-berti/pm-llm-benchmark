The provided solution is nearly flawless. It correctly uses window functions (LEAD) to identify consecutive sequences within each case, accurately filters for the exact activity sequence starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition', applies the time condition precisely between the relevant timestamps (using interval arithmetic compatible with DuckDB), collects distinct qualifying case_ids, and excludes all events from those cases in the final output. The approach handles edge cases implicitly (e.g., cases with insufficient events won't match due to NULL LEAD values; multiple sequences per case are covered by DISTINCT). The explanation is clear, logical, and aligns perfectly with the requirements. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected, even under hypercritical scrutiny.
