### Evaluation Rationale
The final answer (post-<think> section) is highly structured, comprehensive, and directly addresses all three task components with clear headings, bullet points, and a summary table for accessibility. It accurately identifies normative violations exclusively in Case 2 (order reversal, skipped mandatory step, and prohibited action post-rejection), with precise timestamps and rule mappings—flawless on this. Desiderata analysis correctly distinguishes non-severe issues (timings calculated accurately at 49hr and 51hr; consistent noting of missing follow-up across cases), clarifies suboptimality without conflating with strict rules, and logically avoids applying timing desiderata to Case 2's skipped Inform Applicant. Interpretations are reasonable, evidence-based speculations (e.g., human/system error for Case 2, workload for Case 3) that align with constraints without fabricating details.

Minor deductions (hypercritical lens): 
- Slight phrasing inaccuracy in quoting the rejection rule ("do not finalize documentation before closing the case" implies sequencing nuance not in the original, which prohibits it outright post-rejection; though contextually clear and logically sound, this is a precise wording flaw warranting a small penalty).
- Interpretations for Case 1 are somewhat brief compared to others, bordering on underdeveloped (e.g., could tie more explicitly to "efficiency" vis-à-vis recommendations), though still adequate.
- No major unclarities or logical flaws, but the table simplifies "Normative Violations?" to "None" or "Yes (Order skip + Invalid action)" without enumerating all three issues from text—minor redundancy gap, not a flaw.

Overall, nearly flawless execution with exhaustive coverage; scores below 10 only for the nitpicks above, per strict criteria.
