10.0

The graded answer accurately identifies Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violations, with Cases 1 and 4 compliant, aligning perfectly with the normative description's constraints on sequencing (e.g., Authorize Payment before Package Items, Ship Order only after Package Items and never after Cancel Order, and logical branching based on inventory sufficiency). Explanations are precise, directly referencing key rules (e.g., "Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before 'Package items'" and prohibitions on shipping post-cancellation), and interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., implications of authorization signaling sufficiency) are logically sound without overreach or contradiction. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws in the final conclusions or structure.
