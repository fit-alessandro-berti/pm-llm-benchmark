The provided answer is a precise, correct, and fully compliant DuckDB SQL query that exactly meets all requirements of the prompt. It accurately identifies cases containing the specified consecutive activity sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') via sequential row numbering and self-joins on sequence numbers, enforces the >5-day interval condition between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' timestamps using DuckDB's native interval arithmetic, collects distinct matching case_ids for exclusion, and returns all events from non-matching cases with appropriate ordering by case_id and timestamp. The structure uses efficient CTEs, avoids unnecessary computations, handles the "direct succession" requirement without gaps or interleaving events, and produces a result set consisting solely of events from qualifying cases. The accompanying explanation is clear, concise, and directly reinforces the query's logic without extraneous details. No inaccuracies, logical flaws, unclarities, inefficiencies, or deviations from the prompt are present; even minor edge cases (e.g., cases with <3 events, multiple triples per case, or timestamp ties) are implicitly handled correctly within the query's design.
