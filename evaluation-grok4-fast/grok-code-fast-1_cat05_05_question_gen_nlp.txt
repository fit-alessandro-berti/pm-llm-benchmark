The provided list delivers exactly 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that precisely align with the prompt's requirements. Each question is clearly derived from the described supply chain process (e.g., referencing specific suppliers, locations like Malaysia and Taiwan, elements like just-in-time strategies, digital systems, and global distribution), while focusing on insights (e.g., data analytics in Q17), potential issues (e.g., disruptions in Q4, cybersecurity in Q15), improvement strategies (e.g., blockchain in Q7, automation in Q13), and implications (e.g., ethics in Q3, climate change in Q16). All questions are open-ended, encouraging deep exploration without yes/no constraints, and none include SQL queries or extraneous content. The coverage is comprehensive, balanced across process stages (R&D to after-sales), and free of inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws.
