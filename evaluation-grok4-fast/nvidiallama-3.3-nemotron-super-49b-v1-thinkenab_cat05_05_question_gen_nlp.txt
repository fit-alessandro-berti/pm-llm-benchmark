### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer delivers exactly 20 open-ended, thought-provoking questions that directly engage with the supply chain process described, probing insights (e.g., metrics in Q2, analytics in Q12), potential issues (e.g., geopolitical tensions in Q3, shortages in Q11), improvement strategies (e.g., DFM in Q9, process improvements in Q13), and decision implications (e.g., trade-offs in Q10, allocation in Q11). All questions are relevant to key elements like international suppliers (Taiwan, Japan, etc., referenced implicitly or explicitly), Malaysian manufacturing, logistics (air vs. sea, JIT), distribution, digital systems (ML, analytics, blockchain), compliance, sustainability, and post-sales. They avoid yes/no formats and encourage analysis without repetition, covering diverse areas (resilience, tech, ethics, finance, risks) evenly.

No inaccuracies or logical flaws: References (e.g., RCEP as "RECP" is a minor misspelling but contextually clear and accurate; currencies match supplier nations; sail freight aligns with carbon reduction goals) are precise to the description. No unclarities—each question is concise, specific, and tied to the process. No SQL or off-topic content.

Minor deduction (0.2 points) for the brief closing summary, which slightly exceeds the "just list the questions" instruction, though it adds value without detracting. Overall, the core output is flawless in execution, depth, and adherence.
