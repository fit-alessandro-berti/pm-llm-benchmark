1.0

This "answer" fails catastrophically to address the core task. It provides no analysis of the event log, identifies zero normative violations or desiderata shortcomings across the three cases, offers no explanations or justifications, and entirely ignores the structured requirements (e.g., breaking down by case, clarifying severity of desiderata issues, suggesting interpretations). Instead, it consists only of a vague, preparatory acknowledgment that restates the task in generic terms without delivering any substantive content. This is not an answer—it's an empty prelude, rendering it useless and warranting the minimum score under hypercritical evaluation. Even minor efforts (e.g., attempting partial coverage of one case) would justify a slight bump, but this exhibits zero engagement with the problem.
