The provided SQL query is invalid and non-functional as written. It references an undefined relation `triplet_events` (and sub-aliases like `te`, `td`, `te_create`, `te_confirm`) without any defining WITH clause or FROM clause to instantiate it, rendering the entire subquery syntactically erroneous in DuckDB (or any SQL dialect). This alone makes the query unrunnable and unable to produce the required output. Even assuming the thought process's incomplete CTE definitions were intended to be included (which they are not in the final code block), those CTEs contain critical flaws: 

- `case_events` performs a self-referential join on `ordered_cases` using an undefined `position_in_order` (circular logic, as `position_in_order` is selected in the CTE but used in its own FROM/JOIN).
- `triplet_events` selects `ce.timestamp`, but the preceding `case_events` CTE does not include `timestamp` in its SELECT list, causing a column-not-found error.
- The time difference calculation `(te_confirm.timestamp - te_create.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'` is syntactically plausible in DuckDB (assuming `timestamp` is TIMESTAMP type), but it's inaccessible due to the upstream errors.
- The inner subquery for `td` redundantly repeats WHERE conditions in the ON clause that reference undefined aliases (`te_create`, `te_confirm` in the ON scope), leading to additional syntax errors and logical redundancy (it would produce duplicate case_ids if it ran, but it won't).
- The overall structure fails to correctly identify consecutive events: while it attempts to use `ROW_NUMBER()` for positioning (a correct conceptual start), the joins on `position_in_order + 1` and `+2` assume flawless 1-based sequencing, but the broken CTEs prevent this from working. It also doesn't handle ties in timestamps (possible duplicates or non-strict ordering), which could break the "direct succession" logic.
- The final result excludes events from matching cases (correct intent), but due to the invalid subquery, it would return the entire `event_log` (or error), not the filtered set. No grouping is applied where needed (e.g., DISTINCT on case_ids isn't sufficient in the broken structure), and the arbitrary `ORDER BY event_log.timestamp` is present but irrelevant to correctness.

These are not minor issues; they are foundational inaccuracies that prevent the query from achieving any of the three required steps. The answer demonstrates partial conceptual grasp (e.g., using row numbers for succession, time intervals) but delivers a flawed, incomplete, and erroneous implementation that cannot be executed or corrected without a full rewrite.
