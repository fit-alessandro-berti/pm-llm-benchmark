The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and clear DuckDB SQL query that precisely achieves the task: it identifies cases with 6 events via a CTE grouping and counting, then joins back to retrieve only the qualifying events from the original table, without including extraneous columns or data. The syntax is valid for DuckDB, the logic handles grouping and filtering accurately, and the result returns the full set of events for valid cases as required. The explanation, while slightly imprecise in phrasing (e.g., describing the WHERE as "filtering the CTE" when it filters the joined result), supports the code without introducing errors or confusion, and the overall solution is flawless in execution and intent.
