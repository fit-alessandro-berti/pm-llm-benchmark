### Evaluation Rationale
The final textual BPMN-like model is a strong, coherent representation that effectively consolidates the interviews into a structured format suitable for diagram conversion. It accurately captures the core sequence (receipt  PO verification  logging  forwarding  validation/confirmation  matching  approval  payment), key gateways (e.g., PO existence, matching discrepancies, manager approval), roles (all major ones assigned correctly, with Karen limited to exceptions as per transcripts), artifacts (invoice, PO, emails, schedules), and exceptions/variations (e.g., supplier escalations, retrospective POs, rejections with loops implied via holds/escalations). Ambiguities are explicitly noted (e.g., approval trigger, resolution paths), fulfilling the guidance to indicate uncertainty without disrupting flow. Logical coherence is maintained despite interview variances, with no major inaccuracies—minor overlaps (e.g., validation across steps 4–6 reflecting perspective differences) are not flaws but consolidations, and the model avoids unsubstantiated assumptions. The only hypercritical nitpick is a slight syntactic awkwardness in one exception path description ("Invoice  Escalate..."), but this does not impact clarity or convertibility to BPMN. Overall, it is nearly flawless in completeness, precision, and usability.
