### Explanation of Grade
The answer correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) and confirms non-violating ones (1 and 4), earning strong marks for the core task of identification. The structure is clear, with a summary table, detailed breakdowns, and references to the normative description, demonstrating solid organization and relevance. Explanations for Cases 2 and 5 are accurate and comprehensive, directly tying violations to specific rules (e.g., packaging before authorization in Case 2; missing packaging before shipping in Case 5) without unnecessary speculation.

However, the analysis of Case 3 is incomplete and flawed, warranting a deduction. While it correctly flags the primary issue of shipping after cancellation (violating the "never after a cancellation" rule and the cancellation path's logic), it overlooks additional clear deviations:
- After "Check inventory," the process did not "directly proceed to 'Cancel order'" as required for insufficient inventory; instead, "Authorize payment" was inserted, which the description implies should only occur if inventory is sufficient (authorizing payment before cancellation risks unnecessary financial processing when the order should terminate at cancellation).
- "Ship order" also occurs without any preceding "Package items," violating the rule that shipping must follow packaging (though this is secondary to the post-cancellation issue, it compounds the fulfillment errors).

These omissions mean the explanation understates the violations in Case 3, failing to fully interpret the normative constraints (e.g., the "direct" progression after check and the exclusivity of paths based on inventory sufficiency). The ambiguity resolution section reinforces path exclusivity but does not apply it to flag the improper authorization in the cancellation branch. Under hypercritical evaluation, this logical gap—incomplete rule application and missed deviations—prevents a higher score, as the task requires thorough explanation of *all* violated rules or expectations. Minor strengths (e.g., no factual errors in sequences, strict adherence to provided log) mitigate but do not fully offset the issue. A nearly flawless response would exhaustively cover every implied constraint per case without gaps.
