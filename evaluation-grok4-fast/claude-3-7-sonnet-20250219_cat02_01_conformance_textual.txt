### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a thorough, accurate, and well-structured analysis that closely aligns with the task requirements. It systematically evaluates all five cases, correctly identifies the compliant ones (Cases 1 and 4) and the violating ones (Cases 2, 3, and 5), and provides clear, evidence-based explanations tied directly to the normative description. The interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., the logical inconsistency in Case 3 where authorization implies sufficient inventory but cancellation implies otherwise) are reasonable and enhance the analysis without overreaching. References to specific constraints (e.g., sequencing rules for authorization, packaging, shipping, and cancellation) are precise and avoid unsubstantiated claims.

Minor deductions (-0.5) stem from hypercritical scrutiny: 
- In Case 3, while the shipping-after-cancellation violation is correctly flagged as major, the answer could have explicitly noted the additional implied violation of shipping without prior packaging (as per the description's rule that shipping follows packaging), though this is secondary to the cancellation branch and does not materially weaken the response.
- The summary is concise but could have briefly quantified compliance (e.g., "2 compliant, 3 non-compliant") for added precision, though this is a nitpick given the overall completeness.

No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; the response is logically sound, readable, and free of extraneous content. It merits a near-perfect score for its fidelity to the prompt.
