10.0

The provided answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and logically sound, demonstrating a precise interpretation of the normative description without introducing ambiguities or overreaching. It correctly identifies all violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while confirming the conformant ones (1 and 4), with explanations that directly reference key textual constraints (e.g., sequencing dependencies, mutually exclusive paths, and prohibitions like shipping after cancellation). No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present—violations are explained with specificity, and the structure enhances readability without extraneous content. This meets the criteria for a maximum score.
