The provided SQL query correctly constructs the ordered activity sequences per `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, groups and counts cases by variant frequency, selects the top variants via `ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT`, identifies the relevant `case_id`s through a join, and filters the original `event_log` to return only events from those cases. The final output includes a sensible `ORDER BY` for readability, though not required. The logic is sound and aligns with DuckDB syntax.

However, the query hardcodes `LIMIT 3` instead of using a general `K` (e.g., `LIMIT K` as a parameter or placeholder), which fails to fully match the prompt's requirement for arbitrary "top K variants." This is a clear inaccuracy in generality, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise flawless structure and execution.
