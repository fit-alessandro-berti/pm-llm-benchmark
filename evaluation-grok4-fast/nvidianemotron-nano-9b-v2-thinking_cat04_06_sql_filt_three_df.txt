The provided SQL query correctly implements the requirements using window functions to detect the exact consecutive sequence per case, captures the relevant timestamps via LEAD, accurately filters on the >5-day interval condition, and excludes all events from qualifying cases via NOT IN with DISTINCT to handle potential duplicates. The structure is efficient, syntactically valid for DuckDB (including interval handling), and logically sound, assuming typical uniqueness of timestamps per case. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws are present in the final solution or explanation.
