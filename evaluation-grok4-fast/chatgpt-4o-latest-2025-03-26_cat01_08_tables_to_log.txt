### Evaluation Summary
This answer is exceptionally strong and nearly flawless in structure, completeness, and adherence to the prompt, warranting a very high score. It correctly integrates all tables, derives logical activities (e.g., separate events for multi-item pickings, multi-delivery dispatches/arrivals, and multi-invoices/payments), maintains chronological order within each case (essential for process mining traces), and enriches with resources using the provided mapping. The Markdown table is well-formatted, assumptions are explicitly documented, and other attributes are relevant without bloat. Output directly matches the required format, and all events for every order_id are included based on available data (e.g., correctly omitting missing downstream events for order 1004).

However, docking 0.5 points for a few hypercritical minor issues (none fatal, but per instructions, even small ones impact significantly):
- **Logical ambiguity in resource assignment for deliveries**: Assigning the carrier (e.g., "GlobalTransport (Carrier)") as the "Resource/Actor" for both "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" is reasonable but not explicitly supported by the tables—dispatch might logically involve warehouse staff (e.g., a picker or dispatcher), not the carrier, who is more arrival-focused. The prompt recommends inferring "who performed the activity," and while carriers are entities, this introduces slight interpretive stretch without documentation in assumptions.
- **Inconsistent other attributes detail**: For "Order Arrived" events, only `delivery_id` is included (no note, unlike dispatched), which is minor but uneven—notes (e.g., "Partial backorder") could enrich arrivals if relevant. Similarly, payment events include `payment_id` (redundant with activity context) but omit tying back to invoice_id explicitly.
- **Global sorting not fully chronological**: The table is sorted by Case ID then timestamp (standard for event logs), but the prompt emphasizes "chronological order reflects the real process flow" without specifying per-case grouping. A fully global timestamp sort could better visualize cross-case flows, though this is a nitpick as per-case is conventional and functional.

No inaccuracies in data mapping, missing events, or unclarities—every linkage (e.g., payments via invoice_id to order_id) is precise. If these minors were absent, it would be a perfect 10.0.
