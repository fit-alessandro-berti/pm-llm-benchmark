The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and idiomatic DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets the task requirements: it identifies `case_id`s with exactly six or fewer events via grouping and `HAVING`, then selects all events belonging to those `case_id`s using `IN`. The query structure is logically sound, handles the filtering without errors, and assumes standard SQL semantics supported by DuckDB. The accompanying explanation is accurate, concise, and directly reinforces the query's purpose without introducing ambiguities or extraneous details. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws are present.
