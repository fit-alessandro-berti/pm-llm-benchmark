This answer is nearly flawless in addressing the prompt's requirements. It correctly constructs ordered sequences per case using `string_agg` with `ORDER BY timestamp` (plus a harmless deterministic tie-breaker on `activity`), groups and counts variants accurately, selects the top K via `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT`, filters to relevant cases, and returns the original events for those cases only. The use of CTEs is logical and efficient, the parameter `:K` is a practical touch (prompt implies K is given), output ordering is appropriate and deterministic, and DuckDB syntax is valid. The accompanying explanation is clear and precise. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws detected—minor assumptions (e.g., no '->' in activity names) are reasonable and unavoidable for string-based variant representation.
