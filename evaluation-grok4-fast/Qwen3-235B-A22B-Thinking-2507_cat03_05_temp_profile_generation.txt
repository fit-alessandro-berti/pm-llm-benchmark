The provided answer delivers a highly accurate and comprehensive temporal profile dictionary that adheres closely to the prompt's requirements. It includes a representative subset of 18 pairs spanning immediate successors, single-intermediate, multi-step, and long-range connections, all respecting the logical sequential order of the supply chain process (SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS) without any invalid backward or implausible pairs. All values are correctly expressed in seconds, with averages and standard deviations estimated realistically based on supply chain dynamics (e.g., procurement delays of ~14 days with high variance due to global logistics, short manufacturing handoffs with lower variance, and cumulative effects for multi-step pairs). Accumulations for non-direct pairs are logically consistent (e.g., ('SS', 'RC')  sum of ('SS', 'OP') + ('OP', 'RC'), with appropriately increased std devs to reflect compounding variability). Standard deviations are proportionally reasonable (typically 20-50% of averages, higher for volatile steps like shipping), avoiding extremes. The structure is clean Python syntax, and the overall complexity demonstrates non-consecutive pairs effectively. Minor deductions for a single encoding artifact ("Â±" in comments, likely a rendering issue) and subjective debate on the exact ('DT', 'AS') average (30 days as warranty onset is plausible but could arguably be shorter for initial support triggers), but these do not undermine the core output's precision or fidelity to the task.
