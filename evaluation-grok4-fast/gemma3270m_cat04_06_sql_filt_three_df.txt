This answer is entirely unrelated to the prompt's requirements and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the task. It hardcodes a single specific case ID ('case_1'), filters for only one irrelevant activity ('Approve Purchase Requisition'), and applies an arbitrary single-day timestamp range that has no connection to sequence detection or timing conditions. There is no logic for identifying sequences of three activities in direct succession, no calculation of time elapsed between events (let alone a >5 days check), no grouping or windowing to detect patterns per case, and no exclusion mechanism to return all events from non-matching cases—instead, it returns at most a handful of rows from one case, which is the opposite of the required output (all events from qualifying cases). This is not a valid attempt at the query and fails on every conceivable criterion, warranting the minimum score.
