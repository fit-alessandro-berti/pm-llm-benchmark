7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The answer effectively identifies key manifestations of bias, such as the +10 community adjustment favoring the Highland Civic Darts Club (correctly citing C001 and C004 examples) and disparities in approval thresholds linked to local residency (e.g., C004 at 700 approved vs. C003 at 715 rejected, and C005 requiring 740). It ties these to fairness implications, including barriers for those without affiliations or geographic ties despite similar creditworthiness, using a clear structure with examples, a table, and structural inequities discussion. The conclusions emphasize systemic favoritism unrelated to financial merit, aligning well with the question's focus.

However, strict scrutiny reveals flaws warranting deductions:
- **Inaccuracies in data interpretation**: The statement "All local residents (C1–C4) were approved except Case C3 (a non-local resident)" is factually wrong and logically inconsistent—C003 is non-local (FALSE), so grouping it with locals (C001, C002, C004) misrepresents the data and undermines the residency bias claim.
- **Speculative assumptions without evidence**: References to "typical approval thresholds" (e.g., 690 as "below") and de facto stricter thresholds for non-locals are inferred but not supported by the log, introducing ungrounded speculation that weakens logical rigor. While patterns exist (e.g., 715 rejected vs. 700 approved), claiming arbitrary links to "creditworthiness metrics" overstates without explicit rules from the data.
- **Hallucinated elements**: Citations to [3], [9], [5], [7] (e.g., for log analysis tools or normalization) appear fabricated, as no search results or external references exist in the provided context—this introduces irrelevant, inaccurate noise into conclusions.
- **Unclarities and minor flaws**: The manual review subjectivity point is valid but vague (e.g., doesn't specify if Reviewer #4's decision explicitly favored locals). Recommendations, while useful, are extraneous to the question's analytical focus. Phrasing like "C4’s preliminary score of **690** (below typical approval thresholds)" has a formatting glitch ("710  720" likely a typo for "710  720").

These issues—particularly the data error and speculation—prevent a near-flawless score, though the core analysis remains insightful and mostly accurate. A higher grade would require precise data handling, evidence-based claims, and no extraneous/inaccurate additions.
