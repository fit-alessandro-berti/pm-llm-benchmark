7.0

### Explanation of Grade
The answer is structured well, directly addressing all three task components with clear headings, bullet points, and concise explanations. It accurately identifies the normative violations in Case 2 (order reversal and improper finalization post-rejection) and correctly states compliance for Cases 1 and 3. The desiderata analysis is precise, including accurate time calculations (e.g., ~49 hours for Case 3's credit check delay and ~51 hours for the inform delay) and appropriately noting the non-severe nature of these issues without overemphasizing them. Justifications are reasonable, plausible, and aligned with the problem's context (e.g., suggesting system errors or workload delays), covering all cases without fabricating unsupported claims.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, the answer has a significant flaw: it completely omits a clear normative violation in Case 2—the skipping of "Inform Applicant," which is mandatory after Loan Decision regardless of approval/rejection status (per the sequence: Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...). The log shows this step absent, making it a direct sequence skip, yet it's not mentioned among the violations or in justifications. This is not a minor oversight (e.g., verbosity or unclear phrasing) but a substantive inaccuracy that undermines the completeness of the normative analysis, as the task requires identifying *all* violations of strict rules. No other logical flaws or unclarities exist, but this alone prevents a score above 7.0, as the response is strong but not "nearly flawless."
