6.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Hypercritical Assessment)
This grade reflects a solid but flawed response: it correctly identifies some normative violations and all desiderata issues, with clear explanations and appropriate clarifications on severity. The interpretations/justifications are reasonable, generic, and aligned with the task, offering practical suggestions without fabricating details. However, the response contains a critical inaccuracy by omitting a major normative violation in Case 2 (complete absence of "Inform Applicant," which is explicitly required after every Loan Decision per the constraints). This is not a minor oversight—it's a core sequence rule, making the analysis incomplete and logically flawed. Case 1 is implicitly handled correctly by omission (no violations), but the partial coverage of Case 2's issues artificially inflates completeness. Desiderata handling is flawless, earning credit, but the normative gap alone warrants a significant deduction (from a potential 9+ to mid-range). Minor issues include slightly imprecise timestamps in explanations (e.g., Case 3's Inform Applicant is ~51 hours after Decision, not vaguely "more than 48 hours," though this is nitpicky) and overly broad justifications that don't deeply tie back to "line with the given constraints" (e.g., no reference to specific process safeguards). No unclarities, but the response ends with an extraneous summary sentence not required by the task, adding no value. Nearly flawless would require exhaustive, error-free coverage of all violations.
