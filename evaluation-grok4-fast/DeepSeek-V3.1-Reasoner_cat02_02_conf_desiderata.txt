The provided answer is comprehensive, accurate, and directly addresses all three tasks with precision. It correctly identifies normative violations only in Case 2 (with specific, exhaustive explanations matching the log and rules, including the critical omission of Inform Applicant, which is a clear skip of a mandatory step). For desiderata, it appropriately distinguishes non-severe suboptimalities across all cases, evaluates timing where possible (e.g., explicit calculations for Case 3 delays), and handles Case 2's missing Inform Applicant by noting its impact on recommendations without conflating it with normative issues. Interpretations are plausible, grounded in process realities (e.g., human/system errors for violations, external factors for delays), and avoid speculation. Structure is logical and concise, with no ambiguities, logical flaws, or omissions—even minor details like the lack of Follow-up Call are consistently treated as recommended only.
