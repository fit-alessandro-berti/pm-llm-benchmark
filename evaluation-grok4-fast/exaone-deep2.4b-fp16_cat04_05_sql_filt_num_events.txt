The provided SQL query correctly identifies cases with 6 or fewer events using CTEs to compute counts and filter case_ids, then returns all events from those valid cases. It adheres precisely to the requirements, uses standard DuckDB syntax, handles grouping and filtering accurately, and includes a clear, accurate explanation. No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities are present; the minor redundancy of `DISTINCT` in `valid_cases` is harmless and does not affect functionality or optimality in a meaningful way.
