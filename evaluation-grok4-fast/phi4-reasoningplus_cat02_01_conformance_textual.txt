### Evaluation Rationale
The answer is structured, comprehensive, and accurate in identifying violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while correctly deeming Cases 1 and 4 compliant. It provides clear explanations tied directly to the normative description's rules (e.g., ordering constraints for authorization and packaging, prohibition on post-cancellation fulfillment, requirement for packaging in the sufficient-inventory branch). The interpretations of ambiguities (e.g., inferring insufficient inventory from the presence of cancellation in Case 3, without recorded outcomes) are reasonable and well-justified, avoiding overreach.

Minor deduction for slight imprecision in Case 2's wording: phrases like "the next step must be 'Authorize payment'" and (in the summary) "must come immediately after 'Check inventory'" overstate the description, which mandates sequential ordering ("after Check inventory and before packaging") but not strict immediacy. This introduces a tiny logical flaw, though it does not undermine the core violation identification or explanation. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws noted— the conclusions are flawless.
