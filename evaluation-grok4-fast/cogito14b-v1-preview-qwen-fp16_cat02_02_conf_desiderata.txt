6.0

### Explanation of Grade
The answer is structured correctly around the task's three components and identifies the primary normative violations in Case 2 accurately (out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check and unauthorized Finalize Documentation after rejection). It appropriately distinguishes normative rules from desiderata, notes Case 3's timing issues and lack of Follow-up Call as suboptimal (not severe), and provides reasonable interpretations/justifications limited to desiderata deviations without excusing normative breaches. Case 1 is implicitly compliant, which aligns with the log.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, significant flaws prevent a higher score:
- **Major omission in normative analysis (Case 2):** The answer fails to identify the complete skipping of the mandatory "Inform Applicant" step, which occurs after Loan Decision in every case per the strict sequence (no such event exists in Case 2's log). This is a required activity ("the applicant must be informed of the outcome"), not optional, representing a clear normative violation (skipping steps). Identifying only two violations out of three core ones makes the analysis incomplete and logically flawed.
- **Inaccuracy in desiderata details (Case 3):** The description of Inform Applicant timing as "on day 5 after the loan decision" is factually wrong; the log shows ~51 hours (from 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00), or roughly 2-3 days post-decision, not day 5. The Credit Check delay is approximated as "48 hours" but is actually ~49 hours—minor, but combined with the above, it shows imprecise handling of timestamps. This introduces unclarities that could mislead.
- **Minor issues:** No explicit statement on Case 1's full compliance (e.g., it meets both normative and desiderata, including prompt timings), leaving the analysis slightly unbalanced. Justifications are speculative ("system backlogs") without tying directly to log evidence, bordering on vagueness. The response doesn't clarify Case 2's desiderata (e.g., its own timing issues are overshadowed but could be noted as irrelevant due to normative failures).

These issues—especially the missed violation and timeline errors—result in an incomplete and imprecise response, warranting a mid-range score despite the overall logical structure. A nearly flawless answer would cover all violations exhaustively, use exact log-based timings, and explicitly address compliance for non-violating cases.
