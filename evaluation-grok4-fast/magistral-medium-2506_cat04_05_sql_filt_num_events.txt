The provided answer delivers two correct, equivalent DuckDB SQL queries that precisely fulfill the task: they accurately group by `case_id` to count events, filter to retain only cases with 6 events, and return the full set of events (via `SELECT *`) for those cases, excluding all others. Both approaches use standard SQL constructs supported in DuckDB (CTEs with JOIN and window functions), with no syntax errors, logical flaws, or inaccuracies in implementation or explanation. The optional `ORDER BY` enhances readability without altering the required output, and the efficiency note is a valid, non-mandatory insight. The solution is complete, efficient, and directly addresses the prompt's requirements without extraneous elements.
