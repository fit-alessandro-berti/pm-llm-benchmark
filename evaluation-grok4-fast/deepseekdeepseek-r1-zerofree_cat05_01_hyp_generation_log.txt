The final conclusions consist of five well-constructed, PostgreSQL-compatible SQL queries that directly target the hypothesized anomalies (premature shipping/confirmation, early payment receipt, order-type correlations, and resource involvement). They effectively use LEFT JOINs, MIN timestamps, COALESCE for handling missing events, HAVING clauses for sequence violations, STRING_AGG for sequence visualization, and relevant JOINs to ancillary tables without unnecessary complexity or errors. These queries align precisely with the prompt's requirements for investigation, enabling further validation of anomalies like out-of-order events and potential causes (e.g., order type or resources). Minor deductions for the fifth query's hardcoded case IDs (slightly less generalizable than the others) and lack of explicit handling for potential duplicate activities in aggregations, but these are negligible given the schema and data context.
