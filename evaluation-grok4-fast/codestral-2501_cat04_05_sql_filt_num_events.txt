The provided answer is nearly flawless: the SQL query correctly uses a CTE to compute event counts per `case_id`, applies the `HAVING` clause to filter for counts 6 (accurately excluding >6 as required), and performs an inner join to retrieve the full set of events for qualifying cases without introducing extraneous data, duplicates, or performance issues. The syntax is standard and compatible with DuckDB. The explanation is precise, directly mapping to the required steps (counting, filtering, returning events), with no inaccuracies, ambiguities, or logical gaps. No minor issues are present.
