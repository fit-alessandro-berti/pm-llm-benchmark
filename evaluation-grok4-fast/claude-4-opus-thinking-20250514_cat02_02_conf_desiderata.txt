8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer is strong in structure, completeness, and overall alignment with the task. It correctly identifies all normative violations in Case 2 (sequence reversal, improper finalization after rejection, and missing mandatory "Inform Applicant" step), while accurately clearing Cases 1 and 3 of normative issues. The desiderata section properly distinguishes non-severe deviations (e.g., timing delays in Case 3 and omitted follow-up calls across all cases), clarifies their suboptimal nature without overstating severity, and handles Case 2's timing as compliant (which it is, within 24 hours). The interpretations section offers plausible justifications (e.g., system errors or resource constraints) that align with the constraints, and the summary ties everything together effectively.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, the answer contains a clear factual inaccuracy in the desiderata analysis for Case 2: it states the "Credit Check timing: Completed within 20 minutes," but the log shows Application Received at 08:00 and Credit Check at 09:00 (60 minutes later). This is a minor but unambiguous error—likely a misreading of the Risk Assessment timestamp (08:20)—that introduces logical inconsistency, as the claimed 20 minutes does not match the event log. Per the evaluation instructions, even minor inaccuracies warrant a significant deduction from a maximum score, preventing a "nearly flawless" rating. No other major flaws (e.g., omissions, logical gaps, or misinterpretations of rules) are present, but this prevents a score above 8.0.
