### Evaluation
This answer demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the overall structure needed—using CTEs to identify problematic cases based on activity sequence and timing, then excluding events from those cases in the final SELECT. The use of self-joins with timestamp ordering correctly ensures the activities appear in the right chronological order within a case, and the timing filter with DATEDIFF(>5 days) between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is appropriately applied. The exclusion logic via NOT IN is sound for filtering out entire cases, and the final ORDER BY provides a logical presentation of results. The explanatory notes are clear and helpful, including a caveat about dialect variations in date functions (though DuckDB actually uses `date_diff('day', start, end)` or `timestampdiff`, so the syntax is slightly imprecise but not critically so).

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, the answer has a fundamental logical flaw that undermines its correctness: it fails to enforce "direct succession" with "no other event... in between them." The self-joins only guarantee timestamp ordering (e1 < e2 < e3), but they do not prevent intervening events between the triples. For instance, a case with activities like 'Approve Purchase Requisition' (t1), 'Some Other Activity' (t1.5), 'Create Order' (t2), 'Confirm Order' (t3) would incorrectly match, as long as timestamps increase, leading to erroneous case exclusion if the t2-to-t3 gap >5 days. This violates the prompt's explicit requirement for consecutive events in the case's sequence.

To fix this, the query would need to incorporate per-case event ranking (e.g., via ROW_NUMBER() over timestamp per case_id) and check for consecutive ranks (e.g., rn, rn+1, rn+2 matching the activities), or add subqueries to verify no events exist between the timestamps of each pair in the triple. The answer's explanation glosses over this by claiming the joins "ensure... the correct order" without addressing consecutiveness, introducing unclarities and inaccuracies. Additionally, minor issues include potential over-matching if a case has multiple instances of the activities (the joins could pair non-intended triples), lack of handling for duplicate timestamps (though unlikely), and no explicit LIMIT or pagination consideration (not required but could be relevant for large logs). These flaws, especially the core logical omission, prevent a high score despite the solid framework.
