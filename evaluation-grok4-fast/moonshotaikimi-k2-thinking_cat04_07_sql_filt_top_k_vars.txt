The provided answer delivers a correct, efficient, and complete DuckDB SQL query that precisely meets all specified requirements. It accurately extracts ordered activity sequences using `list(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`, groups and counts cases by variant to identify and rank top K frequencies (with `DENSE_RANK` appropriately handling ties without introducing flaws), filters cases belonging to those variants, and returns only the original events from qualifying cases via an optimized `INNER JOIN`. The query structure is clear, logically sound, with no inaccuracies, unclarities, or inefficiencies impacting correctness. Explanations reinforce the implementation without errors, and performance notes are accurate and optional enhancements.
