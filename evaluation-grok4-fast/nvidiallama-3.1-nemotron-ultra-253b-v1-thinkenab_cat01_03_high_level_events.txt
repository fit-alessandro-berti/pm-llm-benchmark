### Evaluation Summary
The provided answer is exemplary in its adherence to the prompt's requirements. It delivers a precise, structured output that fully addresses identifying high-level steps, justifying groupings with clear rationales tied to temporal sequence, resource involvement, and logical process phases, and assigning domain-relevant names. All low-level events from the sample log are comprehensively and accurately grouped without omission or misattribution, demonstrating a consistent pattern applicable to the full log. The additional "grouping_logic" section enhances clarity by explicitly outlining criteria, fulfilling the goal of transforming granular events into meaningful workflow stages. No inaccuracies, unclarities, redundancies, or logical flaws are present; the groupings are coherent, defensible, and minimally granular while respecting distinct phases (e.g., separating weld-specific quality from final inspection avoids over-aggregation). This response is nearly flawless under strict scrutiny.
