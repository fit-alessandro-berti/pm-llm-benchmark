The provided SQL query correctly implements the requirements. It uses window functions (LEAD) partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp` to detect the exact consecutive sequence of the three specified activities starting from 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. The time difference calculation `(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'` accurately targets the interval between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence, using proper DuckDB interval syntax. The NOT IN exclusion ensures all events from matching `case_id`s are omitted, returning only events from cases that lack at least one such qualifying sequence. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; edge cases like multiple sequences, insufficient events, or exact 5-day intervals are handled as intended by the filtering logic.
