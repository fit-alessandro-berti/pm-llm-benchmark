The provided SQL query correctly uses a CTE to identify and filter case_ids with 6 events via GROUP BY and HAVING, then joins back to the event_log to retrieve all columns (el.*) for those cases only. The approach accurately excludes cases with >6 events while preserving the full event details for qualifying cases, and the optional ORDER BY enhances readability without altering the core result. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the solution fully aligns with the task requirements.
