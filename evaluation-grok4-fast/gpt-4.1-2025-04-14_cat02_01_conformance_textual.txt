### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong, demonstrating a precise, structured, and comprehensive analysis that directly addresses the task's requirements. It correctly identifies the violating cases (2, 3, and 5) while clearing 1 and 4, with explanations tightly referenced to the normative description's constraints and sequences. The use of reference summaries, per-case tables, a summary table, and detailed violation breakdowns enhances clarity and logical flow, resolving ambiguities (e.g., interpreting payment authorization as prohibited in the cancel path) without overstepping. Interpretations are reasonable and grounded, such as emphasizing that fulfillment steps like "Ship order" are illogical after "Cancel order."

**Strengths (Supporting High Score):**
- **Accuracy:** All violations are correctly pinpointed without false positives or misses. For Case 2, the reversal of "Package items" and "Authorize payment" is nailed. Case 3's dual issues (inappropriate authorization in cancel path + shipping post-cancellation) are handled with nuance. Case 5's missing "Package items" is explicitly tied to the required sequence.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Covers all cases systematically, explains *why* each is a violation (referencing text like "payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known"), and interprets constraints strictly (e.g., no fulfillment after cancel).
- **Clarity and Structure:** Tables and sections make it easy to follow; final list succinctly recaps without redundancy. No ambiguities in the answer itself.
- **Fidelity to Prompt:** Interprets the normative text faithfully, noting paths and constraints without inventing rules. Handles potential room for interpretation (e.g., in Case 3) by prioritizing prohibitions.

**Minor Deductions (Hypercritical Lens):**
- In Case 3, a slight hedging phrase ("Could conceivably allow a payment authorization attempt for investigation") introduces a minor unnecessary speculation, potentially softening the absolute prohibition in the normative text (which implies direct branching to "Cancel order" without intervening fulfillment steps). This isn't a logical flaw but dilutes strictness by a hair—resolving to a clear violation without qualifiers would be flawless.
- The answer assumes inventory outcomes based on sequence (e.g., presence of "Cancel order" implies insufficient inventory), which is a valid interpretation but could explicitly note that the log doesn't record inventory results, making the deviation inferential. This is a tiny unclarified assumption, not an error, but warrants a fractional dock under utmost strictness.

Overall, the response is nearly flawless—thorough, error-free in facts, and logically airtight. It merits a very high score, with only these negligible quibbles preventing perfection.
