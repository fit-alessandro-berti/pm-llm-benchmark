6.5

### Explanation of Grade
The answer correctly identifies the key normative violations in Case 2 (out-of-order activities and finalizing documentation after rejection) and appropriately notes no such issues in Case 1 (implicitly) or Case 3. It also accurately identifies the desiderata failures in Case 3 (delays and missing follow-up call) while clarifying their non-severe nature, and provides reasonable justifications for the deviations in Cases 2 and 3 without overstepping the constraints. The structure aligns well with the task, and the summary distinguishes normative from desiderata issues effectively.

However, under hypercritical evaluation, a significant flaw deducts points: The answer completely misses a major normative violation in Case 2—the complete skipping of "Inform Applicant," which is strictly required after every Loan Decision (regardless of approval/rejection) per the sequence and textual rules. This omission represents a failure to fully identify and explain all normative violations, introducing a logical gap in the analysis. Minor issues include imprecise wording in the desiderata section (e.g., describing the notification as occurring "48 hours after" when it exceeds that by ~3 hours, potentially misleading on exact timing) and lack of explicit confirmation that Case 1 has zero violations or desiderata failures (implied but not stated, reducing clarity). These prevent a higher score, as the response is strong but not nearly flawless.
