7.2

### Grading Rationale
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**: Section 1 accurately identifies the core anomalies, including the direct contradiction between NonCoexistence(E, C) and the intended process flow (E before C), as well as the logical impossibility created with RespondedExistence(E | A) when combined with required closure (C). The undermined logic (e.g., allowing closure without evaluation) and redundancy note are precise and aligned with the model's flaws. Section 2 provides relevant, example-like hypotheses that cover misinterpretation, policy changes, and technical issues without straying or fabricating. Section 3's purposes are well-targeted to the prompt's examples (e.g., closure without evaluation, coexistence of E and C, assignment-evaluation links), and queries B and C are logically sound and mostly correct in syntax/execution for their intents.
  
- **Weaknesses (Supporting Deduction)**: Section 3's query A is imprecise—it detects closures without E but ignores the conditional trigger of A from RespondedExistence, potentially flagging non-violations (e.g., unassigned claims), undermining its stated purpose. More critically, query D is fundamentally broken: the JOIN restricts `ce` to only 'A' activities, making the `CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E'` clause impossible to trigger (eval_count always 0), rendering the ratio calculation meaningless and the HAVING clause trivially true for all rows. This introduces a major logical flaw and inaccuracy in SQL implementation, directly contradicting the prompt's expectation for effective "SQL-based investigation strategies." No other sections have flaws, but this error alone prevents a "nearly flawless" score under hypercritical evaluation, warranting a significant penalty (e.g., docking ~2-3 points from a potential 9-10). Minor unclarities, like not enforcing timestamp order in query C's purpose (though implied), add slight deducts but are not primary issues. Overall, the response is strong analytically but compromised by executable errors in verification, balancing to a mid-high score.
