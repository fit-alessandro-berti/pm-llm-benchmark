### Evaluation Summary
This response is exemplary and meets every criterion of the prompt with precision and depth. It generates exactly 20 open-ended questions that are directly grounded in the described supply chain process, emphasizing insights (e.g., Q9 on ML forecasting), potential issues (e.g., Q12 on cybersecurity risks), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q3 on design-for-supply-chain), and decision implications (e.g., Q7 on hedging against volatility). Each question is thought-provoking, inviting analysis of trade-offs, risks, and optimizations without being prescriptive or closed-ended. Terminology is accurate and contextually appropriate (e.g., bullwhip effect, CPFR, scope 3 emissions), reflecting a nuanced understanding of multinational supply chain dynamics as outlined. There are no inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws—phrasing is concise, professional, and free of redundancy or extraneous content. The list format is clean, with no introductions, conclusions, or deviations (e.g., no SQL queries). This is a near-flawless execution, warranting the maximum score under strict scrutiny.
