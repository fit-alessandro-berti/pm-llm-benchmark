8.2

### Evaluation Rationale
This grade reflects a strong overall response that accurately identifies nearly all key elements of the task, with clear structure, explanations, and reasonable interpretations. However, under hypercritical scrutiny, several issues warrant deductions: (1) **Logical/structural inconsistency**: The missing "Inform Applicant" in Case 2—a clear normative violation per the rules (must occur after Loan Decision)—is not flagged in the initial Part 1 analysis or summary table for normative rules, only surfacing in Part 2 and the final summary. This creates a fragmented analysis, implying incomplete initial coverage of "hard" rules. (2) **Unpolished presentation**: Includes unedited internal musings (e.g., "but you're explicit that it exists in normative step? Wait —"), which introduce unclarity and reduce professionalism. (3) **Minor inaccuracies/unclarities**: In Part 2 Case 2, it vaguely labels desiderata issues as "Unclear timing issues" despite no actual timing violations there; the table is imprecise on this. Follow-up call is correctly treated as optional across cases, but not explicitly clarified as "encouraged but not strictly required" in every instance. (4) **Extraneous content**: The unrequested offer to "draw a compliance heatmap" deviates from the task, adding noise without value. (5) **Justifications**: Solid and aligned with constraints, but Case 2's explanation for missing Inform ("maybe they assumed the decision announcement was part of another step") is speculative without strong textual tie-in, bordering on unsubstantiated. No major factual errors (e.g., timings and sequences are correctly assessed), but these flaws prevent a "nearly flawless" score, docking ~1.8 points from a potential 10.0.
