### Evaluation Rationale
The final output produces a well-structured Markdown table that covers all required columns (Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor, Other Attributes) and includes events from all relevant tables for every order_id (e.g., order 1004 correctly omits absent delivery/invoice/payment events). Activity names are logically derived (e.g., separate "Item Picked" events per line item, distinct dispatch/arrival per delivery). Resources are appropriately mapped from the Resources table, and other attributes enrich events meaningfully (e.g., quantities, amounts, notes). Assumptions are documented, addressing multi-event handling and missing data.

However, under hypercritical scrutiny, the output has a significant logical flaw: events within case 1002 are not strictly sorted chronologically by timestamp, violating the prompt's requirement to "maintain chronological correctness" and ensure "sequence... reflects the real process flow." Specifically, the second "Order Dispatched" (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z) appears after the first "Order Arrived" (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z) in the table, despite its earlier timestamp—this misordering disrupts the process sequence and would invalidate process mining analysis. No other cases have this issue, but it affects one complete case with multiple deliveries, indicating incomplete adherence to sorting. Minor inconsistencies include using payment_method as "Resource/Actor" (better suited as an attribute) rather than leaving it blank, and not globally sorting the entire table by Case ID then Timestamp (though grouping by case is acceptable if internally ordered). These prevent a near-flawless score, resulting in deductions for inaccuracies and unclarities in core flow representation.
