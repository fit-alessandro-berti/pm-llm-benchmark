The provided answer is a precise, correct, and complete implementation of the required DuckDB SQL query. It accurately uses CTEs to compute ordered activity sequences per case via `STRING_AGG` with `ORDER BY timestamp`, groups and counts variants correctly, selects the top K via `ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT :K`, identifies relevant case_ids, and filters the original event log to return exactly the events from those cases. The parameterization of `:K` is appropriate for a variable K, and no logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist. The structure is efficient, readable, and fully aligns with all prompt requirements without extraneous elements.
