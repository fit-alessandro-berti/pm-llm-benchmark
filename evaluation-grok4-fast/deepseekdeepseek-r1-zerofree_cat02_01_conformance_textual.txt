9.5

### Explanation of Grade
The final conclusions correctly identify Cases 2, 3, and 5 as violations while clearing Cases 1 and 4, aligning precisely with the normative description's constraints (e.g., sequencing of Authorize Payment before Package Items, no Ship Order after Cancel, mandatory Package Items before Ship in the sufficient path, and Close as final). Explanations reference expected sequences and key rules (e.g., illogical Authorize before Cancel in Case 3, missing Package in Case 5), resolving ambiguities reasonably (e.g., interpreting Cancel as implying insufficient inventory, making prior Authorize a deviation). 

Minor deductions for slight imprecisions: In Case 3, the explanation implies but does not explicitly tie "Authorize payment" to the inventory outcome ambiguity (the description notes "room for interpretation" on payment before full confirmation, though the flow clearly branches post-Check); in Case 5, it omits explicitly stating that Ship without Package violates the "after packaging" constraint. These are hypercritically minor unclarity risks but do not undermine the core accuracy or logic. Overall, the response is highly accurate and structured.
