The provided answer fails to deliver the required query. The final SQL statement only returns aggregated counts per qualifying `case_id` (case_id and count), not the full set of events (including `activity` and `timestamp` for each individual event in those cases). This directly contradicts the task's explicit instruction to "return the full set of events for the remaining cases." The explanation reinforces this error by describing the output as `case_id` and count, and incorrectly claims it "returns only events" when it does not. No subquery, CTE, or join is used to filter and retrieve the complete rows, rendering the solution logically flawed and incomplete. Even minor issues warrant significant penalties; this is a core inaccuracy.
