10.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally thorough, accurate, and logically sound, warranting the maximum score under even the strictest scrutiny. It systematically analyzes each case with precise references to the normative description, correctly identifies all violations (Cases 2, 3, and 5) without false positives or omissions, and provides clear explanations that resolve any interpretive ambiguities (e.g., the illogic of authorizing payment before cancellation in Case 3, based on the "directly proceed" implication). The structure enhances clarity, with per-case tables, violation breakdowns, and a concise summary. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present—not even minor ones like unsubstantiated assumptions or overlooked constraints (e.g., it properly flags the missing "Package items" in Case 5 and the forbidden "Ship" after "Cancel" in Case 3). The recommendations are relevant but do not overstep the task. This response is nearly flawless in completeness, fidelity to the prompt, and analytical rigor.
