The provided code is a nearly flawless representation of the described POWL model. It accurately constructs all required transitions with matching labels (including the abbreviated "D&R" for consistency with the scenario's notation), correctly implements the loop operator with BNC as the main body and D&R as the optional redo (aligning precisely with the POWL loop semantics: execute A, then exit or B then repeat A), and uses XOR for the exclusive choice between CD and MD without unnecessary silents. The root StrictPartialOrder includes all nodes, and the order edges faithfully capture the dependencies: SR  CS; CS  {DA, ACI} (enabling concurrency); {DA, ACI}  config_loop; config_loop  deploy_xor; deploy_xor  {QA, SA} (enabling concurrency); {QA, SA}  GLA. No extraneous edges, no missing prerequisites, no logical flaws in concurrency or sequencing, and no deviations from the scenario's structure. The code is clean, commented appropriately, and uses the specified imports and classes without errors.
