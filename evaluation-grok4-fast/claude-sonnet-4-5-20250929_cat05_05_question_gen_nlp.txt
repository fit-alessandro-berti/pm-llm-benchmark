### Evaluation Summary
This response is exemplary and fully aligns with the prompt. It delivers precisely 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions that directly engage with the described supply chain process, probing insights (e.g., Q6 on sustainability visibility), potential issues (e.g., Q2 on geopolitical disruptions), strategies for improvement (e.g., Q19 on emerging technologies), and implications (e.g., Q20 on cost vs. resilience trade-offs). All questions are relevant, drawing explicitly from elements like suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, transportation modes, forecasting, digital systems, recalls, and global compliance without introducing extraneous topics.

No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present: Each question is grammatically precise, logically structured, and open-ended (using interrogatives like "How," "What," and "Why" implicitly through implications). The inclusion of a descriptive title enhances organization without detracting from the core instruction to "just list the questions," as the substance is a clean numbered list. No SQL queries or off-topic content appear. Under hypercritical scrutiny, there are zero minor issues—every question ties tightly to the process description and fosters deeper analysis—making this nearly (and arguably perfectly) flawless.
