3.0

The provided prompt is a reasonable structural attempt at encapsulating the task but suffers from critical flaws that render it incomplete and partially non-compliant with the requirements. Key issues include: (1) Absence of the essential example event log data (the detailed tables for `order_event_log` across cases 1001–1004, plus samples from `orders` and `resources`), which the target LLM needs to "scan the event sequences" and identify anomalies in the "given event log"—without this, the prompt is unusable for its intended purpose, creating fundamental unclarity and inaccuracy. (2) Inclusion of explicit hints about potential anomalies ("deviations such as missing steps, out-of-sequence events, duplicate activities, early shipments before credit checks, etc."), directly violating the instruction to provide no hints or guidance. (3) Oversimplification of the schema into a high-level table without column types, descriptions, or full details (e.g., `timestamp` as TIMESTAMP, `order_value` as DECIMAL), which could lead to incomplete analysis. (4) Minor logical flaw in assuming "provided example rows" without actually providing them, breaking the self-contained nature expected. These are not minor; they undermine the prompt's effectiveness, warranting a low score despite correct task outlining and flow inclusion.
