The provided SQL query is nearly flawless and directly addresses the prompt's requirements with precision, efficiency, and correctness. It uses window functions (ROW_NUMBER and LEAD) to enforce deterministic ordering by timestamp (with activity as a tiebreaker, ensuring reliability even if timestamps duplicate, though the prompt implies datetimes are precise). The LEAD checks for exact adjacency of the three activities in sequence, confirming direct succession with no intervening events. The time difference calculation `(next2_ts - next_ts) > INTERVAL '5 days'` accurately targets the elapsed time between the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in matching triples, using DuckDB-compatible syntax for interval comparison. The DISTINCT collection of case_ids ensures no redundancy, and the final anti-join via NOT IN correctly excludes all events from qualifying "bad" cases (those with at least one such delayed sequence) while returning all others, properly ordered by case_id and timestamp for clarity (aligning with the prompt's call for proper ordering). No logical flaws, inaccuracies, or unclarities exist; edge cases like multiple sequences per case or non-consecutive matches are handled implicitly and correctly. This implementation is optimal and exceeds basic requirements without unnecessary complexity.
