### Evaluation Rationale
The provided answer addresses the task's three components with a clear, structured format that mirrors the query's requirements. It correctly identifies Case 2 as the sole normative violator, with accurate explanations for two key issues (out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and impermissible Finalization after rejection). Case 1 is implicitly compliant (not mentioned, which is appropriate), and Case 3 is correctly excluded from normative violations. For desiderata, it precisely pinpoints Case 3's failures (delays and skipped Follow-up Call), treating them as suboptimal without overemphasizing severity, though it could have more explicitly stated "these are not severe but represent suboptimal behavior" as per the task (minor unclarity, not a major flaw). Justifications are reasonable, neutral, and aligned with the constraints, offering interpretations like "error or misunderstanding" without speculating beyond the log.

However, deductions are warranted for incompleteness and logical gaps under hypercritical scrutiny:
- **Major inaccuracy in normative analysis**: The answer misses a clear violation in Case 2—skipping "Inform Applicant" entirely after Loan Decision, which is a required step in the sequence (Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  ...). The log shows no such activity before Finalize Documentation and Close Case, constituting a skip that contradicts the strict rules. This omission means the explanation of violations is not exhaustive, undermining the task's call to "explain the reasons" fully.
- **Minor issues**: Desiderata section assumes no Follow-up Call failure for Cases 1 and 2 (the log doesn't explicitly note it except for Case 3, so this is defensible, but the desiderata apply universally as "encouraged" for all cases; the answer doesn't clarify this). Timing approximations ("two days") are slightly vague but align with the log (e.g., ~49 hours for Credit Check in Case 3 exceeds 24 hours). No mention of Case 1's desiderata compliance (e.g., it meets timing but potentially skips Follow-up), leaving a small gap in comprehensiveness.
- **Strengths mitigating score**: The response is concise, logical, and free of contradictions or inventions. It avoids penalizing Case 3's desiderata as "serious" and provides balanced justifications. If the missed violation were addressed, this would be near-flawless (9.0+).

Overall, the answer is strong in organization and most content but flawed by incomplete violation identification, justifying a mid-high score rather than excellence.
