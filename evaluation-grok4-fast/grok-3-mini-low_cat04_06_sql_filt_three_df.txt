The provided SQL query is logically correct, efficient, and fully satisfies the prompt's requirements without inaccuracies, unclarities, or flaws. It accurately detects the required consecutive sequence using window functions, applies the precise time filter on the relevant pair of events, identifies the cases to exclude based on the existence of at least one qualifying sequence, and returns all events from the remaining cases. The use of CTEs is clear and appropriate for DuckDB, the interval comparison works as expected, and the optional but sensible ordering ensures a well-structured result set. No penalties apply.
