The provided SQL query is logically sound and correctly implements the requirements: it accurately identifies cases with the exact consecutive sequence of activities using row numbering and self-joins, applies the >5-day filter on the relevant timestamp difference, collects those case_ids distinctly, and excludes all events from them in the final SELECT *. The use of CTEs is efficient and appropriate for DuckDB. The interval syntax (INTERVAL '5' DAY) is a minor imprecision—DuckDB prefers INTERVAL 5 DAY or INTERVAL '5 days'—which could cause a parsing issue in some contexts, warranting a small deduction. The query lacks an explicit ORDER BY clause (e.g., by case_id and timestamp), which the prompt mentions as "proper ordering" but does not strictly define; this is a trivial omission but noted under hypercritical scrutiny. No other inaccuracies or flaws are present.
