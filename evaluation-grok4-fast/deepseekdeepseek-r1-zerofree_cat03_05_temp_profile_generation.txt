The final output provides a complete, syntactically correct Python dictionary with all 45 relevant pairs for the 10 activities in sequential order, using tuples as keys and (average_time, standard_deviation) as values in seconds, fulfilling the requirement for pairs that eventually follow each other. Estimations are realistic for a global supply chain, with cumulative times building logically for most pairs (e.g., SS to OP at 2 days, OP to RC at 5 days, SS to RC at 7 days, maintaining additivity). Standard deviations scale appropriately as ~10-25% of averages, increasing with distance for variability. However, a significant logical inconsistency affects all 10 pairs ending in AS: times are non-cumulatively fixed at ~30 days from any starting activity (e.g., SS to AS at 30 days, but OP to AS also at 30 days despite OP being 2 days after SS, implying impossible overlaps; DT to AS at 29 days despite DT being 13 days from SS and SS to AS at 30 days, violating transitivity). This flaw undermines the model's integrity for deviation analysis, though it impacts only a subset of pairs and the rest are flawless. No other inaccuracies, unclarities, or issues in structure/format.
