The provided code accurately and completely constructs the POWL model as described in the scenario. All activity transitions use correct labels matching the process steps (e.g., "SR", "CS", "DA", etc., with "D&R" appropriately abbreviating the described activity). The loop node uses `Operator.LOOP` with children `[BNC, D_R]`, faithfully representing the repeated BNC followed by optional D&R until exit. The exclusive choice uses `Operator.XOR` with children `[CD, MD]`, correctly modeling the mutually exclusive deployment options. The root `StrictPartialOrder` includes all necessary nodes (individual transitions and operator nodes) without unnecessary nesting, which aligns with the POWL definitions and the provided example. The order edges precisely enforce the described dependencies: SR precedes CS; CS precedes concurrent DA and ACI (no edge between DA and ACI); both DA and ACI precede the loop; loop precedes XOR; XOR precedes concurrent QA and SA (no edge between QA and SA); both QA and SA precede GLA. No extraneous edges, silent transitions, or structural issues are present. The code is syntactically correct, uses the required imports, and requires no modifications to fully represent the scenario.
