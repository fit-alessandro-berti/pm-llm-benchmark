### Evaluation Rationale
This answer is exceptionally strong overall, demonstrating a clear understanding of the task, accurate SQL syntax compatible with DuckDB, and effective problem-solving. The main query correctly uses a subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING to identify qualifying case_ids, then joins back to retrieve the full events (via e.*), preserving the original schema without alterations. The explanation is precise, well-structured, and directly addresses the grouping/filtering requirements. No logical flaws in the core logic; it handles the per-case event counting and exclusion properly, assuming standard SQL behavior in DuckDB (e.g., no issues with aggregation or joins).

However, deducting 0.5 points for a minor but notable inaccuracy in one alternative: The window function approach adds an extraneous `event_count` column to the output (via SELECT * on the subquery that includes it), which technically deviates from returning "the full set of events" without modifications to the schema. While this doesn't break the filtering and is a common/valid pattern, it's not perfectly aligned with the task's implication of unaltered event rows—hypercritically, this introduces unnecessary output bloat. The other alternative (WHERE IN) and main query avoid this entirely. Providing extras like alternatives and explanations is helpful but not deductable, as they don't detract from the core response. If the window query had excluded the extra column (e.g., via explicit column selection), it would be flawless.
