The provided SQL query correctly addresses all requirements of the prompt. It accurately computes ordered activity sequences per case using STRING_AGG with explicit ORDER BY timestamp in the `case_variants` CTE, ensuring timestamp-based ordering. It groups cases by these exact sequences in the `counted_variants` CTE to identify and count unique variants by frequency (case count). The `top_k_variants` CTE properly selects the top K variants by descending count using LIMIT K, treating K as a parameterizable value. The final SELECT retrieves all original events (via e.*) from the `event_log` table, filtered exclusively to cases whose variants match the top K through precise INNER JOINs on case_id and variant, thereby excluding non-matching cases as required. The structure is efficient, leverages CTEs for clarity and reusability, and is fully compatible with DuckDB syntax, including ordered aggregations. No inaccuracies, unclarities, or logical flaws are present; the solution is complete and precise.
