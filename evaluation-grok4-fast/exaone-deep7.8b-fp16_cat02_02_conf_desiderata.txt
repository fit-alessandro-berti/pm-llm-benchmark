3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The answer demonstrates a reasonable structure and correctly identifies some normative violations in Case 2 (credit check ordering and finalization after rejection), along with accurate desiderata issues in Case 3 (timing delays and no follow-up). The justifications in Part 3 are plausible for non-strict issues and appropriately note that strict violations cannot be excused. The summary table is clear and mostly aligns with the log.

However, the answer contains critical inaccuracies and omissions that warrant a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Major Normative Violation Missed in Case 2**: The log for Case 2 completely skips "Inform Applicant" after the Loan Decision (Rejected), proceeding directly to Finalize Documentation and Close Case. This violates the core sequence ("Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome"; "Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision"; prohibition on skipping steps). It also contradicts the rejection path (should inform then close without finalization). The answer fails to identify this, listing only two violations instead of three, which is a significant logical flaw and inaccuracy. This alone severely undermines the analysis of normative rules.

- **Unclear Handling of Desiderata in Case 2**: The answer assumes a "No Follow-Up Call" for Case 2 based on no log entry, but the event log explicitly notes "* (No Follow-up Call)*" only for Case 3, creating ambiguity. More critically, since "Inform Applicant" is skipped (a strict issue), any potential desiderata around its timing is moot, yet this is not addressed.

- **Failure to Explicitly Clarify Desiderata Severity**: Task 2 requires clarifying that desiderata deviations "are not severe" but represent "suboptimal behavior." The answer labels them "Non-Strict" and implies this in the summary, but does not directly state or elaborate as instructed, resulting in unclarity.

- **Minor Omissions and Incompletenesses**: Case 1's full compliance (no violations) is never explicitly stated, leaving the analysis incomplete. Justifications in Part 3 do not cover Case 2's desiderata (follow-up) or the missed "Inform Applicant" skip. Timestamps are handled correctly, but the overall response lacks comprehensiveness for all cases.

These issues—especially the overlooked strict violation—indicate flawed reasoning and incomplete coverage, preventing a higher score. A nearly flawless answer would identify all violations without omission and follow task wording precisely.
