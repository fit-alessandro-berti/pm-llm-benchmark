**9.0**

The provided query is highly accurate and fulfills the task requirements effectively with the following reasoning:

### Strengths:
1. **Correct Use of Common Table Expression (CTE):**
   - The `case_event_count` CTE is well-designed, grouping `event_log` by `case_id` and counting the number of events per case correctly.

2. **Appropriate Filtering:**
   - The `WHERE cec.event_count <= 6` condition in the main query ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are included.

3. **Result Set Inclusion:**
   - The query returns all columns from the `event_log` table for the filtered cases using `SELECT el.*`, as specified in the task.

4. **Join Logic:**
   - The use of a join between `event_log` and `case_event_count` is clear and appropriate, ensuring that all events from qualifying cases are included.

### Minor Issue:
- **Clarity of Explanation:**
  - While the explanation is clear, it could have explicitly acknowledged potential implications of using `COUNT(*)`. For instance, if there are duplicate rows in the `event_log` table, `COUNT(*)` would include these, which might (depending on business context) lead to unintentionally inflated counts. Discussing this possibility or suggesting de-duplication (if necessary) would have added more robustness.

### Conclusion:
Despite the small omission in not addressing potential data issues, the query itself is nearly flawless in logic and fulfills all requirements from the prompt efficiently. The minor criticism lies in the explanatory notes, which could have been marginally more meticulous. Thus, the score is **9.0**.
