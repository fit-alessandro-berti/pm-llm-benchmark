7.5

The answer provides a comprehensive and relevant list of questions, with clear rationales and appropriate confidence scores. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the process and identifies key areas for analysis. However, the grading could be improved by offering deeper critical insights into the data constraints and potential ambiguities. For example, some questions assume data relationships (e.g., "MISSING" rejection reasons) that might not be resolvable without additional information. A slightly stronger emphasis on actionable insights and a focus on reducing redundancy across questions would elevate the response further. Overall, it is a strong effort but leaves room for refinement.
