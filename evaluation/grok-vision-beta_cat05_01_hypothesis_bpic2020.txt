8.0

The proposed questions are relevant, well-structured, and generally align with the data provided. The confidence scores add an additional layer of value, indicating how well each question can be addressed based on the given information. However, some scores and interpretations are slightly optimistic where the data might not explicitly support analysis (e.g., specific reasons for rejection or correlation analysis). Additionally, a few questions could benefit from more detail or refinement to ensure they align more closely with the specific data structure and implications. Overall, the response is solid but leaves some room for improvement in precision and depth.
