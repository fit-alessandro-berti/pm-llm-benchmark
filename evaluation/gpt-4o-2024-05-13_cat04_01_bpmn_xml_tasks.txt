The answer adequately lists the tasks present in the BPMN diagram by their name and corresponding `id` attributes, which is a clear and correct representation. However, there are areas for improvement:

### Positives:
- The tasks are correctly identified and listed.
- The names and IDs of the tasks are presented as required.

### Areas for improvement:
1. While functional, the task selection misses details like visually formatted bullet points, section headers, or a summary.
2. The answer does not mention that tasks in BPMN are typically actions representing a process outcome. Including this context would enhance understanding.
3. Some clarification on how these tasks interact or where they appear in the process flow could add value.
   
Additional explanation of diverging and converging gateways or event handling in relation to the tasks could have provided a more complete answer.
