1.0

The response provided is overwhelmingly verbose and repetitive, with a failure to deliver a coherent, correct answer. The flow of thought demonstrates significant confusion regarding Petri net basics, such as token handling, conditional transitions, and the mechanics of looping. The presented Python code is fragmented and includes incorrect or unfeasible aspects, such as erroneous transitions like `('II', 'FC', 'II')`. Moreover, no final concise and functional implementation of the Petri net is delivered.

Key issues with the answer:
1. **Incompleteness:** A clear and functional implementation of the Petri net is absent. Essential features such as loops (e.g., RDS and II), initial/final markings, and transition definitions are poorly executed.
2. **Repetition:** The response repeats incorrect ideas multiple times without providing corrections or clarifications.
3. **Incorrect Reasoning:** Misunderstanding foundational Petri net principles, such as token distribution and place-to-place connections.
4. **Code Errors:** The provided code lacks functional logic, correct imports, and proper syntax for `pm4py`. The transitions are incorrectly defined, and no working solution is offered.
5. **Absence of Clarity:** The explanation fails to present a coherent logic for creating the Petri net structure, and the response leaves the reader more confused.

Ultimately, the response fails to meet even the minimal requirements of the task. With the lack of a final product and numerous errors, a grade of **1.0** is warranted.
