### Score: **9.5**

#### Explanation:

The query is extremely well-crafted, concise, and almost flawless in its logic. It meets the requirements as outlined in the prompt and uses a two-step approach to achieve the desired result:

1. **Step 1 - Compute Event Counts per Case (`event_counts` CTE):**
   - The query groups by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case, storing this aggregate as `event_count`.

2. **Step 2 - Filter Cases and Retrieve Events (`SELECT` query):**
   - The original `event_log` table is joined with the `event_counts` CTE on `case_id`.
   - A filtering condition ensures that only cases with `event_count` <= 6 are retained. The query then retrieves all events (`el.*`) for the filtered cases.

### Strengths:
- **Correctness:** The query accurately implements the requirements. It identifies `case_id`s with `COUNT(*) <= 6` and ensures only events related to these cases are included in the final result.
- **Readability:** The use of a `WITH` clause (Common Table Expression) to calculate `event_counts` improves readability and makes the logic easy to follow.
- **Efficiency:** The structure is efficient given the nature of the task—filtering based on an aggregate and then joining back to the original table is a standard and performant approach.
- **Clarity:** The use of descriptive aliases (`el` for `event_log` and `ec` for `event_counts`) enhances readability and avoids ambiguity.

### Minor Issues:
1. **Edge Case Consideration:**
   - The query assumes there will always be a `case_id` present in all rows of `event_log`. If there are any rows with null `case_id`, these may unintentionally propagate through the query. To make the query robust, it could explicitly exclude or handle `NULL` case IDs. For example:
     ```sql
     WHERE ec.event_count <= 6 AND el.case_id IS NOT NULL
     ```

2. **Commenting:** 
   - Adding brief comments can make the query even clearer for others reviewing or maintaining the code. While not strictly necessary, it would be a good practice for production-quality code.

#### Justification for Deduction:
These issues are minor and do not affect the core correctness of the solution, so the deduction is limited to 0.5 points.

### Final Assessment:
While strict grading requires acknowledging even small potential improvements, this query is well-written, logical, and efficient. It very nearly earns a perfect 10, but the lack of explicit handling for edge cases and the absence of comments for clarity result in a slight reduction.
