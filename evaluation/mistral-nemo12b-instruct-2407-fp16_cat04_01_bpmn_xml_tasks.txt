**9.5**

This is an excellent answer that correctly lists the tasks in the process model based on the provided BPMN 2.0 XML. However, there's a minor inconsistency in the 6th task, where the task name should be "**pay compensation**," but the XML ID should be "**idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e**," rather than "**iddd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e**."

Other than that, everything else is well-formatted, accurate, and clear.
