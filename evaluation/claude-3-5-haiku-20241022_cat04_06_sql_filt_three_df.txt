**3.0**

### Evaluation:

#### Strengths:
1. **Overall Structure**: The solution outlines a clear approach to addressing the prompt: using `WITH` (CTE) to identify cases with the offending sequence and applying a filter in the final `SELECT`.
2. **Sequence Detection**: The use of multiple self-joins (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`) correctly targets sequences and aligns with the problem requirements in terms of finding the exact order of activities.
3. **Conceptual Steps**: The inclusion of `NOT EXISTS` subqueries suggests that the author is aware of the need to exclude intervening events in the sequence.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Bug in `TIMESTAMP_DIFF` Syntax**: 
   - DuckDB does **not** have a `TIMESTAMP_DIFF` function. DuckDB uses the SQL standard `DATEDIFF` function (e.g., `DATEDIFF('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp)`) for date difference calculations. This is a **critical flaw** because it means the query as written is non-functional.

2. **Incorrect Behavior for Intermediate Events**:
   - The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are meant to ensure that no events in the same case occur between `Approve Purchase Requisition` and `Create Order`, or between `Create Order` and `Confirm Order`. However, they only check other **timestamps** in isolation, and not the intervening **activities** specifically. This would allow unrelated activities with the same timestamps as `e1`, `e2`, or `e3` to bypass the check.

3. **Ambiguity in Filtering Criteria**:
   - The prompt asks to identify cases *only* if the sequence occurs **in direct succession**. However, the use of `AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp` without ensuring proximity allows matching events even if separated widely in time, which violates the definition of direct succession.

4. **Neglect of Timestamp Sorting**:
   - There is no explicit `ORDER BY` clause to ensure events are processed in chronological order for each case. This can result in incorrect matches if the events are not preordered.

5. **Performance Concerns**:
   - The query uses multiple self-joins and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries, leading to potential inefficiency for large `event_log` tables. The prompt does not demand maximum efficiency, but the computational cost could be reduced with improved logic or window functions.

6. **Prompt Misinterpretation**:
   - The prompt stresses the need to exclude cases **only if both the sequence and timing condition are satisfied**. The query does not clearly distinguish cases meeting **both conditions** from cases meeting just one condition, risking incorrect exclusions.

#### Suggested Corrections:
1. Replace `TIMESTAMP_DIFF('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp)` with `DATEDIFF('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp)`.
2. Amend the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries to verify not just the presence of timestamps in between, but also unrelated activities using a condition like `e4.activity NOT IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')`.
3. Add stricter logic to enforce direct succession by ensuring no significant time gap between `e1`, `e2`, and `e3`.
4. Use window functions or row numbering to reduce the complexity and improve performance.

#### Conclusion:
This attempt is a moderately good conceptual draft with some valid ideas and partial implementation of the required logic. Nonetheless, several critical execution flaws and discrepancies in fulfilling the prompt's requirements severely hamper its correctness and reliability. As such, I award a **3.0**.
