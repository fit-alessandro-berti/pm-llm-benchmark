**9.0**

This answer is almost perfect. It correctly lists the tasks from the BPMN 2.0 XML with their unique IDs. However, there are only minor issues:

1. The formatting of the answer could be improved by including a clearer indication that the BPMN task IDs are shown for reference, but are secondary to the task names.
2. The inclusion of task IDs is helpful, but not necessarily required unless specifically asked. 

Other than these points, the tasks themselves have been identified accurately, so the content is correct. Hence, I would rate the answer a 9.0.
