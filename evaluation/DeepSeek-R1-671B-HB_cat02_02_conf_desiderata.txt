**Grade: 9.0**

The analysis provided is detailed and well-structured, identifying normative rule violations and desiderata failures accurately for each case. The following aspects contribute to the high score:

1. **Accurate Identification of Normative Violations**: 
   - The answer correctly flags the normative rule violations for Case 2, including the "Risk Assessment before Credit Check" issue and "Finalize Documentation after Rejection" violation. 
   - No false positives are identified for normative violations in the other cases.

2. **Thorough Analysis of Desiderata Deviations**: 
   - The desiderata failures are outlined for each case with detailed reasoning and clear references to the event log timestamps. For example, the late Credit Check and delayed applicant notification in Case 3 are highlighted, as well as the missing Follow-up Call across all cases.

3. **Justifications and Interpretations**: 
   - The potential reasons for suboptimal behavior are well-reasoned, such as possible clerical errors for Case 2's documentation issue and operational workload constraints for delays in Case 3. This adds significant value to the assessment.

4. **Clear Summary**: 
   - The concise summary at the end ties together the findings, effectively differentiating between normative violations (critical compliance issues) and desiderata failures (areas for improvement).

**Reasons for Deduction**:
1. **Verbosity and Repetitiveness**: The answer is overly lengthy, with some repetition in analyzing the timing of events (especially for Case 2's Credit Check). While this doesn't impact the final conclusions, it adds unnecessary complexity.
2. **Minor Unclarities**: There is a slight overemphasis on the possibility that Follow-up Calls may have occurred but were not recorded for Cases 1 and 2. This analysis is speculative and could have been omitted for clarity.
3. **Missed Opportunity to Discuss Follow-up Call as a General Issue**: The absence of Follow-up Calls in all cases could have been framed as a broader systemic issue, rather than analyzing it case by case redundantly.

Overall, the answer is strong with minor room for improvement in conciseness and clarity, justifying a high but not perfect score.
