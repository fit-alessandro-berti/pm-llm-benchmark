1.0

**Explanation**: The provided response is completely incorrect for the given task. The question asks for generating a DECLARE model for a process that involves specific declarative constraints related to process mining in `pm4py`. Instead, the response provides a MySQL function that is entirely irrelevant to the task. It does not address process variants, constraints, or anything related to DECLARE models. Furthermore, there are no references to process mining concepts such as existence, response, succession, or the like.

This warrants the lowest possible score due to its complete misalignment with the question.
