**9.0**

This is an excellent answer with a high level of accuracy in the SQL query design and detailed explanation. However, strict grading dictates pointing out even minor potential improvements or considerations:

### Positives:
1. **Correct Query Syntax**: The SQL query accurately implements the requirements of filtering out cases with more than 6 events.
   - The use of a `WITH` clause (CTE) to calculate the event count per `case_id` is clear and appropriate.
   - The `HAVING` clause correctly identifies cases with 6 or fewer events.
   - The subsequent `INNER JOIN` retrieves only the events for those filtered cases.
2. **Logical Structure**:
   - The explanation of each query component is logically sound and provides step-by-step clarity.
   - The explanation is helpful for both experienced developers and those newer to SQL, catering to a broad audience.
3. **Query Completeness**:
   - The query is comprehensive and addresses both the filtering and the final result requirements.
   - Optional ordering (`ORDER BY`) is mentioned, showing forethought for practical data usability.

### Minor Issues:
1. **Redundant Filtering Syntax**:
   - Within the CTE, both `COUNT(*) AS event_count` and `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` are used. While the query works as is, best practice could suggest omitting the `event_count` column entirely in this specific use case since it is not directly referenced in the main query. The `HAVING` clause could independently perform the filtering.
2. **Explanation Clarity**:
   - The explanation implies that `event_count` is necessary for filtering, which isn't strictly true because the filtering is achieved directly by `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`. Though this doesn't affect functionality, it might slightly confuse beginners.
3. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - The query does not explicitly state how it handles cases with no events (`case_id` with 0 events). While the problem suggests there are events for all `case_id`, clarifying this explicitly would improve robustness.
4. **Readability of Column Aliases**:
   - Using short aliases like `cec` and `el` can decrease immediate readability. More descriptive aliases like `filtered_cases` instead of `cec` might improve clarity.

### Summary:
These issues are relatively minor and do not detract significantly from the correctness and functionality of the query. The structure and logic are sound, and the explanation is thorough. However, adherence to the evaluation's strictness criterion brings the score slightly below a perfect mark due to these minor considerations.

### Final Grade: **9.0/10**
