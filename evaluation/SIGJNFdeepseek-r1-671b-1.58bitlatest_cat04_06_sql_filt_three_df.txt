**5.0**

The solution demonstrates a decent understanding of the problem and attempts to tackle it logically. However, there are significant issues and ambiguities that lower the score:

### Strengths:
1. The use of `LEAD` and window functions to identify consecutive activities is conceptually correct and well-aligned with the problem requirements, particularly for checking sequences.
2. The `DATEDIFF` function is used appropriately for calculating the time difference between events.
3. The overall structure of the query, including the CTE for excluded cases, and the main `SELECT` statement to exclude specific cases, is logical and intuitive.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Missing validation for intermediate events**:
   - The solution does not guarantee that there are no intermediate events between 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order'. While using `LEAD` ensures consecutive rows in the ordered result set, the dataset might include timestamps that make these activities appear consecutively in the results even if there are other activities from the same case in between. This is a critical flaw in logic.

2. **Assumption of non-null timestamps**:
   - The query assumes all timestamps are non-null. If there are null values, the logic could fail or produce incorrect results. Better handling for null timestamps would have improved robustness.

3. **Ambiguity in `DATEDIFF` usage**:
   - While the reasoning mentions DuckDB's `DATEDIFF` function, it does not verify how this function behaves with datetime columns (e.g., does it ensure compatibility with DuckDB?). There is no explicit clarification about whether the `DATEDIFF` operation needs additional transformation (e.g., converting timestamps to dates).

4. **Lack of edge case considerations**:
   - No mention of handling cases where activity sequences (even if fragmentary) span multiple timestamps or are repeated within a case (`case_id`).
   - No clarification about the inclusion/exclusion logic when partial sequences exist that do not meet the timing condition.

5. **Query readability and logic clarity**:
   - Certain parts of the query could be more explicit or better annotated, such as how timestamps are handled or how edge cases are filtered.
   - The query relies heavily on the assumption that sequences will always be properly aligned based on partitioned timestamps, without explicitly validating this.

### Summary:
While this solution has a solid structure and passes an initial correctness check (for many cases), it fails to account for critical edge cases and logical details that would ensure comprehensive correctness. It would require additional attention to detail, validations for intermediate activities, and robustness improvements to earn a higher score.
