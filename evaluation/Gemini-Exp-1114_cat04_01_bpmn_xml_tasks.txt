9.0

The answer is mostly correct, as it accurately lists the tasks found in the given BPMN 2.0 XML. However, there is one minor omission that prevents it from receiving a perfect score: it does not include the task `"reject request"` (id: `idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7`). 

For a perfect score, attention should have been given to not miss any of the tasks present in the XML.

Overall, this is a strong response that could be improved very slightly by ensuring all tasks are captured fully.
