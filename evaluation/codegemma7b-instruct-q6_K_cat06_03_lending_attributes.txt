**3.0**

This answer is incomplete and misses the point of identifying potentially sensitive attributes. There are several attributes listed in the problem that are relevant for fairness considerations, such as:

1. **case:citizen** – whether the person is a citizen or not could lead to discriminatory practices.
2. **case:gender** – gender is a well-known sensitive attribute that needs to be considered for fairness.
3. **case:german speaking** – language proficiency or whether a citizen speaks German may also result in bias.

These attributes could create biases in the loan approval process.

The answer should at least acknowledge the existence of these attributes and discuss why they might be sensitive in terms of fairness (e.g., possible discrimination in lending decisions). Therefore, the answer falls short of expectations.
