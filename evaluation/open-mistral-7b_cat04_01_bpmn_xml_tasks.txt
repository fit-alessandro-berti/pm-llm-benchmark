**9.0** 

This answer is almost perfect, providing a clear and complete list of the tasks included in the BPMN 2.0 XML. Each task name is correctly matched with its ID in the process model, making it easy to verify and understand. The only reason for deducting 1 point is that it missed one task – "pay compensation (id='d3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e')" – from the process model, which should have been listed.

Overall, the response is well-structured and substantially correct except for the omission of this task.
