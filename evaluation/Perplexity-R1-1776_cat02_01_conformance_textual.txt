**9.0**

The answer is highly detailed and correctly identifies the violations for Cases 2, 3, and 5 based on the normative process described. It interprets the rules thoroughly, resolves ambiguities where necessary, and organizes the reasoning logically. The explanations for each violation are precise, referencing the relevant rules from the normative description.

### Strengths:
1. **Correct Identification of Violations:** The cases that deviate from the normative process (Cases 2, 3, and 5) are accurately identified, and the reasoning behind these violations is clearly articulated.
2. **Structured Explanation:** The answer is well-organized, with violations explained case by case, making it easy to follow.
3. **Rule Compliance:** The rules outlined in the normative description are adhered to strictly, and all deviations are judged accurately.
4. **Ambiguity Handling:** It correctly addresses ambiguities in Case 3 by noting inconsistencies between payment authorization, cancellation, and subsequent events.

### Minor Issues:
1. **Repetition in Case 3 Explanation:** The explanation for Case 3's contradictions could have been slightly more concise, avoiding excessive focus on the ambiguity when a clearer rule violation is evident (shipping after cancellation).
2. **Ambiguity Interpretation:** While the handling of ambiguity is strong, there could have been a bit more discussion on whether ambiguous scenarios (like cancellation after authorization) might occur in exceptional cases, though this is not critical given the adherence to clear rules.

### Justification for Not a Perfect 10:
- The minor repetition and slightly verbose handling of ambiguities in Case 3 slightly detract from the precision expected in a perfect answer.
- While the reasoning is nearly flawless, harsher evaluation criteria call for absolute clarity, conciseness, and consideration of edge scenarios.

### Overall:
The answer is excellent and almost flawless, deserving a **9.0** for its accuracy, depth, and clarity while addressing rule violations.
