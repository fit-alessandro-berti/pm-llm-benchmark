**9.0**

The answer is very accurate, correctly listing all the tasks in the provided BPMN 2.0 XML. However, it missed specifying that there are exactly *8 tasks*, while a more precise explanation could have been given—such as referencing explicitly the BPMN `task` elements. Additionally, tasks could have been mentioned in the sequence they appear in the model source for clarity.

With minor improvements (like briefly explaining the reasoning behind the extraction), it could have reached complete accuracy and clarity deserving of a 10.0 score.
