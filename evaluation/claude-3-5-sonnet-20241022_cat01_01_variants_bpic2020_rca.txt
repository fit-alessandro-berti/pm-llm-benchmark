**8.0**

The answer provides a clear and data-driven analysis of the process-specific performance issues, including the role of rejections, submission retries, multiple levels of approvals, and "REJECTED by MISSING" status in causing delays. Here's how the reasoning is structured effectively:

1. **Identification of bottle-necks based on rejections** (e.g., administration rejection causing high delays) is spot on.
2. **Evaluation of approval chains** and their added complexity (particularly with the Budget Owner) is well observed.
3. **Submission cycles’ impact** on performance is thoroughly highlighted.
4. **Analysis of the unclear/redundant status** ("Rejected by Missing") contributes to the discussion of root causes.

### Areas for improvement:
- While it identifies key performance issues logically, the answer could expand on **specific quantitative comparisons** (e.g., estimating how much each element such as rejections, backlog, or specific actors contribute to overall processing time).
- It could also offer **specific recommendations or insights** for targeted process improvement in these bottlenecks rather than diagnosing issues alone.

Nevertheless, the response illustrates a well-reasoned, process-specific approach based on the data provided, making it solid yet with room for additional detail in terms of recommendations.
