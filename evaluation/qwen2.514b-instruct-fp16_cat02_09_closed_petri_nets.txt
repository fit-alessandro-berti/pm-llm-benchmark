6 out of 10.

### Evaluation Breakdown:

1. **Source Place**
   - **Opposite Concept:** Sink Place is correct and commonly used.
   - **General Concept:** General Place is vague here. More appropriately, this could be categorized as **Place** (without restriction), describing any general node that holds tokens in Petri nets. 
   - **Clarity:** Acceptable but could be clearer.
   
2. **Immediate Transition**
   - **Opposite Concept:** Timed Transition is correct.
   - **General Concept:** *Marking Transition* is not a commonly recognized term in Petri net literature. A more general term here would simply be **Transition**, capturing both immediate and timed transitions. The explanation is a bit confusing.
   - **Clarity:** Could be significantly improved.

3. **Live Transition**
   - **Opposite Concept:** Deadlock or Unreachable Transition makes sense in context, but the term *Dead Transition* would be more explicit.
   - **General Concept:** *Enabled Transition* is valid, but note that it’s a more specific notion than the general concept of a transition. A broader general concept could be simply **Transition**.
   - **Clarity:** Good.

4. **Bounded Net**
   - **Opposite Concept:** Unbounded Net is correct.
   - **General Concept:** Controlled Net is not a well-known generalization. A more suitable general term would be **Petri Net** or **K-Bounded/Unbounded Net**, because such nets include both bounded and unbounded behavior potentially.
   - **Clarity:** The proposed general concept is overly specific and not quite accurate in the context of Petri nets.

5. **Free Choice Net**
   - **Opposite Concept:** Non-Free Choice or Concurrency Net is imprecise. The opposite should be **Non-Free Choice Net** which maintains the distinct definition within Petri net theory.
   - **General Concept:** Synchronized Petri Net is not a standard generalization. A more fitting general concept would be **Petri Net** since free choice is a subclass of Petri nets, and 'synchronized' refers to timing or coordination, which is a different feature entirely.
   - **Clarity:** Incorrect usage of terminology makes this part weak.

### Conclusion:
While the answer generally moves in the right direction, the answer introduces concepts and generalizations that are not standard or completely accurate in the context of Petri nets. The student demonstrates some understanding; however, the use of improper or insufficiently explained terms weakens the answer, particularly regarding the general concepts. For these reasons, the grade reflects room for improvement in both terminology accuracy and precise explanations.
