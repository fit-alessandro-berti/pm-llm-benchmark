1.0

The submission fails to meet the expected standards for several reasons:

1. **Unclear and Erroneous Code**: The code is overly verbose and does not execute properly due to numerous errors (e.g., placeholder variables, undefined functions like `create_and_add`, and inconsistent formatting). Even the logic of defining transitions and places is inefficient and contains redundancies.

2. **Overcomplication Without Clarity**: The explanation convolutes the scenario unnecessarily and fails to clarify the key steps of implementing the proposed Petri net structure. Instead, it jumps between incomplete structures without presenting a coherent final design.

3. **Missing Key Steps**: The transitions for loops between Fraud Check and In-depth Investigation, as well as Document Verification and Re-Document Submission, are not implemented correctly in the final code. Additionally, the handling of the optional Approval step is done incorrectly with overly complex and poorly explained logic.

4. **Failure to Deliver Clear and Working Solution**: The implementation does not provide a clear, working Python script that fulfills the requirements (e.g., setting up proper connections, ensuring logical flow, correctly initializing markings, etc.). The numerous issues make replicating results or adapting the code for real-world use impossible.

5. **Poor Usability**: The use of placeholders like `create_and_add` is confusing, and the generic naming conventions for places contribute to the code's lack of clarity and structure. Additionally, the functions and pieces of the code do not offer clear utility or result in a functioning Petri net.

In summary, the submission is highly flawed, disorganized, and incomplete. It fails to meet the basic requirements for constructing an accepting Petri net for the given scenario. The lack of a coherent and functional final code warrants the lowest possible grade.
