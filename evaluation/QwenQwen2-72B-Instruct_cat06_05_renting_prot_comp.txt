The answer provides a reasonably structured comparison, identifying key differences with respect to rejection frequencies, execution times (performance), and frequencies of signing contracts and tenant cancellations. The reasoning reflects good domain knowledge of rental processes and differentiates between pathways where tenants are rejected or accepted, progress to sign contracts, and ultimately experience cancellations or evictions.

Some points where the response could improve:
1. **Detail on Rejections:** It could give more nuanced observations about the different stages where more rejections tend to happen, especially when it comes to the decision-making criteria or factors for both groups.
2. **Clarity on Specific Paths:** Some lengthy sentences, such as those describing "multiple rent payments," could be clearer to avoid confusion. For example, explicitly linking the numbers of payments made to undesired outcomes (e.g., cancellation, eviction).
3. **Sentence Structure:** The list under point 3 discussing "fewer cases with fewer rent payments" could be reworded for better clarity (e.g., use bullet lists effectively).
4. **The conclusion is cut-off** and doesn't provide a fully rounded summary between protected and unprotected groups.

Overall, the answer is factually correct though a bit incomplete in specific points and conclusions.
