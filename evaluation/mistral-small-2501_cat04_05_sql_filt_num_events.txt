**9.0**

### Explanation of Grading:

This answer is almost flawless. However, to meet the very high standards laid out in the grading scheme, I identified an area where hypercritical judgment reveals slight room for improvement in precision and clarity.

---

### Strengths:

1. **Logical Structure**: 
   - The query is logically sound and correctly implements the task at hand. The steps—counting events per `case_id`, filtering cases with more than six events, and then selecting the desired events—are well-organized and comprehensively explained.

2. **Correct Use of CTEs**:
   - The use of two CTEs (`event_counts` and `filtered_cases`) is a clear and efficient way to structure the query.

3. **Correct Filtering Logic**:
   - The `WHERE event_count <= 6` condition in the `filtered_cases` CTE accurately filters out `case_id`s with more than six events.

4. **Proper Join**:
   - The `JOIN` between the filtered `case_id`s and the original table is implemented correctly, ensuring that only the relevant events are returned.

5. **Final Query Readability**:
   - The inclusion of `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` in the final output enhances usability by making the result easier to read.

6. **Explanation Clarity**:
   - The answer provides a clear and thorough explanation of each step in the query, including the purpose and mechanics of the CTEs and the join.

### Very Minor Issue:

1. **Ambiguity in Aggregation Context**:
   - While it is likely implied, the query does not explicitly mention what would happen if `COUNT(*)` includes nulls or if additional filtering conditions existed in the `event_log`. Being hypercritical, a note about ensuring that all rows in the `event_log` are relevant to the task or the absence of null values in key columns (like `case_id`) could add rigor.

2. **Optimization Opportunity**:
   - A `DISTINCT` in the `filtered_cases` CTE might be unnecessary in this specific context (as `GROUP BY case_id` guarantees unique `case_id`s), and the query avoids inefficiencies well. However, highlighting such considerations could reflect attention to advanced optimization.

3. **Nitpicking Clarity**:
   - While the ordering by `el.case_id` and `el.timestamp` is useful, the task prompt did not require it explicitly. Including a note explaining that this step is optional and for readability would better align the explanation to the task.

### Final Comments:

The solution demonstrates advanced competence in SQL and is well-structured and well-explained, matching the task's requirements. However, extremely minor enhancements related to clarification, edge-case consideration, or optionality of certain output embellishments could elevate it to absolute perfection.
