9.0

### Evaluation:
The provided SQL query is correct, clear, and efficiently solves the problem as defined. It uses a subquery with a `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of events per `case_id`, followed by a `HAVING` clause to filter cases with six or fewer events. This subquery is then used in the `WHERE ... IN` clause of the main query to retrieve the desired set of events.

### Strengths:
1. **Correctness**: The query is logically accurate and adheres to the requirements of filtering cases with more than six events and returning events from the remaining cases.
2. **Clarity**: The explanation accompanying the query is well-structured and provides a good understanding of both the problem and its solution.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach using `WHERE ... IN` is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

### Minor Considerations:
The solution could provide additional clarification on performance, such as mentioning that while the `IN` operator is standard and effective for smaller datasets, using a `JOIN` might be more performant for large datasets. However, this does not significantly detract from the provided answer's accuracy or quality.

### Verdict:
This answer is very solid, nearly flawless, and exhibits a high level of precision and clarity. Given the strictness of evaluation, the very slight omission regarding performance analysis prevents it from scoring a perfect 10. Thus, the score is **9.0**.
