9.0

This is a very solid and well-presented answer with a clear understanding of Petri net concepts. Let's break down why it's graded highly and also suggest a few minor improvements that could make it perfect:

1. **Source Place:**
   - The opposite concept, **Sink Place**, is correct, and the explanation is clear. No issues here.

2. **Immediate Transition:**
   - The proposed opposite concept, **Conditional Transition**, makes sense in a general context and highlights that the transition doesn't fire immediately but depending on certain conditions. However, a more direct opposite in Petri nets might be something like a **Timed Transition** (a transition that takes place after a delay). The suggestion of Conditional Transition is still acceptable, but Timed Transition would feel more native to Petri net theory, specifically under Time Petri nets.

3. **Live Transition:**
   - The opposite concept, **Dead Transition**, is spot-on. A live transition is one that can fire in some reachable marking, while dead transitions never fire in any reachable marking. Excellent explanation.

4. **Bounded Net:**
   - The opposite concept, **Unbounded Net**, is indeed correct. Unbounded nets are those that can have an arbitrarily large number of tokens in one or more places. The explanation provided is accurate and helpful.

5. **Free Choice Net:**
   - The opposite proposed concept, **Sequential Net**, is understandable but isn't a formal opposite in Petri net theory. The more appropriate opposite for a Free Choice Net would be something like a **Non-Free Choice Net** (where choices between transitions are genuinely constrained, either due to conflicts or shared input places). While "Sequential Net" does explain a strategy where no concurrent transitions occur, it's not as closely linked to the core structure of Petri nets as Free/Non-Free Choice. 

### Conclusion:
The overall quality of the description and explanation is excellent, and the grader would value the depth provided. However, a slight tweak in the terminology for **Immediate Transition** and **Free Choice Net** could push this to a perfect 10.
