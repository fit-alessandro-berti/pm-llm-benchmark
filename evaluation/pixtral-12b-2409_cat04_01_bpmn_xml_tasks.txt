**Reasoning:**  
The answer correctly lists all tasks found within the provided BPMN 2.0 XML, as they appear in `<bpmn:task>` elements. The explanation is clear and concise, mentioning that these tasks are part of the `<bpmn:task>` elements. However, a small improvement could be specifying the exact method used, such as ID references for the tasks (e.g., `idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b` for "decide"), which might add further clarity. Otherwise, the answer is highly accurate and well-articulated.
