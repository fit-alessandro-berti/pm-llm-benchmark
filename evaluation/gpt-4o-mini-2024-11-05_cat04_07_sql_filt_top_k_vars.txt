### Evaluation:

#### Strengths:
- The answer clearly outlines the steps required to solve the task.
- It provides a full SQL query with comments explaining each step, aiming to achieve the provided goal.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Incorrect use of the `LIMIT` clause in the `variant_counts` CTE**:
   - The `LIMIT K` clause is applied within the `variant_counts` CTE without using a valid `TOP K` subquery, leading to a logical oversight. It should have been a separate mechanism to filter only the top K variants by using a rank or dense_rank()
