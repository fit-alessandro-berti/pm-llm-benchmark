**Feedback:**
1. **Clarity** - The answer provides a structured list of questions, which is a positive, but formatting issues make the list difficult to follow and read. Some entries are incomplete, and the inclusion of unnecessary symbols and spacing creates a disjointed appearance. Proper bullet points or numbered questions with consistent spacing would have improved readability. While the use of "|", formatting is inconsistent and doesn't help in understanding.

2. **Relevance** - Some questions are relevant and insightful, touching on performance, rejections, approvals, and delays. However, other questions feel a bit vague or too similar to one another, such as asking multiple times about patterns between employees, supervisors, and budget owners.

3. **Specificity** - Some questions are too general or lack the specificity that the data potentially offers. For example, Question 9 lacks depth when referring to "people taking longer" without getting into details of the stage or reason.

4. **Confidence Scores** - While some confidence scores seem appropriate, they are not always well-explained. For example, why is a question like "What is the average frequency and performance per action?" given a high confidence score of 9, while others are rated at 6 or 7? There is no explanation for these ratings.

5. **Completeness** - The list feels incomplete not only because of the significant whitespaces and gaps but also because relevant topics like performance trends over time, outliers in behavior, or exceptional cases (such as the case where payment happens without approval or high-performance variability) could have been touched upon more thoroughly.

In conclusion, the list of questions holds promise, but formatting issues, lack of specificity in places, and unclarified confidence ratings reduce the overall quality.
