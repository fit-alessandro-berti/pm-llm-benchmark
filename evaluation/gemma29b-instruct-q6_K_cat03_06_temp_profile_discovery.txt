This response is essentially a garbled output and makes no sense in terms of content, structure, or coherence. A proper answer should have explained the temporal profile clearly by analyzing transitions between activities based on the provided variants, including calculating the average times and standard deviations between the activities. 

There were no explanations, calculations, or relevant information related to generating a temporal profile in this response. It contained a long and nonsensical repetition of symbols, asterisks, and formatting errors, which were completely irrelevant to the original query.

This response is not useful at all.
