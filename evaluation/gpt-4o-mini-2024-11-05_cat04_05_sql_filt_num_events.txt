**9.0**

The provided answer is well-constructed and nearly flawless. The SQL query is syntactically correct, logically sound, and follows a step-by-step approach to achieve the task. The explanation accurately describes each component of the query, helping the reader understand how the code works. However, a couple of minor points could be improved or emphasized for absolute clarity and robustness:

1. **Event Count Calculation:** The `COUNT(*)` approach assumes the `event_log` table is free of duplicate rows for the same `case_id` and event occurrence. If there are potential duplicate rows in the table, it could slightly affect the correctness, though that's a fairly rare scenario.
   
2. **Query Readability:** While this is subjective and does not deduct from functionality, for absolute clarity, aliasing the `COUNT(*)` output in a slightly more descriptive way (e.g., `AS total_events`) might improve readability.

These points are minor and do not materially affect functionality. Therefore, the solution is awarded a 9.0. A perfect 10.0 requires perfectly addressing all potential ambiguities, even if minor or unlikely.
