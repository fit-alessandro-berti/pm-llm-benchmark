**8.5**

The response is overall solid and provides two valid methods to solve the problem: the CTE with a join and the approach using a window function. Both methods are clearly explained and meet the functional requirements of the problem. However, there are some minor issues:

1. **Excessive verbosity and lack of precision**: The discussion on alternatives (e.g., use of SELECT \* EXCLUDE) and performance considerations is overly verbose, and the flow is unnecessarily complicated in some areas. While thoroughness is good, the clarity and focus of an answer suffer when there are too many tangents. This could confuse a reader.
2. **Lack of final decision**: While the response provides two approaches (CTE with join and window function), it does not decisively recommend one over the other, leaving it ambiguous which method the user should prefer.
3. **Overexplaining DuckDB features**: Details about DuckDB syntax (`EXCLUDE`, `FILTER`, performance considerations) are informative but are not part of the user's direct requirement. Additionally, while `EXCLUDE` from DuckDB is likely supported, it isn't 100% validated in the provided context. This could have been more explicitly handled by sticking to simpler solutions (like explicitly listing column names).

### Strengths:
- The SQL solution (CTE with a join) is robust and correct.
- The second solution using the window function is valid and provides an alternative perspective for solving the problem.
- The discussion of SQL mechanics (GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions, JOIN) is technically correct and grounded in knowledge about DuckDB.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Narrow down the solution focus and explicitly state which method might be preferable considering performance or clarity.
- Avoid lengthy discussions and tangents—ensure the explanation adheres closely to the user’s question and avoids overloading the reader.
- Reduce speculative analysis of DuckDB features and performance. Instead, focus on practical and universal SQL strategies.

While the technical components and SQL correctness are sound, these flaws prevent the answer from achieving a perfect score.
