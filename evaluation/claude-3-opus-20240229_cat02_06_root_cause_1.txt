**5.0**

### Strengths of the Answer:
1. **Identification of Outliers:** The response correctly identifies Cases 102, 104, and 105 as having significantly longer resolution times compared to faster-resolving Cases 101 and 103.
2. **Root Cause Consideration:** It explores factors such as escalations to Level-2 Agents, long waiting times between activities, and delays before investigations, which are plausible contributing factors to longer resolution times.
3. **Recommendations Provided:** Suggestions such as streamlining escalations, addressing process bottlenecks, and training agents highlight actionable steps to improve the process.

### Weaknesses and Issues:
1. **Mathematical Inaccuracy in Resolution Times:** The reported resolution times contain errors:
   - Case 102's resolution time is wrongly stated as 25 hours. Correctly calculated, the total time is **25 hours 10 minutes** from 08:05 to 09:15 the following day.
   - The response fails to mention calculation errors in Case 104 as **24 hours and 10 minutes**, which is noted correctly, but without explanation on inputs.
