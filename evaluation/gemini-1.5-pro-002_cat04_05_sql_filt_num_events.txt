8.0

The revised prompt is significantly improved by incorporating a small example table and clarifying the expected output. It also provides helpful context about the task and edge cases, which is a positive addition. However, I am withholding a perfect score due to the following reasons:

### Strengths:
1. **Example Table and Output**: The inclusion of the example table and expected output adds clarity and removes ambiguity, allowing for better understanding and testing of the SQL query.
2. **Clear Task Description**: The task is articulated well, with specific instructions to group, filter, and return events from cases meeting the criteria.
3. **Edge Case Consideration**: The scenario accounts for cases with more than six events, which is essential.

### Weaknesses:
1. **Formatting/Presentation**: Although the prompt is clear, the explanation and task could be slightly more concise. Reducing redundancy (e.g., restating "return all events for cases with six or fewer events" multiple times) would improve readability.
2. **Expected Output Order Clarification**: While the prompt mentions that "the order of the rows in the output does not matter," this could be explicitly included in the task description or further emphasized to rule out confusion.
3. **Lack of Edge Case Assurance**: The example is simple and doesn't address edge cases like a `case_id` with exactly six events. Such clarification could further strengthen the prompt.

Overall, the revised prompt is excellent but has room for minor adjustments in both brevity and handling edge cases explicitly.
