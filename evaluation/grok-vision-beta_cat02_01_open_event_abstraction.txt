The response is exceptionally thorough, well-structured, and insightful. It clearly explains the concept of event abstraction and offers a detailed list of practical strategies to utilize it effectively for improving readability and manageability in process models derived from event logs. The answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and provides concrete examples across various abstraction techniques, such as aggregation, hierarchical abstraction, semantic abstraction, and pattern recognition.

The use of examples like "Document Verification," "System Initialization," and "Customer Issue Resolution" makes the explanation relatable and practical. The inclusion of visualization techniques, integration with process mining tools, and the stakeholder feedback loop further elevates the response by addressing real-world implementation considerations.

Minor drawbacks:
- The response could have explicitly acknowledged potential challenges or limitations of event abstraction, such as the risk of oversimplification or loss of critical details, which would have added an extra layer of depth.
- A brief conclusion emphasizing why these strategies are essential for stakeholders or real-world applications could have rounded out the answer even more effectively.

Overall, this is an outstanding response that warrants a high score, just shy of perfection due to the absence of a discussion on challenges or trade-offs.
