9.0

The answer is well-structured and correctly lists the tasks from the provided BPMN 2.0 XML. All task elements in the XML are accurately identified, and the corresponding task IDs are correctly provided. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the BPMN syntax and provides the requested output. However, it could be further enhanced by explicitly mentioning how tasks are identified in BPMN (under the `<bpmn:task>` element) for clarity.

This thoroughness might slightly improve an otherwise excellent answer, so it's graded as a 9.0.
