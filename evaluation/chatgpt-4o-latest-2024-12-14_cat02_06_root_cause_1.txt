**4.0**

### Evaluation of the Answer:

#### Strengths:
1. **Identification of Long Cases**: The answer correctly identifies cases **102**, **104**, and **105** as having significantly longer resolution times and provides accurate calculations of the resolution durations in most cases.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: The response points out escalations and long waiting times between activities as key contributing factors to delays, which are reasonable observations given the data.
3. **Actionable Recommendations**: The proposed solutions (e.g., streamlining escalations, improving handoffs, analyzing escalations) are appropriate and directly address the identified performance issues.

#### Weaknesses and Issues:
1. **Mathematical Errors/Discrepancies**:
   - The calculation of durations contains notable errors:
     - **Case 104**: The duration is noted as ~24 hours 10 minutes, but it should be closer to **24 hours 10 minutes**. However, there is significant uncertainty.
     Input repetition undermines clarity
