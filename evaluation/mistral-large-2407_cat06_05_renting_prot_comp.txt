9.0

The response is comprehensive and correctly identifies key disparities between the protected and unprotected groups. The main points are well-structured and touch on critical differences such as rejection rates, extensive screening, performance times, evictions, and tenancy success. Each of these aspects reflects potential unfair treatment.

The only reason for not giving a perfect 10.0 is that some of the points could benefit from slightly more detailed quantitative comparisons (e.g., specific frequency and performance time differences) to reinforce the case for unfair treatment. For example, citing the exact differences in screening frequency or explaining the levels of rejection in more concrete terms could have added more precision to the answer. Nevertheless, this is a strong analysis overall.
