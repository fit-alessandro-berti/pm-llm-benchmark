9.0

The provided query is mostly accurate and would function as required to solve the problem. It exhibits a strong logical flow and delivers a working solution. However, the strict grading criteria recommend a reduction in score due to a very slight lack of emphasis on explaining potential pitfalls or edge cases in the SQL construct used. 

### Strengths:
1. The SQL query is clear, accurate, and functional. 
2. The explanation logically leads to the correct solution.
3. The use of a `NOT IN` subquery cleanly addresses the problem statement.

### Minor Weaknesses:
1. While the answer acknowledges that `NOT IN` can be suboptimal for performance in some scenarios, it could elaborate on alternatives (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `EXISTS`, or using a `WITH` CTE for clarity).
2. The explanation correctly mentions that cases with zero events would not appear in the dataset since every row represents an event – this is good but could delve a bit deeper into the assumptions about the uniformity of the dataset.
3. Though unlikely to arise in this specific case, `NULL` handling in the `NOT IN` construct (if present in the `case_id` column) could lead to unexpected results and isn't discussed. 

Given the strictness criterion, this lack of deeper exploration into SQL nuances and minor omissions justifies a slight deduction, leading to a score of 9.0 instead of a perfect 10.
