The answer correctly identifies most of the tasks, but it misses a minor detail: the first letter of some task names should be capitalized consistently (based on the XML):

- "decide" -> Decide
- "pay compensation" -> Pay compensation
- "check ticket" -> Check ticket
- "examine casually" -> Examine casually
- "register request" -> Register request
- "reject request" -> Reject request
- "examine thoroughly" -> Examine thoroughly
- "reinitiate request" -> Reinitiate request

Although capitalization is arguably a minor issue, it should still be consistent with the XML input provided for full precision.
