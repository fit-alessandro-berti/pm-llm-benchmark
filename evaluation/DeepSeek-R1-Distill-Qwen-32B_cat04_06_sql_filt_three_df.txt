**Grade: 9.0**

This solution is very solid and demonstrates a good understanding of SQL and DuckDB functionalities. It meets the requirements of the problem and provides clear explanations of the thought process. However, a minor deduction is warranted due to slight ambiguities or details that were not explicitly addressed. Below are observations supporting this grade:

### Strengths:
1. **Correct Use of ROW_NUMBER**: The use of `ROW_NUMBER` to sequentially number events within each case is appropriate and ensures that consecutive sequences are identified reliably.
2. **Triplet Identification**: The logic in the `Triplet` CTE carefully identifies the exact sequence of activities using consecutive sequence numbers, which fulfills the "direct succession" condition.
3. **Timing Condition**: The condition to check whether the time difference between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" exceeds 5 days is explicitly detailed and correctly implemented.
4. **Case Exclusion**: The use of a `NOT IN` clause with a subquery to exclude specific `case_id`s is logical and aligns with the problem's requirement to filter out events from matching cases.
5. **Readability and Structure**: The query is well-structured and separated into logical steps, making it easy to understand.

### Weaknesses (justifying the slight deduction):
1. **Implicit Assumptions about Timestamp Calculation**: The solution assumes that timestamps are stored in a format that allows direct subtraction (e.g., seconds since epoch). While this is likely correct for DuckDB, it would have been better to explicitly confirm this assumption or mention possible adjustments for other formats.
2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The solution does not explicitly discuss how ties (e.g., identical timestamps) or overlapping triplets within the same `case_id` might affect the logic. For example, if an event log contains overlapping sequences within a single case, such as:  
   ```
   Approve Purchase Requisition -> Create Order -> Confirm Order -> Create Order -> Confirm Order
   ```
   The logic might handle this correctly, but the absence of a direct confirmation leaves room for ambiguity.
3. **Scalability and Efficiency**: While DuckDB is optimized for analytical queries, the approach relies on sequential joins for all events in the dataset. This could be inefficient on large datasets, particularly if the activity sequence occurs frequently. While this isn't an implementation error per se, discussion on performance considerations would have been valuable.

### Overall Justification:
The query is highly accurate and meets nearly all criteria of the prompt with only minor potential issues. The approach is creative, logical, and appropriately uses SQL features like `ROW_NUMBER`. Given the comprehensiveness and correctness of the approach, this is near perfection, resulting in a score of **9.0**.
