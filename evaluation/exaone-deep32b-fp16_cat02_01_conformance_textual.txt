**Score: 9.8**

The reasoning in the provided answer is highly detailed and accurate in identifying and explaining the violations of the normative process for all the cases. Here are the points justifying the score:

### Strengths:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** 
   - All cases in the event log are thoroughly analyzed against the normative process description.
   - The reasoning identifies the exact violations (and lack thereof for Case 1 and Case 4) and ties them back to the rules laid out in the normative description.

2. **Clear and Logical Explanations:**
   - Violations are explicitly stated and properly referenced against specific constraints from the normative process.
   - For example:
     - **Case 2:** Packaging before authorization is correctly identified and related to the rule about the sequence of Authorize  Package  Ship.
     - **Case 3:** Multiple issues are methodically flagged: authorization when inventory is insufficient and shipping after cancellation.
     - **Case 5:** Skipping Packaging before Shipping is correctly identified as a violation.
   - Non-violations (like the flows for Case 1 and Case 4) are appropriately highlighted with clarity.

3. **Addressing Ambiguities:**
   - The answer resolves ambiguities in the normative description effectively, particularly by recognizing that "Check inventory" determines the subsequent path in the process, and any deviation from the conditional sequences (e.g., Cancel leading directly to Close) constitutes a violation.

4. **Double-Checking Work:** 
   - The flow of thought reflects a deep effort to verify conclusions, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

### Minor Issue:
- **Slight Redundancy:** While the final conclusions and explanations are flawless, there is some redundancy in the thought process, particularly for Case 3, where the explanation of the violations is revisited and restated multiple times. This does not detract from the overall accuracy but slightly affects the efficiency of the presentation.

### Why Not a Perfect 10?
The answer is extremely well-executed and contains no inaccuracies in the final reasoning or conclusions, but the small degree of redundancy suggests room for slight improvement in conciseness. A perfect 10 is reserved for borderline-flawless presentations with no room for improvement, even in structure.

### Final Decision:
**Grade: 9.8**
