**Grade: 9.0**

### Evaluation
The solution presented is very strong, with a clear explanation and a logically sound SQL query that aligns with the problem requirements. The query effectively achieves the desired outcome by:
- Calculating the count of events per `case_id`.
- Filtering to exclude cases with more than six events.
- Returning events only for cases meeting the criteria.

However, for hypercritical evaluation, there are extremely minor points to consider:

---

1. **Redundancy in Explanation:**  
   While the explanation is clear and thorough, it could have been slightly more concise. Minor redundancies, such as re-explaining in great detail each step within the query, might make the explanation longer than necessary for advanced technical readers.

2. **Scalability Note:**  
   The solution claims scalability, but there is no discussion of potential limitations (e.g., if the dataset is extremely large, both the CTE materialization and JOIN could become performance bottlenecks). DuckDB is performant for analytical queries, but adding a note on edge cases or larger-than-memory datasets would strengthen the overall solution's realism.

3. **Missing Edge Case Mention:**  
   A potential edge case, though unrelated to the correctness of the query, could involve `case_id` values that are `NULL` or unexpected conditions in the data (e.g., duplicate rows in `event_log`). While the query would handle this gracefully, explicitly noting this would show deeper critical thinking.

### Why It Scores High
- **Accuracy:** The query is correctly written, aligns perfectly with the requirements, and outputs the desired results without any logical or syntactical issues.
- **Clarity:** Both the explanation and the query are easy to follow and demonstrate understanding of important SQL concepts (e.g., CTEs, aggregation, filtering, joining).
- **Efficiency and Practicality:** The solution is efficient within the context of typical analytics workloads where DuckDB excels.

### Justification for Not Awarding a Perfect 10.0
A perfect score demands not only flawless implementation but also consideration of all potential edge cases, drawbacks, and optimizations. While the core solution is accurate and well-explained, minor improvements could make it even more robust and complete.
