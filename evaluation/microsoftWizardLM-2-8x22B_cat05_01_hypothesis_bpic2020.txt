4.0

The list started out strong, but the answer ends abruptly and is incomplete after question 10. Here are additional critiques:

- **Misbalance of Confidence Scores**: Some confidence scores, such as for question 8 ("saved but not submitted" with 0.65), seem odd compared to other more obvious insights like rejection rates (which should arguably yield higher confidence scores). The overall scoring system lacks consistency.
  
- **Inconsistent Insightfulness**: Some questions like "What percentage of declarations are rejected by the SUPERVISOR?" don't require a deep analysis and could be calculated directly, yet have somewhat inflated confidence scores. 

- **Incomplete Answer**: The list needs to present all 20 questions, plus some additional context would help justify the individual confidence ratings more rigorously.

To achieve a higher grade, the response should not only provide a full list of relevant questions but must also be consistent in how confidence scores are assigned, alongside a clear explanation behind their relevance.
