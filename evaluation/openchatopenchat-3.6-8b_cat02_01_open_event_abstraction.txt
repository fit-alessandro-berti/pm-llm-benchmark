This response provides a well-structured, clear, and comprehensive explanation of how to use event abstraction to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models. The steps are logically outlined and provide actionable advice, addressing key components such as identifying similar events, defining abstractions, replacing detailed events with abstract ones, updating sequences, and refining the model. There’s also mention of visual cues and the importance of documentation and communication, which are essential for practical implementation in real-world settings.

However, the answer could have been improved by briefly touching on some potential challenges or limitations of event abstraction and strategies for dealing with those. Additionally, a few more examples or specific use cases could further illustrate the points being made. Nonetheless, it is a strong and detailed response.
