8.5

**Reasoning for the grade:**

**Strengths:**

1. **Structured and Clear Analysis**: The answer follows a logical structure. It identifies key performance indicators (rejection rate, appointment denial rate, loan rejection process complexity, process duration) and systematically compares these between the "protected" and "unprotected" groups.
  
2. **Quantitative Insight**: The author uses percentages and frequencies effectively to back up the identified differences. This shows a solid base in reasoning and use of numbers to make comparisons meaningful.

3. **Fair Lending Knowledge**: The use of domain knowledge such as "Lending Regulations" and "Credit Risk Assessment" indicates a deeper understanding of the subject and the potential regulatory consequences of unfair practices. The suggestions for further investigations are relevant.

4. **Unbiased Recommendations**: The suggestions for further investigation (e.g., statistical analysis, qualitative research) are well-founded, demonstrating an open-minded approach rather than jumping to conclusions.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Interpretation Issues**: While the answer points out major observations and potential unfair differences, some comparisons (e.g., the process durations and their implications) could have been articulated a bit more clearly. The differences in execution times across variants could have been discussed with more depth (for example pointing out whether the differences are statistically significant).

2. **Missed Detail on Performance**: The mention of the "skipped_examination" variant is interesting, but the author could have delved deeper into what role this step plays in simplifying the process, and why it is entirely missing for the protected group. Also, "performance" differences are crucial but are somewhat underexplored in terms of the impact such variations have on borrowers.

3. **Complexity of Some Points**: Some conclusions may benefit from simpler phrasing and clearer explanation for laypersons, particularly about how exactly each complexity in the process map affects the protected group.

**Conclusion**:

This is a comprehensive and detailed answer, but some clarification and deeper interpretation on specific data points (like execution time) would elevate it further.
