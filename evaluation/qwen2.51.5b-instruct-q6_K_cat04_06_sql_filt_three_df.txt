2.0

The provided SQL script is substantially flawed in both logic and implementation. Below is a breakdown of the issues, which significantly impair its correctness and utility:

---

### Major Issues:

1. **Misinterpretation of Requirements**:
   - The query does not accurately follow the prompt's requirements. Specifically:
     - It does not robustly detect the strict sequence of activities ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') occurring in direct succession within the same case (`case_id`). The WHERE clause with generic filtering using `ACTIVITY IN` is insufficient and does not enforce the order of events.
     - The prompt explicitly states that the time difference must be checked between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events **in that sequence**. This condition is not implemented properly because there is no logic to calculate the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' specifically. The use of `TIMESTAMP BETWEEN sf.TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5 days' AND sf.TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '5 days'` is nonsensical and unrelated to the actual requirement.

2. **Erroneous Filtering Logic**:
   - The query's `FilteredOut` logic does not achieve the desired purpose:
     - The subquery in `NOT EXISTS` incorrectly references the `SequenceFiltered` CTE, which itself lacks logic to identify the proper activity sequence.
     - The timing check does not verify if the time between the relevant 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is > 5 days, as the direct filtering condition compares unrelated timestamps.

3. **Misuse of `CASE_ID`**:
   - Hardcoding `CASE_ID = 'some_case_id'` throughout the query is both incorrect and impractical. The prompt explicitly mentions that the query should work for all cases in the dataset, not just specific hard-coded ones.

4. **Irrelevant Filtering and String Functions**:
   - The use of `SUBSTR(LOWER(Activity), ...)` and similar filters in `SequenceFiltered` has no basis in the prompt. These functions are erroneously applied and appear to be randomly included without purpose.
   - The conditions in `SequenceFiltered` fail to accurately identify any activity within the specified sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order').

5. **Confusion in CTE Logic**:
   - The CTEs (`SequenceMatch`, `SequenceFiltered`, `FilteredOut`) are extremely convoluted and redundant:
     - `SequenceMatch` simply filters events by hardcoded `CASE_ID` and timestamps, which is irrelevant according to the prompt.
     - `SequenceFiltered` appears to attempt some filtering logic via string manipulation, but this is deficient and illogical.
     - `FilteredOut` does not properly exclude cases matching the specified sequence and timing condition.

### Minor Issues:
6. **Error-Prone and Unclear Code**:
   - The redundant WHERE clauses and hardcoded references (`CASE_ID = 'some_case_id'`) make the query impractical and hard to maintain.
   - The query includes unused filters (e.g., timestamps `BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'`) that are unrelated to the prompt.

7. **No Validation of Results**:
   - The query does not include any checks or validations to ensure correctness after execution.

---

### Correct Approach (High-Level Summary):
1. Use a window function or common table expressions (CTEs) to explicitly establish the order of activities within each `case_id` based on timestamps.
2. Identify cases where the exact sequence ('Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order') occurs in direct succession.
3. Filter these cases where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
4. Exclude events from the identified cases in the final result.

Here’s an example of a succinctly structured approach to fulfill the prompt:
```sql
WITH RankedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
Sequences AS (
    SELECT
        r1.case_id,
        r1.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        r2.timestamp AS create_timestamp,
        r3.timestamp AS confirm_timestamp
    FROM RankedEvents r1
    JOIN RankedEvents r2 ON r1.case_id = r2.case_id AND r1.rn + 1 = r2.rn
    JOIN RankedEvents r3 ON r2.case_id = r3.case_id AND r2.rn + 1 = r3.rn
    WHERE
        r1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND r2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND r3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND r3.timestamp > r2.timestamp + INTERVAL '5 DAYS'
),
ExcludedCases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM Sequences
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM ExcludedCases);
```

### Grading Justification:
- **Major Logical Mistakes**: The script fails to fulfill core parts of the requirements (e.g., sequence detection, time-difference filtering, proper exclusions).
- **Incorrect Syntax and Approach**: Hardcoding of `CASE_ID`, irrelevant string manipulation with `SUBSTR`, and nonsensical timestamp filtering severely compromise correctness.
- **Lack of Clarity and Practicality**: The query is convoluted and unwieldy, making it difficult to understand and repurpose.

Given these significant flaws, a strict grade of **2.0** is assigned, recognizing that the query has some measure of structure but fails almost entirely in addressing the problem requirements.
