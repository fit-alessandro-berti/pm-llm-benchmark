9.0

The answer is almost complete and correct. It correctly lists the tasks found in the BPMN process model by identifying the `<bpmn:task>` elements, along with the task names and their corresponding IDs. The explanation about these tasks being represented by `<bpmn:task>` elements is well-articulated.

However, the one minor point preventing a perfect score is that the answer misses associating one less obvious task. In fact, it omits a task:

9. "reject request" (id: idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7), which is listed as part of `sequenceFlow`. 

But otherwise it's a very solid output!
