7.0  

### Strengths:  
1. **Clarity in Identifying Normative Violations**: The answer clearly identifies violations of the normative rules in Case 2, specifically mentioning the sequence issue (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and the improper Finalize Documentation step after rejection.  
2. **Desiderata Analysis**: The analysis of desiderata violations in Case 3 (delayed Credit Check, late notification, and missing Follow-up Call) is thorough and adequately distinguishes these as non-severe deviations.  
3. **Interpretations and Justifications**: The provided explanations for deviations (e.g., system error for normative violations, workload issues for desiderata failures) show an attempt to contextualize the behaviors.  

### Weaknesses:  
1. **Ambiguity in Case 2 Analysis**: While it is noted that normative rules are violated, the statement "desiderata conditions are not applicable" is unclear and problematic. Desiderata such as promptness (e.g., Credit Check within 24 hours) could still technically apply, even if the normative sequence is violated. The answer should have acknowledged whether these conditions were objectively met or not, regardless of the normative violation.  
2. **Missed Opportunity for Improvement**: Regarding Case 3's deviations from desiderata, the answer correctly identifies the issues but doesn't sufficiently analyze alternative procedural improvements. For example, "Follow-up Call missing" could have been flagged as a recurring issue rather than isolated to this case. There is no indication of systemic improvement suggestions.  
3. **Structure and Clarity**: The organization is acceptable but leans slightly redundant. For instance, the "normative violations" and "desiderata failures" analysis could be made more concise, and there is some overlap in content between the lists and the justifications.  
4. **Justifications for Case 2**: The reasoning for the normative violations seems speculative (e.g., "training issue"). While plausible, the justifications lack strong evidence from the provided data and are not clearly grounded in the event log details.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Address the ambiguity in Case 2 desirability analysis. Clearly state whether desiderata were followed or violated, even if normative rules were broken.  
2. Provide deeper systemic insights or actionable recommendations for process improvement, especially for Case 3 (e.g., flagging late actions and missing Follow-up Calls as recurring issues).  
3. Avoid speculative explanations unless they are strongly grounded in the data. Instead of guessing reasons (e.g., "system error"), focus on what definite improvements can be made based on the observable pattern.  
4. Simplify and streamline the structure for better readability and reduced redundancy in phrasing.  

### Final Score Justification:
The answer demonstrates solid reasoning and a competent understanding of the normative rules and desiderata. However, flaws in clarity, incomplete responses (specifically regarding Case 2 desiderata), and speculative interpretations prevent it from reaching a top score. A score of **7.0** reflects satisfactory performance with noticeable room for improvement in precision and depth.
