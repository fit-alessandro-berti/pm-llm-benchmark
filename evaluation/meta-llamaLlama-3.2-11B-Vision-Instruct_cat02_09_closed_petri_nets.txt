**7.5**

Here’s a detailed evaluation of the response:

### 1. Source Place
- Opposite (Sink Place): **Correct**, as the sink place only has incoming arcs and no outgoing arcs, which is indeed the logical opposite of a source place.
- More general (Place): **Correct**, since a place is indeed the more general concept and encompasses both source and sink places.
- **Grade**: Full marks for this part.

### 2. Immediate Transition
- Opposite (Delayed Transition): **Partially correct**. The idea of a "delayed" transition contrasts with an immediate transition, but this leaves ambiguity because "timed transitions" (with explicit timing semantics) are more commonly discussed in the literature. "Delayed transition" could introduce confusion without further clarification regarding its definition.
- More general (Transition): **Correct**, since a transition is the broader category that can include both immediate and delayed ones.
- **Grade**: Slight reduction for the ambiguous choice of the opposite term.

### 3. Live Transition
- Opposite (Dead Transition): **Correct**. A dead transition can never fire, which is indeed the opposite of a live transition that can fire an infinite number of times.
- More general (Transition): **Correct**, transition is the general concept that encompasses both live and dead transitions.
- **Grade**: Full marks for this part.

### 4. Bounded Net
- Opposite (Unbounded Net): **Correct**. An unbounded net is indeed the opposite of a bounded one, with at least one place capable of holding an infinite number of tokens.
- More general (Net): **Partial**. A "net" generally refers to a Petri net but it would be more accurate to say "Petri Net" or "Marked net," since there are different kinds of nets. Still, in the context, this is not inaccurate, just imprecise.
- **Grade**: Pretty good, with a slight suggestion for improvement by clarifying the type of net.

### 5. Free Choice Net
- Opposite (Strictly Conflicting Net): **Incorrect**. The strictly conflicting net does not exist in the definitions provided in classical Petri net theory literature. However, the notion of a "conflicting transition" exists (where choices between transitions cannot coexist). A better opposite would be one related to "State machine" or "Extended free choice net," concepts more clearly found in the literature.
- More general (Net): **Correct**, net is the broader, generic version here.
- **Grade**: Points deducted due to the incorrect term for the opposite concept.

### Conclusion:
The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Petri net concepts and captures most of the opposites and generalizations in a coherent way. There are a few areas requiring more precision, especially in terminology related to delayed/strictly conflicting transitions.

Final Grade: **7.5/10**.
