The answer generally identifies the correct sensitive attributes with respect to fairness considerations, including:

- **case:citizen**: Citizenship/nationality could indeed lead to discrimination.
- **case:gender**: Gender is a common sensitive attribute when assessing fairness.
- **case:german speaking**: Language proficiency could create biases, especially if language-related discrimination exists in the system.
- **resource**: The treatment by entities in the process could introduce biases, though it's slightly less directly sensitive than the other factors (resource could be a bit more contextual).

However, the explanation could benefit from a more detailed breakdown of why these attributes are considered sensitive, and how predictive fairness in decisions might be impacted by these attributes in either direct or indirect ways. Furthermore, while the statement about how these attributes being included doesn't guarantee discrimination is true, a more robust argument could mention how one might consider or mitigate against potential biases like indirect discrimination.

In summary:
- Correct attributes are identified.
- A more nuanced explanation of inherent risks in fairness could be expanded.
