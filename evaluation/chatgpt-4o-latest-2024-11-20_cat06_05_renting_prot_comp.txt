**9.5**

The answer provides a thorough analysis of the key disparities between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups. It methodically identifies and explains the differences in rejection rates, performance times, extensive screening frequencies, long-term tenancy opportunities, and eviction rates. Furthermore, the response logically interprets the implications of these disparities, suggesting potential systemic bias or inefficiencies as root causes.

Here are the strengths:
1. The answer effectively highlights numerical evidence (frequencies and performance times) to substantiate claims.
2. It identifies relevant measures of unfair treatment, such as rejection rates, eviction likelihood, and long-term tenancy opportunities, which align with domain knowledge around process equity.
3. It draws insightful conclusions and links these disparities to potential systemic issues, demonstrating a good understanding of the subject matter.
4. The answer is structured logically, making it easy to follow with clear sections for each key point.

One minor weakness:
- While the analysis is highly detailed, it could have benefited from being slightly more concise to enhance readability and prevent redundancy in some sections.

Overall, the answer aligns well with domain knowledge, substantiates its points with data, and provides actionable conclusions, justifying the high score.
