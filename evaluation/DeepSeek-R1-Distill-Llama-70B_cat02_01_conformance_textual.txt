**Score: 9.0**

The final evaluation is thorough, logically structured, and well-aligned with the normative process description. The explanation identifies the correct cases that deviate from the expected process (Cases 2, 3, and 5), and the violations are clearly analyzed and explained in a way that follows directly from the provided normative rules. Minor flaws that could prevent a perfect score include the lack of deeper reasoning or acknowledgment of potential ambiguities (e.g., clarifying specific edge cases for payment authorization steps). However, the core conclusions are accurate and well-supported by the text, making this response highly reliable.
