**9.0**

This answer is nearly perfect. It provides a clear list of all the tasks correctly along with their associated IDs. The only reason the grading is slightly less than 10.0 is that there is no specific commentary on potential opportunities for improvement, such as pointing out any nuances in the task structure or flow. However, for the main requirement of listing the tasks, the answer does an excellent job and is well formatted and accurate.
