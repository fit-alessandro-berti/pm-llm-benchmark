**7.5**

Here's the breakdown of the grading:

- **Correct identification of Opposite Concepts (Accuracy)**: 
    - The opposites for _Source Place_ (Sink Place), _Immediate Transition_ (Timed Transition), _Live Transition_ (Dead Transition), and _Bounded Net_ (Unbounded Net) are mostly spot-on. These opposites are well-accepted in the Petri nets literature and consistent with the terminology.
    - The opposite concept of _Free Choice Net_ is given as _Non-free choice net_. While technically correct, this is a bit insufficient since the explanation could be improved with better-known properties such as unequal distribution of conflicts (this needs more detail).

- **General Concepts (Explanation and Generalization)**: 
    - The examples given for the utility of each opposite concept are decent but could use refinement. 
    - All of the suggested oppositions are valid, but the "more general concepts" haven’t been mentioned explicitly, and a good generalization would involve concepts that subsume or apply to multiple cases. For example:
        - _Markov Decision Processes_ could be a more general concept that relates to different types of Petri nets when considering either types of transitions or resource decisions.
        - _Controlled Nets_ could be used as a generalization for Free-choice nets, since they apply to broader controlled decision structures.
    - Without proposing broader general abstractions explicitly, the analysis limits itself to oppositional concepts only.

- **Completeness**:
    - The explanation is clear, but it is only focusing on opposites, lacking proposals of more general concepts, which should also be included based on the question.

Hence, given the correct identification of opposites and clear explanations but the incompleteness regarding generalization concepts, the overall grade of 7.5 seems fair for an otherwise good attempt.
