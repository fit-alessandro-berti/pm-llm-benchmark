**8.0**

The answer provides a solid analysis of the differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups. Here's what the grading considers:

### Strengths:
1. **Thoroughness in Comparison**: The answer addresses multiple key aspects, including *frequency of rejection*, *execution times*, *extensive screening*, *tenant success rates*, *tenant cancellations*, and *eviction*. It captures the general imbalance between both groups across these dimensions.
   
2. **Clear Structure**: The response is well-organized, breaking down the comparison into understandable parts, which helps in analyzing each aspect of the process systematically.

3. **Identifies Unfair Differences**: The last part of the answer concisely summarizes the key points, drawing a conclusion about the more stringent screening and higher rejection rates for the protected group, which is central to the unfair treatment claim.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Minor Inaccuracy in Screening Comparison**: The extensive screening frequency comparison isn't entirely accurate. For example, the unprotected group has fewer instances than claimed; the comparison says there are fewer in the unprotected group while the correct interpretation should note that it's around the same level (793 vs. 1022).
   
2. **Use of Performance Times**: The performance times (execution times) are summarized in the context of rejections and tenancy success, but the analysis could be more refined. Specifically, the answer could focus more on how much longer the protected group waits in certain scenarios relative to the unprotected group.

3. **Further Explanation of Impact on Protected Group**: The response could have gone deeper into the implications of the identified differences with respect to fairness. For example, explaining how the higher rejection frequency and longer execution time negatively affect the experience of the protected group could have added more value.

Overall, it's a good, solid response with a few minor inaccuracies and areas that could benefit from refinement.
