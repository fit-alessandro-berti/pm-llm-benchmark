The response provided is incoherent, fragmented, and does not offer any meaningful analysis or comparison of the differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups. Key issues include:

- Lack of structure or complete sentences in many parts of the analysis.
- Irrelevant details and formatting issues (e.g., "****").
- Failure to provide concrete insights or conclusions regarding the differences in treatment based on the provided data.
- No attempt to compare frequencies or performance metrics between groups.

The response fails to meet the requirements of the question and does not offer any useful information or clarification.
