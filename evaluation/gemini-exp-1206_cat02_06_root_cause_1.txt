**7.5**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Identification of Long-Resolution Cases:** The answer correctly identifies longer resolution times (cases 102, 104, 105) and quantifies the durations in hours, providing an easy comparison.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** The discussion offers plausible reasons for delays (escalations, overnight gaps, and delays in investigation). It appropriately highlights escalation-related inefficiencies and their potential consequences.
3. **Recommendations:** The proposed action steps (e.g., better notification systems, prioritization mechanisms, and SLAs for investigation) are practical and relevant to the identified problems.
4. **Structure and Organization:** The answer is logically organized into distinct sections, which ensures ease of reading and clarity in how problems and solutions are presented.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Mathematical Errors:** Resolution time calculations for cases 102 and 104 are incorrect:
   - Case 102: The correct total resolution time is 25.17 hours, but it's understated because the rounding in the chart is inconsistent. The exact time span should be verified to account for differences.
   - Case 104 repeats this ambiguity (time).
2. **Detailing Escalations**: It lacks a deep-div Berat-time escalate without   formal root clar.feedback accuracy
