Your request to evaluate the detailed explanation of the described DECLARE model, along with the rigidity of grading criteria you emphasized, implies that the evaluation should focus on logical accuracy, comprehensiveness, clarity, relevance, proper application of constraints, real-world perspective inclusion, and anticipation of consequences in case of deviations.

However, you've provided the question setup and no student-provided response to evaluate yet. If you can supply the student-written answer to the original prompt, I can thoroughly review and assign a score based on the criteria you've outlined (strictness, attention to detail, and identification of minor flaws).

Let me know if you need help grading or analyzing an existing answer, or if you'd like me to help author an example answer to this prompt!
