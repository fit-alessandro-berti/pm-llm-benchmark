**9.0**

The final answer is clear, logical, and correctly identifies the violations in the event log based on the normative process description. It accurately points out issues in Case 2 and Case 3, explaining them with reference to the outlined flow and constraints:

1. **Case 2 Violation:** Correctly identifies that "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which breaks the rule that "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items."
2. **Case 3 Violation:** Correctly notes that "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which violates the rule that no fulfillment-related activities should follow a cancellation.

### Strengths:
- The reasoning consistently refers back to the normative process description, showing a clear understanding of the rules.
- Each violation is explained with precision and linked to specific deviations from the process requirements.
- The summary provides a concise recap of the analysis, making it easy to follow.

### Weaknesses:
- While the explanation is accurate and the violations are correctly deduced, the phrasing in the analysis section could be slightly more precise. For instance, in the discussion of Case 2, a more explicit mention that "Authorize payment" was out of sequence (not just skipped) could enhance clarity.
- The assessment for Case 3 could briefly clarify why "Ship order" post-cancellation is a dealbreaker, even when "Close order" occurs after it.

### Final Verdict:
The answer meticulously matches the event log to the normative process rules with accurate conclusions and lucid explanations. However, the minor room for improvement in phrasing and precision prevents a perfect score. Thus, a **9.0** is awarded.
