1.0

**Evaluation:**

The provided text is **not an answer** to the "Draft Prompt for the Benchmark." The prompt explicitly asks the respondent to "craft a DuckDB SQL query." The provided text, instead, offers an *evaluation* of the prompt itself, discussing its strengths and suggesting improvements.

Therefore, as an answer to the specific task requested in the prompt (generating a SQL query), the provided text completely fails. It does not attempt to solve the problem posed but instead critiques the problem statement.

According to the grading criteria ("evaluate with the utmost strictness," "hypercritical," "minor issues should result in a significantly lower score"), providing entirely the wrong *type* of response constitutes a fundamental failure and warrants the minimum possible score. The answer does not contain a SQL query, let alone one that addresses the requirements of filtering cases based on event count in DuckDB.
