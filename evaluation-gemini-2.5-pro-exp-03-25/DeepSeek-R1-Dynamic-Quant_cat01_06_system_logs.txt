**Explanation of Logic:**

1.  **Case Identification:**
    *   Cases were defined based on the primary task or document the user was interacting with, inferred primarily from the `Window Title` and `Application` fields in the system log. Each distinct, focused work session was treated as a separate case instance.
    *   Task switches, identified by `SWITCH` events or explicit `FOCUS` events on different primary objects (documents/applications), were used as boundaries between cases.
    *   When the user returned to a previously worked-on document (`Document1.docx`, `Quarterly_Report.docx`) after performing other distinct tasks, these were treated as separate sessions (and thus separate cases or parts of cases) to reflect the interleaved nature of the work. For instance, `Document1.docx` interactions were split into `DOC1_Session1` and `DOC1_Session2`.
    *   The very brief initial focus on `Quarterly_Report.docx` was assigned to the case `DOC_QuarterlyReport` based on the window title, acknowledging it's temporally separated from the main work on that document.
    *   Case IDs were made descriptive (e.g., `DOC1_Session1`, `EMAIL_AnnualMeeting`, `PDF_ReportDraft`) based on the document or task involved.

2.  **Activity Naming:**
    *   Raw system log actions (`FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`, `SWITCH`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT`, `CLOSE`) were mapped to more abstract, standardized activity names suitable for process analysis.
    *   The goal was to represent the user's intent or the function being performed. Examples:
        *   `TYPING` was converted to `Edit Document`, `Edit Spreadsheet`, or `Compose Email` depending on the context.
        *   `SCROLL` was mapped to `Review Email` or `Review PDF`.
        *   `CLICK` events within the email client were mapped to specific actions like `Open Email`, `Prepare Reply`, and `Send Email`.
        *   `FOCUS` events generally indicate the start of interaction with a specific object/task (`Focus on Document`, `Focus on Spreadsheet`).
        *   `SWITCH` events were used to mark the transition point between tasks/cases (`Switch to [Target App]`).
        *   `HIGHLIGHT` became `Annotate PDF`.
        *   `SAVE` and `CLOSE` actions were named clearly (`Save Document`, `Close Document`, etc.).
    *   This abstraction provides a clearer view of the process flow than the raw, low-level system events.

This transformation provides an event log that structures the user's interactions into distinct task-oriented cases with meaningful activity labels, making it suitable for analysis using standard process mining techniques.
