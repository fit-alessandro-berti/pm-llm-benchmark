**Evaluation:**

1.  **Correctness:**
    *   **Sequence Identification:** The use of three joins (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`) combined with specific `activity` checks correctly identifies potential candidates for the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'.
    *   **Direct Succession:** The two `NOT EXISTS` clauses are correctly formulated to ensure that no other event for the same `case_id` exists between `e1` and `e2`, and between `e2` and `e3`, respectively. This accurately implements the "direct succession" requirement.
    *   **Timing Condition:** The `date_diff('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp) > 5` condition is correctly placed within the CTE (`problematic_cases`) to filter only those sequences that meet the time requirement. The function and arguments (`start`, `end`) are appropriate for DuckDB.
    *   **Exclusion Logic:** The final `SELECT` statement uses `WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases)` which correctly excludes *all* events belonging to any case identified in the CTE.
    *   **Output:** The query returns `e.*`, preserving all original columns for the non-excluded events, as requested. The `ORDER BY` clause is reasonable for event log data.

2.  **Clarity and Structure:**
    *   The use of a CTE (`problematic_cases`) significantly improves readability by separating the logic for identifying problematic cases from the final filtering step.
    *   Aliases (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`, `e`) are used effectively.
    *   The provided explanation accurately describes the query's steps and logic.

3.  **Strictness Concerns / Hypercritical Analysis:**
    *   **Efficiency:** While logically correct, the approach using multiple joins and correlated `NOT EXISTS` subqueries *can* be less performant on very large datasets compared to an alternative using window functions (`LEAD`). A window function approach could identify the next 1st and 2nd events and their timestamps in a single pass, potentially simplifying the check for direct succession and timing. For example:
        ```sql
        WITH lead_events AS (
            SELECT *,
                   LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
                   LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
                   LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
                   LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        ),
        problematic_cases_wf AS (
            SELECT DISTINCT case_id
            FROM lead_events
            WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
              AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
              AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
              AND date_diff('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
        )
        SELECT e.*
        FROM event_log e
        WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problematic_cases_wf)
        ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
        ```
        This window function approach is arguably more standard for sequence analysis in modern SQL and often more efficient. The provided solution, while correct, doesn't use this potentially more optimal pattern. Under hypercritical evaluation, not choosing the potentially most efficient/idiomatic approach for sequence analysis can be seen as a minor drawback.
    *   **`DISTINCT` in CTE:** While `SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id` is correct, `NOT IN` works correctly even if the subquery returns duplicate `case_id`s. `DISTINCT` might offer a slight performance benefit or clarify intent but isn't strictly necessary for correctness here. This is a very minor point.

**Conclusion:**

The query is logically sound, correctly implements all requirements of the prompt, and is well-structured. It accurately identifies the direct sequence and applies the timing condition before excluding the relevant cases. The only point preventing a perfect score under hypercritical review is that it uses a join-based approach with `NOT EXISTS` for sequence checking, whereas a potentially more efficient and arguably more modern/idiomatic approach using window functions (`LEAD`) exists for this type of problem. However, the provided solution is not incorrect or logically flawed. Therefore, it receives a high score, but slightly reduced due to the existence of a potentially superior alternative pattern when judged with "utmost strictness".
