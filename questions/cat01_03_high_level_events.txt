**Prompt:**

You are given a complex event log from a manufacturing process that includes highly granular, low-level machine events, operator actions, and system checks. Your task is to group these low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps. Each high-level step should represent a coherent stage of the manufacturing process (e.g., "Material Preparation," "Assembly," "Quality Inspection," etc.). In addition, provide a rationale for how you grouped the low-level events and propose names for the aggregated high-level events.

**Event Log Description:**

- The event log is represented as a sequence of events.  
- Each event has the following attributes:  
  - **CaseID:** The unique identifier of a single product or item being processed.  
  - **Timestamp:** The exact time the event occurred (format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss).  
  - **Activity:** A low-level action performed (e.g., picking a part, scanning a barcode, adjusting a screw, checking a sensor).  
  - **Resource:** The agent or machine performing the event (e.g., Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Quality Sensor #1).  
  - **AdditionalInfo:** Supplemental data related to the event (e.g., part number, measurement value, tool ID).

**Event Log (Sample):**  
Below is a subset of events from multiple cases. The full log is large, but the pattern is consistent. Use this subset to infer rules for grouping events:

```
CaseID | Timestamp           | Activity                    | Resource           | AdditionalInfo

**Instructions:**

1. **Identify High-Level Steps:**  
   Examine the sequence of events for each case and propose a set of high-level activities that represent logical groupings of these low-level steps. For example, a "Material Preparation" step might include retrieving the raw metal sheet, scanning the barcode, placing it on the table, aligning, and preheating.  
   
   Consider grouping events that are temporally close, performed by the same resource or resource type, or logically follow from each other (e.g., picking up a tool followed by welding might be considered part of an "Assembly" step).

2. **Justify Groupings:**  
   For each high-level activity you define, explain why you grouped those low-level events together. Are they all part of preparing a single component? Are they all quality assurance checks? Do they occur in a distinct phase of the manufacturing process?

3. **Name the High-Level Activities:**  
   Assign meaningful, domain-relevant names to each group.

4. **Output Format:**  
   Return a structured representation of your proposed high-level activities.

**Goal:**  
By the end of this exercise, we want a clearly defined set of higher-level activities that represent the larger process steps, making it easier to understand the manufacturing workflow at a glance. You should be able to show how to go from low-level event sequences to more meaningful aggregated process stages.
