**Prompt for the Benchmark:**

"Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log` with at least the following columns:

- `case_id`: Identifies which process instance (case) an event belongs to.
- `activity`: Indicates the name of the executed activity.
- `timestamp`: A datetime value indicating when the activity occurred.

You need to write a DuckDB SQL query that:

1. Identifies any case (`case_id`) that contains the following sequence of three activities in direct succession:  
   - 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  
   - 'Create Order'  
   - 'Confirm Order'

   In other words, these three events must appear in this exact order, with no other event from the same case in between them.

2. Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is **more than 5 days**.

3. After identifying such cases, **exclude them from your final result**. You should only return events from cases that do not meet the above criteria.

Your final query should return all events from `event_log` except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition. Please ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering so that the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."
