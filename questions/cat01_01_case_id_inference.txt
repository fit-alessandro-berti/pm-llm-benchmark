Below is a complex, interleaved sequence of hospital process events. Each line represents a single event, containing attributes like `timestamp`, `activity`, `resource`, `department`, `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `additional_info`. **Note:** The events come from multiple separate "cases" (i.e., distinct patient journeys), but there is no explicit case ID included. Your task is to infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same case) based on the sequence of activities, timing, and other attributes.

```

**Your task:** Based on the event attributes (timestamp, activity, department, patient_age, patient_gender, etc.) and their logical order, determine how these events can be grouped into separate cases. Essentially, infer the case IDs from this complex interleaved sequence.
