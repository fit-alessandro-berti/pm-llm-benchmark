**Prompt:**

LOG SKELETON  
The Log Skeleton process model contains the following declarative constraints:

- **Equivalence:** If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one.  
- **Always Before:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously.  
- **Always After:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events.  
- **Never Together:** The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case.  
- **Activity Occurrences:** Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case. For example, `{'A': {0,1}, 'B': {1,2}}` means A occurs either 0 or 1 time, B occurs either 1 or 2 times.  
- **Directly-Follows Constraints:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after.

The Log Skeleton is expressed as a Python dictionary containing the keys: `'equivalence', 'always_before', 'always_after', 'never_together', 'activ_freq', 'directly_follows'`.

The values associated to `'equivalence', 'always_before', 'always_after', 'never_together', 'directly_follows'` are sets containing pairs (tuples) of activities that satisfy the given constraint. The value associated to `'activ_freq'` is a dictionary mapping each activity to a set of allowed occurrence counts.

**Scenario:**

Consider a complex order fulfillment process in a large-scale distribution center. When a new customer order arrives at the warehouse management system, it must be processed through a series of activities to ensure the order is correctly assembled, packaged, and shipped.

Activities involved:

- **Receive Order (RO)**: This marks the point at which a customer's order enters the system.
- **Check Availability (CA)**: Warehouse staff verify that the items requested in the order are in stock.
- **Reserve Items (RI)**: Once availability is confirmed, items are reserved to prevent allocation to other orders.
- **Pick Items (PI)**: The warehouse workers collect the requested products from the shelves.
- **Quality Check (QC)**: The picked items are inspected to ensure that they meet quality standards.
- **Pack Order (PO)**: The order is packed into boxes or envelopes and prepared for shipment.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**: A shipping label is created and attached to the package.
- **Dispatch (D)**: The package is sent out to the carrier.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)**: An invoice is generated and sent to the customer.
- **Record Payment (RP)**: The payment record is updated in the system once the customer pays.

Your task: Construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given scenario.
