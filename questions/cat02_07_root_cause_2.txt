**Prompt:**

You are given an event log of an “Insurance Claims Processing” process. The goal of this process is to handle submitted claims effectively, evaluate their validity, gather any necessary additional documentation, approve the claim if warranted, pay out the claim, and then close it. While the process steps may look similar on the surface, performance issues can arise due to various root causes. In this scenario, the underlying causes of long case durations may be linked to event-level attributes like the assigned resource, the geographic region handling the claim, and the complexity level of the claim.

Below is a tabular event log, where each row records an event (activity) in a given case, along with the timestamp of the event and additional attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity). Your task is to identify the cases with performance issues and deduce the root causes by analyzing how these attributes correlate with longer lead times.

**Process Steps (for context):**  
- **Submit Claim:** The customer submits an insurance claim.  
- **Evaluate Claim:** The initial assessment of the claim.  
- **Request Additional Documents:** The insurer requests more information if needed.  
- **Approve Claim:** Once all data is complete and verified, the claim is approved.  
- **Pay Claim:** After approval, the insurer pays the claimant.  
- **Close Claim:** The process concludes after payment.

**Your Task:**
1. Identify which cases are taking significantly longer to complete.
2. Analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) to determine potential root causes of these extended durations. For example:  
   - Are cases handled by a particular resource or region taking longer?  
   - Do high-complexity claims require multiple requests for additional documents, thus extending the process?  
3. Propose explanations for why these attributes might contribute to performance issues and offer suggestions to mitigate these root causes.
