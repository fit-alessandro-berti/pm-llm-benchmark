You are an expert AI assistant with deep knowledge in process mining. Your task is to transform the provided Windows activity system log into a process mining event log. This event log should be suitable for analysis with standard process mining tools.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Data Transformation:** Convert the raw system log into an event log format. Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity in a process instance (case).

2. **Case Identification:** Identify how to group related events into coherent cases. A "case" can represent a logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document, handling a particular email, or reviewing a certain PDF. You may need to infer the logic by looking at sequences of events and how the user interacts with different applications and documents over time.

3. **Activity Naming:** Translate raw low-level actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH") into higher-level process steps or standardized activity names. Choose meaningful, consistent activity names that will make sense for process analysis.

4. **Event Attributes:** Include at least the following attributes for each event:
   - **Case ID**: A unique identifier for the case to which the event belongs.
   - **Activity Name**: A descriptive name of the activity.
   - **Timestamp**: The original event timestamp.
   - You may include additional attributes or derived attributes if useful.

5. **Coherent Narrative:** The final event log should tell a story of user work sessions. Describe your logic in a brief explanation after producing the event log.

6. **Explanation:** After producing the event log table, provide a brief summary explaining the logic behind how you grouped events into cases and how you determined activity names.

**Additional Guidance:**

- If multiple plausible interpretations of the cases exist, choose the one that leads to a coherent, analyst-friendly event log.
- Strive to create standardized activities rather than keeping the raw action verbs from the system log.
- Consider temporal and application context.

Below is the Windows system log of user activities. Each line shows a timestamp, action type, and related attributes such as application name and window title. Transform these raw events into a process mining event log based on the instructions above.
