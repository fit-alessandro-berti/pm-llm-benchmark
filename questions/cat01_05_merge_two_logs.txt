**Prompt:**

You are given two separate event logs, **Log A** (from System A) and **Log B** (from System B). Both logs describe a sequence of events for an order fulfillment process, but each log was recorded by a different system with different timestamp granularities, event naming conventions, and attributes. Your task is to produce a single, integrated event log that merges corresponding events into unified records where possible.

**Context & Requirements:**

1. **Logs Description**:  
   - **Log A (System A)**:  
     - Considered the “primary” timeline, but timestamps may reflect the time events are *received*, not when they *started*.  
     - Has fewer attributes per event (e.g., event type, order ID, basic timestamps).

   - **Log B (System B)**:  
     - Has richer attributes (like user_id, resource_id, additional metadata).
     - Timestamps may be slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds.
     - Some event names differ.
     - May contain events not present in Log A, or may be missing events that appear in Log A.

2. **Matching & Merging Events**:  
   - Attempt to align events from Log A and Log B based on a combination of order_id and event timing.  
   - If two events appear to represent the same occurrence, merge them into a single record.  
   - Include all attributes from both logs for merged events. If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both.  
   - If you cannot confidently match two events, leave them separate.

3. **Handling Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**:  
   - If an event appears only in one log and has no suitable match in the other, include it as-is, indicating its origin.
   - Use a small timestamp tolerance for matching (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them the same event).

4. **Final Output**:  
   - Produce a merged event log with enriched attributes.
   - Present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp).
   - Document your reasoning for how events were matched or left separate, and how conflicts were resolved.

**Your Task:**  
Merge these two logs into a single, enriched event log. Align events that represent the same activity, combine their attributes, and produce a final chronological list of events. Include reasoning for your decisions, especially regarding how you handled slight timestamp mismatches and naming variations, as well as how you integrated attributes from both logs.
