# 2) After data is validated, we proceed to preliminary scoring (C).
# 3) After scoring, we have an XOR branch to either check local affiliation (D) or skip it.
# 4) After this choice, we move on to the manual review (E).
# 5) Finally, we issue the final decision (F).

*“Consider the POWL model of the loan application process described above. In particular, focus on the XOR operator that chooses between checking local affiliation (D) and skipping that step. Can you identify how this branching introduces subtle bias favoring certain applicants? Discuss the implications of giving a non-legally protected group an incremental advantage and how it might impact fairness and equity in the final loan decisions.”*
