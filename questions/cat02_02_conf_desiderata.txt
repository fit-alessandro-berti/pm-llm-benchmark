**Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)**  
**Textual Description:**  
You oversee a loan application process that must adhere to a strict sequence of activities. The process always starts with receiving a loan application. After receiving the application, a credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation is done. Once the credit check is completed, a risk assessment is conducted. Based on this assessment, a loan decision (either approved or rejected) is made. Following the loan decision, the applicant must be informed of the outcome. If the loan is approved, the documentation must be finalized before the case is closed. If the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation. At no point should the process skip steps, reverse their order, or perform contradictory actions like finalizing documentation after a rejection.

**Key Normative Constraints:**
- **Sequence:** Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] → Close Case  
- **Ordering Rules:**  
  - Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.  
  - Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision.  
  - Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.  
  - If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.  
  - If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.
  
**What is Not Allowed:**  
- Skipping activities in the required sequence.  
- Changing the order (e.g., doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check).  
- Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.  
- Closing the case without following the decision logic (Approved → Finalize Documentation before closing, Rejected → close without finalization).

**Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**  
**Textual Description:**  
In addition to the strict sequence, there are some recommended best practices. Violating these is not considered a serious problem, but ideally they should be followed. For example, it is preferred that the Credit Check is completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours), and that the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision). It is also encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case, just to ensure all parties are aligned.  
Failing to adhere to these timing recommendations or skipping the follow-up call is not a serious violation. These are considered “desiderata” rather than hard rules.

**Your Task:**

1. Identify which cases are violating the normative rules and explain the reasons.
2. Identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions.  
   - Clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior.
3. When possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations.
