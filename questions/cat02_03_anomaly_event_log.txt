**Prompt:**

You are given an event log from a well-known business process commonly referred to as "Procure-to-Pay" (P2P). This process typically includes activities such as creating a purchase requisition, issuing a purchase order, receiving goods, processing an invoice, and making a payment, among others. The process steps are widely understood in business operations. Below is an event log showing several cases (process instances) with recorded activities. Some of these cases may reflect unusual or anomalous behavior relative to the standard P2P process sequence. Your task is to identify any anomalies and explain why they might be considered problematic, relying on general knowledge of the P2P process and standard business practices.
