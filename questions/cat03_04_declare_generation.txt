**Prompt:**

DECLARE  
A DECLARE model in pm4py is expressed as a Python dictionary containing the following keys:  
`'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init', 'responded_existence', 'coexistence', 'response', 'precedence', 'succession', 'altresponse', 'altprecedence', 'altsuccession', 'chainresponse', 'chainprecedence', 'chainsuccession', 'noncoexistence', 'nonsuccession', 'nonchainsuccession'`

For the keys `{'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init'}`, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule.

For the keys `{'responded_existence', 'coexistence', 'response', 'precedence', 'succession', 'altresponse', 'altprecedence', 'altsuccession', 'chainresponse', 'chainprecedence', 'chainsuccession', 'noncoexistence', 'nonsuccession', 'nonchainsuccession'}`, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule.

**Scenario:**

Consider a complex, multi-department product design and launch process in a manufacturing company. Each product idea goes through a series of steps involving design, prototyping, testing, approval, and marketing before it is finally launched. The activities include:

- **Idea Generation (IG)**: Brainstorm and document new product ideas.
- **Design Draft (DD)**: Create initial product designs.
- **Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)**: Engineers verify if the design is technically feasible.
- **Cost Evaluation (CE)**: Finance teams estimate production costs.
- **Prototype Creation (PC)**: A prototype is built based on the approved design.
- **Laboratory Testing (LT)**: The prototype undergoes technical tests in a lab.
- **User Testing (UT)**: The prototype is tested by a limited set of end-users.
- **Approval Gate (AG)**: Management approves the product design to move forward.
- **Marketing Plan (MP)**: A marketing strategy is formulated to promote the product.
- **Final Launch (FL)**: The product is launched into the market.

Your task: Construct a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for this scenario.
