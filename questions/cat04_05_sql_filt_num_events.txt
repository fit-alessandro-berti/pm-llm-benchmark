**Draft Prompt for the Benchmark:**

"Assume you have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, with each row representing a single event. The table has at least the following columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. Each `case_id` groups events that belong to a single process instance (or 'case').

Your task: Please craft a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total.

In other words, the query should identify the number of events per `case_id`, exclude any `case_id` where this count is greater than six, and then return the full set of events for the remaining cases. Be sure to consider the correct grouping and filtering to achieve this result."
