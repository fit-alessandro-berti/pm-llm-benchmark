**Prompt:**

You are presented with an event log of a “Customer Support Ticket Resolution” process. The event log captures multiple cases, each representing a single support ticket through its lifecycle. Typical steps in this process include receiving the ticket, triaging it, assigning it to a support agent, investigating the issue, resolving the ticket, and then closing it. In some instances, the tickets may also require an escalation to a specialized team.

Below, you will find an event log in tabular format. Each row corresponds to an event: a specific activity performed on a ticket at a given timestamp. The first event of each ticket marks when the ticket was received, and the last event marks the closure of the ticket. All timestamps are aligned to a common reference timeline. Cases (tickets) that take significantly longer than average to resolve suggest performance issues. Your task is to identify any patterns or factors that may be causing these delays.

**Event Log (Tabular Format):**

**Your Task:**

1. Identify which cases have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others.  
2. Determine potential root causes of the performance issues. Consider factors such as the presence of escalations, long waiting times between activities, or unnecessary delays before investigation and resolution steps.  
3. Explain how these identified factors could be leading to increased cycle times and propose any insights or recommendations that might address these performance bottlenecks.
