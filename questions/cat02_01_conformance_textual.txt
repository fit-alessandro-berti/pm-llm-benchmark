**Prompt:**

You are given a textual description of a normative process for handling orders, followed by an event log consisting of multiple cases. Each case represents a single process instance and includes a sequence of recorded activities with timestamps. While the normative description outlines how the process should ideally proceed, it may contain ambiguities. Your task is to identify which cases in the event log deviate from the intended process flow, and to explain what rules or expectations are being violated. You may need to interpret the normative description and the conditions it implies, resolving ambiguities as best as you can.

**Normative Process Description (Textual):**

The general idea of this process is that an order, once received, should be carefully handled in accordance with the availability of the items requested. The process always begins with the "Receive order" activity. After an order is received, the next logical step is to check whether the inventory is sufficient to fulfill it. This "Check inventory" step must occur before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment are made.

If the inventory is found to be sufficient, then the normal progression should continue as follows: after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment, ensuring that the customer’s payment method is valid and approved. Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as "Package items." Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with "Ship order." Once the order has been shipped, it should then be properly finalized by the "Close order" activity. This entire sequence—Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close—reflects the expected flow when inventory is not a limiting factor.

On the other hand, if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process must branch into a cancellation scenario. In such a case, after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to "Cancel order." Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to "Close order." This results in a shorter sequence—Receive, Check, Cancel, Close—for insufficient inventory scenarios.

In essence, the key constraints include: "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known. "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped. "Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation. "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios. Any deviation from these general principles—such as shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before checking inventory, or packaging items before authorization—would be considered a violation of the normative process.

However, the exact nature of these sequences and the conditions they imply may contain some room for interpretation. For instance, one might question whether it’s ever acceptable to authorize payment before certain conditions are fully confirmed, or whether a cancellation step can precede certain checks in extraordinary circumstances. Nonetheless, the description provided here is intended to guide you in understanding what constitutes a “correct” sequence of activities and what does not.
