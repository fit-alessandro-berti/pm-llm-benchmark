**Prompt:**

In this task, you are given two POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models of a well-known “Hire-to-Retire” process. This process typically includes activities such as posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding a new employee, adding the employee to the payroll system, and closing the case. Both models introduce some anomalies—variations from what would be considered a standard or normative sequence of events for a Hire-to-Retire workflow.

**Recall: Definition of POWL Models**  
A POWL model is a partially ordered graph representation of a process, extended with control-flow operators for modeling choice and loop structures. There are four types of POWL structures:  
1. **Activity (Transition):** Represents a labeled process activity (e.g. "Post_Job_Ad"). Silent transitions, with no label, are also possible.  
2. **Exclusive Choice (X):** An operator that represents a branching in the process where exactly one of the sub-models is selected at runtime. (e.g., `X(A, B)`).  
3. **Loop (*):** A loop operator between two sub-models, allowing repetition. For instance, `*(A, B)` means you execute A, then either exit the loop or execute B followed by A again.  
4. **Partial Order (PO):** Specifies a set of nodes (activities or operators) with a defined precedence relation. Some nodes may be executed in parallel if no direct order is defined.

You will see two POWL models below. Each represents a variation of the Hire-to-Retire process but includes deviations from the standard sequence.

**POWL Model 1:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")

model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**POWL Model 2:**
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Post = Transition(label="Post_Job_Ad")
Screen = Transition(label="Screen_Candidates")
Interview = Transition(label="Conduct_Interviews")
Decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
Onboard = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
Payroll = Transition(label="Add_to_Payroll")
Close = Transition(label="Close_Case")
skip = SilentTransition()

loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip])
xor_payroll = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Payroll, skip])

model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

**Your Task:**  
1. Analyze both POWL models in relation to the standard Hire-to-Retire process. Consider the expected order of activities and the logic of hiring new employees.  
2. Identify the anomalies present in each model, considering typical process logic. Some anomalies might be more severe, fundamentally violating the essence of the process, while others might be less severe but still represent deviations from good practice.  
3. Decide which model more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. Justify your choice by explaining how the identified anomalies in each model affect process correctness and integrity.
