### Underlying Database Context

**Database Type:** PostgreSQL

**Schema Description:**

- **Table:** `claims`  
  **Columns:**  
  - `claim_id` (INTEGER) – Unique identifier for the claim  
  - `customer_id` (INTEGER) – Identifier of the customer who submitted the claim  
  - `claim_amount` (DECIMAL) – Monetary amount requested in the claim  
  - `claim_type` (VARCHAR) – Type of the claim (e.g., "home_insurance", "auto_insurance")  
  - `submission_date` (DATE) – Date the claim was received

- **Table:** `adjusters`  
  **Columns:**  
  - `adjuster_id` (INTEGER) – Unique identifier for the adjuster  
  - `name` (VARCHAR) – Name of the adjuster  
  - `specialization` (VARCHAR) – Area of expertise (e.g., "home", "auto")  
  - `region` (VARCHAR) – Geographic region of responsibility

- **Table:** `claim_events`  
  **Columns:**  
  - `event_id` (INTEGER) – Unique event identifier  
  - `claim_id` (INTEGER) – Identifier matching `claims.claim_id`  
  - `activity` (VARCHAR) – Label of the performed step in the process  
  - `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP) – When the step was performed  
  - `resource` (VARCHAR) – The resource (adjuster, system, etc.) who performed the activity  
  - `additional_info` (VARCHAR) – Additional context (optional)

**Intended (Ideal) Process Flow:**  
1. **Receive Claim (R)**  
2. **Assign Adjuster (A)**  
3. **Evaluate Claim (E)**  
4. **Approve Claim (P)**  
5. **Notify Customer (N)**  
6. **Close Claim (C)**

### Actual Process Model in POWL (Containing Anomalies)

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define atomic activities
R = Transition(label="R")  # Receive Claim
A = Transition(label="A")  # Assign Adjuster
E = Transition(label="E")  # Evaluate Claim
P = Transition(label="P")  # Approve Claim
N = Transition(label="N")  # Notify Customer
C = Transition(label="C")  # Close Claim
skip = SilentTransition()

# Create a loop structure that includes Evaluate and Approve.
# * (E, P) means: execute E (evaluate), then either exit the loop or execute P (approve) and then E again, repeatedly.
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[E, P])

# Create an XOR that chooses between notifying the customer or skipping.
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[N, skip])

# Create a partial order structure including the main phases:
# We have: R -> A -> loop -> xor -> C
# However, we will also introduce partial ordering anomalies:
# For example, we do not strictly enforce that A completes before loop, or that loop completes before C,
# allowing some out-of-sequence execution in the model representation.

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[R, A, loop, xor, C])
root.order.add_edge(R, A)     # A after R
root.order.add_edge(A, loop)  # Loop after A
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor) # XOR after the loop
# Intentionally, do not order xor -> C strictly, or add a second edge from A to C directly,
# which might allow C to occur concurrently or prematurely in certain interpretations.
root.order.add_edge(A, C)     # Allows closing claim possibly prematurely
```

You are given a POWL process model of an insurance claim handling process, which includes activities for receiving a claim, assigning an adjuster, evaluating the claim, approving it, notifying the customer, and closing the claim. The model also contains some unusual or anomalous structures, such as a loop between evaluation and approval, and an XOR that may skip customer notification. Moreover, due to partial ordering choices, it appears possible to close a claim before proper evaluation or even before approval has fully taken place.

Your task is to:

1. **Identify the anomalies in the given POWL model**: For example, the loop that repeatedly evaluates and approves claims, the XOR that may omit customer notification, and the partial ordering that might enable closing the claim prematurely.

2. **Generate hypotheses on why these anomalies might exist**: Consider scenarios such as:
   - Changes in business rules that were partially implemented.
   - Miscommunication between departments leading to incomplete process design.
   - Technical errors in the workflow system that allowed non-standard execution paths.
   - Inadequate constraints or controls in the process modeler’s tool.

3. **Propose what could be done to verify these hypotheses using the underlying database**: Suggest how one might write database queries against the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables to look for actual occurrences of these anomalies in the event data. For instance, queries that:
   - Identify claims that were closed without a proper evaluation or approval event.
   - Locate claims that were approved multiple times.
   - Check if customer notification steps are frequently skipped in practice.
