**Prompt:**

You are given a process event log from a complex support workflow at a fictional financial services company. The log captures multiple cases (each representing a customer support ticket) and their associated events. The same activity names appear multiple times within a single case, but carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur. Your task is to carefully analyze the log and then rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences.

**Event Log:**

**Your Task:**

1. Identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case and interpret how their meaning changes depending on their position in the process or the associated context.

2. For each activity that recurs, rename them to reflect their context.

3. Present a revised version of the event log with the renamed activities, ensuring that the new names disambiguate the activities and highlight their roles in the process flow.

4. Justify the naming choices briefly, indicating the contextual clues that led to those changes.
