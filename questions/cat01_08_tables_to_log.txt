**Prompt:**

You are given several tables extracted from an ERP system. These tables represent various aspects of a business process, including orders, items, deliveries, invoices, and payments. Your task is to integrate the data from these tables to produce a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining. The final event log should contain one row per event and include, at a minimum, the following columns:

- **Case ID**: A unique identifier for the process instance.
- **Activity Name**: A descriptive name for the activity that took place.
- **Timestamp**: A date/time field showing when the event occurred.
- **Resource/Actor** (optional but recommended): The user, department, or system entity responsible for the event.
- **Other Attributes** (if available): Any additional relevant data.

**Your Tasks**:  
1. **Identify Cases**: Use the `order_id` as the case identifier for each process instance.
2. **Derive Activities**: Convert key steps in the lifecycle of each order into events. For example:
   - "Order Created" event from the `Orders` table.
   - "Items Picked" event(s) from the `Order Lines` table.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events from the `Delivery` table.
   - "Invoice Issued" event from the `Invoice` table.
   - "Payment Received" event from the `Payments` table.
   
   You may define additional events as needed if the data supports them.
   
3. **Map Timestamps**: Each event should have a timestamp. When multiple timestamps are available (e.g., `item_picking_date` for multiple items), produce one event per activity if itâ€™s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate. Always ensure that the chronological order reflects the real process flow.
   
4. **Combine Data**: Link each event using the keys provided. Ensure that each event row is placed in sequence and can be traced from order initiation to completion.

5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: If the tables contain information about which department or user performed the activity, include a "Resource" or "Actor" column.

**Output Format**:  
Please provide the final event log as a structured table (in Markdown format) where each row represents a single event.
**Important**:  
- Infer activity names logically from the context given by the tables.
- Ensure that every event for every `order_id` is included.
- Maintain chronological correctness.
- If data is missing or ambiguous, document any assumptions made.
