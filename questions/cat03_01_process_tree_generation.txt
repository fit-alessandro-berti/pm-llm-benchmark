PROCESS TREE  
A process tree is a hierarchical process model.  
The following operators are defined for process trees:  
-> ( A, B ) tells that the process tree A should be executed before the process tree B  
X ( A, B ) tells that there is an exclusive choice between executing the process tree A or the process tree B  
+ ( A, B ) tells that A and B are executed in true concurrency.  
* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again (this can happen several times until the loop is exited).  
the leafs of a process tree are either activities (denoted by 'X' where X is the name of the activity) or silent steps (indicated by tau).  
An example process tree follows:  
+ ( 'A', -> ( 'B', 'C' ) )  
tells that you should execute B before executing C. In true concurrency, you can execute A. So the possible traces are A->B->C, B->A->C, B->C->A.

ProcessTree objects are defined in pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree  
They have as properties:  
- parent (the parent process tree, which is left empty for the root node)  
- children (the child ProcessTree objects)  
- operator (one of the pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator enumeration values: Operator.SEQUENCE, Operator.XOR, Operator.PARALLEL, Operator.LOOP)  
- label (if the ProcessTree is a leaf, then it is valued with the label)  
The properties are mimicked in the constructor.

Note that adding the process trees as children is not enough. Their parent should be explicitly set to the parent node. Otherwise, it does not work.

Example construction:  
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator  
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)  
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=root)  
seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)  
B = ProcessTree(label="B", parent=seq)  
C = ProcessTree(label="C", parent=seq)  
seq.children.append(B)  
seq.children.append(C)  
root.children.append(A)  
root.children.append(seq)

**Complex Process Description:**

Consider a highly intricate hospital patient management scenario that reflects a multifaceted set of activities and decision points within a single patient’s stay. The process encompasses multiple interlinked stages of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatments, administrative procedures, and support services. The goal is to model these steps into a single process tree using the given operators and notation.

1. The patient begins their journey by **Arriving (A)** at the hospital reception. Upon arrival, the patient must complete a **Registration (RG)** process to handle personal data, insurance details, and assign a patient ID. Following registration, the patient undergoes an initial **Intake Assessment (IA)** to gather preliminary health information.

2. After the intake assessment, the patient must be evaluated by the triage team. This involves two mandatory activities in sequence:
   - **Triage Interview (TI)** to understand symptoms and severity,
   - **Triage Classification (TC)** to assign the patient a priority level.

3. Based on the triage classification, there is an exclusive decision on the type of initial diagnostic tests:
   - If the patient is suspected of a cardiovascular issue, they perform a **Comprehensive ECG (CE)**.
   - Otherwise, if suspicion is more general or non-cardiac, they perform a **Full Blood Panel (FBP)**.
   
   Only one of these tests (CE or FBP) will be performed as the initial diagnostic procedure.

4. Once the initial diagnostic test is done, the results must be evaluated. If the results are abnormal, a loop commences:
   - The patient must be reviewed by a **Specialist Consultation (SC)**, which could be a cardiologist, hematologist, or another specialist depending on the findings.
   - After consultation, an exclusive treatment choice is made:
     - Administer a **Targeted Medication (TM)**, or
     - Provide a **Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT)** session.
   
   Following the treatment, the patient must undergo a **Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT)** step. The RDT itself is an exclusive choice similar to the initial test:
   - Either a **Follow-up ECG (FCE)** if cardiac issues persist, or
   - A **Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA)** if the issue is non-cardiac.
   
   This loop repeats: after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation and subsequent exclusive treatments. This can happen multiple times until the results are deemed normal. Once normal results are obtained, the loop ends.

5. After normal results are finally achieved, the patient must proceed with a set of advanced diagnostic imaging and lifestyle support activities. These are done to ensure no underlying conditions are missed and to support the patient’s recovery. The following two activities are done in true concurrency:
   - **Advanced Imaging (AI)** (e.g., MRI or CT scan),
   - **Nutritional Counseling (NC)** to optimize patient’s diet.
   
   Both activities should be completed, but their order and concurrency are not fixed—they can be done in parallel.

6. Once the advanced imaging and nutritional counseling are finished, the patient goes through a final sequence of administrative and informational steps:
   - **Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (FAS)** to ensure the patient has a future check-up date,
   - **Detailed Discharge Instructions (DDI)** to provide the patient with guidance on medication, physical activities, dietary restrictions, and warning signs.

7. Before the patient can leave the hospital system entirely, a concurrency block handles the final administrative and financial clearances. In parallel, the following steps occur:
   - **Billing (BL)** to settle hospital expenses,
   - **Insurance Claims Processing (ICP)** to handle insurance-related paperwork and reimbursements,
   - **Medical Records Finalization (MRF)** to ensure all patient records are properly filed and electronically stored.
   
   These three activities (BL, ICP, MRF) occur in true concurrency. After all these parallel activities are completed, the patient’s process ends and they are officially released.

**Expected set of activities:**
- **A**: Arrival
- **RG**: Registration
- **IA**: Intake Assessment
- **TI**: Triage Interview
- **TC**: Triage Classification
- **CE**: Comprehensive ECG
- **FBP**: Full Blood Panel
- **SC**: Specialist Consultation
- **TM**: Targeted Medication
- **SPT**: Specialized Physical Therapy
- **RDT**: Re-Diagnostic Test (loop step)
- **FCE**: Follow-up ECG
- **FBA**: Follow-up Blood Analysis
- **AI**: Advanced Imaging
- **NC**: Nutritional Counseling
- **FAS**: Follow-up Appointment Scheduling
- **DDI**: Detailed Discharge Instructions
- **BL**: Billing
- **ICP**: Insurance Claims Processing
- **MRF**: Medical Records Finalization

Your task is to construct the corresponding process tree that models this entire complex process, using the given operators (->, X, +, *) and the notation for activities or silent steps (tau).
