**Prompt:**

You have been given a log of events from a manufacturing assembly line. Each event represents a snapshot in time of machine operations, as recorded by various sensors. The data is purely numerical, without explicit activity labels. Your goal is to apply process mining techniques to infer the activities being performed—such as "Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection," or "Packaging"—based on patterns in the numeric readings.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the event log provided below. Each event contains:
   - A timestamp
   - A machine identifier (Machine ID)
   - Several sensor readings: temperature, pressure, vibration level, material flow rate, tool position, and energy consumption

2. Identify distinct patterns or "phases" in these readings and group related events together. These phases likely correspond to meaningful steps in a manufacturing process (e.g., cutting, assembling, welding).

3. Assign intuitive labels to each group of events that appear to represent a particular activity. Consider how changes in temperature, pressure, vibration, flow, tool position, and energy usage might indicate transitions between these activities.

4. Provide a rationale for why you assigned each label. For example, you might note that a significant increase in temperature and vibration could indicate a cutting operation, while stable moderate conditions with steady flow might represent assembling parts.

5. Output your labeled activities along with an explanation of how you deduced each one.

**Your Task:**

- Analyze the patterns in the given events.
- Determine which events belong to which high-level manufacturing activities.
- Assign meaningful labels to each set of related events.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have performed a high-level process mining task, deriving a labeled process from a raw event log.
