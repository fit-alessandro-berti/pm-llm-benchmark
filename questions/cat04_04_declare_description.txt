I have a DECLARE declarative process model containing the following constraints (here we provide a short explanation):
Existence: the activity is executed at least once.
Absence: the activity is not executed.
Exactly 1: the activity is executed exactly one time.
Initialization: the trace starts with one of the given activities.
Responded existence: given a couple of activities (A, B), if A occurs then B also occurs.
Co-Existence: given a couple of activities (A, B), if A occurs then B also occurs.
Response: given a couple of activities (A, B), if A occurs then B also occurs in the future of the trace.
Precedence: given a couple of activities (A, B), if B occurs then also A occurs in the past of the trace.
Succession: given a couple of activities (A, B), both the response and precedence constraints are satisfied.
Alternate response, alternate precedence, alternate succession: as the constraints mentioned above, but strenghtened by specifying that the events must alternate without repetitions.
Chain response, chain precedence, chain succession: as the constraints mentioned above, strenghtened by imposing the directly-follows relation.
Non Co-Existence: given a couple of activities (A, B), if A occurs then B should not occur.
Non Succession and non Chain succession: given a couple of activities (A, B), B should not follow A.


These are the constraints of the model:
Responded Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Payment Handled', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')
Existence: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
Alternate response: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')
Exactly 1: Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
Precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
Chain precedence: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
Alternate precedence: ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
Response: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
Chain response: ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
Initialization: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
Absence: Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING
Succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')
Alternate succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')
Chain succession: ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')
Co-Existence: ('Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'), ('Request Payment', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled'), ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Payment Handled', 'Request Payment'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'), ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')

Can you describe the process underlying this data ?
