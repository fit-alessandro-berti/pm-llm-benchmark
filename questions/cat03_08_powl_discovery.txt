**Prompt:**

POWL (PARTIALLY ORDERED WORKFLOW LANGUAGE) MODELS  
A partially ordered workflow language (POWL) is a partially ordered graph representation of a process, extended with control-flow operators for modeling choice and loop structures. There are four types of POWL models:

- An activity (identified by its label, i.e., 'M' identifies the activity M). Silent activities with empty labels (tau labels) are also supported.
- A choice of other POWL models (an exclusive choice between the sub-models A and B is identified by **X ( A, B )**).
- A loop node between two POWL models (a loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by **\* ( A, B )** and tells that you execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again, repeating until the loop is exited).
- A partial order over a set of POWL models. A partial order is a binary relation that is irreflexive, transitive, and asymmetric. A partial order sets an execution order between sub-models (i.e., the target node cannot be executed before the source node is completed). Unconnected nodes in a partial order are concurrent. For example:  
  - **PO=(nodes={NODE1, NODE2}, order={})**: NODE1 and NODE2 can be executed in parallel.  
  - **PO=(nodes={NODE1, NODE2}, order={NODE1-->NODE2})**: NODE2 can only be executed after NODE1 is completed.  
  - A more advanced scenario:  
    **PO=(nodes={NODE1, NODE2, NODE3, X ( NODE4, NODE5 )}, order={NODE1-->NODE2, NODE1-->X ( NODE4, NODE5 ), NODE2-->X ( NODE4, NODE5 )})**, meaning NODE2 and the choice between NODE4/NODE5 both depend on NODE1’s completion, and the choice also depends on NODE2’s completion.

POWL models are defined in `pm4py.objects.powl.obj` in different classes:
- **SilentTransition** defines a silent transition (no operator and no label).
- **Transition** defines a transition with a label (no operator).
- **StrictPartialOrder** defines a POWL model with a set of nodes. The order between elements can be added with `.order.add_edge(source_node, target_node)`. The nodes must be provided in the constructor and cannot be modified afterward.
- **OperatorPOWL** defines a POWL model with an operator and children. The operator can be `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.XOR` or `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator.LOOP`. The children must be provided in the constructor, and cannot be modified afterward.

Below is an example:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

A = Transition(label="A")
B = Transition(label="B")
C = Transition(label="C")
skip = SilentTransition()

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[C, skip])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
```

**Scenario:**

You are given a complex event log in tabular form that details a global manufacturing and distribution process of high-end appliances. Each record in the event log corresponds to an event in a certain case.

**Your Task:**
Based on the event log, produce a POWL model that represents this complex process.

No code needs to be executed, but produce the final POWL structure that captures these relationships, using transitions (activities), possibly silent transitions, and the appropriate POWL operators (X for choice, * for loops), and a StrictPartialOrder to define the partial ordering and concurrency.

**Event Log Example:**

**Key Activities:**  
- OR: Order Received  
- MS: Material Sourcing  
- QS: Quality Screening  
- AS: Assembly  
- IQC: In-line Quality Check (repeated if needed)  
- TST: Testing  
- RT: Re-Testing (if the product fails the initial test, leading back to TST)  
- PK: Packaging  
- LB: Labeling (may be skipped in some cases)  
- DP: Distribution Planning  
- D: Dispatch
