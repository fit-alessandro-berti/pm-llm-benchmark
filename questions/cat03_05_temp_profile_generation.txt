**Prompt:**

TEMPORAL PROFILE  
The temporal profile is a model describing the average and the standard deviation of the times between couples of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution. For a given trace like `<A,B,C,D>`, the pairs `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, and `(C,D)` must be considered. Given a positive value `ZETA`, a deviation occurs when the observed time between two activities in a particular execution is either significantly lower than `(AVG - ZETA * STDEV)` or significantly higher than `(AVG + ZETA * STDEV)`.

The temporal profile is expressed as a Python dictionary associating pairs of activities (as tuples) to a tuple of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` of their temporal distances. For example:
```python
{('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600), ('B', 'C'): (3600, 3600)}
```
This indicates that:
- The average time between `A` and `B` is 86400 seconds (1 day), with a standard deviation of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
- The average time between `B` and `C` is 3600 seconds (1 hour), with a standard deviation of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

**Scenario:**

Consider a complex global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. The process involves multiple steps spanning procurement, inspection, assembly, testing, packaging, and distribution. Each execution of this process involves the following activities:

- **Supplier Selection (SS)**: Choosing the supplier from whom components will be procured.
- **Order Placement (OP)**: Placing the order for the required components.
- **Receive Components (RC)**: Receiving the ordered components at the warehouse.
- **Quality Inspection (QI)**: Inspecting the received components for quality.
- **Component Assembly (CA)**: Assembling the components into a sub-unit of the product.
- **Product Testing (PT)**: Testing the final assembled productâ€™s functionality.
- **Packaging (PK)**: Packaging the final product for shipment.
- **Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Storing the packaged product in the warehouse until shipping.
- **Distribution (DT)**: Shipping the product to retailers or customers.
- **After-Sales Support (AS)**: Providing support and maintenance after the sale.

Over multiple process executions (traces), each activity can follow another activity with some average delay and a standard deviation around that delay. These times depend on various factors like supplier lead times, manufacturing complexity, testing thoroughness, packaging speed, and distribution network efficiency.

Your task:  
Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. For each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other), assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times. The dictionary keys should be tuples of activity labels (e.g., `('SS', 'OP')`), and the values should be tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)`.

Please construct a dictionary that includes a representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps.
