**Prompt:**

You are given a process model represented in the DECLARE constraint language. The model is specified as a Python dictionary with particular keys corresponding to different DECLARE constraints. Some constraints involve only one activity (e.g., `existence`, `absence`, `exactly_one`, `init`), while others involve pairs of activities (e.g., `responded_existence`, `coexistence`, `response`, `precedence`, `succession`, `altresponse`, `altprecedence`, `altsuccession`, `chainresponse`, `chainprecedence`, `chainsuccession`, `noncoexistence`, `nonsuccession`, `nonchainsuccession`).

Each constraint type includes a set of activities (for unary constraints) or pairs of activities (for binary constraints). For unary constraints (like `existence`), the dictionary maps activity names to a dictionary containing at least the keys `"support": 1.0` and `"confidence": 1.0`. For binary constraints (like `response`), the dictionary maps activity names to another dictionary mapping the target activity to a dictionary with `"support": 1.0` and `"confidence": 1.0`.

Your task is to take the initial DECLARE model and add new constraints that limit the process’s bias. Suppose the underlying process is a loan application review in which certain decisions (e.g., Approve, Reject, RequestAdditionalInfo) might be influenced by sensitive attributes (such as ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace). You must introduce constraints that ensure that the sequence of activities does not discriminate based on these attributes. For example, you might add constraints that enforce that any decision activities cannot immediately follow or be preceded only by events where a sensitive attribute leads to a biased outcome. You could also require that "additional checks" (e.g., `ManualReview`) must coexist with decision steps involving applicants from sensitive demographics, ensuring fairness and consistency.

**Given Model (Example):**
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Your Instructions:**

1. **Identify Potential Bias:** Consider that the process, as described, might be susceptible to bias against certain applicants based on sensitive attributes. For instance, a `FinalDecision` of “Reject” might occur more frequently after seeing attributes like `ApplicantRace: Minority` without a proper check in between.

2. **Add New Constraints to Mitigate Bias:** Insert new DECLARE constraints into the model that enforce fairness. These could include:
   - **Coexistence:** If a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), ensure a `ManualReview` activity always coexists in the trace.
   - **Response or Succession Constraints:** Ensure that certain decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`.
   - **Non-succession Constraints:** Prevent a direct succession from a sensitive attribute event (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision event (`Reject`) to avoid immediate biased outcomes.

3. **Preserve the Format:** Make sure all added constraints follow the DECLARE dictionary structure:
   - For unary constraints (`existence`, `absence`, `exactly_one`, `init`), map activities to `{"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`.
   - For binary constraints (`response`, `precedence`, `succession`, etc.), map an activity to another activity’s dictionary, setting `{"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}` for each link.

4. **Document Your Additions:** In your final answer, show the updated `declare_model` dictionary including your newly introduced constraints that limit the possibility of biased decision-making. Additionally, provide a brief rationale for each added constraint.

**Output:**
- The updated `declare_model` dictionary as valid Python code, with new bias-mitigating constraints inserted.
- A short explanation of how these added constraints reduce bias in the loan application process.
