Certainly! Below is a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, formulated as a Python dictionary according to the pm4py specifications:

```python
declare_model = {
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Requisition': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        }
    },
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Requisition': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Approve Purchase Requisition': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Create Purchase Order': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Send Purchase Order to Supplier': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Receive Goods': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Receive Invoice': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        'Process Payment': {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        }
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Create Purchase Requisition', 'Approve Purchase Requisition'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        ('Send Purchase Order to Supplier', 'Receive Goods'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        },
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Process Payment'): {
            'support': 1.0,
            'confidence': 1.0
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Activities:**
  - **Create Purchase Requisition**
  - **Approve Purchase Requisition**
  - **Create Purchase Order**
  - **Send Purchase Order to Supplier**
  - **Receive Goods**
  - **Receive Invoice**
  - **Process Payment**

- **'init' Constraint:**
  - The process starts with **'Create Purchase Requisition'**.

- **'existence' Constraints:**
  - Each activity must occur at least once in the process.

- **'succession' Constraints:**
  - **'Approve Purchase Requisition'** must occur after **'Create Purchase Requisition'**.
  - **'Create Purchase Order'** must occur after **'Approve Purchase Requisition'**.
  - **'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'** must occur after **'Create Purchase Order'**.
  - **'Receive Goods'** must occur after **'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'**.
  - **'Receive Invoice'** must occur after **'Receive Goods'**.
  - **'Process Payment'** must occur after **'Receive Invoice'**.

This DECLARE model ensures that the Purchase-to-Pay process follows the necessary sequence of activities, starting from the creation of a purchase requisition and culminating in the processing of the payment.
