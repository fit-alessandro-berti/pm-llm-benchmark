The Log Skeleton process model describes a complex approval workflow for a declaration process. Here's a high-level description of the process based on the provided constraints:

### Initial Submission
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - This activity marks the beginning of the process. The employee submits the declaration.

### Approval Flow
2. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION**
   - The declaration is initially reviewed by the administration.

3. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**
   - The declaration is then reviewed by the supervisor.

4. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER**
   - Finally, the pre-approver reviews the declaration.

### Approval Outcomes
5. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**
   - The declaration is approved by the administration.

6. **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**
   - The declaration is approved by the budget owner.

7. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**
   - The declaration is approved by the pre-approver.

8. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
   - The declaration is officially approved by the supervisor.

### Rejection Outcomes
9. **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**
   - The declaration is rejected by the administration.

10. **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**
    - The declaration is rejected by the supervisor.

11. **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**
    - The declaration is rejected by the budget owner.

12. **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**
    - The declaration is rejected by the pre-approver.

13. **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
    - The declaration is rejected by the employee.

### Handling Payment Requests
14. **Request Payment**
    - If the declaration is approved, a payment request is made.

15. **Payment Handled**
    - The payment is handled.

### Never Together Constraints
- Specific activities cannot co-exist within the same case, as specified in the "Never Together" constraints:
  - For example, a declaration cannot be both saved and rejected by the employee in the same case.

### Directly-Follows Constraints
- The "Directly-Follows" constraints indicate the immediate sequence of activities:
  - For example, if the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" is initiated, the "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" must follow.

### Activity Occurrences
- The "Activity Occurrences" constraints specify the number of times an activity can occur:
  - For example, the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" can have between 0 and 7 occurrences, while the "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" can have between 0 and 6 occurrences.

### Summary
The process involves a series of approvals by different roles (administration, supervisor, pre-approver, and budget owner) and potential rejections at any point in the process. The workflow ensures that each role performs its task in a specific order, and certain activities must follow a direct sequence. The process also includes handling payment requests and includes constraints to prevent certain activities from occurring simultaneously.
