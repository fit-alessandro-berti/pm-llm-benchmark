To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between pairs of activities for each process variant. Since we don't have the actual times between activities, we'll assume the performance values provided are the total times for each process variant. We'll need to estimate the times between activities based on these total times.

Here's a step-by-step approach to generate the temporal profile:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs**: For each process variant, identify all pairs of activities.
2. **Estimate Times Between Activities**: Assume that the total performance time for a variant is evenly distributed among the activities. This is a simplification, but it allows us to estimate the times between activities.
3. **Calculate Average and Standard Deviation**: For each pair of activities, calculate the average and standard deviation of the estimated times.

Let's start by extracting the activity pairs and estimating the times between activities.

### Step 1: Extract Activity Pairs

For each process variant, we'll extract all possible pairs of activities. For example, for the variant `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection`, the pairs are:
- (Create Fine, Send Fine)
- (Create Fine, Insert Fine Notification)
- (Create Fine, Add penalty)
- (Create Fine, Send for Credit Collection)
- (Send Fine, Insert Fine Notification)
- (Send Fine, Add penalty)
- (Send Fine, Send for Credit Collection)
- (Insert Fine Notification, Add penalty)
- (Insert Fine Notification, Send for Credit Collection)
- (Add penalty, Send for Credit Collection)

### Step 2: Estimate Times Between Activities

We'll assume the total performance time for each variant is evenly distributed among the activities. For example, if a variant has 5 activities and a total performance time of 59591524.946, the estimated time between each pair of activities is 59591524.946 / 5.

### Step 3: Calculate Average and Standard Deviation

For each pair of activities, we'll collect the estimated times from all variants and calculate the average and standard deviation.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Process variants with their frequencies and performances
variants = [
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection", 56482, 59591524.946),
