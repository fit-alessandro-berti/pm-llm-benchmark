The data you've provided outlines a workflow process for handling declarations or requests, likely within an organizational context such as expense claims or project approvals. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process based on the flows:

### Process Flow Description:

1. **Initiation by Employee:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: Employees initiate the process by submitting a declaration. This can lead to several paths:
     - **Direct Approval**: The declaration might go directly for final approval by a supervisor or pre-approver (less frequent paths).
     - **Rejection**: The declaration can be rejected at various stages (by administration, pre-approver, supervisor, etc.), leading back to the employee for resubmission or correction.

2. **Intermediate Approvals:**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: After submission, some declarations are first reviewed by an administrative entity. From here:
     - They can be forwarded to **SUPERVISOR** for final approval or 
     - **BUDGET OWNER** for additional approval before reaching the supervisor.
     - There's also a possibility of rejection by administration, which sends the declaration back to the employee.

3. **Budget Owner Involvement:**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: For declarations requiring budget verification, they are sent to a budget owner before going to the supervisor. This step ensures financial feasibility before final approval.

4. **Supervisor Approval:**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: This is a critical juncture where most declarations converge for a final decision:
     - **Approval**: Leads to payment requests or handling.
     - **Rejection**: Can lead back to the employee or get lost in the system (marked as "MISSING").

5. **Payment Process:**
   - **Request Payment**: After final approval, there's a step to request payment, which then moves to:
     - **Payment Handled**: The actual processing of payment. Occasionally, issues might lead to rejection by "MISSING" or even back to the employee.

6. **Rejections and Corrections:**
   - Rejections can occur at any approval stage, typically sending the declaration back for correction or resubmission by the employee. Each rejection step includes feedback loops back to the employee or other stages.

7. **Unusual Paths:**
   - There are less frequent or unusual paths like:
     - Declarations being saved without immediate action.
     - Declarations moving to different approval stages without a clear logical sequence (like going to pre-approver after administration approval).

### Observations:

- **Performance Metrics**: Each step has associated performance metrics (frequency and time), suggesting an analysis of process efficiency or bottlenecks. High performance numbers could indicate delays or inefficiencies in certain steps.
  
- **Frequency**: The frequency indicates how often each path is taken, with some paths being much less common, which might suggest exceptions or less typical scenarios in the workflow.

- **Rejection Cycles**: The frequent rejections and the need for resubmission indicate a robust review process, potentially aiming to reduce errors or unauthorized expenses.

- **Complex Flow**: The process shows a complex approval hierarchy with multiple checks and balances, which might be designed to ensure accuracy, compliance, and proper authorization in financial transactions or policy adherence.

This process reflects a structured approach to managing declarations or approvals, with multiple layers of oversight to ensure proper handling of organizational resources. However, the complexity could also point towards potential areas for streamlining or automating to improve efficiency.
