Here are 20 questions related to the process with proposed confidence scores based on the data provided:

1. What is the average frequency of all Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE variants? (Confidence: High, Score: 0.9)
2. Which variant has the highest performance score? (Confidence: Medium-High, Score: 0.8)
3. How many times was Payment Handled executed in total? (Confidence: Medium, Score: 0.7)
4. What is the average performance of all Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION variants? (Confidence: Medium, Score: 0.6)
5. Which department has the highest frequency for DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE variant? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.5)
6. Is the frequency of Payment Handled higher than that of Request Payment? (Confidence: High, Score: 1.0)
7. How many times was DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION executed? (Confidence: Medium-Low, Score: 0.4)
8. Which variant has the lowest performance score? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.3)
9. What is the average frequency of all DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR variants? (Confidence: Medium-High, Score: 0.85)
10. How many times was REQUEST PAYMENT executed in total? (Confidence: Medium, Score: 0.7)
11. Which department has the lowest performance score for DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION variant? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.4)
12. Is the frequency of DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE higher than that of DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION? (Confidence: High, Score: 1.0)
13. What is the average performance of all DECLARATION REJECTED by SUPERVISOR variants? (Confidence: Medium-Low, Score: 0.4)
14. How many times was DECLARATION APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER executed? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.5)
15. Which variant has the highest frequency of EXECUTION by MISSING? (Confidence: Medium-Low, Score: 0.3)
16. Is the average performance of all DECLARATION REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER variants higher than that of DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.4)
17. How many times was DECLARATION SAVED executed? (Confidence: Medium-Low, Score: 0.3)
18. Which department has the highest frequency for DECLARATION REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER variant? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.5)
19. Is the frequency of DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION higher than that of DECLARATION REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER? (Confidence: High, Score: 1.0)
20. What is the average performance of all DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR variants with EXECUTION by MISSING? (Confidence: Low-Medium, Score: 0.4)

Note that these confidence scores are subjective and based on my analysis of the data provided. They should be used as a rough guide only.

Some observations:

* The most frequent variant is DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE with a frequency of 4618.
* The fastest process variants have high performance scores (e.g., DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, DECLARATION APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER).
* The slowest process variants often involve multiple rejections and executions, which can lead to low performance scores (e.g., DECLARATION REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, DECLARATION REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER).
* Some departments have higher frequencies for certain variants, but their performance scores are not consistently high.
* EXECUTION by MISSING is a rare event, but its presence in some variants indicates that the process may be prone to delays or errors.
