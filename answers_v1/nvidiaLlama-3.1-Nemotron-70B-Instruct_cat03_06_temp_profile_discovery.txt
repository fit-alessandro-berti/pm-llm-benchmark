Generating a comprehensive temporal profile from the provided process variants involves several steps, including identifying unique activity pairs, calculating the average time (AVG) between these pairs, and determining the standard deviation (STDEV) for each pair. However, given the complexity and the detailed nature of the data (performance times are provided but not explicitly dated or timestamped for each step within a variant), we'll outline a conceptual approach to build a simplified temporal profile. We'll also provide a basic Python implementation to get you started, focusing on calculating AVG for each activity pair, assuming you have access to detailed timestamp data for each activity within each process execution (which isn't directly provided in your question).

### Step 1: Identify Unique Activity Pairs
- From the variants, extract all unique pairs of consecutive activities. For simplicity, we'll consider direct successors in the variants listed.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Time (AVG) for Each Pair
- **Theoretical Approach**: Calculate the average time between each pair of activities. This requires detailed timestamp data for each activity across all process executions, which you'd need to have or generate based on the provided performance data (e.g., dividing performance time by frequency to infer average durations and then using these to estimate times between activities).

### Step 3: Calculate Standard Deviation (STDEV) for Each Pair
- Similarly, **theoretical**: Once you have the specific timestamps or inferred durations for each activity pair across executions, you can calculate the standard deviation for each pair.

### Simplified Python Implementation (Hypothetical Timestamp Data)
Assuming you have a dictionary `execution_data` where each key is a process variant and the value is another dictionary with activity names as keys and lists of timestamps (in seconds, for simplicity) as values:

```python
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical Data Structure (You need to populate this based on your actual data)
execution_data = {
    'Create Fine -> Send Fine ->...': {
        'Create Fine': [1643723400, 1643723405,...],  # List of timestamps for each execution
        'Send Fine': [1643723410, 1643723415,...],
        #...
    },
    #...
}

def calculate_temporal_profile(execution_data):
    temporal_profile = {}
    
    for variant, activities in execution_data.items():
        activity_pairs = list(zip(activities.keys(), list(activities.keys())[1:]))
        
        for pair in activity_pairs:
            pair_times = []
            for execution in zip(*[activities[pair[0]], activities[pair[1]]]):
                pair_times.append(execution[1] - execution[0])  # Calculate time difference
                
            avg = np.mean(pair_times)
            stdev = np.std(pair_times)
            
            temporal_profile[pair] = (avg, stdev)
    
    return temporal_profile

# Example Usage
temporal_profile = calculate_temporal_profile(execution_data)
for pair, (avg, stdev) in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"Pair: {pair}, AVG: {avg}, STDEV: {stdev}")
```

### Note:
- This implementation **assumes** access to detailed timestamp data for each activity within each process execution, which you'd need to integrate or generate based on the `performance` and `frequency` data provided.
- To fully populate `execution_data` and accurately calculate AVG and STDEV, you would need to either have or simulate detailed timestamp information for each activity across all executions.

Given the performance data, to estimate the time between activities for calculation purposes, you might consider dividing the performance time by the frequency for each variant and then use these estimates to simulate or calculate the AVG and STDEV. However, this approach would be an approximation and might not fully align with the actual temporal behavior of your process.
