Based on the process variants provided, there are several notable differences between the treatment of individuals from the protected group and the unprotected group:

1. **Frequency of Discharges:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of discharges (284/286 for Registered at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment and 284/309 for Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment) compared to the unprotected group (158/174 and 158/156, respectively).

2. **Frequency of Treatment Unsuccessful Attempts:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of treatment unsuccessful attempts (653/29 for Registered at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment and 604/65 for Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment) compared to the unprotected group (652/587, respectively).

3. **Thorough Examination Frequency:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of individuals undergoing Thorough Examinations (1466/190 for Registered at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis and 1418/156 for Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis) compared to the unprotected group (1426/174, respectively).

4. **Diagnostic Frequency:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of individuals undergoing Thorough Examinations with Diagnostic procedures performed (130/145 for Registered at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis and 139/155 for Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis) compared to the unprotected group (125/172, respectively).

5. **Treatment Successful Rate:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of individuals undergoing Treatment that is successful (260009.675/41 for Registered at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis and 260001.864/30 for Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis) compared to the unprotected group (239992.083/32, respectively).

6. **Discharge Frequency:**

   - The protected group has a higher frequency of individuals discharging after successful Treatment (251/72 for Registered at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis and 248/70 for Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis) compared to the unprotected group (236/81, respectively).

Overall, these differences suggest that there may be factors contributing to a higher incidence of unsuccessful Treatment attempts among individuals from the unprotected group. Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to identify the underlying causes and implement appropriate interventions to address these disparities.
