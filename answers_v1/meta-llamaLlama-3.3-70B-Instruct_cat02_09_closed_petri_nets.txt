Here are the opposite concepts, more general concepts, and explanations for each of the given concepts in the field of Petri nets:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place** - a place that has no outgoing arcs, i.e., it is a place where tokens can only be consumed and not produced.
	* More general concept: **Place** - a place is a fundamental element in a Petri net that can hold tokens, and it can be either a source, sink, or an intermediate place.
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Timed Transition** - a transition that takes time to fire, i.e., it has a delay or a time interval associated with it.
	* More general concept: **Transition** - a transition is a fundamental element in a Petri net that represents an activity or an event, and it can be either immediate, timed, or have other properties like stochastic or deterministic timing.
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition** - a transition that can never fire, i.e., it is not live and will never be enabled.
	* More general concept: **Transition with Liveness Properties** - this concept encompasses various liveness properties of transitions, including liveliness, deadlock-freeness, and persistency.
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net** - a net where the number of tokens in at least one place can grow indefinitely, i.e., the net is not bounded.
	* More general concept: **Net with Boundedness Properties** - this concept includes various boundedness properties, such as safety, boundedness, and liveness, which describe the behavior of tokens in a net.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflict Net** - a net where two or more transitions share a common input place, and the firing of one transition prevents the firing of the other, i.e., there is a conflict.
	* More general concept: **Net with Conflict Resolution** - this concept encompasses various types of nets with conflict resolution mechanisms, including free choice, asymmetric choice, and symmetric choice nets, which describe how conflicts between transitions are resolved.

These opposite and more general concepts provide a deeper understanding of the original concepts and highlight the relationships between different properties and behaviors in Petri nets.
