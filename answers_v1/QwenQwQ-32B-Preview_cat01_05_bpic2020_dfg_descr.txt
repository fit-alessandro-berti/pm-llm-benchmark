Based on the provided data, it appears that the process revolves around the submission and approval of declarations, leading to payment requests and handling. Here's an attempt to describe the process based on the flow:

1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
   - This can lead to several paths:
     - Approval by Administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION).
     - Approval by Budget Owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER).
     - Approval by Pre-Approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER).
     - Direct final approval by Supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
     - Rejection by Administration (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION).
     - Rejection by Pre-Approver (Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER).
     - Rejection by Supervisor (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR).
     - Rejection by Employee (Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE).
     - Saved status by Employee (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE).

2. **Approval Paths:**
   - After submission, the declaration can be approved by different roles:
     - Administration: If approved, it can then be approved by the Budget Owner or directly by the Supervisor.
     - Budget Owner: If approved, it goes to the Supervisor for final approval.
     - Pre-Approver: If approved, it goes to the Supervisor for final approval.
   - Each approval step has associated frequencies and performance metrics, indicating how often this path is taken and the time taken for approval.

3. **Rejection Paths:**
   - Rejections can occur at multiple stages:
     - Administration can reject the declaration, leading it back to the Employee.
     - Pre-Approver can reject, leading back to the Employee.
     - Supervisor can reject, leading back to the Employee.
     - Employee can also reject their own declaration.
   - Rejected declarations may be resubmitted or lead to further actions.

4. **Final Approval and Payment:**
   - Once the declaration is finally approved by the Supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR), a payment request is made (Request Payment).
   - The payment request is then handled (Payment Handled), completing the process.
   - There is also a direct path from submission to payment request, but it seems less frequent.

5. **Special Cases:**
   - Some transitions involve rejection by "MISSING," which seems to be a status or role that leads to further actions like resubmission or other rejections.
   - There are rare transitions like Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or ADMINISTRATION, which might be intermediate states before final approval or rejection.

6. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Each transition has a frequency and performance metric, likely indicating how often that path is taken and the average time taken for that transition.
   - High performance times might indicate bottlenecks in the process.

In summary, the process is a multi-stage approval workflow for declarations submitted by employees, involving approvals from various stakeholders like Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, and Supervisor, leading to payment requests and handling. The process includes multiple points for rejection and resubmission, with various statuses and transitions between them.
