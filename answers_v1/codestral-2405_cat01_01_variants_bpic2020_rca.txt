Based on the provided data, there are several variants in the Declaration process that are associated with performance issues. Here are some potential root causes, focusing on process and data specific considerations:

1. **Long Approval Chains**: Some variants involve multiple approvals before the final approval and payment handling. Long approval chains can lead to delays and performance issues. This is evident in variants like Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled.

2. **Rejection and Resubmission**: There are several variants where declarations are rejected and resubmitted multiple times. This can lead to unnecessary work and delays, potentially causing performance issues. For example, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled.

3. **Missing Information**: There are variants where declarations are rejected due to missing information. This can cause delays and additional work for the employees. For instance, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled.

4. **Rejections and Decline**: There are variants where declarations are rejected by approvers or budget owners. These rejections can lead to delays and additional work for the employees. For example, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE.

5. **Data Entry Errors**: There are some variants where declarations are saved but not submitted, which can lead to data entry errors and potential performance issues. For instance, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE.

These are specific considerations based on the provided data. To further investigate and confirm these root causes, you might want to analyze additional data or conduct more detailed investigations.
