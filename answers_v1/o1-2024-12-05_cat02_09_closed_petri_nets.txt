Below are each of the given Petri net concepts along with a plausible opposite concept and a more general concept that encompasses them:

1. **Source Place**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Sink Place* (a place that has no outgoing arcs to transitions, whereas a source place has no incoming arcs)  
   - **More General Concept:** *Place* (an element of a Petri net that may have incoming and/or outgoing arcs, with source and sink places being special cases)

2. **Immediate Transition**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Timed (or Delayed) Transition* (a transition whose firing is associated with some positive delay, as opposed to an immediate transition which fires instantaneously)  
   - **More General Concept:** *Transition* (an event in the Petri net that changes the marking; both immediate and timed transitions are subtypes of transitions)

3. **Live Transition**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Dead Transition* (a transition that can never fire again after some point in the net’s evolution, in contrast to a live transition which can potentially fire infinitely often)  
   - **More General Concept:** *Transition (with varying degrees of liveness)* (all transitions can be classified based on liveness properties; ‘live’ is just one such property)

4. **Bounded Net**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Unbounded Net* (a Petri net in which the number of tokens in at least one place can grow without limit, unlike a bounded net where every place has a maximum token capacity)  
   - **More General Concept:** *Petri Net* (the concept of boundedness is a property that may or may not hold; all bounded and unbounded nets are Petri nets)

5. **Free Choice Net**  
   - **Opposite Concept:** *Non-Free Choice (or Restricted Choice) Net* (a net in which the enabling of a certain transition depends on the choice of another, violating the free-choice property)  
   - **More General Concept:** *Place/Transition (P/T) Net* (free choice nets are a well-structured subclass of general Petri nets; all free choice nets are Petri nets, but not all Petri nets are free choice)
