The provided data outlines a process related to declarations (typically a form of request, such as for payment, reimbursement, or an expense claim) and the various possible outcomes that can occur as the request moves through a series of approvals and rejections. Here's an overview of the process based on the data:

### Process Overview

1. **Submission Phase**:
   - **Employee Initiation**: It begins when an *EMPLOYEE* submits a *Declaration*. This is the starting point where the employee puts forth their request, which may involve requesting payment.
   - **Submissions**: Declarations can be submitted multiple times, and responses can vary based on various approval stages.

2. **Approval Pathways**:
   - Once a *Declaration* is submitted, it can go through several approval stages:
     - It may be approved by the *ADMINISTRATION* or may need to go through a *PRE_APPROVER*. 
     - If approved, it can then be forwarded to final approval by a *SUPERVISOR*, resulting in a *FINAL_APPROVED* status, which allows for *Payment Handling*.

3. **Rejection Pathways**:
   - Declarations can face various rejections at different stages:
     - A *Declaration* might be rejected by *ADMINISTRATION*, *BUDGET OWNER*, or *SUPERVISOR*, often requiring the employee to resubmit or make adjustments based on feedback.
     - *REJECTED* declarations also lead to the possibility of being reevaluated and resubmitted, establishing a loop where employees address issues tagged by approvers.

4. **Handling Payments**:
   - Once a *Declaration* reaches the *FINAL_APPROVED* stage from the *SUPERVISOR*, it can proceed to *Payment Handled*. 
   - Payment handling indicates that the financial aspect of the declaration is processed, indicating a successful outcome.

5. **Issues with Missing Information**:
   - There are instances of declarations being rejected by a *MISSING* status, suggesting that there were issues related to the completeness or availability of supporting documentation or information.

6. **Final Approvals and Expert Review**:
   - The process also includes secondary levels of approval that might involve budget owners or additional supervisory checks which can result in further rejection or approval, highlighting a multi-tier review system.

7. **End of the Cycle**:
   - The process ends with either successful payment for approved declarations or further loops of resubmission in the case of rejections.

### Insights from Performance and Frequency Data

- **Performance Metrics**: Each transition between stages includes performance values, which suggest time or cost associated with that particular part of the process. 
- **Frequency of Occurrences**: The frequency shows how often each pathway is taken, revealing potential bottlenecks. For instance, stages with high rejection rates might indicate a need for better information at the submission phase.
- **Success vs. Failure Rates**: It’s important to note how often declarations make it to the payment phase versus the rejections at various stages, which can inform future process optimizations.

### Conclusion

Overall, the provided data illustrates a structured process for handling declarations with multiple checkpoints for validation and approval. The existence of various pathways for approval and rejection underscores a complex, iterative workflow that emphasizes accuracy and thorough review in handling declarations and financial requests. Analyzing the performance and frequency metrics can lead to actionable improvements to streamline the process and reduce unnecessary delays.
