Based on the data provided, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, using domain knowledge in the context of property management:

1. **Rejection Rates:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of 'Reject Prospective Tenant' variants (1036 + 793 + 484 + 366 = 2679) compared to the 'unprotected' group (2490 + 1022 + 674 + 365 = 4551).
   - The 'protected' group has more extensive screening processes (Extensive Screening, frequency = 793 + 366 + 29 + 23 + 18 + 16 + 14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 1060) compared to the 'unprotected' group (1022 + 63 + 88 + 84 + 63 + 56 + 45 = 1027).
   - The 'protected' group has higher performance (execution time) for most variants, especially for the extensive screening and rent payment processes (e.g., 540011.977 vs. 480013.530, 810021.897 vs. 719990.659).

2. **Cancellation Rates:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of 'Tenant Cancels Appartment' variants (29 + 23 + 18 + 16 + 14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 176) compared to the 'unprotected' group (268 + 223 + 156 + 128 + 108 + 103 + 88 + 84 + 63 + 56 + 52 + 45 = 1787).
   - The 'protected' group has a higher performance (execution time) for 'Tenant Cancels Appartment' variants (810021.897 vs. 640003.769, 990053.913 vs. 719990.659, 1080116.500 vs. 800009.840, etc.).

3. **Eviction Rates:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of 'Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant' (6) compared to the 'unprotected' group (0), indicating that evictions are less common but more time-consuming for the 'protected' group.

4. **Move-In Processes:**
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of 'Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent' and subsequent rent payments (29 + 23 + 18 + 16 + 14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 176) compared to the 'unprotected' group (268 + 223 + 156 + 128 + 108 + 103 + 88 + 84 + 63 + 56 + 52 + 45 = 1787).

In summary, the 'protected' group faces more extensive screening, higher rejection rates, and more time-consuming processes, while the 'unprotected' group faces more frequent cancellations and evictions. However, the 'unprotected' group also experiences more frequent move-ins and rent payments.
