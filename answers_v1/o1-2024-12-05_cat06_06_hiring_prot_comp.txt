When comparing the process variants of the protected group against those of the unprotected group, several key differences emerge. These differences can be understood in terms of the complexity of the care pathways, the frequency of certain process variants, and the range of performance times associated with similar treatment patterns.

**1. Differences in Overall Complexity and Variety of Paths**  
- **Protected group**:  
  - The protected group shows a wider variety of shorter and more direct process variants. For example, there are variants that end prematurely right after registration, such as:
    - *Register at ER (no further steps, freq = 158, performance = 0)*  
    - *Register at FD (no further steps, freq = 156, performance = 0)*  
  These truncated sequences suggest that some patients in the protected group either dropped out early, were immediately deferred, or were recorded in a preliminary manner without subsequent follow-up steps.
  
- **Unprotected group**:  
  - The unprotected group is dominated by more complex, fully realized sequences. It is rare to find a variant that terminates immediately after registration without further healthcare interactions. Instead, even very simple variants in the unprotected group often contain at least some form of diagnosis or treatment step.
  - There is also a unique minimal variant present for the unprotected group:  
    - *Discharge only (freq = 505, performance = 0)*  
    This indicates a scenario where patients might have been recorded late in the process or transferred in from another process, resulting in a standalone "Discharge" event.

**2. Frequency and Scale of Similar Process Variants**  
- **Protected group**:  
  The protected group’s frequencies for each process variant tend to be in the double or low triple digits. Even common and standard treatment paths (e.g., “Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge”) have relatively modest frequencies (e.g., 269 occurrences).

- **Unprotected group**:  
  The unprotected group shows much higher frequencies for similar or equivalent variants. For example, the pathway “Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge” appears 1466 times. This higher scale may suggest that the unprotected group is larger in sample size or that the system routes more patients from the unprotected group through certain “full” care pathways involving multiple examination stages.

**3. Complexity of Repeated or Escalating Treatment Cycles**  
- Both groups have variants that include repeated unsuccessful treatments followed by re-diagnosis and further attempts until success. However, the unprotected group appears to have these complex, iterative pathways at higher frequencies. For instance:
  - Unprotected group has numerous high-frequency variants involving multiple rounds of thorough and expert examinations, as well as multiple unsuccessful treatments before eventually reaching a successful discharge. Some complex variants occur over 100 times for the unprotected group, compared to dozens or fewer for the protected group.
  
- The protected group also experiences these complex cycles, but less frequently and in fewer total cases. This may indicate that patients in the protected group are less commonly subjected to prolonged, iterative treatment cycles, or it could reflect underlying differences in case mixes or clinical decision-making patterns.

**4. Performance Times (Execution Times)**  
- When similar variants are compared directly, the performance (execution) times are often quite close between the two groups. For standard treatment paths (e.g., register -> examination -> diagnosis -> treatment -> discharge), the performance times are in the same ballpark—often around 260,000 to 320,000 time units for “successful” treatment pathways and around 420,000 to 480,000 for sequences involving unsuccessful attempts.
- The presence of zero-performance variants in the protected group (e.g., registering without any follow-up) is unique. In contrast, the unprotected group’s minimal variant (discharge only) also has zero performance, but it is a discharge event rather than a registration event.

**5. Use of Specific Steps (Expert/Thorough Examination)**  
- Both groups undergo “Expert Examination” and “Thorough Examination” steps in complex scenarios. The difference is in frequency and possibly the decision-making logic:
  - The unprotected group tends to have more patients going through the extended “Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination” sequences, suggesting that more complex investigative procedures are the norm rather than the exception.
  - In the protected group, while these extended sequences exist, there are more alternative pathways that involve fewer steps or earlier termination. This implies potentially different triage criteria, threshold for specialist referrals, or different underlying conditions being managed.

**Summary of the Main Differences**:
1. **Process Completion vs. Early Termination:**  
   The protected group shows early termination or incomplete sequences (just registration), while the unprotected group more commonly progresses through at least some formal steps before discharge.

2. **Frequency and Scale:**  
   The unprotected group’s variants occur at substantially higher frequencies, indicating either a larger patient population or different procedural norms.

3. **Complexity and Iterative Treatments:**  
   The unprotected group more frequently navigates prolonged, multi-step, and multi-attempt treatment sequences, whereas the protected group has these but at lower frequencies.

4. **Performance Times Largely Comparable:**  
   For equivalent pathways, performance times are similar, suggesting that once a treatment pattern is chosen, both groups experience roughly the same processing speed. The main difference is the distribution and frequency of each pattern.

In essence, the protected group’s process map reveals more early dropouts or simplified paths, whereas the unprotected group’s map shows a higher incidence of fully realized, complex, and iterative treatment routes—both successful and unsuccessful—at much greater scale.
