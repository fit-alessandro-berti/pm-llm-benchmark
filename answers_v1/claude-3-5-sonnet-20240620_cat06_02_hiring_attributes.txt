Based on the attributes provided, the following are potentially sensitive for fairness in a job application process:

1. case:citizen - This attribute indicates citizenship status, which could lead to discrimination based on national origin.

2. case:gender - Gender information can result in gender-based discrimination.

3. case:german speaking - Language ability, especially tied to a specific nationality, could lead to discrimination based on national origin or ethnicity.

4. case:religious - Religious information is highly sensitive and could lead to religious discrimination.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they relate to protected characteristics that are often the basis for unfair discrimination in hiring processes. Using these attributes to make hiring decisions could potentially violate equal employment opportunity laws in many jurisdictions.

The other attributes like activity, concept:name, resource, and various timestamp fields appear to be process-related and less likely to directly cause fairness issues. However, it's important to note that even seemingly neutral attributes could indirectly lead to biased outcomes if they correlate strongly with protected characteristics.

It's crucial for organizations to carefully consider how they use this information in their hiring process to ensure fair treatment of all applicants and compliance with anti-discrimination laws.
