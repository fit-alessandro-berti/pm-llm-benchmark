To identify potentially unfair differences in the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups based on the provided process variants and their execution times, we can analyze the following aspects:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
   - The unprotected group has higher frequencies in certain process variants, particularly:
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 2490) 
     - "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (frequency = 1022).
   - In contrast, the best-performing process variants for the protected group tend to have lower frequencies, suggesting that they might follow a less common path.

### 2. **Performance Times:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - The protected group tends to have much longer execution times for certain variants, particularly those involving extensive screening and signing contracts with multiple pay rent actions. For instance, "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening..." has various execution times exceeding 1 million milliseconds (e.g., 1,285,999.929).
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The unprotected group's processes, particularly those leading to rejection, show more consistent and markedly lower execution times (e.g., less than 500,000 milliseconds for the most frequent rejection variants).

### 3. **Process Complexity:**
   - The protected group's process variants appear to involve more steps, which can introduce delays. Examples like extensive documentation (e.g., "Hand In The Paperwork" and multiple screenings) may prolong their journey when compared to the unprotected group's simpler rejection processes. Variants in the unprotected group often lead to rejection with fewer steps involved.
   
### 4. **Outcome Distribution:**
   - The protected group has multiple variants that lead to outcomes involving contract signing and moving in, but they also show many rejection variants. This suggests a higher initial investment of time and resources (in terms of screening and paperwork) that may result in similar rejections as those in the unprotected group, leading to potential inefficiencies or qualitative differences in how both groups are assessed.

### Summary:
- **Differences in Frequency:** The unprotected group tends to have a larger volume of applications with faster rejection rates, suggesting possibly more streamlined processing or less stringent screening.
- **Differences in Execution Time:** The protected group experiences longer processing times, possibly indicating a more complex or cumbersome screening process.
- **Complexity and Steps Involved:** The protected group involves additional steps that could be seen as unjustifiably complex compared to the streamlined processes available to the unprotected group.
  
### Conclusion:
The differences observed may suggest that the protected group is subjected to a more rigorous, lengthy, and complex process that ultimately leads to similar outcomes as those in the unprotected group but with significantly more investment of time and resources. These disparities may warrant a review to ensure equitable treatment across both groups.
