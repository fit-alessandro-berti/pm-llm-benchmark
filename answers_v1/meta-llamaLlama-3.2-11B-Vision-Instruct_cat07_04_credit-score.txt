The provided visualization is a flowchart that illustrates the process of credit scoring. The flowchart is divided into two sections: the top section represents the credit scoring process, while the bottom section represents the scoring service.

**Top Section: Credit Scoring Process**

The top section of the flowchart begins with the input of a request for credit score information. The request is then processed through a series of steps, including:

1. Request credit score
2. Delay in receiving the credit score
3. Report delay
4. Send credit score
5. Credit score received

If the credit score is received, the process proceeds to the next step, which is to send the credit score. If the credit score is not received, the process reports a delay and waits for further instructions.

**Bottom Section: Scoring Service**

The bottom section of the flowchart represents the scoring service, which is responsible for computing the credit score. The scoring service receives the request for credit score information and processes it through a series of steps, including:

1. Compute credit score (level 1)
2. Check if the score is available
3. Report delay
4. Compute credit score (level 2)
5. Send credit score

If the credit score is computed successfully, the scoring service sends the credit score back to the credit scoring process. If the credit score is not computed, the scoring service reports a delay and waits for further instructions.

**Key Components**

The flowchart includes several key components, including:

* **Credit Scoring Process**: This is the top section of the flowchart, which represents the credit scoring process.
* **Scoring Service**: This is the bottom section of the flowchart, which represents the scoring service.
* **Request Credit Score**: This is the input step that initiates the credit scoring process.
* **Compute Credit Score**: This is the step that computes the credit score.
* **Send Credit Score**: This is the step that sends the credit score back to the credit scoring process.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the provided visualization is a flowchart that illustrates the process of credit scoring. The flowchart is divided into two sections: the top section represents the credit scoring process, while the bottom section represents the scoring service. The flowchart includes several key components, including the request credit score, compute credit score, and send credit score steps. Overall, the flowchart provides a clear and concise overview of the credit scoring process.
