Event abstraction is a technique used in process mining and process discovery to replace low-level, granular events in an event log with more conceptually meaningful, higher-level activities before constructing a process model. By doing so, the model’s complexity is substantially reduced, resulting in improved readability and easier management. Below are several ways this can be effectively utilized:

1. **Grouping Low-Level Events into Conceptual Activities:**  
   Real-world processes often generate extremely detailed event logs. These logs might contain fine-grained steps such as “Enter data in field A,” “Select option B,” or “Click Confirm Button,” which are collectively part of a single logical task like “Submit Order.” By abstracting these multiple, low-level events into a single higher-level activity (e.g., “Order Submission”), the model no longer emphasizes micro-level operations. This abstraction helps stakeholders focus on the business logic rather than technical details.

2. **Leveraging Domain Knowledge for Abstraction Rules:**  
   The most meaningful abstractions come from individuals who understand the domain. Subject matter experts can define grouping rules such as:  
   - **Time-based rules:** Group all consecutive events occurring within a short time frame under a single conceptual activity.  
   - **Pattern-based rules:** Identify recurring low-level patterns that represent a single, coherent business action.  
   - **Resource-based rules:** Combine events performed by the same resource in a sequence that leads to a known business outcome.

   By incorporating domain-specific logic, the abstracted model better aligns with the terminology and goals of the business, making it more interpretable.

3. **Hierarchical Abstraction Layers:**  
   Instead of a single level of abstraction, multiple levels can be introduced. At the lowest level, events remain as they are. The next level might aggregate low-level events into small conceptual tasks, and a top-level layer might aggregate those tasks into major process phases. This hierarchical structure offers flexibility: analysts can “zoom in” to understand details when needed, or “zoom out” for a high-level overview. Such a layered approach ensures that complexity can be dialed up or down depending on the purpose of the analysis.

4. **Reducing Model Complexity and Cognitive Load:**  
   Without abstraction, process models derived from large event logs often become “spaghetti-like,” with numerous arcs and nodes that are hard to follow. Event abstraction simplifies the structure, allowing fewer but more meaningful nodes and reducing the number of interconnections. A simplified model is more approachable, making it easier for stakeholders—managers, process owners, auditors—to comprehend and act upon the insights derived from it.

5. **Enhanced Maintainability and Update Efficiency:**  
   Abstracted models are typically more stable over time. While low-level system events might change frequently (e.g., interface modifications that split a single action into multiple sub-events), the overarching conceptual activities remain relatively constant. This makes maintaining and updating process models easier, as modifications to the underlying IT systems do not require a complete reconstruction of the conceptual layers.

6. **Improved Analysis Techniques (Conformance, Performance):**  
   With a more abstracted process model, it becomes simpler to conduct conformance checking—comparing the discovered model to a prescribed reference model. Likewise, performance analysis (e.g., identifying bottlenecks) is clearer when looking at major activities rather than tangled webs of micro-events. Analysts can quickly highlight where delays occur and how to streamline the process, as the model gives them a cleaner lens through which to spot issues.

7. **Integration with Other Process Improvement Tools:**  
   Abstracted models integrate more naturally with other business process management (BPM) and workflow analysis tools. High-level activities map more directly to decision points or KPI measurements, facilitating the embedding of models into continuous improvement efforts.

**In essence, event abstraction acts like a conceptual “filter” that transforms dense, technical event data into a clear, business-oriented narrative. By applying event abstraction before modeling, analysts and decision-makers benefit from significantly improved readability, better maintainability, and a more manageable level of complexity, enabling them to derive actionable insights without getting lost in the granular details of system-level events.**
