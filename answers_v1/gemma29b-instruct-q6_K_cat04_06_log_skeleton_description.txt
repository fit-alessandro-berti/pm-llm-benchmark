The process described by this data appears to be an approval workflow for a request, likely for payment or some other resource. 

Here's a breakdown based on the provided constraints:

**Key Activities:**

* **Submission:**  The process begins with a "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activity.
* **Approvals:**  There are multiple approval stages involving different roles:
    * **Administration:** "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION"
    * **Supervisor:** "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR"
    * **Pre-approver:** "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER"
    * **Budget Owner:** "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER"

* **Rejections:**  At various stages, there are possibilities for rejection:
    * **Missing Information:** "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING"
    * **Administration:** "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION"
    * **Pre-approver:** "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER"
    * **Supervisor:** "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR"
    * **Budget Owner:** "Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER"
    * **Employee:** "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" 

* **Final Approval:** The process culminates in "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".

* **Payment:** A "Request Payment" activity is triggered after certain approvals, potentially leading to "Payment Handled".

**Constraints:**

* **Equivalence:** Some activities always occur together (e.g., "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" and "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION").
* **Always Before/After:**  Specifies the order of activities (e.g., "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" must occur before "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING").
* **Never Together:**  Indicates activities that cannot happen simultaneously (e.g., "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" and "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" cannot coexist).
* **Activity Occurrences:** Limits the number of times each activity can occur in a case.
* **Directly-Follows:** Defines immediate sequencing of activities (e.g., "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" directly follows "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING").


**Process Description:**

The process begins with an employee submitting a request. This triggers a chain of approvals involving different stakeholders: Administration, Supervisor, Pre-approver, and Budget Owner. At each stage, there is a possibility for rejection, leading to different pathways within the workflow.

If all approvals are granted, the request is finally approved by the Supervisor, potentially leading to a payment request and subsequent processing.

**Note:** Without a visual representation or more context about the specific domain, this description is based on inferences drawn from the provided constraints.
