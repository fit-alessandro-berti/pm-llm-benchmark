 From the provided data, it appears that there are several key differences in the process variants for the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Number of steps**: The processes for the protected group generally have more steps compared to those for the unprotected group. This could indicate a more rigorous or comprehensive screening and approval process for the protected group.

2. **Types of steps**: The protected group's process variants include additional steps such as extensive screening, signing contracts, moving in, paying rent, and tenant cancellation, which are not present in the unprotected group's process variants. This suggests that once approved, tenants in the protected group may have a more secure and long-term lease agreement, with regular rent payments and potential for lease termination.

3. **Frequency of rejection**: The protected group has fewer instances of 'Reject Prospective Tenant' steps compared to the unprotected group. This might indicate that it is harder for individuals in the protected group to be rejected during the screening process. However, more context is needed to fully understand the reasons behind this difference.

4. **Performance**: The performance (execution time) of the processes for the protected group tends to be higher than those for the unprotected group, especially in cases where tenants do not cancel their apartment. This could be due to the additional steps involved or longer waiting times during the screening and approval process.

5. **Termination**: There are several process variants in the protected group that involve a tenant cancelling their apartment after multiple rent payments. This suggests that tenants in the protected group may have more flexibility or protection regarding lease termination compared to those in the unprotected group.

These differences could indicate that the protected group is subject to more stringent and protective lease terms, possibly due to legal requirements or protections for the group members. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis and understand the underlying causes of these observed differences.
