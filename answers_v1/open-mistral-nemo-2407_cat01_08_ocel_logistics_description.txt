Based on the provided directly follows graph for each object type, here's a description of the underlying process:

1. **Customer Places Order**
   - A customer places an order (object type: customers, "place order").
   - The order is confirmed by the customer or an employee (object type: orders, "confirm order").

2. **Order Processing**
   - Once the order is confirmed, an employee picks the items from the inventory (object type: items, "pick item").
   - If an item is out of stock, it's reordered (object type: items, "item out of stock" -> "reorder item").
   - The picked items are then used to create a package (object type: items, "pick item" -> "create package").
   - The created package is sent (object type: packages, "create package" -> "send package").

3. **Package Delivery**
   - The sent package is delivered (object type: packages, "send package" -> "package delivered").
   - Upon delivery, the customer is reminded to pay for the order (object type: items, "package delivered" -> "payment reminder").
   - The customer pays for the order (object type: orders, "pay order").

4. **Order Completion**
   - After the payment is received, the order is marked as complete (object type: orders, "pay order").
   - If the customer hasn't paid for the order, payment reminders are sent until the order is paid (object type: items, "package delivered" -> "payment reminder").

5. **Employee Activities**
   - Employees can also place orders (object type: employees, "pick item" -> "place order").
   - They can confirm orders (object type: employees, "pick item" -> "confirm order").
   - Employees can also handle out-of-stock items by reordering them (object type: employees, "pick item" -> "item out of stock" -> "reorder item").

6. **Product Activities**
   - Products can be picked (object type: products, "pick item"), confirming orders (object type: products, "confirm order"), or creating packages (object type: products, "create package").
   - Products can also be paid for (object type: products, "pay order").

Here's a simplified process flow:

Customer  Place Order  Confirm Order  Pick Item  Create Package  Send Package  Package Delivered  Pay Order  Order Complete

This process represents a typical order fulfillment process in an e-commerce or retail setting, with additional details on employee and product activities.
