The provided visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** diagram representing a decision-making process, likely involving a request evaluation system. Here's a detailed explanation of the flow:

1. **Starting Point**: 
   - The process starts with a single circular event labeled "Start."

2. **Register Request**:
   - A task is performed to **"register request"**, as shown by a rectangular shape.

3. **Decision Gate (XOR Gateway)**:
   - The process branches into two exclusive paths, marked by an "X" symbol (exclusive gateway). Two options arise:
     - Proceed with an **"examine thoroughly"** step.
     - Proceed with an **"examine casually"** step.

4. **Check Ticket**:
   - If the **"examine thoroughly"** path is chosen, the task **"check ticket"** is included as part of the examination.

5. **Merge Point and Decision Making**:
   - The process merges back into a decision-making point after examinations.
   - A gateway likely determines whether the review is complete.

6. **Decide**:
   - A task labeled **"decide"** follows, where a final decision about the next course of action is made.

7. **Follow-up Choices**:
   - After decision-making, another XOR gateway directs the process into one of three paths:
     - **Reject the request**: The process ends here for rejection.
     - **Pay compensation**: The process also ends here for compensation payout.
     - **Reinitiate request**: The process loops back to the registration, beginning again.

8. **End**:
   - The process ends at a designated circular "End" event.

### Key Visual Elements:
- **Rectangles**: Represent process tasks or activities.
- **Diamonds (Gateways)**: Represent decision points or flow directions.
- **Arrows**: Show the flow of the process.
- **Circles**: Represent start and end events.

This diagram outlines a decision-making framework that systematically evaluates and processes a request.
