Based on the provided attributes, the following could be considered sensitive for fairness in the context of a rental process:

*   **`case:citizen`:** This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. This could lead to discrimination against non-citizens, who might face unfair treatment in the rental process.
*   **`case:gender`:** This attribute represents the gender of the applicant. It could be a source of discrimination, potentially leading to preferential treatment based on gender stereotypes.
*   **`case:german speaking`:** This indicates whether the applicant speaks German. This could lead to discrimination against those who don't speak German, potentially due to language barriers or cultural biases.
*   **`case:married`:** This attribute indicates the marital status of the applicant. Discrimination could occur based on assumptions or biases related to marital status.

**Rationale:**

These attributes are considered sensitive because they relate to personal characteristics that should ideally not influence the outcome of a rental application. Using these attributes to make decisions could lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, potentially violating equal opportunity principles.

**Other Considerations:**

While the `resource` attribute might not appear directly sensitive, it could indirectly reflect biases. For example, if certain real estate agents or landlords consistently reject applications from specific demographic groups, it could indicate underlying discriminatory practices. However, further analysis would be needed to establish such a connection.

It's important to note that the sensitivity of attributes can be context-dependent. What is considered sensitive in one domain might not be in another. In the context of a rental process, attributes related to personal identity and background are generally considered sensitive due to the potential for discrimination.
