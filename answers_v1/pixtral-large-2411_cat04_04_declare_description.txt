Based on the provided DECLARE constraints, the process underlying the data appears to be a structured workflow for handling declarations and payments. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The process starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE." This means an employee submits a declaration, initiating the process.

2. **Existence and Exactly 1 Constraints**:
   - The activities "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR," "Request Payment," "Payment Handled," and "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must each occur exactly once in the process.

3. **Responded Existence Constraints**:
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must also occur.
   - If "Payment Handled" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must also occur.
   - Similar constraints apply to other pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must co-occur within the process.

4. **Alternate Response Constraints**:
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must occur without repetitions.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must occur without repetitions.
   - Similar constraints apply to other pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must alternate without repetitions.

5. **Precedence and Chain Precedence Constraints**:
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must occur in the past.
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Request Payment" must occur in the past.
   - Similar constraints apply to other pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must precede others.
   - Chain precedence constraints ensure that "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" directly precedes "Request Payment," and "Request Payment" directly precedes "Payment Handled."

6. **Response and Chain Response Constraints**:
   - If "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must occur in the future.
   - If "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must occur in the future.
   - Similar constraints apply to other pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must follow others.
   - Chain response constraints ensure that "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" directly follows "Request Payment," and "Request Payment" directly follows "Payment Handled."

7. **Succession and Chain Succession Constraints**:
   - Both response and precedence constraints must be satisfied for certain pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must succeed others.
   - Chain succession constraints ensure that "Request Payment" directly follows "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR," and "Payment Handled" directly follows "Request Payment."

8. **Co-Existence Constraints**:
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must also occur.
   - If "Request Payment" occurs, then "Payment Handled" must also occur.
   - Similar constraints apply to other pairs of activities, ensuring that certain activities must co-occur within the process.

9. **Absence Constraints**:
   - Certain activities related to rejection or intermediate approval stages (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER," "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION") are absent from the process. This implies that the process does not involve rejection or intermediate approval steps.

### Summary of the Process:
1. **Start**: An employee submits a declaration.
2. **Approval**: The declaration is finally approved by a supervisor.
3. **Payment Request**: A request for payment is made.
4. **Payment Handling**: The payment is handled.

The process ensures that each step occurs exactly once, with specific ordering and co-existence constraints to maintain the flow and integrity of the workflow. The absence of rejection and intermediate approval activities suggests a streamlined process where declarations are either submitted and approved or not considered at all.
