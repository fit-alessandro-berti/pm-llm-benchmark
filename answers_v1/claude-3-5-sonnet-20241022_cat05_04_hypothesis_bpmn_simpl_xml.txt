Answer: Yes

3. How many steps are involved in the ultrasound probe preparation sequence? (95%)
Answer: 4 steps (configuration, gel in probe, cover probe, put sterile gel)

4. What are the three possible vessel identification methods shown in the parallel paths? (100%)
Answer: Doppler identification, Anatomic identification, and Compression identification

5. Does anesthetizing occur before or after vessel identification? (100%)
Answer: After vessel identification
