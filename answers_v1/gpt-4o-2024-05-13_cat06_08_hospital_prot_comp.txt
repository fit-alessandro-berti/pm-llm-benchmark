To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, let's evaluate both the frequency and performance (execution time) of the process variants. It is essential to focus on identifying potential disparities that could signal unfair treatment.

### Frequency Analysis
1. **High Frequency Variants**:
   - The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of certain complex process variants, such as "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge."
     - _Protected_: Highest frequency = 284
     - _Unprotected_: Highest frequency = 1466
   - The unprotected group has several high-frequency variants, indicating more standardized pathways, whereas the protected group shows more variability in frequencies across different variants.

2. **Absence of High Complexity Variants in Protected Group**:
   - The high complexity variants involving detailed expert and thorough examinations (along with multiple treatment attempts) appear more frequently in the unprotected group.
     - For example, variants like "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" have a frequency of 35-40 in unprotected but far less in the protected group.

3. **Zero Performance Variants**:
   - A noticeable portion of variants in the protected group involves registering but not progressing further, which might indicate cases where patients drop out or are dismissed early without receiving full treatment.
     - _Protected_: Register at ER (158), Register at FD (156)
     - _Unprotected_: No comparable zero-performance variants.

### Performance Analysis
1. **Overall Execution Times**:
   - Execution times for similar processes seem longer in the protected group:
     - Protected: "Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" = 320003.346
     - Unprotected: "Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" = 320005.695

2. **Complex Process Performance Differences**:
   - Variants involving more complex processes or additional steps (such as multiple treatments) generally show longer times in both groups, with relatively small differences, which might not immediately indicate unfairness based solely on performance times.

3. **Discharge Times**:
   - Several variants in the unprotected group have a performance time of zero, indicating some instances where patients are discharged immediately, without a comprehensive treatment path.
     - Unprotected: "Discharge" = 0.000 (frequency = 505)

### Notable Unfair Differences
1. **Access to Complex Treatments**:
   - The unprotected group seems to have greater access to complex variants involving thorough and expert examinations, suggesting that the protected group might face barriers to receiving these comprehensive treatments.

2. **Early Exits / Discharges**:
   - The protected group has a significant number of cases with zero performance time variants, which could indicate problems such as denied treatment, dropouts, or dismissals not seen in the unprotected group.

3. **Standardization and Frequency**:
   - The unprotected group has higher frequencies in fewer process variants, suggesting more standardized pathways, whereas the high variability in frequencies among the protected group might indicate inconsistencies in treatment pathways.

### Conclusion
The examination indicates potential unfairness primarily in three areas: access to complex treatments, early exits or discharges without treatment, and overall standardization of the treatment process. This analysis suggests the need to further investigate why the protected group experiences these differences and whether these differences result from systemic biases or other factors that require rectifying.
