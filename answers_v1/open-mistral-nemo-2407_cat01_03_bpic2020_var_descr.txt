Based on the provided data, the underlying process appears to be a declaration approval and payment process, involving multiple roles such as Employee, Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, and Supervisor. Here's a step-by-step description of the process, including variants and their frequencies:

1. **Declaration Submission** (frequency = 5752)
   - An employee submits a declaration.

2. **Initial Approval** (frequency = 4618 + 2473 + 1392 + 575 + 345 + 188 + 174 + 77 + 57 + 49 + 40 + 36 + 31 + 29 + 22 + 21 + 20 + 14 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 9197)
   - The submitted declaration is approved by either:
     - Administration (frequency = 4618 + 2473 + 1392 + 575 + 345 + 188 + 77 + 57 + 49 + 36 + 31 + 29 + 22 + 21 + 20 + 14 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 8457)
     - Pre-Approver (frequency = 1392 + 57 + 22 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 1525)
     - Supervisor (frequency = 40 + 21 = 61)

3. **Budget Owner Approval** (frequency = 2473 + 188 + 49 + 29 + 20 + 14 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 3206)
   - After initial approval, some declarations are sent to the Budget Owner for approval.

4. **Final Approval** (frequency = 4618 + 2473 + 1392 + 575 + 345 + 188 + 77 + 57 + 49 + 36 + 31 + 29 + 22 + 21 + 20 + 14 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 9197)
   - The approved declaration is then sent to the Supervisor for final approval.

5. **Payment Request** (frequency = 9197)
   - After final approval, a payment request is made.

6. **Payment Handling** (frequency = 9197)
   - The payment request is handled, presumably processed and paid.

7. **Declaration Rejection** (frequency = 174 + 345 + 188 + 77 + 57 + 40 + 36 + 31 + 22 + 21 + 14 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 1093)
   - Declarations can be rejected at various stages by Administration, Pre-Approver, or Supervisor, leading to re-submission or final rejection.

8. **Declaration Saving** (frequency = 134)
   - An employee can also save a declaration without submitting it.

The process variants represent different paths that a declaration can take, depending on the approvals and rejections it encounters. The frequencies indicate how often each variant occurs, and the performances are likely the total cost or time associated with each variant. The most frequent path is the direct approval and payment process (frequency = 4618), while the least frequent paths involve multiple rejections and re-submissions.
