 Based on the declarative constraints provided, we can describe a process that seems to involve a multi-step approval workflow for payment requests. Here's an interpretation of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration for approval (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by EMPLOYEE`), although this activity is not explicitly listed in the constraints, it is implied by the occurrence of subsequent approval activities.

2. **Approval Hierarchy**:
   - The declaration requires approval from various roles in a hierarchy, including the Administration, Supervisor, Pre-Approver, and Budget Owner.
   - The `Equivalence` constraints suggest that when a declaration is marked `FOR_APPROVAL` by one role, it must also be marked with the corresponding approval status by other roles or result in a request for payment or payment handling. For example, if the Administration forwards a declaration for approval, it must be matched with approvals or rejections by the Supervisor and Budget Owner, or result in a payment request or handling.

3. **Approval Conditions**:
   - `Always Before` constraints indicate that declarations forwarded for approval by the Supervisor or Pre-Approver must be preceded by the employee submitting the declaration.
   - `Always After` constraints show that certain rejections (e.g., by the Pre-Approver or Supervisor) must follow the declaration being forwarded for approval.

4. **Exclusivity**:
   - `Never Together` constraints specify that certain activities cannot occur in the same case, indicating conflicting decisions or states. For example, a declaration cannot be both saved and rejected by the same or different roles at the same time.

5. **Activity Occurrences**:
   - These constraints limit the number of times certain activities can occur within a case. For instance, an employee can submit a declaration up to seven times, and the Administration can approve a declaration up to four times.

6. **Directly-Follows Constraints**:
   - These constraints dictate immediate succession of activities. For example, if a Supervisor forwards a declaration for approval, it must be directly followed by a rejection by Missing (a role or a placeholder for an unspecified reason for rejection).

7. **Payment Processing**:
   - The process involves requesting payment and handling payments, which are tied to the approval status of declarations. For instance, a payment request can occur only after the Administration has forwarded a declaration for approval and can only occur up to once.

8. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
   - The process allows for multiple rejections by different roles, and an employee can save a declaration up to once, which implies that they might revise and resubmit it.

9. **Final Approval**:
   - The Supervisor can provide a final approval, which is a distinct step from the regular approval and has its own constraints on occurrences.

10. **Completion**:
    - The process concludes when all necessary approvals are obtained, and the payment is handled. The `Payment Handled` activity can only occur once, indicating the end of the process.

In summary, the process is a complex approval workflow with multiple decision points, where a declaration passes through various stages of approval, can be rejected or saved for further editing, and ultimately leads to a payment request and handling, with strict rules on the sequence and occurrence of activities. The constraints ensure that the process adheres to the business rules and that inconsistent states are avoided.
