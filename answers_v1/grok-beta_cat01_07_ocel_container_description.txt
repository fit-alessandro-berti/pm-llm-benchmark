The data you've provided describes a complex logistics and transportation process involving multiple object types and interactions. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the directly follows graph for each object type:

### 1. Handling Unit
- **Collect Goods** -> **Load Truck**: This indicates that goods are collected from a storage area or directly from production, then loaded onto a truck. This is a straightforward, one-to-one process where each handling unit follows this path.

### 2. Truck
- **Load Truck** -> **Load Truck**: This loop suggests that trucks might be loaded multiple times, possibly indicating multiple stops or loading of different goods.
- **Load Truck** -> **Drive to Terminal**: Once loaded, the truck drives to a terminal.
- **Drive to Terminal** -> **Load Truck**: After arriving at the terminal, the truck might load again, suggesting a process where trucks could be making multiple trips or handling different types of cargo at the terminal.

### 3. Container
- **Order Empty Containers** -> **Pick Up Empty Container**: Containers are ordered and then picked up, initiating their journey in the logistics chain.
- **Pick Up Empty Container** -> **Load Truck**: Empty containers are loaded onto trucks.
- **Load Truck** -> **Drive to Terminal**: Containers are transported to a terminal.
- **Drive to Terminal** -> **Weigh**: Containers are weighed, possibly for documentation or compliance.
- **Weigh** -> **Place in Stock** or **Bring to Loading Bay**: Depending on the process, containers might be placed in stock or moved directly to a loading bay.
- **Bring to Loading Bay** -> **Load to Vehicle**: Containers are brought to the loading bay and loaded onto a vehicle for transport.
- **Load to Vehicle** -> **Depart**: The vehicle departs with the loaded container.
- **Reschedule Container**: There's a process for rescheduling containers which might be due to delays, changes in plans, or operational needs.

### 4. Vehicle
- **Book Vehicles**: Vehicles are booked or scheduled for transport tasks.
- **Load to Vehicle**: Vehicles are loaded with containers or goods.
- **Load to Vehicle** -> **Depart**: After loading, the vehicle departs. This can happen multiple times, suggesting that vehicles might make several trips.
- **Book Vehicles** -> **Reschedule Container**: Sometimes vehicle booking leads to container rescheduling, indicating flexibility in the logistics plan.

### 5. Forklift
- **Weigh** -> **Place in Stock**: Forklifts are involved in moving containers post-weighing to stock or back to the loading bay.
- **Load to Vehicle** -> **Weigh**: Containers might be weighed again before loading onto another vehicle or during transit checks.
- **Bring to Loading Bay** -> **Load to Vehicle**: Forklifts help in bringing containers to the loading bay for vehicle loading.

### 6. Customer Order & Transport Document
- **Register Customer Order** -> **Create Transport Document**: A customer order triggers the creation of a transport document.
- **Create Transport Document** -> **Book Vehicles**: The transport document leads to booking vehicles for transport.
- **Book Vehicles** -> **Order Empty Containers**: Vehicles are booked, and containers are ordered as part of the logistical preparation.

### Overall Process Flow:
- **Order and Preparation**: Orders are registered, transport documents are created, and logistics (vehicles, containers) are prepared.
- **Loading and Transport**: Goods are collected, loaded onto trucks, driven to terminals, where containers are managed (weighed, stored, moved to loading bays).
- **Handling at Terminal**: Containers undergo several handling processes like weighing, storage, and loading onto outbound vehicles.
- **Transport and Delivery**: Vehicles transport containers or goods, potentially making multiple stops or trips, and eventually depart for delivery.

This process involves coordination among different entities (vehicles, containers, forklifts, etc.) with significant emphasis on scheduling, handling, and transportation logistics to ensure goods move from collection to delivery efficiently. There's also a clear indication of processes for managing disruptions or changes through rescheduling, which is crucial for operational flexibility in logistics.
