Sensitive attributes are those that could lead to biased outcomes in a model or process. 

Looking at the provided attributes, the following could be considered sensitive for fairness:

* **case:citizen:** This attribute indicates whether a person is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status is a serious fairness concern.
* **case:gender:** This attribute relates to a person's gender. Gender bias is a prevalent issue in many domains, and it's crucial to ensure fairness for all genders.
* **case:german speaking:** This attribute refers to a person's language proficiency. Discrimination based on language can create barriers and unfair treatment.
* **case:married:** This attribute indicates a person's marital status. While seemingly less sensitive than others, marital status can sometimes be correlated with other protected attributes and lead to indirect discrimination.

It's important to note that the sensitivity of an attribute depends on the specific context and the potential for harm.  A thorough fairness assessment should consider the specific application and potential biases present in the data and the process.
