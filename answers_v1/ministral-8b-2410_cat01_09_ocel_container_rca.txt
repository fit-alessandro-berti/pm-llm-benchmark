Based on the provided event log data, several root causes for performance issues in the process can be identified:

### 1. **High Duration in 'Weigh' and 'Place in Stock' Activities**
- **Object type: Container**
  - `"Weigh" -> "Place in Stock"` has a high frequency (1814 events) but a low frequency of objects (1814). This suggests that the weighing and placing in stock activities are relatively time-consuming.
  - The duration for "Weigh" is 2559.54 (seconds) and for "Place in Stock" is 1960.09 (seconds), which are significant durations.
  - This could be due to inefficiencies in the weighing process or in the storage of containers.

### 2. **Long Duration in 'Book Vehicles' Activity**
- **Object type: Vehicle**
  - `"Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles"` has a high frequency (585 events) and a long duration (295965.56 seconds), indicating that booking vehicles is a time-consuming process.
  - This might be due to the complexity of the scheduling algorithm or delays in vehicle availability.

### 3. **High Frequency of 'Depart' Activity**
- **Object type: Container**
  - `"Order Empty Containers" -> "Depart"` has a high frequency (561 events) and a long duration (1007066.16 seconds), suggesting that the departure of containers is a frequent and time-consuming operation.
  - This could be due to inefficiencies in the departure process, such as slow loading times or bottlenecks in terminal operations.

### 4. **Inefficiencies in 'Load Truck' Activity**
- **Object type: Container**
  - `"Load Truck" -> "Drive to Terminal"` has a high frequency (1989 events) and a long duration (10999.07 seconds), indicating that loading trucks and driving to the terminal is a time-consuming process.
  - Similarly, `"Load Truck" -> "Load Truck"` with a duration of 5259.71 seconds suggests inefficiencies in the initial loading process.

### 5. **High Frequency of 'Reschedule Container' Activity**
- **Object type: Container**
  - The `"Reschedule Container"` activity has a high frequency (36 events), suggesting that containers often need to be rescheduled.
  - This could be due to scheduling conflicts, delays, or other operational issues.
- **Object type: Transport Document**
  - The `"Reschedule Container" -> "Depart"` and `"Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container"` activities also have high durations (298469.31 and 255614.86 seconds respectively), indicating that rescheduling containers is a time-consuming process.

### 6. **Long Duration in 'Drive to Terminal' Activity**
- **Object type: Truck**
  - The activity `"Drive to Terminal"` has a high frequency (1988 events) and a long duration (84119.09 seconds), suggesting that driving to the terminal is a significant time-consuming process.
  - This could be due to distance, traffic, or inefficiencies in routing optimization.

### 7. **High Duration in 'Bring to Loading Bay' Activity**
- **Object type: Container**
  - The activity `"Bring to Loading Bay"` has a high frequency (1931 events) and a significant duration (2428.91 seconds), indicating that bringing containers to the loading bay is a time-consuming process.
- **Object type: Forklift**
  - `"Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle"` also has a high frequency (1753 events) and a duration of 2318.32 seconds, indicating inefficiencies in the transportation of containers.

### 8. **High Frequency of 'Depart' Activity**
- **Object type: Transport Document**
  - The activity `"Depart"` has a high frequency (142 events) and a long duration (1051301.41 seconds), suggesting that departures are frequent and time-consuming.
  - This could be due to inefficiencies in the departure process or delays in the logistics chain.

### Summary of Root Causes:
1. **Long duration in weighing and placing in stock activities.**
2. **Time-consuming booking of vehicles.**
3. **Frequent and time-consuming departures of containers.**
4. **Inefficiencies in loading trucks and driving to the terminal.**
5. **High frequency of rescheduling containers.**
6. **Long driving times to the terminal.**
7. **Time-consuming transportation of containers to the loading bay.**
8. **High frequency and long duration of departures.**

These root causes should be addressed to improve the overall efficiency and performance of the process.
