 Opposite Concepts:
1. Manual Process Discovery: Instead of automated, this concept refers to the manual analysis and identification of business processes based on human observations or documentation.
2. Retrospective Monitoring: Unlike real-time monitoring, retrospective monitoring involves analyzing past events in a process for improvement purposes, often using historical data from logs or event records.
3. Top-down Discovery: As opposed to bottom-up discovery, top-down discovery starts with high-level process models and uses them as a basis to discover more detailed sub-processes and activities.
4. Process Inefficiency: This concept focuses on the inefficiencies or bottlenecks within processes that cause delays, increased costs, or lower productivity compared to optimal performance.
5. Reactive Monitoring: In contrast to predictive monitoring, reactive monitoring involves detecting issues only after they occur and taking corrective actions based on those detections rather than anticipating and preventing them.
6. Offline Process Simulation: Unlike process simulation in real-time, offline process simulation is done without the actual system or process running, using a separate simulated environment to test various scenarios and make improvements.

More General Concepts:
1. Process Modeling: This refers to the creation of graphical or formal representations of processes, which can include automated discovery, top-down, bottom-up, or manual methods.
2. Process Analysis: A general term for the examination of process models and event data to identify areas for improvement, bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or compliance issues.
3. Process Improvement: The systematic effort to enhance processes through optimization, automation, redesign, and other means to increase efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
4. Business Process Management (BPM): BPM is a holistic management approach aimed at improving the performance of business operations by aligning people, processes, and technology to achieve organizational goals.
5. Event Logging: The process of recording events or activities as they occur in a process, which can be used for analysis, monitoring, simulation, and other purposes.
