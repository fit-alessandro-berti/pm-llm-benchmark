Event abstraction is indeed a powerful tool for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. Here are some ways you can utilize it:

1. Simplify the Model: Event abstraction involves identifying specific events or activities in your data that have a clear cause-and-effect relationship, such as 'Purchase Order Received', 'Order Shipped', and so on. These events form the building blocks of your process model. By simplifying these complex actions into their most basic forms (e.g., just receiving an order), you make it easier for anyone to understand how the entire process works.

2. Easier Identification of Critical Steps: With event abstraction, you can clearly identify critical steps in a process. For instance, if an error occurs at any stage (e.g., 'Order Processing Failed'), the entire model needs attention. This could involve re-evaluating or modifying individual stages to ensure that they are robust and reliable.

3. Better Identification of Potential Bottlenecks: If certain events in your process lead to long waiting times or bottlenecks, you can identify these early on using event abstraction. This allows for proactive measures like adding resources or improving processes before the bottleneck becomes a problem.

4. Simplified Performance Monitoring: Once you have simplified and abstracted your model, it's easier to monitor performance issues at different stages of the process. For example, if 'Order Received' receives too many requests per hour, you know that you should either increase resources or adjust the processing time for 'Order Processed'.

5. Enhanced Training and Communication: Simplifying complex processes through event abstraction makes it easier for everyone involved in a process to understand how it works and where improvements can be made. This is especially useful when explaining processes to non-technical personnel, improving their understanding of tasks or providing training sessions.

In summary, event abstraction not only simplifies your data but also enhances the manageability and readability of your complex process models derived from event logs. It makes identifying critical steps, potential bottlenecks, performance issues, and areas for improvement much simpler.
