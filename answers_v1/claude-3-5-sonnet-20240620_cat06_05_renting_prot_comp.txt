Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies for both protected and unprotected groups, I can identify several key differences that may indicate unfair treatment. Here are the main observations:

1. Rejection rates:
   - Protected group: Higher rates of early rejection, particularly at the "Apply for Viewing Appointment" stage (484 cases) and after viewing the property (1036 cases).
   - Unprotected group: Lower early rejection rates (365 cases at application, 674 after viewing).

2. Extensive screening:
   - Protected group: More frequent extensive screening (793 cases leading to rejection after extensive screening).
   - Unprotected group: Less frequent extensive screening (1022 cases, but proportionally lower given the larger sample size).

3. Tenancy duration:
   - Protected group: Fewer long-term tenancies. The highest frequency for long-term tenancy is only 14 cases (6+ months of rent payments).
   - Unprotected group: More long-term tenancies, with higher frequencies for 6+ months of rent payments (e.g., 84 cases for 6 months, 56 cases for 8 months).

4. Eviction:
   - Protected group: Contains a variant with eviction due to missed rent payment (6 cases).
   - Unprotected group: No explicit eviction variant mentioned.

5. Processing times:
   - Protected group: Generally longer processing times, especially for rejection paths (e.g., 540,011 vs 480,013 for extensive screening leading to rejection).
   - Unprotected group: Shorter processing times for similar paths.

6. Acceptance rates:
   - Protected group: Lower overall acceptance rates, with fewer variants leading to move-in and rent payment.
   - Unprotected group: Higher acceptance rates, with more variants and higher frequencies for move-in and rent payment scenarios.

These differences suggest potential unfair treatment of the protected group, characterized by:
1. Higher likelihood of early rejection
2. More extensive and time-consuming screening processes
3. Shorter tenancy durations
4. Higher risk of eviction
5. Longer processing times
6. Lower overall acceptance rates

These patterns could indicate systemic bias against the protected group in the rental process, potentially violating fair housing laws and practices. It's important to investigate the reasons behind these disparities and address any underlying biases in the rental application and tenant management processes.
