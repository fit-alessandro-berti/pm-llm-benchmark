Certainly! A Purchase-to-Pay process typically involves the following activities:

1. Create Purchase Order (CPO)
2. Approve Purchase Order (APO)
3. Send Purchase Order to Supplier (SPO)
4. Receive Goods (RG)
5. Receive Invoice (RI)
6. Approve Invoice (AI)
7. Pay Invoice (PI)

Let's assume some hypothetical average times and standard deviations for the intervals between these activities. Here is how a temporal profile might look like:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('CPO', 'APO'): (43200, 7200),   # Half a day (12 hours) on avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('CPO', 'SPO'): (54000, 10800),  # 15 hours on avg, 3 hours stdev
    ('CPO', 'RG'): (259200, 43200),  # 3 days on avg, 12 hours stdev
    ('CPO', 'RI'): (345600, 86400),  # 4 days on avg, 24 hours stdev
    ('CPO', 'AI'): (432000, 108000), # 5 days on avg, 30 hours stdev
    ('CPO', 'PI'): (518400, 129600), # 6 days on avg, 36 hours stdev
    
    ('APO', 'SPO'): (10800, 3600),   # 3 hours on avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('APO', 'RG'): (216000, 36000),  # 2.5 days on avg, 10 hours stdev
    ('APO', 'RI'): (302400, 79200),  # 3.5 days on avg, 22 hours stdev
    ('APO', 'AI'): (388800, 97200),  # 4.5 days on avg, 27 hours stdev
    ('APO', 'PI'): (475200, 115200), # 5.5 days on avg, 32 hours stdev
    
    ('SPO', 'RG'): (205200, 32400),  # 2.38 days on avg, 9 hours stdev
    ('SPO', 'RI'): (291600, 73800),  # 3.38 days on avg, 20.5 hours stdev
    ('SPO', 'AI'): (378000, 91800),  # 4.38 days on avg, 25.5 hours stdev
    ('SPO', 'PI'): (464400, 110400), # 5.38 days on avg, 30.5 hours stdev
    
    ('RG', 'RI'): (86400, 21600),   # 1 day on avg, 6 hours stdev
    ('RG', 'AI'): (172800, 28800),  # 2 days on avg, 8 hours stdev
    ('RG', 'PI'): (259200, 36000),  # 3 days on avg, 10 hours stdev
    
    ('RI', 'AI'): (86400, 14400),   # 1 day on avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('RI', 'PI'): (172800, 21600),  # 2 days on avg, 6 hours stdev
    
    ('AI', 'PI'): (86400, 10800)    # 1 day on avg, 3 hours stdev
}

# Example to check the 'temporal_profile' dictionary
for key, value in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"{key}: AVG = {value[0]} seconds, STDEV = {value[1]} seconds")
```

In this profile:
- Times are expressed in seconds.
- Average (AVG) and standard deviation (STDEV) are provided for each pair of activities.

For example:
- The time between **'CPO'** and **'APO'** is on average 12 hours (43,200 seconds) with a standard deviation of 2 hours (7,200 seconds).
- The time between **'CPO'** and **'RI'** is on average 4 days (345,600 seconds) with a standard deviation of 24 hours (86,400 seconds).

This temporal profile can be used to identify deviations based on the provided ZETA value.
