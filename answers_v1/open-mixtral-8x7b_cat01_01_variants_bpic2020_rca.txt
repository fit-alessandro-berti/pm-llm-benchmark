Based on the process variants provided, the following potential root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. Complexity of the approval process: Many of the process variants include multiple approval steps, such as approval by administration, budget owner, and supervisor. This complexity can lead to delays in processing and reduced performance.
2. Rejection and rework: Several process variants include rejection steps, where the declaration is returned to the employee for revision. This rejection and rework can add additional steps and time to the process, reducing performance.
3. Involvement of multiple roles: Many process variants involve multiple roles, such as employee, administration, budget owner, pre-approver, and supervisor. The handoff between these roles can add time and complexity to the process, reducing performance.
4. Frequency of certain process variants: Some process variants have a higher frequency than others, which can indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the process. For example, the process variant with the highest frequency (4618) includes approval by administration and supervisor, but not budget owner. This could indicate that involving the budget owner in the approval process may reduce performance.
5. Performance outliers: Some process variants have significantly higher performance values than others, which could indicate anomalies or outliers in the data. For example, the process variant with the highest performance value (4922455.714) includes approval by pre-approver and supervisor, but not administration or budget owner. This could indicate an anomaly in the data rather than a performance issue.
6. Lack of savings: One process variant involves saving the declaration, but does not include any payment handling. This could indicate a missed opportunity to streamline the process and improve performance.

To address these performance issues, it may be helpful to analyze the process variants in more detail, identify the root causes of bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and implement process improvements to streamline the approval process, reduce rejection and rework, and involve fewer roles. Additionally, monitoring the frequency and performance of different process variants can help identify anomalies and outliers, and provide insight into areas for process improvement.
