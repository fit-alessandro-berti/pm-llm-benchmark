Based on the provided declarative constraints, we can infer a structured process flow for the approval and handling of declarations. Here's a detailed description of the process:

### Process Overview
The process involves various stages of declaration submission, approval, rejection, and payment handling. Different roles such as EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER are involved in these stages.

### Key Activities and Constraints

  - **Equivalence**: If this activity occurs, it must have the same occurrences as:
    - Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
    - Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER
    - Request Payment
    - Payment Handled
    - Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR
    - Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER

### Summary
The process involves multiple stages of declaration submission, approval, and rejection, with specific constraints ensuring the correct sequence and occurrence of activities. The declarative constraints ensure that certain activities must occur together, in a specific order, or not at all, depending on the context. This structured approach helps in maintaining the integrity and compliance of the approval process.
