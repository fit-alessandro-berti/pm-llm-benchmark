The data you provided outlines a multi-step process for handling employee declarations and associated payments within an organization. Each process variant reflects a sequence of actions that can occur, illustrating various pathways that an employee's declaration can take depending on approvals and rejections by different stakeholders. Here's a breakdown of the overall process and its components:

### Key Components of the Process

1. **Initial Submission**:
   - The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration, indicating the initiation of a request (e.g., for expense reimbursement, leave request, etc.).

2. **Approval Stages**:
   - The declaration goes through several layers of approvals:
     - **Administration Approval**: The declaration must first be approved by the administration department. This is a common first step.
     - **Additional Approvers**: Depending on the variant, it may also require approval from other roles such as a budget owner or a pre-approver. This adds another layer of scrutiny and can prolong the process.
     - **Final Approval**: Ultimately, the declaration must receive final approval from a supervisor, which is a critical step before proceeding to payment processing.

3. **Payment Request & Handling**:
   - Once the declaration has been finalized and approved, a payment request is generated to initiate the payment process.
   - The payment is then processed and handled.

4. **Rejection Handling**:
   - Several variants show that a declaration can be rejected at multiple stages:
     - Rejections may come from administration, budgets, or supervisors. After a rejection, the declaration may be revised and resubmitted for approval.
     - The data indicates that this looping back (resubmission after rejection) can occur multiple times, with some sequences showing repeated rejections.
     - Some processes show that after rejections, there are still successful final outcomes where the declaration ultimately results in a payment being processed.

5. **Saved and Finalized States**:
   - Occasionally, declarations can be saved, indicating a work-in-progress state where the employee might not yet be ready to submit.
   - The successful pathways culminate in the declaration being approved and the subsequent processing of payment.

### Frequency and Performance Metrics
- Each process variant is associated with a frequency (how often that specific variant was followed) and a performance metric (which may represent the efficiency or time taken).
- The variants with higher frequencies represent more common paths taken through the process, while the performance metrics can give insights into which pathways might be more efficient compared to others.

### Observations
- The data suggests that rejections are a significant part of the process, indicating potential inefficiencies or areas for improvement. Variants with a high performance metric but low frequency might represent ideal pathways that are not utilized as often.
- The overall structure indicates a tightly controlled process with multiple checkpoints for approval, which is common in many organizational procedures to mitigate errors and ensure compliance.

### Conclusion
This process data illustrates a complex decision-making structure with multiple stakeholders involved. Approvals and rejections are essential phases that can affect the efficiency and average time taken for declaration processing and payment handling. Understanding these pathways can help in streamlining operations and potentially reducing the cycle times for declarations.
