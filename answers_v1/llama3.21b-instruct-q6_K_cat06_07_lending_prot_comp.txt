I can help you identify the unfair differences in treatment between the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group.

First, let's analyze the process variants of the protected group:

**Unfair differences:**

1. **Application Rejection**: The protected group faces a higher rejection rate compared to the unprotected group (660 vs 163). This suggests that the system is not adequately evaluating borrowers for creditworthiness.
2. **Loan Denied due to Co-Signer Not Being Present**: The protected group has a higher number of loan denied cases where the co-signer is absent, leading to an average performance gap of $4,904.31 (compared to $3,299.29 in the unprotected group).
3. **Additional Examinations and Follow-ups**: The protected group spends more time on additional examinations and follow-ups, resulting in a higher application rejection rate.
4. **More frequent submission of loan files**: The protected group submits their loan applications more frequently, with an average of 6 times compared to the unprotected group's 2.5 times.

**Reasons for unfair differences:**

Based on my domain knowledge, here are some possible reasons why these unfair differences might exist:

1. **Risk-based lending**: The system may be designed to prioritize riskier borrowers (e.g., those with higher income or better credit history). This could lead to a greater likelihood of rejection for the protected group and more frequent additional examinations.
2. **Co-signer requirements**: Co-signing can significantly impact loan approval rates, especially in certain cases. The system may have specific co-signer-related rules that favor the unprotected group.
3. **Loan product complexity**: The types of loans offered (e.g., personal or business) might differ between protected and unprotected groups, leading to variations in application processing times and rejection rates.

To address these unfair differences, it's essential to review and refine the system's underwriting process, risk assessment criteria, and co-signer requirements. This may involve:

1. **Risk-based lending adjustments**: Implementing more nuanced credit scoring models that consider multiple factors beyond income and credit history.
2. **Co-signer policies optimization**: Adjusting co-signer requirements or implementing additional verification steps to mitigate the impact of co-signers on loan approval rates.
3. **Loan product categorization**: Standardizing loan products for both protected and unprotected groups, ensuring consistent underwriting criteria.

By identifying these unfair differences and addressing them through data-driven adjustments, you can create a more equitable lending process that benefits all borrowers.
