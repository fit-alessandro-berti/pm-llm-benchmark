Based on the process variants, several differences might be observed between the protected and unprotected groups:

1. Disease Severity: The unprotected group appears to have more severe conditions requiring 'Expert Examination' and 'Thorough Examination', as observed by their higher frequency. This could potentially imply a bias where the protected group might not be getting such extensive examinations as frequently as the unprotected group.

2. Frequency of Unsuccessful Treatments: It appears that the unprotected group also has a higher frequency of unsuccessful treatments, resulting in repeated treatments until success is achieved. On the other hand, the protected group seems to have a lower incidence of this, hinting at potential inequalities in the success rate of the initial treatments.

3. Performance Time: The performance for both groups tends to be similar for comparable procedures. However, due to the frequency of certain procedures (like Thorough Examination, Expert Examination) for the unprotected group, the overall performance time in such cases could be higher, suggesting potential inefficiencies or delays in treatment.

4. Discharge frequency: There is a significant discharge frequency with zero performance time in the unprotected group, which is not seen in the protected group. This might indicate a potential administrative or system bias.

5. Use of Emergency Room (ER) vs Family Doctor (FD): There seems to be a preference for the protected group to register at the ER compared to FD. In contrast, the unprotected group registers more at FD, indicating a potential difference in healthcare access or utilization.

Note: The observations made are purely based on the presented data and presumptions, further investigation would be necessary to confirm any suggestions of unfair treatment or bias.
