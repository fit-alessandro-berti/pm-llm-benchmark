Certainly! The process you've described involves the handling of declarations or requests within an organization, which typically follows a sequence of steps involving various stakeholders and potential outcomes. Here's a breakdown of the process based on the variants you've provided:

### Overview of the Process:

1. **Initiation by Employee**:
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the starting point where an employee submits a declaration or a request.

2. **Review and Approval/Rejection**:
   - **Approvals**: 
     - **By ADMINISTRATION** - This seems to be a common first level of approval or rejection. 
     - **By PRE_APPROVER** - Less frequent, suggesting a preliminary check before further approvals.
     - **By BUDGET OWNER** - Involved in some cases, likely for declarations involving financial commitments or budget considerations.
     - **By SUPERVISOR (FINAL_APPROVED)** - This appears to be the final approval step in many cases, indicating the supervisor's role in the final decision-making.

   - **Rejections**: 
     - Rejections can occur at any of these approval stages, and the process often loops back to the employee for resubmission after rejection. This could mean:
       - Corrections or additional information are required.
       - The declaration does not meet certain criteria or policies.

3. **Post-Approval Steps**:
   - **Request Payment**: Once approved, the process typically moves to this stage where a payment or action request is made.
   - **Payment Handled**: The final step where the payment or the action related to the declaration is processed.

### Key Observations:

- **Multiple Approval Layers**: There are multiple layers of approval which can complicate the process, potentially leading to delays or multiple rejections and resubmissions.

- **Rejection Cycles**: The data shows several instances where declarations are rejected multiple times, indicating a cycle of revisions, resubmissions, and rejections, which suggests a need for clarity or training on what constitutes an acceptable declaration.

- **Performance Metrics**: The performance metrics (time taken) differ significantly across variants, with more rejections and resubmissions leading to longer processing times. For example, processes with multiple rejections take significantly longer, indicating inefficiencies or complexities in the approval process.

- **Variants with Low Frequency**: Some process variants have very low frequencies, suggesting they are either rare occurrences or perhaps newer procedures not yet widely adopted or known.

- **Special Cases**: There are mentions of "REJECTED by MISSING", which could imply that some declarations are rejected due to missing documentation or information, not directly by a person.

### Process Improvement Suggestions:

- **Streamline Approvals**: Consider if some of the approval steps could be automated or if the criteria for approval could be clearer to reduce unnecessary rejections.
  
- **Training and Documentation**: Enhance training for employees on how to prepare declarations properly to reduce the frequency of rejections.

- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a better feedback mechanism when a declaration is rejected so employees understand exactly what needs to be corrected.

- **Performance Tracking**: Use the performance data to identify bottlenecks or overly complex approval paths and redesign these parts of the process.

This process, as described, reflects a detailed workflow intended to ensure thorough review and compliance but also highlights areas where efficiency might be improved to reduce cycle times and increase employee satisfaction with the process.
