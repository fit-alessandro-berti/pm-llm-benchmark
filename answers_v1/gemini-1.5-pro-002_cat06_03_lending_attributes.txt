In this loan application process, the sensitive attributes for fairness are likely:

* **case:citizen:**  Citizenship status could lead to discriminatory practices.
* **case:gender:** Gender is a protected characteristic and should not influence loan decisions unfairly.
* **case:german speaking:**  While language ability might be relevant for communication, it shouldn't be a basis for discrimination.  It's possible this is a proxy for ethnicity/national origin, which would make it even more sensitive.

These attributes represent characteristics that are often associated with societal biases and could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in the loan application process.  It's crucial to analyze whether the process treats individuals fairly regardless of these attributes.
