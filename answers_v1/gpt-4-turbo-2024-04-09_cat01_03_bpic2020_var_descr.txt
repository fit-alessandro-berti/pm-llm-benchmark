The data you've provided describes a business process centered around the handling of declarations (likely financial or administrative requests) within a company. The process comprises a diverse range of activities and steps performed by different roles in the organization, and varies significantly based on the decisions made at each step. Here's a breakdown of the underlying steps and variations:

### Key Process Participants
1. **Employee**: Initiates declarations and handles rejections.
2. **Administration**: Approves, pre-approves, or rejects declarations.
3. **Budget Owner**: Also involved in certain approvals or rejections.
4. **Supervisor**: Gives final approval or rejections of declarations.
5. **Pre-approver**: Possibly another layer of administrative checking before reaching the Supervisor.
6. **Missing**: A placeholder for an undefined or uncaptured role or decision point.

### Core Process Steps
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: This is the initiation of the process where an employee submits a declaration for approval.
2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION/BUDGET OWNER/PRE_APPROVER**: This stage can involve different roles and appears to be a first-level check before escalating the declaration to higher authority.
3. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: This represents the final approval needed before proceeding to the payment stage.
4. **Request Payment**: This step is likely administratively preparing or submitting a request to process the payment for the approved declaration.
5. **Payment Handled**: The final step where the payment is processed and likely marks the closure of the process for a particular declaration.

### Variations and Complexities
- **Rejections**: At any approval stage, the declaration can be rejected (by Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-approver, or Supervisor). If rejected, the employee may resubmit the declaration, possibly after making necessary changes. This resubmission can happen multiple times, resulting in extended process loops.
- **Saved Declarations**: In some cases, declarations are just saved (potentially as drafts) by an employee, not moving forward in the process.

### Performance Metrics
- **Frequency**: Number of times a particular process variation has occurred.
- **Performance**: Likely a measure of the time or cost taken by that variant of the process, though the specific metric (e.g., time in minutes, total cost in currency) isn't explicitly defined.

### Observations on Process Efficiency
- Processes involving fewer steps and fewer rejections tend to have higher frequencies, suggesting that simplicity and lesser resistance in the process might result in quicker and more frequent completions.
- Some process variants with very high performance measures might indicate inefficiencies, especially where there are multiple rejections and resubmissions, leading to potentially higher costs and longer durations.

### Recommendations
- **Analysis of Rejections**: Understanding why rejections occur might help in refining the submission guidelines or training for employees, reducing the rate of initial rejections.
- **Streamlining Approvals**: Evaluate whether all the roles involved in approvals are necessary, particularly in stages with multiple approval points which may be contributing to process delays.
- **Automation Potential**: Implementing automated checks or AI to pre-validate declarations before submission could reduce the load on administrative and budget roles.

This overview of the process suggests a complex system where simplification and strategic improvements could significantly enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
