Based on the provided declarative constraints, the process appears to be a multi-step approval process for a payment request. Here is a high-level overview of the process:

1. An employee submits a payment request by performing the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' activity. The number of times an employee can submit a payment request is bounded by the 'Activity Occurrences' constraint, which allows for up to 7 submissions.
2. The payment request is then sent for approval to a pre-approver ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'). If the pre-approver rejects the request ('Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER'), the request cannot be submitted again ('Never Together' constraint). If the pre-approver approves the request ('Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER'), the request is sent for approval to the administration ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION').
3. The administration can either approve ('Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION') or reject ('Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION') the payment request. If the administration rejects the request, the pre-approver cannot submit the request again ('Never Together' constraint). If the administration approves the request, it is sent for approval to a supervisor ('Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR').
4. The supervisor can either approve ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR') or reject ('Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR') the payment request. If the supervisor rejects the request, the employee cannot submit the request again ('Never Together' constraint). If the supervisor approves the request, the payment is handled ('Payment Handled').
5. The payment request can also be rejected by a budget owner ('Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER') or by the employee themselves ('Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE').

The 'Always Before' constraints indicate that the pre-approver and supervisor must approve the payment request before it can be submitted by the employee, while the 'Always After' constraints indicate that the payment request must be submitted before it can be rejected by the pre-approver or handled by the payment team. The 'Directly-Follows Constraints' indicate that the pre-approver and administration must approve the payment request before it can be rejected by the pre-approver.

Overall, the process is designed to ensure that payment requests are properly reviewed and approved before being processed, with multiple checks and balances in place to prevent errors or fraud.
