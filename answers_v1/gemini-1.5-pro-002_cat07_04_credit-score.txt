The visualization depicts a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram for a credit scoring process, split across two participants: a "credit scoring (frontend bank)" and a "scoring service".  It shows the flow of events and actions involved in requesting and receiving a credit score.

**Credit scoring (frontend bank):**

1. **Scoring Request Received:** The process begins with the frontend bank receiving a scoring request (represented by an envelope icon).
2. **Request Credit Score:** The frontend then requests the credit score.
3. **Exclusive Gateway (Merge):** The flow merges based on whether the request experienced a "delay information received" event or a "credit score received" event.
4. **Report Delay:** If a delay is reported, this activity is executed.
5. **Exclusive Gateway (Merge):**  The flow merges again after the "report delay" and "credit score received" paths.
6. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** This gateway likely represents a decision point based on the credit score or the delay status, although the criteria isn't explicitly shown in the diagram.
7. **Send Credit Score:** The credit score is sent.
8. **Scoring Request Handled:** The process ends, indicating the request has been fully processed.


**Scoring Service:**

1. **Scoring Request Received:**  The scoring service receives the scoring request (envelope icon).
2. **Compute Credit Score (Level 1):** The service computes the credit score at level 1.
3. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR - "score available?"):**  A decision point based on score availability.
4. **Send Credit Score:** If the score is available (yes path), the score is sent.
5. **Report Delay:** If the score is not available (no path), a delay is reported.
6. **Compute Credit Score (Level 2):**  If the score wasn't available initially, the score is computed at level 2 after reporting the delay. This suggests a fallback mechanism or a more complex calculation.
7. **Send Credit Score:** The credit score (computed at level 2) is sent.
8. **Exclusive Gateway (XOR):** Another decision point, likely representing success/failure sending the credit score, although the exact criteria isn't explicitly stated.
9. **Scoring Request Handled:**  The process in the scoring service ends.

**Key Observations:**

* **Asynchronous Communication:** The dashed lines connecting the two participants suggest asynchronous communication between the frontend bank and the scoring service.
* **Message Queueing:** The annotation "inkl. ID for message queueing" within the scoring service implies the use of a message queue for managing the requests, especially when a delay is involved.
* **Error Handling/Fallback:** The "level 2" credit score computation path in the scoring service likely represents a fallback mechanism if the initial score calculation fails or is unavailable.
* **Missing Details:** The diagram doesn't specify the exact criteria used for decision points (exclusive gateways).  It also lacks details about the nature of the delay or error handling.


This BPMN diagram provides a good high-level overview of the credit scoring process, but further details would be necessary for a complete understanding of the implementation.
