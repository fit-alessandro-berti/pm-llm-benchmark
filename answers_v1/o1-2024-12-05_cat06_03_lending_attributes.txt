In the context of fairness and avoiding discrimination, attributes that can be tied to protected characteristics or personal demographics are generally considered sensitive. In this particular dataset, the following attributes stand out as sensitive:

1. **case:citizen**:  
   Whether someone is a citizen or not can be linked to nationality, which is often considered a protected characteristic in fairness assessments. Using this attribute may lead to discrimination based on nationality or immigration status.

2. **case:gender**:  
   Gender is one of the most commonly recognized protected attributes. Decisions influenced by gender carry the risk of systemic bias or discrimination.

3. **case:german speaking**:  
   Language proficiency or language background can serve as a proxy for ethnicity, national origin, or cultural background, all of which are typically considered sensitive. If decision-making processes are influenced by whether someone is "german speaking" or not, it could lead to unfair treatment.

Other attributes like the "activity," "concept:name," "resource," or timestamps are generally not inherently sensitive. These primarily describe process steps, resource allocation, or timing and are not directly tied to demographic or protected group status.

In summary, the attributes related to an individual's demographic or social background—**citizenship status, gender, and language background (german speaking)**—are considered sensitive attributes for fairness.
