Based on the provided directly-follows graph for different object types, I can describe the underlying process, which appears to be a logistics and transportation operation. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Customer Order Initiation:
   - The process starts with "Register Customer Order" followed by "Create Transport Document".

2. Transport Planning:
   - After creating the transport document, the next step is to "Book Vehicles".
   - This is followed by "Order Empty Containers".

3. Container Preparation:
   - Empty containers are ordered and then picked up ("Pick Up Empty Container").
   - The containers are then loaded onto trucks ("Load Truck").

4. Truck Operations:
   - Trucks are loaded, sometimes multiple times ("Load Truck" -> "Load Truck").
   - Once fully loaded, trucks "Drive to Terminal".

5. Terminal Operations:
   - At the terminal, containers go through several steps:
     a. "Weigh"
     b. "Place in Stock" or directly "Bring to Loading Bay"
     c. If placed in stock, later "Bring to Loading Bay"
   - Forklifts are heavily involved in these terminal operations, moving containers between weighing, storage, and loading areas.

6. Vehicle Loading:
   - Containers are loaded onto vehicles (likely ships or trains) in the "Load to Vehicle" step.
   - This step can occur multiple times for a single vehicle.

7. Departure:
   - After loading, the final step is "Depart".

8. Rescheduling and Exceptions:
   - Throughout the process, there are instances of "Reschedule Container", which can lead back to various steps like booking vehicles or loading.

Key observations:
- The process involves multiple object types: Customer Orders, Transport Documents, Containers, Trucks, Vehicles (likely ships or trains), Forklifts, and Handling Units.
- There's a clear flow from order creation to transport planning, container preparation, terminal operations, and final departure.
- The process allows for flexibility with rescheduling options at various stages.
- Some steps, like loading trucks or vehicles, can occur multiple times for a single object, indicating batch processing or multiple pickup/delivery points.
- The duration between steps varies greatly, with some steps happening quickly (e.g., weighing) and others taking much longer (e.g., waiting in stock).

This process resembles a typical intermodal freight transport operation, where goods are moved using multiple modes of transportation, likely involving trucks for local transport and larger vehicles (ships or trains) for long-distance transport.
