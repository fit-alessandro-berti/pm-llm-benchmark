Certainly! Let's craft a Log Skeleton model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (PTP) process. Here's how such a process might work:

1. **Purchase Requisition** - An employee requests a purchase.
2. **Purchase Order Creation** - The purchase requisition is approved, and a purchase order is created.
3. **Goods Receipt** - The goods are received.
4. **Invoice Receipt** - An invoice for the goods is received.
5. **Invoice Verification** - The invoice is checked against the purchase order and goods receipt.
6. **Payment Processing** - The invoice is paid.

Now, let's define the Log Skeleton for this process:

```python
purchase_to_pay_log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),  # Assuming these always happen in pairs for simplicity
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Purchase Requisition', 'Purchase Order Creation'),
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'),
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'),
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'),
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment Processing'),
    },
    'never_together': {
        # In this simple model, there might not be clear 'never together' relationships since the process is quite sequential.
        # However, if we assume some activities must not occur in the same trace for any reason:
        ('Purchase Requisition', 'Payment Processing'),  # Requisition should not be raised after payment is processed
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Purchase Requisition': {1},  # Must occur exactly once per case
        'Purchase Order Creation': {1},
        'Goods Receipt': {1},  # Assuming goods receipt happens once per purchase order
        'Invoice Receipt': {1},
        'Invoice Verification': {1},
        'Payment Processing': {1},  # Payment processing happens once after verification
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Purchase Requisition', 'Purchase Order Creation'),
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'),
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'),  # In our model, goods and invoice receipt follow each other directly
        ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment Processing'),
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence**: Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt might be considered equivalent in this simplified model, assuming each good receipt has a corresponding invoice receipt.
- **Always Before**: Ensures that certain activities occur before others in the process flow.
- **Always After**: Ensures that after invoice verification, payment must be processed.
- **Never Together**: Here, it's somewhat theoretical since all steps should occur in a linear fashion, but included for completeness.
- **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity in a case should occur exactly once, which is typical for such a sequential process.
- **Directly-Follows**: Defines the immediate succession of activities, ensuring the correct order of execution.

This model simplifies many potential complexities (like multiple goods receipts for a single invoice or partial payments) but provides a basic framework for how a Purchase-to-Pay process might be modeled with Log Skeletons. Remember, real-world processes might require more nuanced constraints.
