The data describes a business process related to the handling of declarations or requests, which goes through various stages involving different roles: EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, and MISSING (possibly indicating missing documentation or requirements). The process can be broadly summarized as follows:

1. **Submission by Employee**: Every variant starts with a Declaration being SUBMITTED by an EMPLOYEE.

2. **Approval Process**:
   - Some declarations are APPROVED directly by ADMINISTRATION.
   - In some cases, there is an additional approval step from PRE_APPROVER before it reaches SUPERVISOR.
   - Other times, BUDGET OWNER needs to approve the declaration after ADMINISTRATION but before SUPERVISOR.
   
3. **Final Approval**:
   - The process typically concludes with a FINAL_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR.

4. **Rejection Process**:
   - If any of the approvals (by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER) are rejected, the declaration can be REJECTED by the relevant party.
   - In case of rejection, the employee might need to resubmit the declaration after making necessary changes or corrections.

5. **Handling Payment**:
   - Once a declaration has been finally approved (or if it bypassed some steps due to direct approval from SUPERVISOR), the next step is Request Payment followed by Payment Handled.
   
6. **Special Cases**:
   - There are special cases where declarations can be marked as REJECTED by MISSING, which might indicate that something essential was missing during any stage of the process and needs further action.

7. **Performance Measures**:
   - Each variant has a frequency (number of times this path occurred) and performance (which could represent time taken or cost involved for each instance).

8. **Variations in Process Flow**:
   - The variants highlight different paths a declaration might take based on the involvement of various approvers and their decisions (approve/reject). Some declarations follow a more straightforward route, while others involve multiple iterations due to rejections.

9. **Handling Rejected Cases**:
   - When there's a rejection at any step, it often results in the employee having to resubmit the declaration after adjustments have been made.
   - There are cases where the same rejection-revision cycle happens several times before final approval and payment handling.

This process highlights the complexity of managing approvals for declarations or requests across multiple stages with different parties involved. It also underscores the importance of proper documentation and compliance to avoid rejections, which can significantly increase the time (and possibly cost) taken to complete a request cycle.
