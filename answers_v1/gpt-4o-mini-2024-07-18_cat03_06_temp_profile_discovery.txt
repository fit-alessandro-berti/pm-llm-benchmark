To generate a temporal profile for the described process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between pairs of activities based on the process execution data you provided. The temporal profile will be represented as a dictionary, where each key is a tuple of activity pairs (activity1, activity2) and its value is a tuple containing the average time and the standard deviation.

Since the execution data you provided does not include specific time durations between the activities executed together, I'll outline the general approach for calculating the temporal profile:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs**: Identify unique pairs of activities from all the variants. For example, from the variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification", we derive pairs: ("Create Fine", "Send Fine"), ("Create Fine", "Insert Fine Notification"), and ("Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification").

2. **Count Frequencies**: Maintain a count of how many times each pair occurs across all variants, using a similar structure to the execution data's frequencies. This will help in calculating the averages.

3. **Calculate Average Times**: For each activity pair, calculate the total time spent divided by the frequency of the paired activities so as to establish an average.

4. **Calculate Standard Deviations**: After calculating averages, you will also need to collect the individual times for each execution instance, then compute the variance and standard deviation for that activity pair.

5. **Compile into the Profile**: Finally, create the profile dictionary using activity pairs as keys.

Here’s how the code could be set up assuming you have a dataset of execution times associated with each variant:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample data structure to hold the frequencies of the process variants.
variants = [
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Send for Credit Collection", 56482, 59591524.946),
    ("Create Fine", "Payment", 46371, 889688.400),
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", 20385, 8380516.026),
    # Add all other variants similarly...
]

# Create a dictionary to hold the cumulative times and counts for average calculation
time_data = defaultdict(lambda: {'total_time': 0, 'count': 0, 'variances': []})

# Iterate through each variant
for variant in variants:
    activities = variant[:-3]  # All but the last three elements
    frequency = variant[-3]     # Frequency
    performance = variant[-1]   # Performance (time spent)
    
    # Loop through each unique pair of activities in the variant
    for i in range(len(activities)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(activities)):
            activity_pair = (activities[i], activities[j])
            time_data[activity_pair]['total_time'] += performance * frequency
            time_data[activity_pair]['count'] += frequency
            time_data[activity_pair]['variances'].append(performance)  # Collect individual performances

# Generate the temporal profile
temporal_profile = {}
for activity_pair, data in time_data.items():
    avg_time = data['total_time'] / data['count']
    
    # Calculate variance and stddev
    individual_times = data['variances']
    variance = np.var(individual_times)  # Population variance
    std_dev = np.sqrt(variance)
    
    temporal_profile[activity_pair] = (avg_time, std_dev)

# Output the temporal profile
for pair, values in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"{pair}: Average Time = {values[0]}, Standard Deviation = {values[1]}")
```

This code provides a framework to compute the temporal profile based on activity execution times and frequencies. You would need to complete the `variants` list with relevant data for all variants you have. The output will show the average times and standard deviations for each pair of activities involved in the process.

Make sure to validate that your actual time data is appropriate to proceed with this. Depending on your specific scenario, you might need to adapt the extraction of execution times and the way the activities are paired.
