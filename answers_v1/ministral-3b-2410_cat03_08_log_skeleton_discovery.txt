To generate a Log Skeleton model for the given process variants, we need to extract the declarative constraints from the provided information. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify Activity Occurrences:**
   - We'll denote each activity with a unique identifier.
   - We'll then determine the bounds for the occurrences of each activity based on the provided frequencies.

2. **Determine Constraints:**
   - **Equivalence:** Activities that always have the same occurrences in all variants.
   - **Always Before/After:** Activities that must occur in a specific order.
   - **Never Together:** Activities that cannot occur simultaneously.
   - **Directly Follows:** Activities that always follow directly after the other.

Given the complexity and the number of variants, I'll provide a simplified Log Skeleton model focusing on the primary relationships. More detailed constraints can be added based on further analysis.

### Step 1: Define Activities
```python
activities = ['Create Fine', 'Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection', 'Payment', 'Appeal to Judge', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender']
```

### Step 2: Extract Frequent Occurrences
```python
# Example: Create Fine with its bounds
activ_freq = {
    'Create Fine': {0, 1},
    'Send Fine': {1, 2},
    'Insert Fine Notification': {1, 2},
    'Add penalty': {0, 1, 2},
    'Send for Credit Collection': {0, 1},
    'Payment': {0, 1, 2, 3},
    'Appeal to Judge': {0, 1},
    'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
    'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
    'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {0, 1},
    'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {0, 1},
}
```

### Step 3: Determine Constraints
We'll derive the constraints from the process variants. Here are some key constraints:
- **Equivalence:** Activities like Payment, Send Fine Notification, Send Fine, etc., which appear interchangeably.
- **Always Before/After:** Activities like `Create Fine -> Send Fine` and `Appeal to Judge -> Payment`.
- **Never Together:** Activities that appear simultaneously in the variants like `Send for Credit Collection` and `Payment`.
- **Directly Follows:** Activities like `Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification` and `Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty`.

### Step 4: Construct the Log Skeleton Model
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # Example: Equivalence of activities
        ('Create Fine', 'Create Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Payment', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): [],
        ('Payment', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'): [],
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): []
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): [],
        ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'activ_freq': activ_freq,
    'directly_follows': {
        # Example: Directly Follows relationships
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Send Fine Notification'): [],
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): [],
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): []
    }
}
```

### Example of Log Skeleton Model
```python
# Complete Log Skeleton Model
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Create Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Payment', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): [],
        ('Payment', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'): [],
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): []
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): [],
        ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Payment'): []
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Fine': {0, 1},
        'Send Fine': {1, 2},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {1, 2},
        'Add penalty': {0, 1, 2},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {0, 1},
        'Payment': {0, 1, 2, 3},
        'Appeal to Judge': {0, 1},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {0, 1},
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [],
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): [],
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): [],
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): []
    }
}
```

This skeleton model captures the essential constraints and relationships from the provided process variants. For a more detailed analysis, additional constraints and fine-tuning would be necessary based on the specific process requirements.
