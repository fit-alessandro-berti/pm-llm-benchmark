There are several main differences between the process variants of the protected group and the unprotected group. Here are some of the key differences:

  1. The protected group has a much lower frequency of process variants compared to the unprotected group. This suggests that the protected group may be experiencing more challenges or obstacles in going through the process.
  2. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that involve examinations, such as "Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination" and "Expert Examination -> Diagnosis". This suggests that the protected group may be more likely to require additional evaluations or consultations.
  3. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that involve multiple unsuccessful treatment attempts before a successful outcome. For example, "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" and "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful". This suggests that the protected group may be experiencing more complications or difficulties in achieving a successful outcome.
  4. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants that involve a discharge without treatment or a successful outcome. For example, "Discharge" and "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment". This suggests that the protected group may be experiencing more negative outcomes or complications.
  5. The protected group has a lower frequency of process variants that involve a successful outcome after a single treatment attempt. For example, "Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Treatment". This suggests that the protected group may be experiencing more challenges or complications in achieving a successful outcome.
