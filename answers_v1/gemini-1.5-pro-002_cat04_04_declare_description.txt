The process describes a simple payment request and approval flow, with a strict sequence of actions and exactly one occurrence of each activity.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** The process begins with the employee submitting a declaration. (Initialization)

2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:** The supervisor approves the declaration. (Chain Succession, meaning it directly follows the submission)

3. **Request Payment:** A payment request is made. (Chain Succession, directly following the supervisor's approval, Chain Precedence and Response with the previous two)

4. **Payment Handled:** The payment is processed. (Chain Succession, following the payment request, Chain Precedence and Response with the previous three)


The various constraints reinforce this strict sequence and single occurrence nature:

* **Exactly 1:** Each of the four activities happens exactly once.
* **Existence:** Guarantees all four core activities occur.
* **Responded Existence/Co-Existence:** Reinforce that if one of the four core activities occurs, the others must also occur.  However, given the other more specific constraints, these are somewhat redundant.
* **(Alternate/Chain) Response/Precedence/Succession:**  These define the strict ordering and direct following relationship between activities.  `Chain` constraints ensure direct following, while `Alternate` prevents repetition of activities between the related actions.  For example, Alternate Succession of (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Payment Handled) ensures no other core activity happens between the submission and the payment handling.
* **Absence:**  Clearly lists activities that are *not* part of this specific process. This likely represents other potential paths in a larger workflow that are excluded in this particular scenario.


**In short:** An employee submits a declaration. The supervisor approves it.  A payment request is made, and then the payment is handled. Each step happens exactly once and in that precise order.
