To generate a temporal profile for the given process variants, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between activity pairs. However, you haven't provided the actual times between activities for each process variant. In the absence of these times, we can't calculate the temporal profile directly.

But, I can show you how to calculate the temporal profile if you have the times. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Extract times between activities**: You need to have a matrix or data structure where each entry represents the time between two activities.
2. **Calculate average and standard deviation**: Compute the average time and standard deviation for each pair of activities.
3. **Form the temporal profile dictionary**: Create a dictionary where the keys are tuples of activity pairs, and the values are tuples of average time and standard deviation.

Let's assume we have a dictionary of times between activities. Here is how you can generate the temporal profile:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import statistics

# Example times data (this should be your actual data)
times_data = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [15, 20, 10, 15, 25],
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): [10, 12, 14, 11],
    # Add more times pairs as per your data
}

# Initialize the dictionary to store the temporal profile
temporal_profile = defaultdict(lambda: (0, 0))

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each activity pair
for (activity_a, activity_b), times in times_data.items():
    avg_time = statistics.mean(times)
    std_dev = statistics.stdev(times)
    temporal_profile[(activity_a, activity_b)] = (avg_time, std_dev)

# Convert defaultdict to regular dictionary for better readability
temporal_profile = dict(temporal_profile)

# ZETA value
ZETA = 1.5

# Print the temporal profile
for (activity_a, activity_b), (avg_time, std_dev) in temporal_profile.items():
    print(f"({activity_a}, {activity_b}): Average = {avg_time}, Std Dev = {std_dev}")

# Print the temporal profile with ZETA adjustment
for (activity_a, activity_b), (avg_time, std_dev) in temporal_profile.items():
    lower_bound = avg_time - ZETA * std_dev
    upper_bound = avg_time + ZETA * std_dev
    print(f"({activity_a}, {activity_b}): Lower Bound = {lower_bound}, Upper Bound = {upper_bound}")
```

This script will calculate the average time and standard deviation for each pair of activities and print them. You would need to replace the `times_data` dictionary with your actual data for the times between activities.

If you provide the actual time data between each pair of activities, I can generate the temporal profile for you.
