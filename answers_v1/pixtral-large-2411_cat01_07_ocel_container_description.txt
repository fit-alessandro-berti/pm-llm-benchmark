Based on the provided directly-follows graph for different object types, we can infer a logistics process involving the handling of goods, containers, trucks, vehicles, forklifts, customer orders, and transport documents. Here's a description of the process:

1. **Customer Order and Transport Document:**
   - The process begins with registering a customer order.
   - A transport document is created for the registered customer order.
   - Vehicles are booked based on the transport document.
   - Empty containers are ordered for the booked vehicles.
   - The process may involve rescheduling containers if needed.
   - Eventually, the vehicles depart for delivery.

2. **Handling Unit:**
   - Goods are collected and loaded onto trucks.

3. **Truck:**
   - Trucks are loaded with containers.
   - Trucks may load multiple times or drive to the terminal.
   - After driving to the terminal, trucks may load again.

4. **Container:**
   - Empty containers are ordered and picked up.
   - Containers are loaded onto trucks, which then drive to the terminal.
   - At the terminal, containers are weighed and placed in stock.
   - Containers may be brought to the loading bay and loaded onto vehicles.
   - Containers may also be rescheduled if needed.
   - Loaded vehicles depart for delivery.

5. **Vehicle:**
   - Vehicles are booked and loaded with containers.
   - Loaded vehicles depart for delivery.
   - Vehicles may be rescheduled if needed.

6. **Forklift:**
   - Forklifts are used to bring containers to the loading bay, load them onto vehicles, weigh them, and place them in stock.
   - Forklifts may perform multiple tasks such as loading, weighing, and placing containers in stock.

Here's a simplified flow of the process:

1. Register Customer Order
2. Create Transport Document
3. Book Vehicles
4. Order Empty Containers
5. Pick Up Empty Container (using Forklift)
6. Load Truck (with Containers)
7. Drive to Terminal (Truck)
8. Weigh (Container using Forklift)
9. Place in Stock (Container using Forklift)
10. Bring to Loading Bay (Container using Forklift)
11. Load to Vehicle (Container using Forklift)
12. Depart (Vehicle)

Throughout the process, there are possibilities for rescheduling containers and vehicles, and multiple loading and moving activities may occur. The process involves interactions between different object types, such as customer orders, transport documents, trucks, containers, vehicles, and forklifts.
