The underlying process described is an IT service provider process, specifically related to a project. The process includes initiation, planning, execution, and closure phases as outlined in the BPMN diagram provided. 

Upon starting, the initiate subprocess triggers the project's initialization activities, including getting initial information about the customer from the Billing and payment module of the customer management system, generating the project work plan for delivery based on this information, and sending a request to the Project manager for approval. The process waits in this waiting stage until approved or rejected.

If approved, it executes in parallel the deliver projects (project implementation) and close processes, where it delivers an order and closes the project by issuing orders of payment against that order according to rules established between the customer and the vendor. It also sends a confirmation email upon closing the project.
