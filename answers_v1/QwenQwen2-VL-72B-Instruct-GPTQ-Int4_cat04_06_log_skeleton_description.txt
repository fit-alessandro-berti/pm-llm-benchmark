The process underlying this data is related to the approval and handling of declarations, which can be related to budget or financial requests. The process involves multiple roles such as EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER. The process starts with the EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved or rejected by other roles. If approved, the declaration may proceed to the final approval stage. If rejected, it may be rejected at various stages by different roles. The process may also involve payment handling if the declaration is approved. The process is governed by declarative constraints such as equivalence, always before, always after, never together, activity occurrences, and directly-follows constraints, which define the relationships between the activities and roles in the process.
