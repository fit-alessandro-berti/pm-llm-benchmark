To generate a temporal profile, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each couple of activities in each process variant.

Here is the Python code to generate the temporal profile:
```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta

# Process variants data
process_variants = [
    # ... paste your process variants data here ...
]

# Function to calculate time difference and generate temporal profile
def calculate_temporal_profile(process_variant):
    times = []
    for i in range(1, len(process_variant)):
        activity1 = process_variant[i-1]
        activity2 = process_variant[i]
        time_diff = (activity2[0] - activity1[0]).total_seconds() / 86400  # convert to days
        times.append((time_diff,))
    df = pd.DataFrame(times, columns=['Time'])
    avg_time = df['Time'].mean()
    std_dev = df['Time'].std()
    return {('A', 'B'): (avg_time, std_dev)}

# Generate temporal profile for each process variant
temporal_profile = {}
for process_variant in process_variants:
    temp_profile = calculate_temporal_profile(process_variant)
    for activity1, activity2 in temp_profile:
        if ('A', 'B') not in temporal_profile:
            temporal_profile[('A', 'B')] = []
        temporal_profile[('A', 'B')].append((activity1, activity2))
    # Remove redundant entries
    for key, value in list(temporal_profile.items()):
        if len(value) > 1 and all(activity1 == key[0] for activity1, activity2 in value):
            del temporal_profile[key]

# Print temporal profile
for couple, values in temporal_profile.items():
    avg_time = [value[1][0] for value in values]
    std_dev = [value[1][1] for value in values]
    print(f"({couple[0]}, {couple[1]}) - Average Time: {sum(avg_time)/len(avg_time):.2f}, Standard Deviation: {sum(std_dev)/len(std_dev):.2f}")
```
This code will generate a temporal profile for each process variant and print the average and standard deviation of the times between each couple of activities.

Please note that you need to replace `process_variants` with your actual data. Also, this code assumes that the time difference is calculated in days (86400 seconds). If your data uses a different unit, you may need to adjust the calculation accordingly.
