The attributes that could potentially influence fairness in this case are:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute could be sensitive if there is a significant difference in the frequency of certain events (like paying rent or applying for viewings) between citizens and non-citizens.

2. `case:gender`: Similar to the `case:citizen` attribute, if there are significant differences in event frequency based on gender, this could be sensitive for fairness.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute could be sensitive if there are significant differences in event frequency based on fluency in German.

4. `case:married`: If there are significant differences in event frequency based on marital status, this could be sensitive for fairness.

5. `resource`: If there are significant differences in event frequency based on the real estate agent or service provider, this could be sensitive for fairness. For example, if one real estate agent or service provider significantly influences the event of renting a property, this could be sensitive for fairness.
