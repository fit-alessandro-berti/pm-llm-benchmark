Generating a temporal profile for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process requires understanding the typical activities involved in such a process and making informed estimates about the average time durations and standard deviations between these activities. The Purchase-to-Pay process generally includes the following steps:

1. **Purchase Request** (PR) - An employee requests to purchase something.
2. **Purchase Order** (PO) - The purchase is approved, and an order is sent to the supplier.
3. **Goods Receipt** (GR) - The goods/services are received.
4. **Invoice Receipt** (IR) - The invoice for the goods/services is received from the supplier.
5. **Invoice Verification** (IV) - The invoice is verified against the PO and GR.
6. **Payment** (P) - Payment is made to the supplier.

Below is a Python dictionary representing a temporal profile for this hypothetical P2P process. Note that the actual average times (AVG) and standard deviations (STDEV) are fictional and provided for illustrative purposes only. Real values should be derived from historical process execution data.

```python
temporal_profile_p2p = {
    ('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order'): (86400, 7200),  # 1 day avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'): (604800, 259200),  # 7 days avg, 3 days stdev
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Receipt'): (518400, 172800),  # 6 days avg, 2 days stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (345600, 120000),  # 4 days avg, 1.5 days stdev
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'): (28800, 7200),  # 8 hours avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Verification'): (259200, 86400),  # 3 days avg, 1 day stdev
    ('Invoice Verification', 'Payment'): (86400, 43200),  # 1 day avg, 0.5 days stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Goods Receipt'): (1209600, 518400),  # 14 days avg, 6 days stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Invoice Receipt'): (1105920, 466560),  # 12.8 days avg, 5.4 days stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Invoice Verification'): (1166400, 489600),  # 13.5 days avg, 5.7 days stdev
    ('Purchase Request', 'Payment'): (1267200, 518400)  # 14.7 days avg, 6 days stdev
}
```

**Interpretation:**
- The tuple keys represent the activity pairs.
- The first value in each tuple (e.g., `86400`) is the average time in seconds between the two activities.
- The second value (e.g., `7200`) is the standard deviation of the time in seconds.

**Example Use Case with ZETA:**
Given `ZETA = 2`, for the activity pair `('Purchase Request', 'Purchase Order')`:
- **Lower Threshold** = `AVG - ZETA * STDEV` = `86400 - 2 * 7200` = `86400 - 14400` = `72000` seconds (or 20 hours)
- **Upper Threshold** = `AVG + ZETA * STDEV` = `86400 + 2 * 7200` = `86400 + 14400` = `100800` seconds (or 28 hours)

Any time between a `Purchase Request` and a `Purchase Order` that falls outside of the 20 hours to 28 hours range would be considered a deviation given `ZETA = 2`.
