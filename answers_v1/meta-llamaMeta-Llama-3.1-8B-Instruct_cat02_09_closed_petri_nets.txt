Here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the given Petri net concepts:

1. **Source Place**:
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place**: A place with only one outgoing arc, where tokens can only flow out, never enter.
	* More general concept: **Internal Place**: A place with at least one incoming and one outgoing arc, allowing tokens to flow both in and out.
2. **Immediate Transition**:
	* Opposite concept: **Deferred Transition**: A transition that cannot fire until all its predecessor transitions have fired at least once.
	* More general concept: **Multi-Choice Transition**: A transition with multiple predecessor places, allowing tokens to be removed from any of them before firing.
3. **Live Transition**:
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition**: A transition that is never enabled, i.e., its predecessor places never have tokens.
	* More general concept: **Fireable Transition**: A transition that can potentially fire, depending on the current marking of its predecessor places.
4. **Bounded Net**:
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net**: A net where the number of tokens in a place is unbounded, i.e., it can grow indefinitely.
	* More general concept: **K-Bounded Net**: A net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded by a constant K.
5. **Free Choice Net**:
	* Opposite concept: **Determined Net**: A net where the choice of successor transition for a token is uniquely determined, i.e., no conflict resolution is needed.
	* More general concept: **Preferential Net**: A net where transitions have priorities or weights, influencing the conflict resolution strategy.

Note that these opposite and more general concepts are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and some Petri net concepts may overlap or have nuances that are not fully captured by these examples.
