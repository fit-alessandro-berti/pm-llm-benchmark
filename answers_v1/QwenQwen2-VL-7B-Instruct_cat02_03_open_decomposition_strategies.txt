Benefits:

1. Improved accuracy: Decomposing large-scale processes into smaller components makes it easier to identify and analyze specific process flows, which can increase the accuracy of process mining results.

2. Enhanced scalability: Decomposing processes allows for more efficient use of computational resources by breaking down large-scale processes into smaller, more manageable components.

3. Increased insight: By breaking down large-scale processes into smaller components, process mining practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying process flows and identify areas for improvement.

4. Reduced complexity: Decomposing large-scale processes can help to simplify the analysis of complex processes and make them more understandable to stakeholders.

Challenges:

1. Data integration: Decomposing large-scale processes may require integrating data from multiple sources, which can be difficult and time-consuming to accomplish.

2. Data quality: Decomposing large-scale processes may require data cleaning and preprocessing, which can be challenging and resource-intensive to accomplish.

3. Model accuracy: Decomposing large-scale processes may require the development of accurate models, which can be difficult to achieve, especially when dealing with incomplete or inaccurate data.

4. Interpretation: Decomposing large-scale processes can result in a large number of process models, which can be difficult to interpret and communicate to stakeholders.
