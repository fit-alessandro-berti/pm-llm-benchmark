This visualization appears to be a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram showing a credit scoring workflow. The process is divided into two swim lanes: "credit scoring (bank)" and "scoring service."

The flow begins when a scoring request is received and follows these main paths:

1. In the bank lane:
- Starts with receiving a scoring request
- Requests a credit score
- Has parallel paths for handling delay information and credit score reception
- Ends with sending the credit score

2. In the scoring service lane:
- Receives the scoring request
- Computes credit score (level 1)
- Has a decision gateway "score available?"
- If yes: directly sends credit score
- If no: reports delay, computes credit score (level 2), then sends credit score
- Includes a note about "intl. ID for message queueing"

The diagram uses standard BPMN elements like:
- Message events (envelope icons)
- Tasks (rounded rectangles)
- Gateways (diamond shapes)
- Sequence flows (solid lines)
- Message flows (dashed lines)

The process ensures proper handling of both immediate score availability and delayed scoring scenarios, with appropriate communication between the bank and scoring service.
