Event abstraction is a technique used in process mining to group similar events into a higher-level activity. This grouping of events helps to reduce the complexity of process models and improve their readability and manageability. Here are some ways in which event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs:

1. Identify key activities: One of the first steps in event abstraction is to identify the key activities that are common across different process instances. By grouping similar events into higher-level activities, you can create a more streamlined process model that is easier to read and understand.

2. Simplify the process model: Event abstraction can help to simplify the process model by removing unnecessary details and focusing on the most important activities. This can make it easier to identify patterns and trends in the data, and to identify areas for improvement.

3. Improve the accuracy of process models: By grouping similar events into higher-level activities, you can create more accurate process models that are less prone to errors. This can help to ensure that the process model accurately reflects the actual processes that are taking place in the organization.

4. Facilitate process analysis: Event abstraction can make it easier to analyze process models by reducing the number of individual events that need to be examined. This can help to identify areas for improvement and to optimize processes.

5. Enable better decision-making: By creating clearer and more accurate process models, event abstraction can help managers and decision-makers to make better decisions about how to optimize processes and improve efficiency. This can ultimately lead to better business outcomes and increased profitability.

Overall, event abstraction is a powerful tool for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. By grouping similar events into higher-level activities, you can create more accurate, streamlined, and easy-to-understand process models that can help to improve business processes and outcomes.
