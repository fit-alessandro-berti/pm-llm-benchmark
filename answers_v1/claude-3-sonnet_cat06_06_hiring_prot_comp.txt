Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performance (execution times), there are several notable differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group:

1. Frequency of expert examinations: The unprotected group seems to have a higher frequency of process variants involving expert examinations (e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 1466 for the unprotected group, while the highest frequency for a similar variant in the protected group is 179). This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to undergo additional or specialized examinations.

2. Frequency of treatment failures and re-diagnoses: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving treatment failures and subsequent re-diagnoses (e.g., "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 225 for the unprotected group, while the highest frequency for a similar variant in the protected group is 48). This could suggest that the unprotected group experiences more treatment failures and requires additional diagnoses and treatments.

3. Longer process variants: The unprotected group has process variants with more steps, such as multiple instances of treatment failures and re-diagnoses (e.g., "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a frequency of 35 for the unprotected group, while there is no such long variant for the protected group). This could indicate that the unprotected group goes through more complex and prolonged treatment processes.

4. Performance (execution times): While there are some process variants with similar performance for both groups, in general, the process variants involving multiple steps or treatment failures tend to have longer execution times for the unprotected group compared to similar variants for the protected group. This could suggest that the unprotected group experiences longer waiting times or delays in their treatment processes.

It's important to note that these observations are based solely on the provided data and may not capture the complete picture or the underlying reasons for these differences. Further investigation and domain knowledge would be required to determine if these differences are indeed unfair or if there are legitimate reasons for the variations in treatment processes between the two groups.
