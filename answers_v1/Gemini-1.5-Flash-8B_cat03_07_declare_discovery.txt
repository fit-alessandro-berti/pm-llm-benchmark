#Important: This is a starting point.  A comprehensive model requires careful analysis of the data to
# define the precise relationships between activities.  The rules below are *examples*.  You'll need
# significantly more specific constraints to capture the actual process variability.


# Example adding some constraints (based on the data, but needing much more input and analysis).
# Example 1: Create Fine must always be first
declare_model['precedence']['Send Fine'] = {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}
declare_model['precedence']['Insert Fine Notification'] = {'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}
declare_model['precedence']['Add penalty'] = {'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}



# Example 2: Payment can happen after Create Fine, but other paths may exist.
declare_model['response']['Payment'] = {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}




# Example 3: Send for Credit Collection should only follow Add Penalty
declare_model['response']['Send for Credit Collection'] = {'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}

#Example 4.  Add more as required.  Define all the specific paths and relationships in your process

```

**Explanation and Crucial Improvements Needed:**

1. **Data Analysis is Key:** The provided example process variations are too high-level for a good Declare model.  You need to *analyze* the frequencies and paths in your data to define meaningful, detailed declarative rules.  For example, if the `Send Fine` activity always immediately follows `Create Fine`, then a direct `chainresponse` rule should be included between those activities. 
2. **Define Precise Relationships:**  Instead of generic "response" constraints, you need *specific* rules based on the data.  If a certain activity always happens *after* another, use precedence/response, and if the activities always happen in direct sequence, use chain constraints.  What is the relationship between "Payment" and "Send for Credit Collection"?  Do they ever appear together? Does "Send Appeal to Prefecture" ever happen without "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" coming before? 
3. **Non-Coexistence/Non-Succession Rules:**  If an activity *never* occurs with another activity, you need to add a `noncoexistence` rule.  If certain activities are mutually exclusive in terms of sequence, define specific `nonsuccession` rules.
4. **Handle Varied Paths:** The process variations are many. The declarative constraints should reflect the different possible sequences, not just a single common one. This is done through specific chains, precedence, and response rules for each specific path.
5. **Support and Confidence Values:** Assign proper support and confidence values. If a relationship is rare, then the support and confidence should be lower. You cannot simply set them to 1.0 for every declarative constraint.


**Example (Illustrative, Needs Refinement):**

```python
#Illustrative example; needs significant data analysis
declare_model['chainresponse']['Send Fine'] = {'Create Fine': {'support': 0.95, 'confidence': 0.98}} #High confidence Send Fine follows Create Fine
declare_model['response']['Insert Fine Notification'] = {'Send Fine': {'support': 0.85, 'confidence': 0.92}} 

#More complex response and non-succession examples would go here
#...
```

**How to use this:** This code generates a *template*. Fill it with accurate declarative rules reflecting the specific process characteristics from your data analysis. Then you can use this `declare_model` in `pm4py` for declarative mining.

Crucially, spend the time understanding your data to create a precise and accurate declarative model.  Simply setting values to 1.0 will likely not reflect the complexity of your process. Remember the frequency and performance data are very useful in this analysis.
