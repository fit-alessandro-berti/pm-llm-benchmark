To propose a list of 20 relevant questions over the process, I'll focus on questions that can help understand the efficiency, effectiveness, and bottlenecks in the process. I'll also provide a confidence score based on the data and information provided.

1. **Which process variant has the highest frequency?**
   - Confidence: 90% (Directly derived from the provided data)

2. **Which process variant has the lowest performance?**
   - Confidence: 90% (Directly derived from the provided data)

3. **What is the average performance of the process variants?**
   - Confidence: 90% (Can be calculated based on the provided data)

4. **Is there a significant difference in performance between the first and last steps of the process variants?**
   - Confidence: 85% (Based on the provided data, we can calculate the performance ratio between the first and last steps)

5. **Which process variant has the highest number of steps?**
   - Confidence: 90% (Directly derived from the provided data)
