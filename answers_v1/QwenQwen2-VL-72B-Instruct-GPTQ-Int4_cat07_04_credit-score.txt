The provided visualization is a flowchart that depicts the process of credit scoring from the perspective of a bank and a scoring service. The flowchart is divided into three main sections: "credit scoring frontend (bank)," "credit scoring (bank)," and "scoring service." Here is a detailed description of the process:

### Credit Scoring Frontend (Bank)
- **Start**: The process begins with the bank's credit scoring frontend.
- **Request Credit Score**: The bank initiates a request for a credit score.
- **Scoring Request Received**: The request is received by the credit scoring service.

### Credit Scoring (Bank)
- **Delay Information Received**: The bank receives information about any delays in the credit scoring process.
- **Report Delay**: The bank reports the delay.
- **Credit Score Received**: The bank receives the credit score from the scoring service.
- **Send Credit Score**: The bank sends the credit score to the frontend.
- **Scoring Request Handled**: The process is completed at the bank's end.

### Scoring Service
- **Scoring Request Received**: The scoring service receives the request for a credit score.
- **Compute Credit Score (Level 1)**: The scoring service computes the credit score at level 1.
- **Score Available?**: A decision is made to check if the score is available.
  - **Yes**: If the score is available, it is sent to the bank.
  - **No**: If the score is not available, a report delay is sent to the bank.
- **Report Delay**: The scoring service reports the delay.
- **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)**: The scoring service computes the credit score at level 2.
- **Send Credit Score**: The scoring service sends the credit score to the bank.
- **Scoring Request Handled**: The process is completed at the scoring service's end.

### Additional Notes
- There is a note indicating "incl. ID for message queuing," which suggests that a unique identifier is included for message queuing purposes.

This flowchart provides a clear and detailed representation of the credit scoring process, highlighting the interactions between the bank and the scoring service, as well as the decision points and potential delays in the process.
