Process cubes represent an advanced conceptual framework in multi-dimensional process mining that enables analysts to analyze process data from multiple perspectives and granularity levels. Here's a comprehensive analysis of process cubes and their distinction from traditional process mining approaches:

Key Components of Process Cubes:

1. Dimensions
- Time periods
- Process variants
- Organizational units
- Geographic locations
- Customer segments
- Performance indicators

2. Operations
a) Slice and Dice
- Isolate specific dimensional values
- Focus on particular process aspects
- Create targeted analysis views

b) Roll-up and Drill-down
- Aggregate/decompose process information
- Navigate between abstraction levels
- Analyze at different granularities

Differences from Traditional Process Mining:
