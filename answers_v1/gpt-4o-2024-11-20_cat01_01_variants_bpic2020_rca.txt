Understanding the potential root causes for performance issues in the process requires analyzing the provided process data and identifying patterns that contribute to high performance times (long durations) and low efficiency in terms of the number of handoffs, rejections, and loops in the process. Below are some key process and data-specific considerations based on the information in the dataset:

---

### **1. Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions Create Delays**
- **Observation**: Process variants with multiple rejection and resubmission loops tend to have much higher performance values (longer execution times). For example:
  - Variant with `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`  `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`  ... (loop)  **[Performance = 2542497.917]**.
  - A similar pattern with more rejection loops and resubmissions yields an even higher performance cost: **[Performance = 3502608.250]**.
- **Root Cause**: Each rejection increases delays as the process waits for the rejected task to be corrected, resubmitted, and reprocessed. When multiple rejection loops repeat, the performance cost escalates significantly.

---

### **2. Interaction with Multiple Approvers**
- **Observation**: Process variants with extra steps for approval from additional roles (e.g., *PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER*) exhibit longer performance times. For example:
  - Involving multiple approver roles: 
    - **`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION  Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER  Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`**: [Performance = 1084338.407].
    - Without BUDGET OWNER, e.g., **`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`** directly: [Performance = 810187.903].
  - Introducing new approver(s) increases decision-making and coordination delays.
- **Root Cause**: Each additional approver introduces latency caused by handoffs, pending approvals, or potential misalignment among approvers.

---

### **3. Complex Approval Chains Involving Multiple Rejections**
- **Observation**: Process steps with re-approvals or rejected tasks being sent to multiple decision-makers sequentially extend process duration.
  - E.g.: Variants combining **`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION  Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`**  **`Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`**  Resubmission  Repeat approvals excessively increase the total performance time.
  - A highly complex case: **[Performance = 2790977.310]** involves repeated rejections and the need to pass through multiple approvers.
- **Root Cause**: Longer approval chains amplify delays because rejected declarations often need to return to the previous stage(s) for reevaluation, creating a back-and-forth loop between roles.

---

### **4. Late Stage Rejection of Declarations**
- **Observation**: Variants with declarations rejected at later stages (e.g., by **SUPERVISOR** or **BUDGET OWNER**) have higher performance issues because much of the prior work is wasted, and resubmission restarts the approval workflow. For example:
  - Variant: `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR  Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE  Resubmission` ... [Performance = 1728631.623].
  - Late rejections by **SUPERVISOR** after early approvals indicate that issues are only discovered late, causing significant rework and delays.
- **Root Cause**: Errors or noncompliance issues that are not flagged early in the process propagate downstream, leading to bottlenecks and expensive corrective actions near the end of the process.

---

### **5. Complex Loops with Rare Scenarios**
- **Observation**: Variants with rare but highly complex sequences tend to have extreme performance values due to their deviations from the standard path. For example:
  - A complex rejection and resubmission loop involving **4+ iterations** before final approval: [Performance = 3502608.250].
  - A series of repeated *REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION* loops: [Performance = 2790977.310].
  - These scenarios have low frequency but reflect processes where inefficiencies or significant issues arise.
- **Root Cause**: Rare edge cases with excessive loops or errors that propagate through the process result in disproportionately high delays, indicating process inefficiencies in handling exceptional cases.

---

### **6. Steps Without Actionable Outcomes**
- **Observation**: Some variants include process steps that do not lead to an actionable outcome or contribute value directly. For example:
  - **`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`**: [Performance = 0.000, Frequency = 134].
  - Variants where tasks are rejected (by **ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR**) but never resubmitted, e.g.,:
    - **`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR  Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`**: [Performance = 653277.889].
  - These steps indicate wasted effort with no result for the process goal.
- **Root Cause**: Idle or unnecessary steps (e.g., saving drafts that are never submitted) or unresolved rejections cause inefficiency without driving progress toward workflow objectives.

---

### **7. Outliers with Exorbitant Performance Times**
- **Observation**: Certain rare process variants stand out due to exceptionally high performance values, e.g.:
  - **`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`**: [Performance = 13805869.200].
  - These outliers may be due to unusual circumstances like escalations, significant employee or approver delays, or system issues.
- **Root Cause**: These extreme cases likely arise due to either human inefficiencies (e.g., lack of timely action from parties), systemic inefficiencies (e.g., workflow misconfiguration), or technical problems (e.g., delays caused by IT systems).

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Reduce Rejections**: Analyze causes of rejections at each step and implement preventive measures (e.g., employee training, better quality checks at submission).
2. **Streamline Approval Chain**: Minimize the number of approvers for standard cases (e.g., eliminating **BUDGET OWNER** for smaller requests).
3. **Flag Critical Issues Early**: Implement workflows to detect issues earlier in the process (e.g., during **ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL**) rather than in later stages.
4. **Optimize Handling of Rare Cases**: Address rare and complex cases separately with specific workflows optimized for efficiency.
5. **Monitor and Address Outliers**: Investigate outliers with exorbitant performance times to identify any systemic or human inefficiencies.

By focusing on these root causes and addressing the inefficiencies in the process and data, overall performance can be significantly improved.
