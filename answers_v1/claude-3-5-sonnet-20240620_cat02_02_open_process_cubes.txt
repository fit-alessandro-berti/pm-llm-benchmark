Process cubes represent an advanced approach in multi-dimensional process mining that extends traditional process mining techniques. Here's a concise overview of their role and how they differ from traditional approaches:

Role of process cubes:
1. Provide a multi-dimensional view of processes
2. Enable analysis across different perspectives and granularities
3. Support comparative analysis of process variants

Key differences from traditional process mining:

1. Dimensionality:
   Traditional: Typically focuses on a single process perspective
   Process cubes: Incorporate multiple dimensions (e.g., time, resources, activities)

2. Granularity:
   Traditional: Often analyzes processes at a fixed level of detail
   Process cubes: Allow for flexible aggregation and drill-down across dimensions

3. Comparative analysis:
   Traditional: Limited ability to compare process variants
   Process cubes: Facilitate easy comparison of different process slices

4. Data organization:
   Traditional: Usually works with flat event logs
   Process cubes: Organize data in a multi-dimensional structure

5. Analytical capabilities:
   Traditional: Focuses on discovering and analyzing a single process model
   Process cubes: Enable more complex analyses, including trend detection and anomaly identification across dimensions

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of process cubes or their comparison to traditional process mining approaches?
