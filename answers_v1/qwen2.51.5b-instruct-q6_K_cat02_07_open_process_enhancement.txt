Process mining is an emerging field that combines techniques from data science, machine learning, and software engineering to discover and understand business processes within large amounts of historical transactional event data. Process mining can be thought of as a combination of two main tasks:

1. **Process Discovery**: This involves automating the process of identifying the underlying structure or model of real-world workflows that generate this data. It starts with raw unstructured data (event logs) and uses algorithms to infer how work is performed by analyzing sequences of events from different activities, such as phone calls or user interactions.

2. **Conformance Checking**: Once a process model has been discovered, conformance checking verifies whether the actual system's behavior matches that inferred process model within predefined criteria for accuracy, completeness, and relevance. This helps ensure that the processes being followed are indeed as expected by business objectives and standards.

Process enhancement involves applying improvements directly to the process models identified during discovery. These improvements can include changes to existing processes or creation of new ones based on insights gained from analyzing data and process modeling. Unlike traditional methods like optimizing a single point in an existing workflow, process enhancement aims to redesign and streamline the entire business process, which may involve iterative cycles of process discovery, conformance checking, and improvement.

**Key Differences:**
- **Focus**: While process discovery is about building a precise model of how work gets done, process mining focuses on understanding processes through historical data. Process enhancement uses this knowledge to make changes that improve efficiency or effectiveness.
  
- **Scope**: Discovering the underlying structure is more focused; it's like creating a blueprint for your workflow. Enhancing involves using this blueprint to implement specific improvements, such as adding new steps, changing existing ones, and optimizing workflows.

- **Outcome**: The outcomes of process discovery are often referred to as "process models," whereas conformance checking verifies these against expectations or standards. Process enhancement results in the actual changes made to real processes based on what's learned from data analysis.

Understanding the distinctions between these phases helps explain how process mining can be more effective when it aims not just at understanding but also at transforming business processes through practical application and improvement.
