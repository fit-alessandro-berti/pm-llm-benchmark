Analyzing the provided directly follows graph, several performance issues can be identified:

1. **High frequency of "Load Truck"**: The high frequency of "Load Truck" events (8559) with a relatively low number of objects (6) for the Truck object type, and (8559) with a higher number of objects (1896) for the Container object type, suggests that the loading process is inefficient. This might be due to inadequate resource allocation, inefficient loading strategies, or inadequate container management.

2. **Long duration between "Weigh" and "Place in Stock"**: For the Container object type, the duration between "Weigh" and "Place in Stock" is relatively long (2559.54), which could indicate inefficiencies in the weighing process, transportation, or storage.

3. **High frequency and duration of "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Load to Vehicle"**: For the Forklift object type, the high frequency and duration of "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Load to Vehicle" events suggest that the forklift operations are a bottleneck in the process. This might be due to inadequate forklift capacity, inefficient loading strategies, or poor warehouse layout.

4. **Long duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container"**: For the Container object type, the long duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" (368943.92) indicates potential issues with container supply chain management, such as inadequate forecasting, transportation, or inventory management.

5. **High frequency and duration of "Reschedule Container"**: For the Container and Transport Document object types, the high frequency and duration of "Reschedule Container" events suggest that there are issues with container scheduling, allocation, or availability, leading to delays and inefficiencies.

6. **Long duration between "Create Transport Document" and "Book Vehicles"**: For the Transport Document object type, the long duration between "Create Transport Document" and "Book Vehicles" (22207.07) could indicate inefficiencies in the transportation planning and booking process.

7. **High frequency and duration of "Depart"**: For the Transport Document object type, the high frequency and duration of "Depart" events, including the loop "Depart" -> "Depart", suggest that there are issues with transportation execution, such as delays, cancellations, or changes in transportation plans.

8. **Inefficient use of resources**: The high frequency of events for certain object types, such as Forklift and Truck, suggests that these resources are being overutilized, while others, like Vehicle, are underutilized. This could indicate poor resource allocation or scheduling.

These performance issues can be addressed by optimizing resource allocation, improving process efficiency, and streamlining container management, transportation planning, and warehouse operations.
