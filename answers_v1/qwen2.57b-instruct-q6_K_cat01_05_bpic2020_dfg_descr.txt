Based on the provided data, it appears that the process involves a series of steps in a declaration and payment handling workflow. Here's a high-level description of the process:

### Process Overview:
1. **Employee Submits Declaration** (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`):
   - This is the initial step where an employee initiates the process by submitting a declaration.

2. **Approval Flow**:
   - The declaration then moves through various approval stages, starting with administrative approvals and moving up to more senior management.
   
3. **Payment Request** (`Request Payment`):
   - Once the declaration is finally approved (either by the supervisor or another approver), it triggers a payment request.

4. **Payment Handling**:
   - After the payment request is initiated, the payment is handled.

5. **Rejection Flow**:
   - If any step in the approval process leads to rejection, the declaration may be returned to the employee for further action or correction.
   
6. **Final Approval and Payment Completion**:
   - The final step involves the supervisor's approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), which triggers the payment handling.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Employee Submits Declaration** (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`):
   - This is the starting point of the process where an employee initiates a declaration.
   - Frequency: 8202, Performance: 99860.580

2. **Administrative Approvals**:
   - The declaration can move to multiple levels of approval within the administration and budget owner roles (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`).
   - These steps are designed to ensure that the financial aspects of the declaration are correctly reviewed.

3. **Pre-Approver Approval**:
   - If there's a pre-approver involved, they must approve the declaration before it can move further (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`).

4. **Final Supervisor Approval**:
   - The final step in the approval process is usually handled by the supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - Frequency: 7921 (combining both direct and indirect paths), Performance: Varies based on different paths.

5. **Payment Request**:
   - Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is initiated.
   - This step triggers further processing to handle the actual payment (`Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`).

6. **Rejection Paths**:
   - There are multiple rejection points where the process can fail or be redirected for correction.
   - For example, if any approver rejects a declaration, it may return to the employee for resubmission or correction.

7. **Final Payment Handling and Completion**:
   - If all approvals are successful, the final step is the payment handling (`Payment Handled`), which marks the completion of the process.
   - Frequency: 3 (combining different paths through `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` -> `Request Payment` -> `Payment Handled`).

### Summary:
The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration and moves through multiple approval stages, including administrative approvals, pre-approval, and supervisor final approval. If all steps are successfully passed, it leads to the generation of a payment request, which is then handled for processing. There are various rejection paths at different points in the process that can lead back to the employee or earlier stages for correction.

This workflow ensures that financial transactions are accurately reviewed and authorized before any payments are made.
