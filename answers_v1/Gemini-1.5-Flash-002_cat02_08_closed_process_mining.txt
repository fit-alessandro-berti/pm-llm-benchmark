Let's examine the opposite and a more general concept for each provided process mining concept:


| Process Mining Concept | Opposite Concept | More General Concept | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Automated Process Discovery** | **Manual Process Discovery** | **Process Understanding** | APD uses algorithms to extract processes from event logs. The opposite relies on manual analysis of documents, interviews, and observations.  The general concept encompasses all ways of understanding how a process works, whether automated or manual. |
| **Predictive Monitoring** | **Reactive Monitoring** | **Process Monitoring** | Predictive monitoring anticipates deviations. Reactive monitoring only responds after a problem is already evident. Process monitoring is the overarching term, including both predictive and reactive approaches. |
| **Bottom-up Discovery** | **Top-down Discovery** | **Process Modeling** | Bottom-up starts with event logs. Top-down starts with a pre-existing process model and checks conformance. Process modeling is the broader field encompassing both approaches as well as methods like creating models from scratch. |
| **Process Simulation** | **Process Execution (without simulation)** | **Process Analysis** | Process simulation uses a model to predict outcomes.  Process execution refers to the actual running of the process. Process analysis is a more general umbrella term encompassing all methods for investigating a process (simulation, execution analysis, etc.).|
| **Process Efficiency** | **Process Inefficiency** | **Process Performance** |  Efficiency focuses on minimizing resource consumption. Inefficiency signifies wasted resources.  Performance is a more general term encompassing various aspects of process quality, including efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance. |
| **Real-time Monitoring** | **Post-hoc Monitoring/Analysis** | **Process Observation** | Real-time monitoring provides immediate feedback. Post-hoc analysis examines data after the fact.  Process observation broadly refers to any method of observing and gathering information about a process, encompassing both real-time and retrospective methods. |


In summary, the "opposite" concepts highlight alternative approaches within the process mining domain, while the "more general" concepts place the specific process mining techniques within a broader context of process management and analysis.
