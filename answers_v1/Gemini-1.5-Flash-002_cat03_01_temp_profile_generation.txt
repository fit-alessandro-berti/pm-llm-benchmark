    ('Order Approval', 'Goods Receipt'): (604800, 86400), # 7 days avg, 1 day stdev (exceptional case, might be due to external factors)

    #Adding some alternative paths for more realism

**Explanation of the values:**

The times are given in seconds.  The averages and standard deviations reflect potential variations in processing times.  Some activities, like Goods Receipt, have longer average times and higher standard deviations due to external factors (shipping, supplier delays). The large standard deviation on the total process time reflects the many potential variations in the process.  Adding alternative paths (cancellation) makes the model more robust and realistic.  Consider these values as examples â€“ actual values will vary greatly based on the specific organization and its processes.  A real-world implementation would involve gathering data from process executions to determine these values statistically.
