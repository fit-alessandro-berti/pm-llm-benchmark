Sure! Let's consider a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. The typical activities in a P2P process might include:

1. **Purchase Order (PO)**
2. **Goods Receipt (GR)**
3. **Invoice Receipt (IR)**
4. **Invoice Approval (IA)**
5. **Payment (P)**

For simplicity, let's assume the following average times and standard deviations between these activities:

- **PO to GR**: Average time is 3 days (259200 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **PO to IR**: Average time is 5 days (432000 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **PO to IA**: Average time is 6 days (518400 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **PO to P**: Average time is 7 days (604800 seconds), standard deviation is 2 days (172800 seconds).
- **GR to IR**: Average time is 2 days (172800 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **GR to IA**: Average time is 3 days (259200 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **GR to P**: Average time is 4 days (345600 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **IR to IA**: Average time is 1 day (86400 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **IR to P**: Average time is 2 days (172800 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).
- **IA to P**: Average time is 1 day (86400 seconds), standard deviation is 1 day (86400 seconds).

Given these assumptions, the temporal profile for the Purchase-to-Pay process can be represented as follows:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('PO', 'GR'): (259200, 86400),
    ('PO', 'IR'): (432000, 172800),
    ('PO', 'IA'): (518400, 172800),
    ('PO', 'P'): (604800, 172800),
    ('GR', 'IR'): (172800, 86400),
    ('GR', 'IA'): (259200, 86400),
    ('GR', 'P'): (345600, 86400),
    ('IR', 'IA'): (86400, 86400),
    ('IR', 'P'): (172800, 86400),
    ('IA', 'P'): (86400, 86400)
}
```

This dictionary associates each pair of activities with a tuple containing the average time (in seconds) and the standard deviation (in seconds) between the activities. You can use this temporal profile to detect deviations in the process execution based on the value of ZETA.
