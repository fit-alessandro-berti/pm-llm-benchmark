```

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Data Representation:** The log is now represented as a dictionary where keys are trace strings and values are tuples of (frequency, performance).

2. **Iterating Through Traces:** The code iterates through each trace, extracts activity pairs, and calculates the average time between them *for each occurrence*. This is crucial for accurate standard deviation calculation.

3. **Sorted Activity Pairs:** Activity pairs are sorted using `tuple(sorted(...))` to ensure that (`A`, `B`) and (`B`, `A`) are treated as the same pair, preventing duplicates in the `temporal_profile`.

4. **Handling Standard Deviation for Single Occurrences:**  The code now checks `if len(times) > 1` before calculating the standard deviation. If there's only one occurrence of a pair, the standard deviation is set to 0. This prevents `statistics.stdev` from raising an error.

5. **Calculating Average and Standard Deviation:** After processing all traces, the code calculates the average and standard deviation for each activity pair using the collected times.

6. **Output:** The resulting `temporal_profile` is a dictionary where keys are activity pairs and values are tuples of (average, standard deviation).

This improved code accurately calculates the temporal profile by considering the individual durations between activities for each occurrence in the log, leading to a more precise representation of time variability.  It also handles the edge case where only one occurrence of an activity pair exists. This provides a robust and correct solution for generating a temporal profile from the given log data.
