This diagram depicts a business process for credit scoring using a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) notation.  Let's break down the process flow:

**Overall Process:** The diagram shows two main lanes representing two distinct systems:

1. **Credit Scoring (Bank):** This lane represents the bank's system initiating and managing the credit scoring request.
2. **Scoring Service:** This lane represents the external service responsible for actually computing the credit score.


**Process Steps:**

1. **Credit Scoring (Bank) Lane:**
    * **Scoring Request Received:** The process begins when the bank receives a credit scoring request.
    * **Request Credit Score:** The bank sends a request to the scoring service.
    * **Decision Point (XOR Gateway):**  The bank awaits either a credit score or a delay notification from the scoring service.

2. **Scoring Service Lane:**
    * **Scoring Request Received:** The scoring service receives the request.
    * **Compute Credit Score (Level 1):** The service attempts to compute the credit score.
    * **Decision Point (XOR Gateway):**  If the score is available, it proceeds; otherwise, it reports a delay.
    * **Report Delay:** If the score cannot be computed immediately, a delay is reported back to the bank.  The dotted line indicates asynchronous communication and likely message queuing.  Thereâ€™s an implicit assumption that a subsequent attempt to compute the score is done after a certain time.
    * **Send Credit Score:** If the score is computed successfully, it is sent back to the bank.
    * **Scoring Request Handled:** Once the score is sent or delay reported, the request is marked as handled within the scoring service.

3. **Credit Scoring (Bank) Lane (Continued):**
    * **Credit Score Received:** The bank receives the credit score from the scoring service.
    * **Send Credit Score:** The bank sends the received score to its next step (not explicitly shown).  This assumes the score is then used within the bank's internal workflow.
    * **Delay Information Received:** If a delay is reported, the bank records the delay notification.
    * **Report Delay:** The bank handles the delay notification (details not shown).
    * **Scoring Request Handled:** Finally, the credit scoring request is marked as handled within the bank's system.

**Key Aspects:**

* **Asynchronous Communication:**  The dashed lines indicate asynchronous communication (i.e., not real-time, allowing the systems to work independently).
* **Error Handling:** The process implicitly handles delays, but it lacks explicit error handling for other potential issues (e.g., service unavailability).
* **Message Queuing:** The dotted line with the note "inkl. ID for message queuing" suggests that messages are placed in a queue when delays occur to manage workload and prevent immediate blocking.
* **Level 1 & Level 2 Credit Scores:**  The use of "Level 1" and "Level 2" computation suggests there might be two different scoring algorithms or data sources, possibly with varying complexity or speed.


**In Summary:**

The diagram illustrates a relatively simple but robust credit scoring process. It clearly outlines the interaction between the bank's system and the external scoring service, incorporating error handling for delays and facilitating asynchronous communication. The use of BPMN allows for a clear visualization of the steps involved and the flow of information between the different systems.
