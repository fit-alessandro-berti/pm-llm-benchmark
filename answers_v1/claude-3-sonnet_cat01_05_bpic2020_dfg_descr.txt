Based on the provided data, it appears to be a process related to expense declaration or reimbursement approval within an organization. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration/expense claim (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. The declaration goes through various approval stages:
   a. Pre-approval by a pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER)
   b. Approval by the administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION)
   c. Approval by the budget owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER)
   d. Final approval by the supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR)

3. At any stage, the declaration can be rejected by the respective approver (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR). In such cases, the declaration is typically sent back to the employee for revision or resubmission.

4. If the declaration is finally approved by the supervisor, a request for payment is initiated (Request Payment), and subsequently, the payment is handled (Payment Handled).

5. There are also some exceptional cases, such as a declaration being rejected by a missing approver (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING), or an already approved declaration being rejected (e.g., Payment Handled -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE).

6. The data also includes frequency and performance metrics (possibly representing the average processing time) for each step in the process.

Overall, it appears to be a multi-step approval process for expense declarations or reimbursement requests, involving various stakeholders like employees, pre-approvers, administrators, budget owners, and supervisors. The process includes approval, rejection, and payment handling steps, with provisions for resubmission and exceptional cases.
