To generate a temporal profile for the given process variants, we need to determine the average and standard deviation of the time intervals between each pair of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution.

Given the complexity and the volume of the provided data, let's break down the steps to calculate the temporal profile:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs and Times**: For each process variant, extract the pairs of activities and the corresponding times between them.
2. **Calculate Averages and Standard Deviations**: Compute the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities.
3. **Construct the Temporal Profile**: Organize the results into a dictionary with activity pairs as keys and tuples of (average time, standard deviation) as values.

Let's start with an example calculation for a few process variants to illustrate how this can be done.

### Example Calculation

#### Process Variant: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection
- Pairs: (Create Fine, Send Fine), (Send Fine, Insert Fine Notification), (Insert Fine Notification, Add penalty), (Add penalty, Send for Credit Collection)
- Times: 59591524.946, 3600, 3600, 3600 (hypothetical values for illustration)

#### Process Variant: Create Fine -> Payment
- Pairs: (Create Fine, Payment)
- Times: 889688.400 (hypothetical value for illustration)

### Full Calculation

To perform the full calculation, we need to parse all the variants, extract the pairs, and compute the statistics. Here is a Python code snippet to help automate this process:

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Sample process variants (simplified for illustration)
process_variants = [
    ("Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Send for Credit Collection", 59591524.946),
    ("Create Fine", "Payment", 889688.400),
    # Add more process variants here
]

# Function to extract activity pairs and times
def extract_pairs_and_times(variants):
    pairs_and_times = defaultdict(list)
    for variant in variants:
        activities = variant[:-1]  # Exclude the performance time
        times = [variant[-1]]  # Extract the performance time
        for i in range(len(activities) - 1):
            pairs_and_times[(activities[i], activities[i + 1])].append(times[0])
    return pairs_and_times

# Extract pairs and times
pairs_and_times = extract_pairs_and_times(process_variants)

# Calculate averages and standard deviations
temporal_profile = {}
for (activity1, activity2), times in pairs_and_times.items():
    avg_time = np.mean(times)
    std_dev = np.std(times)
    temporal_profile[(activity1, activity2)] = (avg_time, std_dev)

# Output the temporal profile
print(temporal_profile)
```

### Result

The `temporal_profile` dictionary will contain the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities. For example, it might look like this (with hypothetical values):

```python
{
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (avg_time1, std_dev1),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (avg_time2, std_dev2),
    # More pairs and their statistics
}
```

### Full Processing

For the full list of provided process variants, you would need to:
1. Parse each variant to extract activity pairs and times.
2. Store these times in the `pairs_and_times` dictionary.
3. Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair.
4. Construct the final temporal profile.

This process can be automated using the provided code structure, extended to include all the variants you have listed.
