The process describes the steps involved in a medical procedure, likely a central venous catheter insertion guided by ultrasound. It starts with preparation and ends with confirming catheter placement and function. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Preparation Phase:**

* **Prepare implements:** Gathering necessary equipment.
* **Hand washing:** Standard hygiene procedure.
* **Get in sterile clothes:** Maintaining a sterile environment.
* **Clean puncture area:** Preparing the patient's skin.
* **Drap puncture area:** Covering the area with sterile drapes.
* **Ultrasound configuration:** Setting up the ultrasound machine.
* **Gel in probe:** Applying ultrasound gel to the probe.
* **Cover probe:** Covering the probe with a sterile sheath.
* **Put sterile gel:** Applying sterile gel to the patient's skin.
* **Position probe:** Placing the ultrasound probe for imaging.
* **Position patient:** Ensuring the patient is in the correct position.

**2. Vein Identification Phase:**

* **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):**  This gateway represents a choice of identification methods.
* **Doppler identification:** Using Doppler ultrasound to locate the vein.
* **Anatomic identification:** Identifying the vein based on anatomical landmarks.
* **Compression identification:** Identifying the vein by applying pressure.
* **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):**  All identification methods lead to the next step.

**3. Anesthesia and Puncture Phase:**

* **Anesthetize:** Numbing the puncture area.
* **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):**  Ensuring anesthesia is effective before proceeding.
* **Puncture:** Inserting the needle into the vein.
* **Blood return:** Confirming needle placement by observing blood return.

**4. Catheter Insertion Phase:**

* **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):**  This gateway handles potential complications during blood return.
    * **Successful blood return path:**
        * **Drop probe:** Removing the ultrasound probe (likely after successful initial placement).
        * **Remove syringe:** Detaching the syringe from the needle.
        * **Guidewire install:** Inserting the guidewire through the needle.
        * **Remove trocar:** Removing the needle, leaving the guidewire in place.
        * **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):**  Represents a choice of wire position checks.
        * **Check wire in long axis:** Verify guidewire placement via ultrasound in long axis view.
        * **Check wire in short axis:** Verify guidewire placement via ultrasound in short axis view.
        * **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):**  Both checks lead to the next step.
        * **Wire in good position:** Confirmation of proper guidewire placement.
        * **Exclusive Gateway (Diverging):**  Potential need for pathway widening.
        * **Widen pathway (optional):**  If needed, dilating the pathway for catheter insertion.
        * **Advance catheter:** Inserting the catheter over the guidewire.
        * **Remove guidewire:** Removing the guidewire, leaving the catheter in place.
        * **Check flow and reflow:** Confirming catheter patency and function.
        * **Check catheter position:** Final check of catheter placement.
    * **Unsuccessful blood return path (looping back):**
        * **Exclusive Gateway (Converging):** Allows for repeated puncture attempts.

**5. Completion:**

* **End Event:**  The procedure is complete.


The process includes several decision points (exclusive gateways) and a loop for handling potential issues during puncture. This provides a robust and flexible workflow for this medical procedure.
