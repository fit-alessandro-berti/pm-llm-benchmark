Certainly. Here's a list of 20 relevant questions about the process, along with confidence scores (on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is the highest confidence) based on the information provided:

1. What is the most common process variant? (Confidence: 10)

2. Which variant has the highest frequency? (Confidence: 10)

3. What percentage of declarations are approved without any rejections? (Confidence: 9)

4. How many declarations are submitted but never reach the "Payment Handled" stage? (Confidence: 8)

5. What is the average performance time for declarations that are approved on the first attempt? (Confidence: 9)

6. How often does the BUDGET OWNER get involved in the approval process? (Confidence: 9)

7. What percentage of declarations are rejected by the ADMINISTRATION? (Confidence: 8)

8. How many steps are in the longest process variant? (Confidence: 10)

9. What is the role of the PRE_APPROVER and how often are they involved? (Confidence: 8)

10. What percentage of rejected declarations are resubmitted? (Confidence: 7)

11. How does the involvement of a BUDGET OWNER affect the performance time? (Confidence: 8)

12. What is the average number of rejections before a declaration is finally approved? (Confidence: 7)

13. How often does the SUPERVISOR reject a declaration after it has been approved by ADMINISTRATION? (Confidence: 8)

14. What is the significance of the "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" variant and why does it have zero performance time? (Confidence: 6)

15. How does the performance time change when a declaration goes through multiple rejection-resubmission cycles? (Confidence: 8)

16. What percentage of declarations are approved by the SUPERVISOR without prior approval from ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER? (Confidence: 9)

17. How often does the mysterious "MISSING" role appear in the process, and what might it represent? (Confidence: 6)

18. What is the average performance time for declarations that are ultimately handled? (Confidence: 8)

19. How does the involvement of a PRE_APPROVER affect the likelihood of final approval? (Confidence: 7)

20. What percentage of declarations go through the simplest path (SUBMITTED -> APPROVED -> FINAL_APPROVED -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled)? (Confidence: 9)

I'd be happy to elaborate on any of these questions or discuss the reasoning behind them if you'd like.
