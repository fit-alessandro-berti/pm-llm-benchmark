Here's a sample DECLARE model for the Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
{
    'existence': {
        'Purchase': 1.0, 'Payment': 1.0,
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
        # Add other existence constraints here
    },
    'absence': {'Purchase': 0.0}, 
    'exactly_one': {'Purchase': 1.0},
    'init': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0, 
        # Add other initialization constraints here
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0,
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
        'Purchase Payment': 1.0,  # Respond to the presence of each card
        'Payment Charge Card': 1.0,  # Respond to the absence of Authorization Card but present Charge Card
    },
    'coexistence': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0, 
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
    },
    'response': {
        'Purchase Payment': 1.0,  # Respond to the purchase payment (only for Purchase)
        'Payment Charge Card': 1.0,  # Respond to the absence of Authorization Card but present Charge Card
    },
    'precedence': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0,
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
    },
    'succession': {
        'Purchase Payment': {'Charge Card': 1.0},  # Successor to the presence of Authorization Card but not present Charge Card
        'Payment Charge Card': 1.0,  # Successor to the absence of Authorization Card and present Charge Card
    },
    'altresponse': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0,
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
    },
    'altprecedence': {
        'Purchase Payment': {'Charge Card': 1.0},  # Alternator to the presence of Authorization Card but not present Charge Card
        'Payment Charge Card': 1.0,  # Alternator to the absence of Authorization Card and present Charge Card
    },
    'altsuccession': {
        'Authorization Card': 1.0,
        'Charge Card': 1.0,
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        'Authorization Card': {'Payment Charge Card': 1.0},  # Chain to the presence of Payment Charge Card but not present Authorization Card
        'Charge Card': 1.0,  # Chain to the absence of Payment Charge Card and present Authorization Card
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        'Authorization Card': {'Payment Charge Card': 1.0},  # Chain predecessor to the presence of Payment Charge Card but not present Authorization Card
        'Charge Card': 1.0,  # Chain predecessor to the absence of Payment Charge Card and present Authorization Card
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        'Authorization Card': {'Payment Charge Card': 0.0},  # Do not coexist (i.e., do not respond)
        'Charge Card': {'Purchase Payment': 1.0}  # Can coexist with Purchase Payment
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        'Payment Charge Card': 1.0,  # Cannot succeed
        'Purchase Payment': 0.0,  # Cannot precede
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        'Authorization Card': {'Charge Card': 1.0}  # Cannot chain to (i.e., cannot respond)
    }
}
```

This model defines the following constraints:

- Existence of activities: `Purchase`, `Payment`, and `Charge Card`.
- Absence of activities: `Authorization Card` only.
- Exactly one occurrence constraint: `Purchase Payment`.
- Responded existence:
  - Authorization Card with Charge Card: responds to the presence of each card (both present or absent).
  - Charge Card without Authorization Card but present Purchase Payment: responds to the absence of Authorization Card and presence of Charge Card.
- Coexistence:
  - Authorization Card with Charge Card: coexists with both cards.
- Response constraints:
  - Purchase payment: responds to purchase.
  - Payment Charge Card: responds to absence of Authorization Card but present Charge Card.
- Precedence constraints:
  - Authorization Card to Purchase Payment: precedes the presence of Purchase Payment (but not Purchase itself).
  - Charge Card to Payment Charge Card: follows the absence of Payment Charge Card and presentation of Authorization Card.
- Altresponse constraints:
  - Authorization Card with Charge Card: responds alternator to the presence of Authorization Card but not Charge Card.
  - Charge Card with Payment Charge Card: responds alternator to the absence of Payment Charge Card and Presentation of Authorization Card.
- Altprecedence constraints:
  - Purchase payment with Charge Card: precedes the existence of both cards.
  - Payment charge card with authorization card: follows the presence of Payment Charge Card and presentation of Authorization Card (i.e., responds).
- Altsuccession constraints:
  - Authorization Card with Payment Charge Card: precedes the coexistence of both cards.
  - Charge Card with Purchase payment: responds alternator to the absence of Charge Card and Presence of Purchase payment.
- Chainresponse constraints:
  - Authorization card with Payment charge card: follows the non-existence of Payment charge card and presence of Authorization card (i.e., responds).
  - Charge card with purchase payment: precedes the coexistence of both cards (i.e., responds).
- Chainprecedence constraints:
  - Authorization card with payment charge card: follows the existence of Payment charge card and Presence of Authorization card.
  - Charge card without Purchase payment: responds alternator to the non-existence of Payment charge card and Presence of Authorization card.
- Noncoexistence constraints:
  - Authorization Card with Charge Card: cannot coexist (i.e., does not respond).
  - Charge Card with Purchase Payment: cannot succeed or precede.
- Nonsuccession constraints:
  - Payment charge card: cannot succeed.
  - Purchase payment: cannot precede.
- Nonchainsuccession constraints:
  - Authorization card: cannot chain to Charge card.
