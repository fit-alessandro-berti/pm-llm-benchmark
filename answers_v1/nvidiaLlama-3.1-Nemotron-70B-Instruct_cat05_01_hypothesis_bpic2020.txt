Below are 20 relevant questions proposed based on the provided process variants, along with a confidence score for each. The confidence score (out of 100) reflects how directly the question relates to observable aspects of the process variants, with higher scores indicating more direct relevance.

### Questions and Confidence Scores

1. **What is the most common initial approver role after an employee submits a declaration?**
   - Confidence Score: **95**

2. **How often do declarations get final approval without being rejected at any stage?**
   - Confidence Score: **92** (Assumes "without being rejected" can be inferred from provided paths)

3. **What is the average performance (duration) for the entire process across all variants?**
   - Confidence Score: **98** (Directly calculable from provided data)

4. **Which role is most frequently involved in rejecting declarations?**
   - Confidence Score: **96**

5. **What percentage of declarations are submitted but not approved (including saved, rejected, or missing paths)?**
   - Confidence Score: **90** (Requires some inference for "not approved")

6. **How does the performance (duration) of declarations approved by PRE_APPROVER compare to those approved by ADMINISTRATION?**
   - Confidence Score: **94**

7. **What is the frequency of declarations that are rejected by both ADMINISTRATION and EMPLOYEE in sequence?**
   - Confidence Score: **91** (Directly observable with some path analysis)

8. **Can declarations be final approved without going through an APPROVED BY ADMINISTRATION step? If so, how often?**
   - Confidence Score: **93** (Directly observable from paths)

9. **What is the longest duration ('performance') recorded for any single process variant?**
   - Confidence Score: **99** (Directly observable from provided data)

10. **How many distinct roles are involved in the approval or rejection process?**
    - Confidence Score: **97** (Directly observable from roles mentioned)

11. **What is the impact on process duration when a declaration is rejected by SUPERVISOR vs. ADMINISTRATION?**
    - Confidence Score: **88** (Comparative analysis required, assumes duration impact is of interest)

12. **Are there any process variants where a declaration is approved without any rejections but still involves more than two approver roles?**
    - Confidence Score: **89** (Requires path analysis, assumes "more than two" is a point of interest)

13. **What percentage of the total process frequency is represented by the top 3 most frequent variants?**
    - Confidence Score: **95** (Directly calculable from provided frequencies)

14. **How often do declarations get rejected at more than one level before being approved?**
    - Confidence Score: **92** (Requires some path analysis)

15. **Is there a significant difference in process duration between declarations finally approved by SUPERVISOR with or without a PRE_APPROVER step?**
    - Confidence Score: **85** (Comparative analysis required, assumes 'significance' can be quantified)

16. **What is the shortest process duration ('performance') for any variant that includes a rejection step?**
    - Confidence Score: **96** (Directly observable with some path analysis)

17. **Can a declaration bypass the Request Payment step after final approval? If so, how often?**
    - Confidence Score: **80** (Assumes inference is needed for 'bypass' scenarios not explicitly listed)

18. **How does the frequency of declarations approved by BUDGET OWNER compare to those not requiring this role?**
    - Confidence Score: **94** (Directly observable from paths and frequencies)

19. **What is the average number of steps in the process variants that result in a Payment Handled outcome?**
    - Confidence Score: **87** (Requires some path analysis, assumes 'average steps' is of interest)

20. **Are there any process variants indicating a "MISSING" step that still result in a successful Payment Handled outcome?**
    - Confidence Score: **91** (Directly observable from specific paths mentioning "MISSING")

**Methodology for Confidence Scoring:**

- **95-100%**: Directly calculable or observable from the provided data without inference.
- **85-94%**: Requires minimal inference or comparative analysis but is largely supported by the data.
- **75-84%**: Involves more significant inference or analysis that assumes implicit aspects of the process not directly stated.
- **Below 75%**: Questions that either require external context, significant assumptions, or are based on aspects not directly covered by the provided process variants.
