11. Which task follows the "Ultrasound configuration" task? (Confidence: High)
12. What is the ID of the task that involves positioning the patient? (Confidence: High)
13. Which task is directly followed by the end event? (Confidence: High)
14. How many different paths can a process follow after the "Position patient" task? (Confidence: Medium)
15. Does the process include a task for checking the flow and reflow after the catheter is positioned? (Confidence: Medium)

The confidence scores are based on the assumption that the JSON representation is complete and accurately reflects the BPMN model. The questions with "High" confidence are straightforward and can be answered directly from the provided JSON data. Questions with "Medium" confidence may require some interpretation of the flow or understanding of BPMN concepts, but they can still be answered with a reasonable degree of certainty based on the given data.
