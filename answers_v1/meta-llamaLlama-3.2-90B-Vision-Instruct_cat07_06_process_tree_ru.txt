The image presents a flowchart that illustrates the process of handling requests and tickets. The chart is divided into two main sections: the left side focuses on requests, while the right side deals with tickets.

**Request Section:**

*   The process begins with "seq," which leads to either "register request" or "xor loop."
*   "Register request" branches off into "seq," resulting in "reinitiate request" or "xor."
*   "Reinitiate request" then splits into "reject request" or "pay compensation."
*   "Reject request" and "pay compensation" are distinct outcomes.

**Ticket Section:**

*   Starting from "and," the process divides into "check ticket" or "xor."
*   "Check ticket" further branches into "examine thoroughly" or "examine casually."
*   Both "examine thoroughly" and "examine casually" represent separate conclusions.

In summary, the flowchart outlines the steps involved in managing requests and tickets, highlighting the various paths and outcomes that can occur during these processes.
