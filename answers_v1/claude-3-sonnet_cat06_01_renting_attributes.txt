Based on the attributes provided, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the person is a citizen or not, which could potentially lead to discrimination based on citizenship status.

2. `case:gender`: This attribute represents the gender of the individual, which is a protected characteristic that should not be used for discriminatory purposes.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether the person speaks German or not, which could potentially lead to discrimination based on language or ethnicity.

4. `case:married`: This attribute represents the marital status of the individual, which could potentially lead to discrimination based on marital status.

Attributes related to personal characteristics such as citizenship, gender, language/ethnicity, and marital status are generally considered sensitive for fairness because using these attributes for decision-making processes could result in unfair treatment or discrimination against certain groups of people.

It's important to note that the sensitivity of an attribute depends on the specific context and the applicable laws and regulations. In some cases, even attributes that may seem innocuous could be considered sensitive if they can be used as proxies for protected characteristics.

When dealing with sensitive attributes, it's recommended to follow best practices for fairness and non-discrimination, such as avoiding the use of sensitive attributes in decision-making processes, or applying appropriate techniques to mitigate potential biases and ensure fair treatment for all individuals.
