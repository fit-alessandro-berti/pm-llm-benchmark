Based on the directly follows graph provided, we can infer a high-level overview of the logistics and supply chain processes involved in handling goods from collection to final delivery. Here's a detailed description of the process:

### Initial Handling Unit Process:
1. **Collect Goods**: The first step involves collecting goods, which are then loaded onto trucks.
2. **Load Truck**: This is a critical step where goods (handled as units) are loaded into trucks for transportation.

### Truck Management:
- Trucks start their journey by loading goods and driving to the terminal or another destination.
- **Drive to Terminal**: After loading, the truck drives to the terminal where it might be parked or prepared for further operations.
- **Load Truck -> Load Truck (Loop)**: This indicates that trucks may need multiple trips within a day, possibly involving reloading or unloading at different points.

### Container Handling:
- Containers are collected and loaded onto trucks.
1. **Order Empty Containers**: Containers needed to transport goods are ordered.
2. **Pick Up Empty Container**: The empty containers are picked up.
3. **Load Truck -> Load Truck (Loop)**: Similar to the truck process, this might involve multiple loadings and unloadings of containers.

- When loaded onto trucks:
1. **Drive to Terminal**: Trucks take the containers to the terminal for further processing.
2. **Weigh**: Containers are weighed before being placed in storage or loaded elsewhere.
3. **Place in Stock / Bring to Loading Bay**: Containers can be stored temporarily and then moved to loading bays as needed.
4. **Load to Vehicle**: Containers are loaded onto vehicles (like trucks) for final delivery.

### Customer Order Process:
1. **Register Customer Order**: Orders from customers are registered, which triggers the creation of transport documents.
2. **Create Transport Document**: Once an order is registered, a transport document is created, indicating the necessary logistics steps to fulfill it.

### Vehicle Management and Operations:
- **Book Vehicles**: Scheduling vehicles for specific tasks or trips.
- **Load to Vehicle -> Depart**: Vehicles are loaded with goods (or containers) and then depart from their location.
- **Reschedule Container**: Containers may need rescheduling due to delays, changes in plans, or other issues. This can be done before or during the vehicle's departure.

### Forklift Operations:
- **Bring to Loading Bay / Load to Vehicle / Weigh / Place in Stock**: Forklifts are used to move goods between loading bays and vehicles. They also handle weighing operations and placing items in storage.
- **Load to Vehicle -> Bring to Loading Bay (Loop)**: This loop indicates that forklifts may need to move containers multiple times during the process.

### Final Delivery:
- The transport document guides the delivery of goods, which involves booking vehicles, ordering empty containers if needed, and managing departures.
- Departures can be rescheduled due to various reasons like delays or changes in plans. Containers that are not immediately loaded may need to be rescheduled for future trips.

This overview provides a comprehensive picture of how goods are collected, loaded, transported, and delivered based on the given event log data. Each step involves multiple objects (e.g., trucks, containers, vehicles) and operations managed through various processes like loading, driving, weighing, and rescheduling.
