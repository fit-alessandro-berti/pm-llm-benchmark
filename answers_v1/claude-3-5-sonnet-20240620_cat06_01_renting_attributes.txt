Based on the attributes provided, there are several that could be considered sensitive from a fairness perspective:

1. case:citizen - This attribute indicates citizenship status, which is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions. Using this information in decision-making processes could lead to discrimination against non-citizens.

2. case:gender - Gender is a widely recognized protected characteristic. Using gender information in rental decisions or screening processes could result in unfair treatment based on gender identity.

3. case:german speaking - Language ability, especially when tied to national origin, can be a sensitive attribute. Discriminating based on language skills could indirectly lead to discrimination against certain ethnic or national groups.

4. case:married - Marital status is often considered a protected characteristic in housing and rental situations. Using this information could lead to discrimination against single individuals or non-traditional family structures.

These attributes are sensitive because they relate to personal characteristics that are often protected by anti-discrimination laws in many countries. Using these attributes to make decisions about tenancy, screening, or other aspects of the rental process could potentially lead to unfair treatment or discrimination against certain groups of people.

It's important to note that while the "resource" attribute shows different agents and landlords involved in the process, the sensitivity of this information depends on how it's used. If certain agents or landlords are consistently assigned to or avoiding specific demographic groups, it could indicate a fairness issue.

The other attributes like activity, concept:name, and various timestamps are generally less sensitive from a fairness perspective, as they relate more to the process itself rather than personal characteristics of the individuals involved.
