Event abstraction is an important technique that can help to simplify complex process models derived from event logs by reducing the level of detail in the events and activities represented in the model. Here are some ways that event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models:

1. Grouping similar events together: One effective way to use event abstraction is to group together similar events that have the same or similar effects on the process. For example, different types of maintenance activities can be grouped together as a single abstract event called "maintenance." This simplifies the model and makes it easier to identify the key activities that are driving the process.

2. Removing irrelevant events: Another way to use event abstraction is to remove events that are not relevant to the process. For example, if a process model is used to analyze a manufacturing process, events related to the delivery of raw materials or the packaging of finished products may not be relevant. These events can be abstracted away to simplify the model.

3. Creating composite events: Composite events are events that are created by combining multiple individual events. For example, a composite event called "order fulfillment" can be created by combining the events of receiving an order, picking items from inventory, packing them, and shipping them to the customer. Composite events can help to simplify complex process models and make them more manageable.

4. Using hierarchical event classification: Hierarchical event classification involves classifying events into a hierarchy of levels of abstraction. For example, the top level of the hierarchy might include abstract events such as "sales," "production," and "distribution." The next level might include more specific events such as "order processing" and "inventory management." This hierarchical approach can help to organize complex process models and make them easier to understand.

Overall, event abstraction can be a powerful tool for simplifying complex process models and making them more readable and manageable. By carefully selecting which events to abstract and how to group them, analysts can create models that focus on the key activities and processes that drive the business.
