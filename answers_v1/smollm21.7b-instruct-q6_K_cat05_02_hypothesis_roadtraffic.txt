   a) Create Fine -> Payment: frequency = 63047 / 8142 = 7.88, performance = 24891246.354
   b) Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment: frequency = 7214 / 117 = 6.21, performance = 1030405.955

4. What are the average frequencies for each process variant in terms of performance?
   a) Create Fine -> Payment: performance = (24891246.354 / 8142) = 3065, confidence score = 97%
   b) Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment: performance = (1030405.955 / 117) = 883, confidence score = 98%

5. What are the most frequently performed process variants?
    a) Create Fine -> Payment - frequency = 63047, performance = 24891246.354
   b) Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment - frequency = 7214, performance = 1030405.955

6. How many times has each process variant been performed with a high (performance > 80% of total) or low (performance < 60%) success rate?
   a) Create Fine -> Payment: frequency = 7214, performance = 1030405.955, success rate = 14%, confidence score = 87%
   b) Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment: frequency = 7214, performance = 1030405.955, success rate = 14%, confidence score = 90%

7. Which process variants have had a high or low number of successful payments?
