Here's an example of a DECLARE model for an hypothetic Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Invoice Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        'Cancel Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.0}
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Send Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'coexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'altresponse': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5}
    },
    'altprecedence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5}
    },
    'altsuccession': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 0.5}
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Cancel Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Cancel Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Cancel Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```
Note that the `confidence` values are arbitrary and may need to be adjusted based on the actual process data.

This model specifies the following constraints:

*   `existence`: The activities `Create Purchase Order`, `Send Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Invoice Receipt`, and `Payment` must occur at least once.
*   `absence`: The activity `Cancel Purchase Order` must not occur.
*   `exactly_one`: The activity `Send Purchase Order` must occur exactly once.
*   `init`: The process must start with the activity `Create Purchase Order`.
*   `responded_existence`: If `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must also occur. Similarly, if `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must also occur, and so on.
*   `coexistence`: If `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must also occur. Similarly, if `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must also occur.
*   `response`: If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must occur in the future. Similarly, if `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Invoice Receipt` must occur in the future, and so on.
*   `precedence`: If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Create Purchase Order` must have occurred in the past. Similarly, if `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must have occurred in the past.
*   `succession`: If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Receive Goods` must occur in the future, and if `Receive Goods` occurs, then `Send Purchase Order` must have occurred in the past.
*   `altresponse`, `altprecedence`, `altsuccession`: These constraints are similar to the previous ones, but they require the activities to alternate without repetitions.
*   `chainresponse`, `chainprecedence`, `chainsuccession`: These constraints are similar to the previous ones, but they require the activities to occur in a chain, where each activity directly follows the previous one.
*   `noncoexistence`: If `Create Purchase Order` occurs, then `Cancel Purchase Order` must not occur.
*   `nonsuccession`: If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Cancel Purchase Order` must not occur in the future.
*   `nonchainsuccession`: If `Send Purchase Order` occurs, then `Cancel Purchase Order` must not occur in the future, and `Send Purchase Order` must not directly precede `Cancel Purchase Order`.

Note that this is just one possible example of a DECLARE model for a Purchase-to-Pay process, and the actual constraints may vary depending on the specific process and requirements.
