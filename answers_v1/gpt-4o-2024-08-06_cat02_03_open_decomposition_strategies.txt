In large-scale process mining projects, decomposition strategies can be instrumental in managing complexity and improving analysis outcomes. Here are the main benefits and challenges associated with applying these strategies:

### Benefits

1. **Scalability:**
   - Decomposition allows for breaking down large and complex process models into smaller, more manageable sub-processes. This makes it feasible to analyze and visualize the processes efficiently.

2. **Improved Manageability:**
   - By focusing on individual sub-processes or components, analysts can tackle each part with more detail and precision. It can simplify troubleshooting and iterative refinement.

3. **Parallelization:**
   - Smaller decomposed parts can be analyzed in parallel by different teams or through distributed computing approaches, reducing overall processing time.

4. **Enhanced Focus:**
   - Decomposition helps isolate specific processes or areas of interest, allowing for targeted improvements and more focused exploration of particular aspects of the process.

5. **Better Insights:**
   - A detailed examination of individual sub-processes might reveal insights that could be missed when looking at an aggregated view of the entire process.

6. **Noise Reduction:**
   - By filtering out unrelated or low-level details in the decomposition process, it becomes easier to highlight the main trends and issues within each segment.

### Challenges

1. **Identification of Decomposition Criteria:**
   - Determining the appropriate criteria for decomposition is critical. Poorly chosen criteria can lead to inefficient analysis or loss of context and vital interdependencies.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Once decomposed, integrating insights from various sub-process analyses can be challenging. It may be difficult to synthesize findings into a cohesive overall process understanding.

3. **Complex Interdependencies:**
   - Processes often have intricate dependencies and interactions that can be obscured when pieces are analyzed in isolation.

4. **Loss of Global Perspective:**
   - Over-focusing on decomposed parts might result in overlooking the larger process flow and systemic issues affecting the entire process.

5. **Resource Intensive:**
   - Managing and executing multiple decomposition strategies may require significant human and computational resources.

6. **Consistency and Standardization:**
   - Ensuring consistent standards and methodologies across different decomposed sections can be challenging, especially in multi-disciplinary or multi-team environments.

In summary, while decomposition strategies can significantly aid in managing and analyzing large-scale process mining projects, they must be carefully planned and executed to balance detailed insights with the holistic understanding of the overall process landscape.
