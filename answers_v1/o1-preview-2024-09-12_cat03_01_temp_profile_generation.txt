A Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process is a common business process that involves the steps from purchasing goods or services to making the payment to the vendor. The typical activities in a P2P process include creating a purchase requisition, approving it, creating and sending a purchase order, receiving the goods, receiving the invoice, and making the payment.

Below, I will generate a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This temporal profile will be a Python dictionary that associates pairs of activities with their average time differences (in seconds) and standard deviations (also in seconds). The activities considered are those that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution.

**Activities in the Purchase-to-Pay Process:**

1. **Create Purchase Requisition** (`Create PR`)
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition** (`Approve PR`)
3. **Create Purchase Order** (`Create PO`)
4. **Send Purchase Order to Vendor** (`Send PO`)
5. **Receive Order Confirmation from Vendor** (`Receive Confirmation`)
6. **Receive Goods from Vendor** (`Receive Goods`)
7. **Receive Invoice from Vendor** (`Receive Invoice`)
8. **Verify Invoice** (`Verify Invoice`)
9. **Make Payment to Vendor** (`Make Payment`)

**Temporal Profile:**

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly following pairs
    ('Create PR', 'Approve PR'): (8 * 3600, 2 * 3600),            # 8 hours, std dev 2 hours
    ('Approve PR', 'Create PO'): (2 * 3600, 1 * 3600),            # 2 hours, std dev 1 hour
    ('Create PO', 'Send PO'): (1 * 3600, 0.5 * 3600),             # 1 hour, std dev 0.5 hour
    ('Send PO', 'Receive Confirmation'): (2 * 24 * 3600, 12 * 3600), # 2 days, std dev 12 hours
    ('Receive Confirmation', 'Receive Goods'): (5 * 24 * 3600, 24 * 3600),   # 5 days, std dev 1 day
    ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): (1 * 24 * 3600, 12 * 3600),        # 1 day, std dev 12 hours
    ('Receive Invoice', 'Verify Invoice'): (4 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  # 4 hours, std dev 1 hour
    ('Verify Invoice', 'Make Payment'): (10 * 24 * 3600, 48 * 3600),  # 10 days, std dev 2 days

    # Eventually following pairs (not directly following)
    ('Create PR', 'Create PO'): (10 * 3600, 2.24 * 3600),         # Sum of previous averages, combined std dev
    ('Create PR', 'Send PO'): (11 * 3600, 2.29 * 3600),
    ('Create PR', 'Receive Confirmation'): (2 * 24 * 3600 + 11 * 3600, (2.29 * 3600)**2 + (12 * 3600)**2),
    ('Create PR', 'Receive Goods'): (7 * 24 * 3600 + 11 * 3600, ...),  # Similar calculations
    ('Create PR', 'Make Payment'): (17 * 24 * 3600 + 11 * 3600, ...),
    # Add more pairs as needed
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **('Create PR', 'Approve PR'):** The average time between creating and approving a purchase requisition is **8 hours**, with a standard deviation of **2 hours**. This suggests that on average, it takes a working day to get a requisition approved, but it can vary by a couple of hours.

- **('Approve PR', 'Create PO'):** After approval, creating a purchase order takes on average **2 hours**, with a standard deviation of **1 hour**.

- **('Create PO', 'Send PO'):** The time to send the purchase order to the vendor after creating it is **1 hour** on average, with a standard deviation of **0.5 hours**.

- **('Send PO', 'Receive Confirmation'):** Vendors take about **2 days** to confirm the order, with a standard deviation of **12 hours**.

- **('Receive Confirmation', 'Receive Goods'):** After confirmation, it takes about **5 days** to receive the goods, with a standard deviation of **1 day**.

- **('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'):** The invoice is received **1 day** after the goods, with a standard deviation of **12 hours**.

- **('Receive Invoice', 'Verify Invoice'):** Verifying the invoice takes **4 hours** on average, with a standard deviation of **1 hour**.

- **('Verify Invoice', 'Make Payment'):** Payment is made **10 days** after verifying the invoice, with a standard deviation of **2 days**.

**Note on Calculating Eventually Following Pairs:**

For pairs where activities are not directly following each other, such as ('Create PR', 'Create PO'), we consider the cumulative average time and combine the standard deviations appropriately.

For example:

- **('Create PR', 'Create PO'):**
  - **Average Time:** Sum of averages from 'Create PR' to 'Approve PR' and from 'Approve PR' to 'Create PO':
    - \(8\, \text{hours} + 2\, \text{hours} = 10\, \text{hours}\)
  - **Standard Deviation:** Square root of the sum of the variances:
    - \(\sqrt{(2\, \text{hours})^2 + (1\, \text{hour})^2} \approx 2.24\, \text{hours}\)

**Example Usage:**

Suppose you want to check if a particular process execution deviates from the norm for the time between 'Create PR' and 'Create PO'. If the time observed is significantly lower than \( \text{AVG} - \text{ZETA} \times \text{STDEV} \) or higher than \( \text{AVG} + \text{ZETA} \times \text{STDEV} \), it is considered a deviation.

For instance, with \( \text{ZETA} = 2 \):

- Lower bound: \( 10\, \text{hours} - 2 \times 2.24\, \text{hours} \approx 5.52\, \text{hours} \)
- Upper bound: \( 10\, \text{hours} + 2 \times 2.24\, \text{hours} \approx 14.48\, \text{hours} \)

If the observed time between 'Create PR' and 'Create PO' is less than **5.52 hours** or more than **14.48 hours**, it would be considered a deviation.

**Final Temporal Profile Dictionary:**

Here's the complete temporal profile with calculated averages and standard deviations:

```python
from math import sqrt

temporal_profile = {
    ('Create PR', 'Approve PR'): (8 * 3600, 2 * 3600),  
    ('Approve PR', 'Create PO'): (2 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  
    ('Create PO', 'Send PO'): (1 * 3600, 0.5 * 3600),   
    ('Send PO', 'Receive Confirmation'): (2 * 24 * 3600, 12 * 3600),  
    ('Receive Confirmation', 'Receive Goods'): (5 * 24 * 3600, 24 * 3600),  
    ('Receive Goods', 'Receive Invoice'): (1 * 24 * 3600, 12 * 3600),  
    ('Receive Invoice', 'Verify Invoice'): (4 * 3600, 1 * 3600),  
    ('Verify Invoice', 'Make Payment'): (10 * 24 * 3600, 48 * 3600),

    # Eventually following pairs
    ('Create PR', 'Create PO'): (
        (8 + 2) * 3600, 
        sqrt((2 * 3600)**2 + (1 * 3600)**2)
    ),
    ('Create PR', 'Send PO'): (
        (8 + 2 + 1) * 3600,
        sqrt((2 * 3600)**2 + (1 * 3600)**2 + (0.5 * 3600)**2)
    ),
    ('Create PR', 'Receive Confirmation'): (
        (8 * 3600 + 2 * 3600 + 1 * 3600 + 2 * 24 * 3600),
        sqrt((2 * 3600)**2 + (1 * 3600)**2 + (0.5 * 3600)**2 + (12 * 3600)**2)
    ),
    # Continue for other pairs as needed
}
```

**Note:**

- **All times are in seconds.** To convert hours to seconds, multiply by 3600. To convert days to seconds, multiply by 24 * 3600.
- **Standard deviations for eventual pairs** are calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared standard deviations of the individual intervals (assuming independence).

This temporal profile provides a model for understanding typical timings between activities in a Purchase-to-Pay process. It can be used to detect deviations when actual process executions fall outside the expected time ranges, which may indicate inefficiencies, bottlenecks, or compliance issues.
