The data represents a complex process for approving and handling employee declarations, likely for expense reimbursements or similar claims.  It's highly iterative and incorporates various rejection/approval paths.

**Core Steps:**

1. **Declaration Submission:** An employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

2. **Pre-Approval (Optional):**  The declaration might be reviewed by a `PRE_APPROVER`. This step can result in approval or rejection.

3. **Administration Review:**  The declaration goes to `ADMINISTRATION` for further review and approval.  Rejection at this stage triggers a return to the employee.

4. **Budget Owner Review (Optional):**  For some declarations, a `BUDGET OWNER` approves or rejects.

5. **Supervisor Review (Final Approval):**  The `SUPERVISOR` ultimately approves or rejects the declaration.  This is the final step before payment.

6. **Payment Request:** Once finally approved, a `Request Payment` is initiated.

7. **Payment Handling:** The `Request Payment` leads to the actual payment being processed (`Payment Handled`).


**Rejection Scenarios and Feedback Loops:**

* **Employee Rejection:** Declarations can be rejected at several points in the process, sending them back to the employee for correction or resubmission.

* **Missing Approvals/Rejections:** Issues with specific approvers (e.g., `MISSING` approvals or `REJECTED` by specific roles) add complexity to the process, forcing resubmissions or additional investigation.


**Performance Metrics:**

The `frequency` and `performance` values indicate the number of times a specific transition happened and the average time taken for each transition.  High performance values for particular transitions (e.g., high time) suggest bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or problems related to particular roles or stages of the process.  For example, a high `performance` value for `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING` suggests a significant delay or problem in that approval step.

**Overall, the data highlights a complex approval workflow, potentially with a variety of approval roles, feedback loops, and considerable room for improvement in terms of process efficiency due to bottlenecks or process failures. Further analysis, including visualizations of the transition frequencies and potential correlations between different rejection types, is needed to pin down the exact problems and identify solutions.**
