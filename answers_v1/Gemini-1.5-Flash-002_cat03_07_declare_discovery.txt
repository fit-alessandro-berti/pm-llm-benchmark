**Important Note:**  The provided code only fills in the `existence`, `absence`, `exactly_one`, and `init` sections based on the obvious constraints from the data.  The other constraints (responded existence, coexistence, response, etc.) require a more sophisticated analysis of the event sequences.  To accurately populate those sections, you would need to apply algorithms that infer these relationships from the given process variants.  This might involve techniques from process mining such as frequent pattern mining or constraint mining.  A simple examination of the provided traces isn't sufficient to completely define those constraints.  For instance,  "Send Fine" often follows "Create Fine", but there are exceptions;  to accurately capture this, a more robust method is required beyond simply looking at the traces and making assumptions.
