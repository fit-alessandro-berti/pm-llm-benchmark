Based on the provided directly follows graph for different object types, several process and data-specific considerations can be identified as potential root causes for performance issues:

1. **High Duration Between Critical Events**:
   - **Items**: The duration between "place order" and "confirm order" is 90745.84, which is relatively high. This suggests a significant delay in confirming orders after they are placed.
   - **Items**: The duration between "pick item" and "pay order" is 120345.93, indicating a long time between picking items and paying for the order.
   - **Items**: The duration between "package delivered" and "payment reminder" is 1127921.43, which is extremely high, suggesting a significant delay in sending payment reminders after package delivery.

2. **High Frequency of Events with Long Durations**:
   - **Items**: The event "pay order" -> "pick item" has a high frequency (1236) and a long duration (429073.36), indicating frequent and prolonged delays in picking items after payment.
   - **Items**: The event "package delivered" -> "pay order" has a high frequency (1259) and a long duration (452919.25), suggesting frequent delays in payment after package delivery.

3. **Inefficient Employee Workflow**:
   - **Employees**: The event "pick item" -> "pick item" has a high frequency (4545) but involves only 7 employees, indicating that a small number of employees are repeatedly picking items, which could be a bottleneck.
   - **Employees**: The event "confirm order" -> "confirm order" has a high frequency (1995) but involves only 5 employees, suggesting that a few employees are repeatedly confirming orders, which could be inefficient.

4. **Order Processing Delays**:
   - **Orders**: The duration between "confirm order" and "pay order" is 528039.95, which is very high, indicating a significant delay in payment after order confirmation.

5. **Customer Order Confirmation Delays**:
   - **Customers**: The duration between "confirm order" and "place order" is 198743.13, which is high, suggesting a significant delay in placing new orders after confirming previous ones.

6. **Product Handling Inefficiencies**:
   - **Products**: The event "pick item" -> "pick item" has a high frequency (1018) but involves only 20 products, indicating repeated picking of the same products, which could be inefficient.
   - **Products**: The event "pay order" -> "pay order" has a high frequency (807) but involves only 20 products, suggesting repeated payment processing for the same products.

7. **Package Handling Delays**:
   - **Packages**: The duration between "create package" and "send package" is 68577.23, which is relatively high, indicating a delay in sending packages after they are created.
   - **Packages**: The duration between "send package" and "package delivered" is 66493.91, which is also high, suggesting a delay in delivering packages after they are sent.

Addressing these specific issues, such as reducing the duration between critical events, optimizing employee workflows, and improving order and product handling processes, could help mitigate performance issues in the process.
