In this event log, the following attributes show sensitivity to fairness:

1. Case - Citizen, case:gender, and case:german speaking contain gender-related information and language of residence, respectively. These attributes might be sensitive to fairness since they have different distributions across various groups (e.g., males vs females, german vs non-german speakers).
2. Time - time:timestamp contains the date, hour, and minute of each event, which could potentially contain biases if certain times are more common in specific groups or locations.
3. Resource - resource contains references to different systems (e.g., online system) and loan officers. These attributes may be sensitive as they might reflect the availability or bias towards certain resources across different groups.
