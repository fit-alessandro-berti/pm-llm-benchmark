Here are 20 relevant questions regarding the process variants you provided, along with a confidence score indicating the expected reliability of the insights that can be drawn from them. The confidence scores range from 1 (low confidence) to 5 (high confidence).

1. **What is the most common process variant for declarations submitted by employees?**
   - Confidence Score: 5

2. **What is the average performance (time taken) across all declaration variants?**
   - Confidence Score: 4

3. **Which variant leads to the fastest payment processing?**
   - Confidence Score: 4

4. **How do the approval stages (By ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, etc.) affect the overall performance of the process?**
   - Confidence Score: 4

5. **What impact does rejection at various stages (by ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, etc.) have on the frequency of declarations?**
   - Confidence Score: 5

6. **Is there a notable difference in performance between declarations that are fully approved versus those that go through rejection?**
   - Confidence Score: 5

7. **How does the presence of 'REJECTED by MISSING' influence the overall performance data?**
   - Confidence Score: 3

8. **Which process variants have the highest and lowest frequency of resubmissions by employees?**
   - Confidence Score: 4

9. **What are the most common reasons for rejection throughout the process, and how do they impact overall performance?**
   - Confidence Score: 4

10. **How does the approval rate by the BUDGET OWNER affect the subsequent payment processing?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

11. **What percentage of declarations are submitted multiple times after rejection, and how does this affect performance?**
    - Confidence Score: 3

12. **Are there specific patterns in the sequences of approvals and rejections that correlate with greater efficiency?**
    - Confidence Score: 3

13. **How does the performance vary between different approvers (ADMINISTRATION vs. BUDGET OWNER vs. SUPERVISOR)?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

14. **What is the distribution of performance times across different approval and rejection scenarios?**
    - Confidence Score: 3

15. **Which declaration submission process variant has the most significant impact on processing times and overall efficiency?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

16. **Is there a correlation between the frequency of particular variants and the overall performance metrics?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

17. **What are the trends in resubmissions after specific stages of rejection (e.g., after ADMINISTRATION rejection)?**
    - Confidence Score: 3

18. **How does the frequency of rejections by various actors (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, etc.) shape overall process efficiency?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

19. **Can we identify a threshold of rejections that signals a high likelihood of a process breaking down?**
    - Confidence Score: 3

20. **How can the approval process be streamlined based on the observed performance metrics of existing variants?**
    - Confidence Score: 4

These questions can help identify pain points, inefficiencies, and potential improvements in the declaration process, which is crucial for enhancing performance and reducing delays.
