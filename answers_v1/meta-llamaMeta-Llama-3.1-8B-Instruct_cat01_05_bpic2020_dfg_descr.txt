A fascinating dataset!

After analyzing the data, I'll try to reconstruct the process underlying it. Please note that I'll make some assumptions and might not have 100% accuracy.

**The process appears to be a simple workflow for requesting and approving a declaration**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: An employee submits a declaration, which is the initial step in the process.
2. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**: The declaration is reviewed and approved by a pre-approver, who ensures the declaration meets certain criteria.
3. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The approved declaration is then reviewed and finalized by a supervisor.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled**: Once the declaration is final approved, it triggers the payment handling process.

**Multiple paths for rejection and re-submission**

If the declaration is rejected at any stage, it can be re-submitted through various paths:

* **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**: If the employee's declaration is rejected, they can re-submit it.
* **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**: If the administration rejects the declaration, the employee can re-submit it.
* **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**: If the supervisor rejects the declaration, the employee can re-submit it.

**Direct flows**

There are some direct flows between stages, indicating that the process allows for direct transitions:

* **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Payment Handled**
* **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**

**Some exceptions and edge cases**

There are some exceptions and edge cases in the data:

* **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment**: This flow is unclear and might be a mistake or an edge case.
* **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by...**: These flows are unusual and might be related to specific roles or exceptions in the process.
* **Request Payment -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**: This flow is unclear and might be a mistake or an edge case.

Overall, the process appears to be a simple workflow for requesting and approving a declaration, with multiple paths for rejection and re-submission. However, there are some exceptions and edge cases that might require further investigation to understand their purpose and implications.
