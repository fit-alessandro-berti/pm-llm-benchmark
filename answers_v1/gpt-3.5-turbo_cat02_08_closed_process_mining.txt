Opposite concept:
- Manual Process Discovery: This concept involves manually mapping out and analyzing processes rather than relying on automated tools to discover and document them. This approach may be more time-consuming and prone to human error, but it can allow for a more in-depth understanding of the processes involved.

More general concept:
- Business Process Management (BPM): This concept encompasses a range of methods, techniques, and tools used to design, analyze, optimize, and control business processes. BPM involves not only process mining but also process modeling, automation, improvement, and monitoring to ensure that processes are efficient, effective, and aligned with business goals. It provides a holistic approach to managing and optimizing processes within an organization.
