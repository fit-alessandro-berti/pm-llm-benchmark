Creating a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process involves defining typical time intervals between activities commonly involved in such a process. Here's an example of how such a temporal profile might look:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Receive Purchase Requisition', 'Approve Purchase Requisition'): (7200, 1800),        # AVG: 2 hours, STDEV: 0.5 hours
    ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Purchase Order'): (86400, 43200),            # AVG: 1 day, STDEV: 12 hours
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order to Supplier'): (14400, 5400),         # AVG: 4 hours, STDEV: 1.5 hours
    ('Send Purchase Order to Supplier', 'Receive Order Acknowledgement'): (43200, 21600),# AVG: 12 hours, STDEV: 6 hours
    ('Receive Order Acknowledgement', 'Receive Goods/Services'): (345600, 86400),        # AVG: 4 days, STDEV: 1 day
    ('Receive Goods/Services', 'Verify Goods/Services'): (14400, 3600),                  # AVG: 4 hours, STDEV: 1 hour
    ('Verify Goods/Services', 'Receive Supplier Invoice'): (86400, 43200),               # AVG: 1 day, STDEV: 12 hours
    ('Receive Supplier Invoice', 'Approve Invoice'): (28800, 7200),                     # AVG: 8 hours, STDEV: 2 hours
    ('Approve Invoice', 'Execute Payment'): (172800, 86400),                             # AVG: 2 days, STDEV: 1 day
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Activities:** These are typical activities in a Purchase-to-Pay process, like `Receive Purchase Requisition`, `Approve Invoice`, etc.
- **Average (AVG):** This is a hypothetical average time that usually elapses between each pair of activities, expressed in seconds.
- **Standard Deviation (STDEV):** This measures the typical deviation from the average time, indicating variability in the process timing.

### Usage:
To detect deviations in a process execution using this temporal profile, you would check the actual time elapsed between two activities against the calculated deviation thresholds (AVG ± ZETA * STDEV). If the elapsed time is outside this range, it's identified as a deviation.
