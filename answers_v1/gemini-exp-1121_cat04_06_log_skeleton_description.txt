Based on the provided declarative constraints, we can describe the underlying process. Keep in mind that declarative models don't enforce a specific order of execution, but rather define rules that must be satisfied. Therefore, multiple execution paths are possible. This description focuses on the possible flows and relationships between activities.

**Main Activities and Roles:**

*   **Employee:**  Can `SAVE`, `SUBMIT`, or have a declaration `REJECTED`.
*   **Pre-Approver:** Can `FOR_APPROVE`, `APPROVE`, or `REJECT` a declaration, and can also generate a `Request Payment`. There seems to be a handling for `MISSING` declarations, also raising a rejection
*   **Supervisor:** Can `FOR_APPROVE` or `FINAL_APPROVE` a declaration, or `REJECT` it. Can also handle declarations `REJECTED` by `MISSING` events. There's also an indication of a submission being triggered by a Supervisor's FOR_APPROVAL action.
*   **Budget Owner:**  Can `APPROVE` or `REJECT` a declaration.
*   **Administration:** Can `FOR_APPROVE`, `APPROVE`, or `REJECT` a declaration, and handles payments (`Payment Handled`). Also might submit directly a declaration

**Process Flow and Constraints:**

1. **Declaration Submission and Initial Handling:**
    *   The process likely starts with an employee either saving (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`) or submitting (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) a declaration. An employee cannot save and submit a declaration at the same time, and cannot have a declaration rejected if it was previously saved.
    *   If an Employee submits, this may trigger a `FOR_APPROVAL` by either the Supervisor or Pre-Approver.
    *   The Supervisor or Pre-Approver can then handle this by either approving, rejecting or forwarding to other actors.
    *   The number of submitted declarations by an employee can vary between 0 to 7, saved declaration are capped at 1, and rejections to employees can occur multiple times (0-3, 6).

2. **Approval and Rejection Paths:**
    *   There are multiple levels of approval: Pre-Approver, Supervisor, Budget Owner, and Administration. The exact sequence can vary, but some constraints exist.
    *   Several equivalences exist for FOR_APPROVAL by Administration, meaning if it happens, then one of the other activities must also happen the same number of times: Final Approval by Supervisor, Approval by Budget Owner, Rejection by Administration, Request Payment, Payment Handled, Rejection by Supervisor and rejection by Budget Owner.
    *   A `FOR_APPROVAL` action by the pre-approver, supervisor or administration can be linked to a `REJECTED by MISSING` notification. It must also come before in the case of pre-approval or supervisor.
    *   If a Supervisor is involved in the FOR_APPROVAL stage, then a SUBMIT by the employee should have occurred previously. The Supervisor can also trigger a SUBMIT by the employee. The Supervisor cannot be involved in the process if it has been rejected by Administration, the employee has saved the declaration or if the Payment has been already handled.
    *   A Preapprover FOR_APPROVAL might be linked to an employee SUBMIT, this action also always comes before REJECTED by MISSING and is always followed by a REJECTED by MISSING. The preapprover FOR_APPROVAL is exclusive with the approvals, rejections, savings and the final approval and it is also exclusive with actions by Budget Owners and the Supervisor (FOR_APPROVAL, REJECTIONS).
    *   If Administration does a FOR_APPROVAL, then a request payment should occur and this should happen in the same number of times. The Administration FOR_APPROVAL is also exclusive with any PRE_APPROVER action (approval, for_approval, rejections) and any action by BUDGET OWNER and the Supervisor (APPROVALS, FOR_APPROVAL, REJECTIONS), payment handling, and with the employee saving. The Administration can also trigger a PRE_APPROVAL action.
    *   If a declaration is approved by the Pre-Approver, it cannot be followed by a rejection by Administration. Also, an Approval or Rejection by the Pre-Approver excludes any action by the Budget Owner. The Preapprover cannot ask for FOR_APPROVAL if it is also requested by other roles.
    *   There are a number of exclusive relations, for example, If a declaration has been FOR_APPROVED by the Supervisor, it cannot be rejected by Administration, saved by the employee, have the payment handled, approved by Pre-approver, rejected by Budget Owner or by other approvers.
    *   The Budget Owner can either approve or reject. The Budget Owner cannot be involved if it has been rejected by the Pre-approver or the declaration has been saved.
    *   Final Approval seems to be exclusively done by the Supervisor and it is exclusive with the employee Saving, any FOR_APPROVAL by the Supervisor or Preapprover.
    *   Approvals by either Administration, Budget Owner or Preapprover lead to the employee saving the document.

3. **Payment Handling:**

    *   `Payment Handled` is a terminal step, and it cannot occur if the Supervisor is in the `FOR_APPROVAL` stage, or there are any actions from the Preapprover (FOR_APPROVAL, APPROVAL). If there is a payment handled, it always comes after the rejection by employee and is always followed by a rejection by employee. It seems to be triggered by an Administration approval and triggers as well a rejection by Employee.

4. **Activity Occurrences:** The number of times each activity can occur within a case is constrained (e.g., `Request Payment` can occur 0 or 1 time, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` can occur 0 to 7 times).

5. **Directly Follows Constraints:** there exist 3 direct succession of events. Supervisor FOR_APPROVAL that leads to MISSING rejection, and Preapprover FOR_APPROVAL that also leads to a MISSING rejection and finally, an Administration FOR_APPROVAL that leads to the Employee submitting a declaration.

**In summary, the process describes a declaration workflow with multiple approval levels, potential rejection points, and a payment handling stage. The specific path a declaration takes can vary, but the declarative constraints ensure that certain rules are always followed, regardless of the sequence of activities.**

**Further Clarification and Potential Scenarios:**

To get a more concrete understanding, it would be helpful to know:

*   What kind of declarations are being processed?
*   What are the business rules that drive the different approval and rejection paths?
*   Are there any priorities or preferences in terms of the approval sequence?

Based on the analysis, some possible scenarios could include:

*   **Simple Approval:** Employee submits, Pre-approver approves, Budget Owner approves, Administration approves, Payment Handled.
*   **Rejection by Pre-approver:** Employee submits, Pre-approver rejects.
*   **Rejection by Supervisor:** Employee submits, Supervisor rejects.
*   **Complex Approval:** Employee submits, Pre-approver for_approves, Supervisor for_approves, Budget Owner approves, Administration approves, Payment Handled.
*   **Missing Information:** Employee submits, Supervisor FOR_APPROVES, then a MISSING rejection is notified.
*   **Direct submission by Administration:** Administration approves and submits, then requests payment and handles payment

Understanding the context and business rules behind this process would further clarify the specific scenarios and decision points involved.
