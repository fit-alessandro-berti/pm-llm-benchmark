The data reveals potential unfair differences in loan application processing between the protected and unprotected groups.  Several key disparities warrant investigation:

**1. Disproportionate Rejection Rates and Paths:**

* **Higher Rejection Rates Earlier in the Process:** The protected group shows a significantly higher frequency of application rejection *before* reaching the underwriter (960 rejected vs 664 for the unprotected group).  This suggests potential bias early in the process, perhaps during initial application screening or verification of borrower information.  The unprotected group's higher frequency of "skipped examination" leading to loan approval further highlights a potential bias. This process step is absent in the protected group and suggests preferential treatment for the unprotected group.

* **Longer and More Frequent Co-Signer Requests:** The protected group experiences a considerably higher frequency of requests for co-signers (across various process paths), even when compared to the unprotected group, suggesting a higher threshold for approval without a co-signer.  This is a significant indicator of potential discrimination.

* **More Frequent Collateral Assessments:** The protected group undergoes significantly more "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" steps, indicating a greater scrutiny of their collateral compared to the unprotected group. This repetitive collateral assessment further suggests a harsher evaluation standard for the protected group.

**2. Processing Time Differences (Performance):**

While some process paths have similar times, several differences are noteworthy:

* **Higher average processing time for denials in the protected group:** Although the "Loan Denied" outcomes exist in both groups, the average processing time for denials seems higher for the protected group, especially for paths involving multiple collateral assessments and co-signer requests.  This increased time spent on ultimately rejected applications suggests unnecessary delays or redundant steps specifically for the protected group.

* **The unprotected group has shorter processing time for approvals:**  The unprotected group has a significantly higher number of approved loans with notably shorter processing times compared to similar approval paths in the protected group.

**3.  Absence of Process Variants:**

There are some process variants present in the unprotected group's data that are entirely missing from the protected group's data, including the "skipped_examination" resulting in approval. The absence of this path for the protected group is highly suspicious and could indicate discriminatory practices.

**Overall Assessment:**

The data strongly suggests potential disparate treatment based on protected status.  The disproportionate rejection rates, higher frequency of co-signer requests and collateral assessments, longer processing times for denials, and the absence of certain process paths in the protected group raise serious concerns about fairness and equal opportunity.  Further investigation is crucial, including an analysis of the criteria used at each stage of the application process to determine whether these differences are justifiable or indicative of discrimination.  A deeper look into the definition of the "skipped examination" process is also vital to understand its implications.
