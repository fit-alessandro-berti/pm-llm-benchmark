The data represents a process for handling employee declarations, likely for expenses or reimbursements. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: An employee creates and submits a declaration for approval.

2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**: The declaration is reviewed and approved by an administrative team or individual.

3. **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**: In some cases, the declaration also needs approval from a budget owner.

4. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**: Occasionally, a pre-approver may need to approve the declaration before it proceeds.

5. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: The declaration is finally approved by a supervisor.

6. **Request Payment**: Once all approvals are obtained, a payment request is initiated.

7. **Payment Handled**: The payment is processed and handled.

However, there are also instances where the declaration can be rejected at various stages:

- **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**: The administrative team can reject a declaration, sending it back to the employee to be resubmitted.
- **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**: The budget owner can reject a declaration, sending it back to the employee to be resubmitted.
- **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**: The pre-approver can reject a declaration, sending it back to the employee to be resubmitted.
- **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**: The supervisor can reject a declaration, sending it back to the employee to be resubmitted.

There are also cases where the declaration is saved but not submitted, and instances where the process breaks down and a "MISSING" step occurs, likely indicating an error or gap in the process.

The frequency and performance metrics provided can help identify which paths are most common and efficient, and where bottlenecks or inefficiencies might exist in the process.
