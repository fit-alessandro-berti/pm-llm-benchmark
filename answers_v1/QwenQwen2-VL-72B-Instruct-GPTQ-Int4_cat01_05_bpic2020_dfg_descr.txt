The underlying process in the data appears to be a workflow for processing declarations made by employees. The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration, which is then reviewed and approved or rejected by various stakeholders such as the administration, pre-approver, budget owner, and supervisor. If the declaration is approved, it moves on to the next step in the process, which may be final approval by the supervisor or payment handling. If the declaration is rejected, it goes back to the employee for further review or resubmission. The process also includes steps for handling missing or rejected declarations. The frequency and performance metrics indicate how often each step occurs and how long it takes on average.
