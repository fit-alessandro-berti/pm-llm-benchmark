To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities. However, the provided data does not include the actual timestamps, but rather the frequency and performance metrics for each process variant.

Assuming the performance metric represents the total time taken for each process variant, we can calculate the average time taken for each pair of activities. Since the actual timestamps are not provided, we will make the assumption that the time taken for each activity is proportional to its position in the process variant.

```python
import pandas as pd
from collections import defaultdict

# Process variants data
data = [
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection", 56482, 59591524.946),
    ("Create Fine -> Payment", 46371, 889688.400),
    ("Create Fine -> Send Fine", 20385, 8380516.026),
    #... (all process variants)
]

# Create a dictionary to store the average and standard deviation of times for each pair of activities
temporal_profile = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0, 0])  # [total_time, count, sum_squares]

# Iterate over each process variant
for variant, frequency, performance in data:
    activities = variant.split(" -> ")
    
    # Calculate the time taken for each activity
    time_per_activity = performance / len(activities)
    
    # Iterate over each pair of activities
    for i in range(len(activities) - 1):
        activity_pair = (activities[i], activities[i + 1])
        time = time_per_activity
        
        # Update the temporal profile
        temporal_profile[activity_pair][0] += time * frequency
        temporal_profile[activity_pair][1] += frequency
        temporal_profile[activity_pair][2] += time ** 2 * frequency

# Calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair of activities
temporal_profile_avg_std = {}
for activity_pair, (total_time, count, sum_squares) in temporal_profile.items():
    avg_time = total_time / count
    std_dev = (sum_squares / count - avg_time ** 2) ** 0.5
    temporal_profile_avg_std[activity_pair] = (avg_time, std_dev)

print(temporal_profile_avg_std)
```

This code generates a temporal profile for the given process, calculating the average and standard deviation of the times between each pair of activities. Please note that the actual timestamps are not used in this calculation, as they are not provided in the problem statement. The performance metric is used as a proxy for the time taken for each process variant, and the time taken for each activity is assumed to be proportional to its position in the process variant.

**Example Output:**

```python
{
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (108.995, 10.423),
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (119.342, 11.551),
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (133.211, 12.693),
    ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): (151.112, 14.512),
    #... (all activity pairs)
}
```

This output represents the temporal profile for the given process, with each activity pair associated with its average and standard deviation of times. The actual values will depend on the specific process variants and their frequencies and performance metrics.
