The image shows a business process diagram or workflow chart divided into three swim lanes: "credit reporting (bank)", "credit scoring (bank)", and "scoring service".

The process begins in the credit reporting lane with a "scoring request received" event. It then flows to the "request credit score" task.

In the credit scoring lane, the process splits after the request. One path leads to potential delay information, while the other goes directly to receiving a credit score.

The scoring service lane shows a more detailed process:
1. It receives the scoring request
2. Computes a credit score (level 1)
3. Checks if the score is available
4. If yes, it sends the credit score
5. If no, it reports a delay, then computes a credit score (level 2) before sending

Both the credit scoring and scoring service lanes end with a "scoring request handled" event.

The diagram uses various BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) symbols including:
- Start and end events (circles)
- Tasks (rectangles)
- Gateways (diamonds)
- Message events (envelopes)
- Sequence flows (solid lines)
- Message flows (dashed lines)

There's also a note mentioning "intl. ID for message queueing" connected to the "report delay" task in the scoring service lane.

This workflow appears to represent a credit scoring process, possibly for a bank, with provisions for handling delays and different levels of score computation.
