In process mining, "process enhancement" is a term used to describe a set of techniques that aim to improve the quality, efficiency, and productivity of business processes. It involves analyzing and optimizing existing processes to identify opportunities for improvement, rather than solely focusing on discovering new processes or ensuring they conform to standard specifications.

The main differences between process enhancement, discovery, and conformance checking are:

1. **Purpose**: Process enhancement aims to improve existing processes, while process discovery focuses on identifying new or unseen processes. Conformance checking, on the other hand, is used to ensure that a process meets specific standards or specifications.
2. **Methodology**: Process enhancement typically involves analyzing and understanding an existing process, whereas process discovery may involve identifying new or innovative processes using various data sources and analytics techniques. Conformance checking, by contrast, relies on predefined templates or standard operating procedures (SOPs) to verify that a process adheres to these specifications.
3. **Output**: The output of process enhancement is often more focused on improving operational efficiency and reducing errors, while the output of discovery may include new processes, variations in existing processes, or insights into workflow dynamics. Conformance checking typically produces a list of processes that meet specific criteria.

Process enhancement involves various techniques, such as:

1. **Data analysis**: Mining data from various sources, including transactional data, user interactions, and system logs.
2. **Process modeling**: Creating diagrams to visualize the flow of information through an existing process.
3. **Benchmarking**: Comparing an organization's processes with industry standards or best practices.
4. **Root cause analysis**: Identifying root causes of process-related issues or inefficiencies.

In contrast, process discovery focuses on:

1. **Exploratory data mining**: Mining unstructured data to identify patterns and trends in business processes.
2. **Insight generation**: Analyzing data to generate insights into how businesses can improve their processes.
3. **Case studies**: Conducting in-depth analysis of specific business processes or domains.

Conformance checking, on the other hand, typically involves:

1. **Template-based approach**: Verifying that a process adheres to predefined templates or SOPs.
2. **Standardization**: Ensuring compliance with industry standards or regulatory requirements.
3. **Audit trails**: Maintaining detailed records of process adherence and compliance.

In summary, process enhancement focuses on improving existing processes through analysis, modeling, and benchmarking, whereas discovery aims to identify new or innovative processes using various data sources and analytics techniques. Conformance checking is used to verify that a process meets specific standards or specifications.
