Sure, I can generate a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process. Here is an example:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Order Submission', 'Order Approval'): (24*60*60, 6*60*60),
    ('Order Approval', 'Order Rejection'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60),
    ('Order Rejection', 'Order Resubmission'): (6*60*60, 2*60*60),
    ('Order Resubmission', 'Order Approval'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60),
    ('Order Approval', 'Payment Request'): (2*60*60, 1*60*60),
    ('Payment Request', 'Payment Approval'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60),
    ('Payment Approval', 'Payment Processing'): (6*60*60, 2*60*60),
    ('Payment Processing', 'Invoice Generation'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60),
    ('Invoice Generation', 'Invoice Approval'): (2*60*60, 1*60*60),
    ('Invoice Approval', 'Invoice Payment'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60),
    ('Invoice Payment', 'Invoice Reconciliation'): (6*60*60, 2*60*60),
    ('Invoice Reconciliation', 'Accounts Payable Closing'): (12*60*60, 4*60*60)
}
```

In this hypothetical process, we have divided the purchase-to-pay process into several activities. The average and standard deviation values are expressed in seconds. For example, the average time between 'Order Submission' and 'Order Approval' is 24 hours (86400 seconds), while the standard deviation is 6 hours (21600 seconds). The other activities follow a similar pattern.
