The provided data describes a business process involving multiple steps and stakeholders in the approval and payment handling of declarations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Initial Declaration:**
   - An employee submits a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).

2. **Pre-approval:**
   - The declaration may go through a pre-approval process by a pre-approver (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER) before moving forward.
   - If pre-approved, the declaration moves to the supervisor for final approval.
   - If not pre-approved, the declaration may be rejected (Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER) and sent back to the employee for resubmission.

3. **Administrative Approval:**
   - The declaration is then reviewed by the administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION) or rejected (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION).
   - If rejected, the declaration returns to the employee for resubmission.

4. **Budget Owner Approval:**
   - After administrative approval, the declaration may also need approval from a budget owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER).
   - If the budget owner rejects the declaration (Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER), it goes back to the employee for resubmission.

5. **Supervisory Approval:**
   - Finally, the declaration requires final approval by a supervisor (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR).
   - If the supervisor rejects the declaration (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR), it goes back to the employee.

6. **Payment Request:**
   - Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request can be made (Request Payment).
   - This request is then handled (Payment Handled).

7. **Error Handling and Corrections:**
   - If there are issues such as missing information (Declaration REJECTED by MISSING), the declaration must be resubmitted by the employee.
   - Certain transitions indicate errors or specific handling, such as declarations being saved (Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE) or moving directly to request payment (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment).

8. **Rejection Loops:**
   - Several loops exist where a rejection at any stage sends the declaration back to the employee for corrections or resubmission.

9. **Special Cases:**
   - Some special transitions indicate unique paths, such as declarations moving directly to request payment from being saved or from being rejected by certain roles.

### Key Performance Metrics:
- **Frequency** represents the number of times each transition occurred.
- **Performance** indicates the time or cost associated with each transition, highlighting potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the process.

### Process Summary:
The process involves multiple levels of approval and potential rejections, with each rejection sending the declaration back to the employee for corrections. Once all approvals are obtained, a payment request is made and handled. The process includes various checks and balances to ensure compliance and accuracy.

### Potential Areas for Improvement:
- **Reduce Rejections:** Focus on reducing rejections at each stage to streamline the process.
- **Efficiency:** Improve the efficiency of transitions with high performance times.
- **Communication:** Enhance communication between stakeholders to minimize errors and delays.

This process aligns with typical workflows in environments requiring multiple approvals, such as finance, procurement, or HR departments.
