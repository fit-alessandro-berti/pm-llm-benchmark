To identify the main differences in the treatment between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, let's look at both the frequency and performance. These metrics reflect how often certain process variants occur and how long they take to execute, respectively.

### Key Observations

1. **Rejection Rates:**
   - **Protected Group**: There's a high frequency of rejection at various stages. Process variants ending in "Reject Prospective Tenant" occur frequently (e.g., 1036, 793, 484, and 366 times).
   - **Unprotected Group**: Similarly, there are frequent rejections, but the absolute numbers are higher, particularly for the "Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" variant (2490 occurrences).

2. **Performance (Execution Time):**
   - **Protected Group**: The performance times for rejection are generally longer (e.g., 270000, 540011, 449997), suggesting longer processing times before reaching a rejection decision.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The performance times for rejection are slightly shorter (e.g., 400004, 480013), indicating quicker decisions.

3. **Contract Signing and Continuation:**
   - **Protected Group**: Process variants involving "Sign Contract" and "Pay Rent" are significantly less frequent. The protected group sees extensions into a multi-pay rent scenario (e.g., six to seven rent cycles) only in very few cases compared to the unprotected group.
   - **Unprotected Group**: There is a higher frequency of signing contracts and paying rent multiple times before cancellation. Notably, many cases extend to six or more rent cycles.

4. **Extensive Screening:**
   - **Protected Group**: There are some cases where "Extensive Screening" leads to rejections or continuations, but the numbers are mixed.
   - **Unprotected Group**: The frequency of "Extensive Screening" leading to successful contract signing is noticeably higher, indicating either a reduced barrier from this process or a smoother transition after extensive screening.

### Summary

- **Rejection Likelihood**: Both groups see high rejection rates; however, the performance times for the protected group suggest either more complex evaluations or inefficient processes, potentially indicating bias.
  
- **Process Duration**: The protected group's longer durations for rejections could imply potential barriers or delays in decision-making, whereas the unprotected group seems to progress to decisions more swiftly.

- **Successful Outcomes and Tenure**: The unprotected group has a noticeably higher frequency in not only securing contracts but also maintaining tenancies for longer periods before cancellation, suggesting more favorable conditions post acceptance.

Overall, a potential disparity exists in both the pace and the success metrics of reaching different stages of the process. Considerations for potential bias include whether the evaluation criteria or processes for the protected group are inherently more stringent or if other systemic factors contribute to these observations. Further investigation into qualitative factors, like application specifics or decision criteria, could provide in-depth insights.
