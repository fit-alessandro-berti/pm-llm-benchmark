The visualization is a timeline showing the progression of events related to fines over a period. It features parallel lines connecting different stages of a process, likely representing individual cases.

- The top line labeled "Send Fine" represents the initiation or issuance of fines.
- The middle section "Insert Fine Notification" indicates a follow-up step, perhaps notifying individuals of the fines.
- The bottom section "Send for Credit Collection" suggests a final escalation step where unresolved fines are handed over for collection.

The vertical lines connecting each stage could represent the progression of individual cases through these stages over time. The timeline spans from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013, with many cases transitioning from initial notification to credit collection. The density of lines suggests frequent case processes. The red lines may indicate a subset of actions, possibly highlighting specific cases or types of fines.
