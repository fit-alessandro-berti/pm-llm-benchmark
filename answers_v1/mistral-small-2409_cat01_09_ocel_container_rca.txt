Based on the provided directly follows graph and the associated frequencies and durations, several root causes for performance issues can be identified:

### Root Causes for Performance Issues:

1. **High Duration and Frequency of Certain Events:**
   - **Bottleneck Events:** Events with high durations and frequencies suggest they may be bottlenecks. For example:
     - "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" has a very high duration (743380.51) and frequency (1794), indicating a significant delay in this step.
     - "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" also has a high duration (1960.09) and frequency (1814), which could cause delays.

2. **Repeated Events:**
   - **Frequent Repetition of Activities:** Some activities are repeated frequently, which might indicate inefficiencies. For example:
     - "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" for Trucks and Containers is repeated frequently (8559 and 8559 respectively), suggesting repeated loading without significant progress.
     - "Place in Stock" -> "Place in Stock" for Forklifts (23 events) could indicate an issue where containers are being restocked repeatedly without being moved out.

3. **Delays in Transitions:**
   - **Long Durations in Transitions:** Certain transitions have very high durations, which could indicate process inefficiencies. For example:
     - "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" has a very high duration (368943.92), suggesting a significant delay in this part of the process.
     - "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" for Vehicles (duration 40895.81) and Transport Documents (duration 8635.50) indicate persistent delays in rescheduling.

4. **High Frequency of Specific Activities:**
   - **Frequent Activities:** High frequency of specific activities might indicate process inefficiencies. For example:
     - "Load Truck" -> "Weigh" and "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" for Containers (with high frequencies and durations) suggest that these steps are time-consuming and occur frequently.
     - "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" for Forklifts (1753 events) indicates a high volume of this activity, which could be a bottleneck.

5. **Inefficient Rescheduling:**
   - **Rescheduling Issues:** The high frequency and duration of "Reschedule Container" activities across different object types indicate that there are frequent issues requiring rescheduling, which can delay the overall process.

### Specific Recommendations:

1. **Optimize Loading and Unloading:**
   - Reduce the frequency and duration of "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" activities by streamlining the loading process.

2. **Improve Transition Times:**
   - Focus on reducing durations for high-duration transitions such as "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container".

3. **Efficiently Handle Rescheduling:**
   - Address the root causes of frequent rescheduling to reduce the delays and inefficiencies associated with "Reschedule Container" activities.

4. **Investigate High-Duration Activities:**
   - Analyze and optimize activities with high durations like "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" to ensure they are not causing unnecessary delays.

5. **Streamline Frequent Activities:**
   - Optimize frequently occurring but time-consuming activities such as "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" to improve overall process flow.

By addressing these specific issues, you can significantly improve the performance of the process.
