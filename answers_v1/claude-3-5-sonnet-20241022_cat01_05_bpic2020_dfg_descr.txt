This appears to be an expense declaration/reimbursement process within an organization. Here's a breakdown of the main flow and key observations:

1. Main Happy Path:
- An EMPLOYEE submits a declaration
- It gets APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION
- Then either:
  * Goes directly to SUPERVISOR for FINAL_APPROVAL, or
  * Goes through BUDGET OWNER approval first, then to SUPERVISOR for FINAL_APPROVAL
- After FINAL_APPROVAL, a payment is requested
- Finally, the payment is handled

2. Notable Features:
- Multiple approval layers exist: PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR
- The SUPERVISOR appears to have final approval authority
- There are several rejection paths where declarations can be:
  * Rejected by various approvers (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR)
  * When rejected, declarations typically go back to the EMPLOYEE
  * The EMPLOYEE can resubmit rejected declarations

3. Some unusual/exception paths:
- There's a "MISSING" status that can reject declarations
- Some declarations go through a "FOR_APPROVAL" state
- There are rare cases where payments are handled differently or rejected after being approved

The process seems designed with checks and balances, allowing multiple stakeholders to review declarations before payment is approved. The high frequency of the payment handling steps (10,000+) compared to the declaration steps (1,000-8,000) suggests this might be part of a larger system where payments can be triggered by other processes as well.
