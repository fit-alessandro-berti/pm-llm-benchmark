What a delightful mess of a process!

After analyzing the data, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that I might make some assumptions or interpretations, and the actual process might differ.

**Overview**

The process appears to be a workflow for handling declarations (likely expense reports or similar documents) within an organization. The process involves various stages, approvals, and rejections, ultimately leading to payment handling.

**Key Stages and Transitions**

1. **Submission**: An employee submits a declaration ( frequency = 8202 ).
2. **Pre-approval**: The declaration is sent for pre-approval to either a pre-approver, administration, or budget owner.
	* If pre-approved, it moves to the next stage.
	* If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision.
3. **Approval**: The declaration is sent for approval to either administration, budget owner, or supervisor.
	* If approved, it moves to the next stage.
	* If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision or is sent to another approver.
4. **Final Approval**: The declaration is sent for final approval to a supervisor.
	* If finally approved, it triggers a request for payment.
5. **Payment Handling**: The payment is handled ( frequency = 10037 ).
6. **Rejection and Revision**: If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it goes back to the employee for revision and resubmission.

**Other Observations**

* There are multiple rejection paths, indicating that a declaration can be rejected at various stages and by different approvers.
* Some rejections lead to a "MISSING" state, which might indicate a timeout or an error in the process.
* The "FOR_APPROVAL" states seem to be intermediate stages, but their exact purpose is unclear.
* The "SAVED" state appears only once, and its role in the process is unknown.

**Simplification and Questions**

To better understand the process, it would be helpful to simplify the workflow and address the following questions:

* Can the approval stages be streamlined or consolidated?
* What are the specific rules for routing declarations to different approvers?
* How do the various rejection paths impact the overall process efficiency?
* Are there any specific pain points or bottlenecks in the current process?

By answering these questions and refining the process, it may be possible to reduce complexity and improve the overall efficiency of the declaration handling workflow.
