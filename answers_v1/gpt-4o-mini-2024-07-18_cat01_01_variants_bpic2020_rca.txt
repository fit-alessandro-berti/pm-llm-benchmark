Analyzing the performance data of the process with various variants reveals potential root causes for performance issues specific to the process itself. Here are some data-driven considerations:

1. **High Rejection Rates**: Multiple variants show that declarations are frequently rejected by different roles (e.g., Administration, Supervisor, Budget Owner). This leads to rework and additional cycles of resubmission, which directly impacts overall performance. The variants with frequent rejections contribute to longer processing times.

2. **Path Complexity**: Some process variants have lengthy paths due to multiple approvals and rejections (for example, the combination of approvals from Administration, Budget Owner, and Supervisor). The complexity increases the handling time and potential for delays, as evident from the lower performances recorded for these variants. Reducing unnecessary steps could streamline the process.

3. **Frequent Rework Loops**: Variants that involve rejections followed by resubmissions (e.g., declarations rejected by Administration and then resubmitted) indicate inefficiencies in the approval process. Instances of repeated rejections can hinder overall throughput and increase resource utilization without adding value.

4. **Performance Variability Across Variants**: The data shows variable performance metrics across different variants, with certain paths yielding significantly better performance (e.g., “Payment Handled” only after an approval path versus multiple layers of approval and rejection). This variability suggests that simpler or more direct paths are more efficient and should be analyzed for best practices.

5. **Performance of Specific Handlers**: Performance issues may also relate to the speed and efficiency of individual roles (e.g., Administration, Supervisor). Understanding how each role contributes to delays or bottlenecks—especially if particular variants show significantly slower processing within certain roles—could help identify where focus is needed to enhance performance.

6. **Idle Time or Delays in Processing**: Some paths reveal multiple stages of approvals and particularly rejections. This can lead to periods of inactivity or waiting time for declarations, especially when feedback loops are not quick. Investigating the delays between stages and the transitions in the approval process is crucial.

7. **Impact of Non-standard Cases**: Specific variants involve unusual sequences, such as "REJECTED by MISSING", indicating potential issues with data completeness or dependency on external input that might not be accounted for in the system. This could lead to delays as the process might be on hold until the missing information is provided.

8. **Resource Allocation**: The performance between more frequently traveled paths versus less frequented, complex ones suggests potential misallocation of resources. Ensuring that key roles have adequate coverage and prioritizing submissions based on their past performance could maximize throughput.

9. **Scalability of Approval Process**: With certain complexities resulting from multiple approval layers, the process might not be scalable to handle increased volumes or urgent requests, leading to performance degradation during peak times.

By addressing the above specific issues, the organization could enhance the process efficiency, reduce handling times, and improve overall performance in handling declarations and processing payments.
