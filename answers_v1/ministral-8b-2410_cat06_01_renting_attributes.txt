In the context of ensuring fairness in event logs, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to biases or disparities in the process outcomes. These attributes often relate to personal characteristics of the individuals involved in the process. In the provided event log, the following attributes are sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen. In some contexts, citizens might be treated differently than non-citizens.
2. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual. Different genders might face different treatment or outcomes in the process.
3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German. Language barriers could potentially affect how an individual is treated in the process.
4. `case:married`: This attribute indicates the marital status of the individual. Married individuals might be treated differently in some processes.

These attributes are sensitive because they can influence how the process is executed and the outcomes individuals receive. It's crucial to account for these attributes when analyzing fairness in the process to ensure that all individuals are treated equitably.
