To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some key observations and differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
- **Protected Group:** The most frequent process variant is "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected" with a frequency of 960.
- **Unprotected Group:** The most frequent process variant is "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied" with a frequency of 2709.

### 2. **Performance Metrics:**
- **Protected Group:** The average performance (execution time) for the most frequent process variant is 219999.156.
- **Unprotected Group:** The average performance for the most frequent process variant is 340005.309.

### 3. **Loan Denial Rates:**
- **Protected Group:** The process variants leading to "Loan Denied" are more frequent and have a higher performance metric compared to those leading to "Sign Loan Agreement."
- **Unprotected Group:** Similarly, the process variants leading to "Loan Denied" are more frequent, but the performance metrics are generally higher than those in the protected group.

### 4. **Appointment Denial:**
- **Protected Group:** The frequency of "Appointment Denied" is 599 with a performance of 90000.623.
- **Unprotected Group:** The frequency of "Appointment Denied" is 363 with a performance of 80001.088.

### 5. **Additional Steps and Complexity:**
- **Protected Group:** There are more complex process variants involving multiple visits to assess collateral and requests for co-signers, which often lead to "Loan Denied."
- **Unprotected Group:** There are fewer complex process variants, but those that exist also often lead to "Loan Denied."

### 6. **Skipped Examination:**
- **Unprotected Group:** There is a unique process variant "skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement" with a frequency of 332 and a performance of 260013.446. This variant does not exist in the protected group.

### 7. **Sign Loan Agreement:**
- **Protected Group:** The frequency of process variants leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" is relatively low compared to those leading to "Loan Denied."
- **Unprotected Group:** The frequency of process variants leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" is higher, but still less than those leading to "Loan Denied."

### 8. **Performance Disparities:**
- **Protected Group:** The performance metrics for process variants leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" are generally lower than those leading to "Loan Denied."
- **Unprotected Group:** The performance metrics for process variants leading to "Sign Loan Agreement" are higher than those in the protected group but still lower than those leading to "Loan Denied."

### Summary of Unfair Differences:
1. **Higher Frequency of Loan Denial:** The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants leading to "Loan Denied" compared to the protected group.
2. **Longer Execution Times:** The unprotected group generally has longer execution times for process variants leading to "Loan Denied."
3. **Complex Process Variants:** The protected group has more complex process variants involving multiple visits and requests for co-signers, which often lead to "Loan Denied."
4. **Skipped Examination:** The unprotected group has a unique process variant involving "skipped_examination," which is not present in the protected group.
5. **Appointment Denial:** The protected group has a higher frequency of "Appointment Denied" compared to the unprotected group.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group may face more stringent and time-consuming processes, leading to a higher rate of loan denials and longer execution times. The presence of a "skipped_examination" variant in the unprotected group also indicates a potential bias or unfair treatment.
