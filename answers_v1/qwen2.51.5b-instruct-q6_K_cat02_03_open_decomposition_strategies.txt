Decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects offer several benefits and pose some significant challenges:

Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Model Accuracy**: By breaking down complex processes into smaller, manageable parts, analysts can focus on understanding each step individually before integrating them. This leads to a more accurate model that better reflects real-world operations.
   
2. **Simplified Analysis**: Smaller, decomposed models are easier to analyze and interpret compared to large-scale process models. This makes it simpler for stakeholders to understand the processes involved in their roles.

3. **Improved Decision-Making**: Involving multiple small teams or departments can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of different perspectives on how processes should be managed. This results in better-informed decisions that consider diverse viewpoints and potential trade-offs.

4. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, simpler models are easier to maintain over time as the business environment changes. Any updates made for one part of the process can be implemented more quickly without affecting other parts.

Challenges:
1. **Complexity in Integration**: Integrating smaller processes into a larger system is complex and requires careful planning to ensure that each step aligns seamlessly with others, minimizing bottlenecks or disruptions in overall operations.

2. **Risk of Inadequate Scope**: If not managed carefully, decomposing a large process can lead to oversimplification or even ignoring critical aspects of the original workflow. This can result in suboptimal models and misrepresentations of actual operational practices.

3. **Lack of Broad Understanding**: Smaller processes may be too specific for broader context understanding. To gain comprehensive insight into how all parts of a process interact, it's necessary to maintain a high level overview that includes the larger system dynamics not just isolated components.

4. **Resistance to Change**: Employees and departments involved in smaller processes might resist changes due to lack of visibility or understanding of their role in maintaining overall efficiency and quality.

5. **Technical Expertise Requirements**: The complexity often necessitates specific technical skills within the team, such as proficiency with process mining tools, which can be challenging for some stakeholders if they are not familiar with these technologies.

6. **Resource Management**: Managing decomposed processes requires additional resources (time, personnel) beyond what might typically be available in a standard project setup. Ensuring that these extra resources do not divert focus from the core objective of improving process efficiency is crucial.

7. **Overly Detailed Analysis**: The decomposition approach can sometimes lead to overly detailed analysis where every step or interaction within processes is scrutinized excessively, potentially hindering decision-making by creating information overload for end-users.

Applying decomposition strategies effectively requires a balanced approach that acknowledges these benefits and challenges while ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of process improvements.
