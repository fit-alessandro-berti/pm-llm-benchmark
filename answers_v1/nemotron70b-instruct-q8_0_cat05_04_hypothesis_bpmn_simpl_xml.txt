Here are 20 relevant questions about the process, along with a confidence score for each (on a scale of 1-5, where:

* **1**: Question is somewhat related but may not directly pertain to the process's core aspects or might be open to very broad interpretation.
* **2**: Question shows relevance but might have an assumed context not explicitly covered in the provided XML.
* **3**: Question is relevant with a moderate level of specificity, directly relating to elements within the process.
* **4**: Question is highly relevant and specific, directly addressing key aspects or potential pain points of the process.
* **5**: Question is extremely pertinent, targeting critical decision points, outcomes, or core functionalities of the process.
