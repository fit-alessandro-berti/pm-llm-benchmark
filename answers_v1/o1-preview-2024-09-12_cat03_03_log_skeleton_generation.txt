Certainly! Below is a Log Skeleton model represented as a Python dictionary for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This model includes the specified declarative constraints such as equivalence, always before, always after, never together, activity occurrences, and directly-follows constraints.

```python
# Define the Log Skeleton model for the hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Create PR', 'Approve PR'),
        ('Create PO', 'Send PO'),
        ('Match Invoice', 'Approve Invoice'),
        ('Approve Invoice', 'Pay Supplier')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Approve PR', 'Create PR'),
        ('Create PO', 'Approve PR'),
        ('Send PO', 'Create PO'),
        ('Receive Goods', 'Send PO'),
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Send PO'),
        ('Match Invoice', 'Receive Goods'),
        ('Match Invoice', 'Receive Invoice'),
        ('Approve Invoice', 'Match Invoice'),
        ('Pay Supplier', 'Approve Invoice')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Create PR', 'Approve PR'),
        ('Approve PR', 'Create PO'),
        ('Create PO', 'Send PO'),
        ('Send PO', 'Receive Goods'),
        ('Send PO', 'Receive Invoice'),
        ('Receive Goods', 'Match Invoice'),
        ('Receive Invoice', 'Match Invoice'),
        ('Match Invoice', 'Approve Invoice'),
        ('Approve Invoice', 'Pay Supplier')
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No activities are mutually exclusive in this model
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create PR': {1},
        'Approve PR': {1},
        'Create PO': {1},
        'Send PO': {1},
        'Receive Goods': {1, 2, 3},       # Allows for partial deliveries
        'Receive Invoice': {1, 2},        # Allows for multiple invoices
        'Match Invoice': {1},
        'Approve Invoice': {1},
        'Pay Supplier': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Create PR', 'Approve PR'),
        ('Approve PR', 'Create PO'),
        ('Create PO', 'Send PO'),
        ('Match Invoice', 'Approve Invoice'),
        ('Approve Invoice', 'Pay Supplier')
    }
}

# Print the Log Skeleton model
for key, value in log_skeleton.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}\n")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Activities:**
  - **Create PR**: Create Purchase Requisition
  - **Approve PR**: Approve Purchase Requisition
  - **Create PO**: Create Purchase Order
  - **Send PO**: Send Purchase Order to Supplier
  - **Receive Goods**: Receive Goods from Supplier
  - **Receive Invoice**: Receive Invoice from Supplier
  - **Match Invoice**: Match Invoice with Purchase Order and Goods Receipt
  - **Approve Invoice**: Approve the Invoice for Payment
  - **Pay Supplier**: Execute Payment to Supplier

- **Equivalence Constraints:**
  - These pairs of activities occur the same number of times in each case.
  - Example: If 'Create PR' occurs, 'Approve PR' must also occur, and both happen exactly once.

- **Always Before Constraints:**
  - If the first activity occurs, the second activity must have occurred previously.
  - Example: If 'Approve PR' occurs, 'Create PR' must have occurred before it.

- **Always After Constraints:**
  - If the first activity occurs, the second activity must occur after it.
  - Example: If 'Create PR' occurs, 'Approve PR' must occur after it.

- **Never Together Constraints:**
  - In this process, there are no activities that cannot co-exist within the same case.

- **Activity Frequencies (`activ_freq`):**
  - Defines the allowed number of occurrences for each activity within a case.
  - Example: 'Receive Goods' can occur 1 to 3 times to account for partial deliveries.

- **Directly-Follows Constraints:**
  - Specifies that one activity must occur immediately after another.
  - Example: 'Create PR' is directly followed by 'Approve PR'.

**Note:** This model represents a simplified version of a Purchase-to-Pay process, capturing the essential activities and their relationships. The actual process in an organization might have additional complexities, exceptions, or variations that are not reflected in this hypothetical model.
