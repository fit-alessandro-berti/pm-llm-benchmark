Here are 20 relevant questions over the process with a confidence score for each:

1. **What is the most common path for a declaration to be approved and paid?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
2. **How many declarations are submitted by employees that are ultimately rejected?** (Confidence score: 0.8)

4. **Which role is most responsible for rejecting declarations?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
5. **What percentage of declarations require re-submission after being rejected?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
6. **How does the approval process differ for declarations that are ultimately paid versus those that are rejected?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
7. **Can we identify any bottlenecks in the declaration approval process?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
8. **How many declarations are saved by employees but not submitted?** (Confidence score: 0.9)
9. **What is the performance time for declarations that are approved by the administration but rejected by the supervisor?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
10. **Do declarations that are approved by the pre-approver have a higher chance of being paid?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
11. **Can we identify any correlation between the frequency of declarations and their performance time?** (Confidence score: 0.5)

13. **What is the average number of re-submissions required for a declaration to be approved and paid?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
14. **Do declarations that are approved by the budget owner have a faster performance time?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
15. **Can we identify any differences in the approval process for declarations that are submitted by different types of employees?** (Confidence score: 0.4)
16. **How does the performance time for declarations vary depending on the day of the week or time of month they are submitted?** (Confidence score: 0.5)
17. **What percentage of declarations are approved by the supervisor on the first attempt?** (Confidence score: 0.7)
18. **Can we identify any correlation between the performance time and the frequency of declarations for each role?** (Confidence score: 0.6)
19. **How many declarations are rejected by the administration but ultimately approved and paid?** (Confidence score: 0.8)
20. **Do declarations that are submitted during peak periods (e.g. end of month) have a slower performance time?** (Confidence score: 0.5)

Note: The confidence score is a subjective measure of how likely the question is to be relevant and answerable based on the provided process data. A higher confidence score indicates a higher likelihood of the question being relevant and answerable.
