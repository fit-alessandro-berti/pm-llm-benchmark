Some notes on the generation:
- Existence: since all shown activities do indeed occur, at least once in the trace, we add them to the existence mapping, each with support 1.0 and confidence 1.0.
- Absence: If there are steps that never occur in the process (and therefore should not be executed) you can put them in this dictionary. However there were no absent activities in the provided sequence variants.
- Co-Existence: All activities occurring on the same trace variant implicitly coexist. However, there was not enough information in the prompt to directly construct this in a meaningfully abstract way. 
- Response, Precedence and Succession could be defined if activities or sets of activities directly follow each other, whereas this could be reversed for precedence rules and thus directly implied.
  
This represents the result of a program designed to generate a basic pm4py DECLARE model from the given input. For the constraints requiring direct investigation on activity sequence succession (`succession`, `altresponse`, `altprecedence`, `altsuccession`, `chainresponse`, `chainprecedence`, and `chainsuccession`) some degree of manual effort is taken, as well as the less clear mappings (`nonchainsuccession`, `nonsuccession`, `noncoexistence`).
