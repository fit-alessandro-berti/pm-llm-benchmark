Based on the directly follows graph and event data provided, the following potential root causes for performance issues in the process can be identified:

1. High frequency and duration of "Load Truck" events for Object type: Truck and Container. This could indicate inefficiencies in the loading process, such as poor truck utilization, manual handling, or other bottlenecks.
2. High frequency and duration of "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" events for Object type: Container. This could suggest that there are delays or inefficiencies in the procurement and handling of empty containers.
3. High frequency and duration of "Book Vehicles" events for Object type: Vehicle and Transport Document. This could indicate that there are delays or inefficiencies in the vehicle scheduling and assignment process.
4. High frequency and duration of "Reschedule Container" events for Object type: Container and Transport Document. This could suggest that there are issues with container prioritization, scheduling, or handling that are leading to frequent rescheduling.
5. High frequency and duration of "Depart" events for Object type: Transport Document. This could indicate that there are delays in the departure of transport units, which could be caused by a variety of factors such as poor planning, traffic, or loading/unloading inefficiencies.
6. High frequency and duration of "Place in Stock" events for Object type: Forklift and Container. This could suggest that there are inefficiencies in the put-away process, such as congestion, poor truck or operator utilization, or other bottlenecks.
7. High frequency and duration of "Bring to Loading Bay" events for Object type: Forklift. This could indicate that there are inefficiencies in the movement of goods to the loading bay, such as congestion, poor material handling, or other bottlenecks.

These potential root causes can be further analyzed and validated using process mining techniques and other data analysis methods to identify specific areas for improvement and to develop targeted solutions.
