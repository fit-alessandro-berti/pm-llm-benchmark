Sure, I'd be happy to help describe the process underlying this data.

From the information provided, it appears to be a flow of a declaration process within an organization. The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration. Based on the frequency and performance data, we can see that some declarations are rejected by the employee, the pre-approver, the administration, the budget owner, or the supervisor at various stages of the process.

Once a declaration is submitted by an employee, it can be approved by a pre-approver, administration, or directly by the supervisor. If the declaration is approved by the administration or the pre-approver, it can then be approved by the budget owner or rejected by the supervisor, budget owner, or missing. If the declaration is approved by the budget owner, it can then be finally approved by the supervisor, or it can be rejected by the supervisor.

If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it can be resubmitted by the employee or rejected by the missing party, and the process starts over again. If a declaration is finally approved by the supervisor, a payment can be requested, but this can also be rejected by the missing party. If the payment is handled, the declaration process is completed.

There are also some unique occurrences in the data, such as a declaration being saved by the employee and then requesting payment, a declaration being for approval by the supervisor, pre-approver, or administration and then being rejected by the missing party, and a declaration being submitted for approval by the supervisor, pre-approver, or administration and then being resubmitted by the employee.

Overall, the data suggests a complex and multistep approval process for declarations, with multiple opportunities for rejection and resubmission of declarations. The performance data can also be used to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement in the process.
