To analyze and identify the unfair differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups based on the provided process variants and their execution times, we can look for patterns in the frequency of specific process steps and performances associated with outcomes (e.g., loan applications getting denied versus approved). Here are the main differences:

### 1. **Outcome Frequencies and Denials:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - High frequencies of applications being rejected or loans being denied. For instance, the predominant paths lead mostly to applications being rejected (1,960) or loans being denied (with significant variations in frequency, e.g., 229 for "Make Visit to Assess Collateral").
     - The process for denial often involves multiple steps, including requests for co-signers and collateral assessments, which seem to elongate the process without a positive outcome.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - A higher frequency of successful outcomes (e.g., loans approved) compared to the protected group, specifically with 1,656 applications resulting in signed loan agreements against only 31 in the protected group.
     - A notable number of applications lead to denial (2,709), but the divergence in the proportion of successful applications compared to the protected group indicates a disparity in access to favorable outcomes.

### 2. **Execution Times:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Generally higher execution times for processes leading to loan denials, which may suggest a more complicated or prolonged pathway to obtaining a loan, hence possibly indicating systemic inefficiencies for this group.
     - For failed applications, the steps involve multiple requests (like for co-signers) and collateral evaluations, leading to heightened performances (e.g., >330,000 milliseconds).

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - More streamlined processes for outcomes, with lower execution times for denied applications (e.g., <300,000 milliseconds for certain variants) compared to the protected group.
     - Successful applications, e.g., signing the loan agreement, exhibit performance values close to 340,000 milliseconds. It suggests that more straightforward pathways exist for this group, ultimately leading to quicker turnaround times.

### 3. **Process Variants and Complexity:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Processes are often more involved (i.e., multiple steps and checks). For instance, variants include repeated visits for collateral assessments, which might indicate bureaucratic hurdles that disproportionately affect this group.
     - The presence of complicated paths might contribute to frustration and lack of confidence in securing loans, affecting overall accessibility.

   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Simpler and less redundant processes from application to approval. The steps rarely repeat (i.e., examination processes seem to be bypassed or simplified).
     - Some variants include "skipped examination," indicating flexibility in requirements that may not be available to the protected group.

### 4. **Systematic Bias Indicators:**
   - The protected group's pathways suggest systemic hurdles that could reinforce negative financial behavior or reinforce biases against them, perhaps implying discriminatory practices that result in more denials despite similar initial stages (application processes).
   - Given the discrepancies in rejection rates and time-consumed, potential biases may reflect on how the institutions interact with these two groups, indicating a need for procedural review for fairness and equal access to credit.

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that the protected group faces an unfair disadvantage through longer processes with more frequent undesirable outcomes, while the unprotected group enjoys more successful transactions with streamlined processes. This disparity warrants a closer examination of lending practices and potential biases, as these differences could profoundly impact the financial well-being of individuals in the protected group.
