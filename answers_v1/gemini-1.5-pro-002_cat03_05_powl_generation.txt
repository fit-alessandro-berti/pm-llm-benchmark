from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities as Transitions

invoice_approval_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[auto_approval, manual_approval])

# Connect invoice creation to the choice of approval methods
invoice_approval = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_invoice, invoice_approval_choice])
invoice_approval.order.add_edge(create_invoice, invoice_approval_choice)


# Construct the main process flow using StrictPartialOrder
p2p_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[create_purchase_requisition, approve_purchase_requisition,
                                        create_purchase_order, receive_goods, invoice_approval,
                                        three_way_match, payment])

# Define the order of activities
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_purchase_requisition, approve_purchase_requisition)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(approve_purchase_requisition, create_purchase_order)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(create_purchase_order, receive_goods)
p2p_process.order.add_edge(receive_goods, invoice_approval)  # Connect to the invoice approval sub-process
p2p_process.order.add_edge(invoice_approval, three_way_match) # three-way match after invoice creation and approval
p2p_process.order.add_edge(three_way_match, payment) # payment after resolving discrepancies (if any)

# Now p2p_process represents the entire Purchase-to-Pay POWL model

# Example of how to visualize (requires additional libraries,  may not render perfectly for complex POWLs):
# from pm4py.visualization.powl import visualizer as powl_visualizer
# gviz = powl_visualizer.apply(p2p_process)
# powl_visualizer.view(gviz)



```

Key improvements:

* **Modular Design:** Breaks down the process into smaller, manageable components (e.g., invoice approval subprocess). This makes the model easier to understand and modify.
* **Choice Modeling:** Includes the XOR operator to represent the choice between automated and manual invoice approval.
* **Loop Modeling:**  Models the three-way match process as a loop, allowing for multiple iterations of discrepancy resolution.
* **Clearer Ordering:** Uses `StrictPartialOrder` and `add_edge` consistently to define the precedence relationships between activities.
* **Comments:**  Adds comments to explain the logic and purpose of different parts of the model.
* **Visualization Hint:** Includes a commented-out example of how to visualize the POWL (requires installing `graphviz` and having it in your system's PATH).


This improved model provides a more realistic and flexible representation of a Purchase-to-Pay process. Remember to install the necessary `pm4py` library: `pip install pm4py`.
