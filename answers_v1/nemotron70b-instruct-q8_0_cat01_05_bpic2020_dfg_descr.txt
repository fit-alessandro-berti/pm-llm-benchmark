Based on the provided flow data, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process. Please note that some interpretations might be subjective due to the complexity and potential ambiguities in the data.

**Process Name:** Expense/Declaration Approval and Payment Process

**Primary Objective:** To approve employee-submitted declarations ( possibly expense reports or financial claims ) and subsequently handle payments.

**Key Entities Involved:**

1. **Employee**: Submitter of declarations.
2. **Administration** ( ADMIN ): Initial approver.
3. **Pre-Approver** ( PRE_APPROVER ): Optional additional approver before higher authority.
4. **Budget Owner** ( BUDGET OWNER ): Approver responsible for budget checks.
5. **Supervisor**: Final approver and also involved in rejection handling.
6. **Missing** ( MISSING ): Possibly an automated/system check or an external entity (the role is somewhat unclear).

**High-Level Process Steps:**

1. **Declaration Submission and Initial Processing**
	* Employees submit declarations, which can be:
		+ Approved by Administration (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`)
		+ Rejected by Administration (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`)
		+ Directly rejected by the Employee themselves (rare, `Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE` from submission)
		+ Saved but not directly processed further ( rare, `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE` )

2. **Multi-Level Approval Process**
	* Approved declarations by Administration can follow two main paths:
		1. **Direct to Final Approval**:
			- `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`
			- Optionally with a Pre-Approval step (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`)
		2. **Budget Owner Approval**:
			- `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER` before `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`
			- Can also be rejected at this stage (`Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`)

3. **Rejection Handling**
	* Rejections can occur at multiple stages and are often routed back to the Employee for resubmission.
	* Supervisors can reject declarations, which may or may not have been previously approved by other entities.

4. **Payment Processing**
	* After final approval, a declaration triggers a payment request (`Request Payment`)
	* Payments are handled (`Payment Handled`), with very rare instances of payments being requested without following the standard approval flow (e.g., from saved declarations or post-rejection).

**Observations and Potential Process Improvement Areas:**

- **Complex Approval Paths**: The process has multiple, intersecting approval paths, which can lead to inefficiencies. Streamlining these could simplify the process.
- **High Rejection Rates at Administration Level**: This might indicate a need for clearer submission guidelines or additional support for employees during the initial submission phase.
- **Direct Jumps and Rare Transitions**: Some transitions (e.g., directly from submission to rejection by the employee, or saved declarations requesting payment) occur rarely. These could be edge cases or indicate areas where the process isn't fully capturing all steps or decision points.
- **"Missing" Entity's Role**: Clarifying the role of "MISSING" could help in understanding potential system checks or external validation processes that are not immediately clear.

**Recommendations for Further Analysis:**

1. **Visual Process Mapping**: Create a detailed, visual map to better illustrate all paths and identify potential bottlenecks.
2. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Engage with employees, administration, pre-approvers, budget owners, supervisors, and potentially the "MISSING" entity representatives to gain deeper insights into each step's challenges and rationales.
3. **Performance Metrics Deep Dive**: Analyze the performance metrics (e.g., frequency, performance/time taken) at each step to pinpoint inefficiencies and areas for improvement.
4. **Employee Guidance and Support Review**: Evaluate the support provided to employees during the initial submission phase to reduce early-stage rejections.
