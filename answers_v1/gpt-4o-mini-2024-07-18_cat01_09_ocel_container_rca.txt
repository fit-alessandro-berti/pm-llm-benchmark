To analyze the root causes of the performance issues in the process based on the provided directly follows graph, we should look at the frequencies, durations, and transitions between different activities. Here are some specific considerations based on the data:

### 1. High Frequency of Self-Loops:
- **Load Truck  Load Truck (Truck/Container)**: This transition has the highest frequency of events (8559). It creates a bottleneck because of the repeated loading operations without progression to the next step. Additionally, this occurs for both Truck and Container object types, indicating that the system may be caught in a loop of loading rather than moving forward.
- **Load to Vehicle  Load to Vehicle (Vehicle)**: Similar behavior is identified here, with 1827 events. This too can indicate inefficiencies in how the loading process is managed, leading to unnecessary delays.

### 2. Protracted Durations:
- **Order Empty Containers  Pick Up Empty Container**: This transition has a very long duration of 368943.92, suggesting delays in making a decision or executing this step. Such extended durations can slow down subsequent processes, contributing to overall inefficiency.
- **Order Empty Containers  Depart**: This process has a duration of 1007066.16, indicating significant delays from ordering to departure. Given the relatively high number of events (561), this step is a potential area for major delays across the entire process.
- **Depart  Depart**: This self-loop also carries a large duration (1051301.41) which indicates that items may be stuck in a waiting status, causing delays in the overall flow.

### 3. Frequent Rescheduling Activities:
- **Reschedule Container** has multiple transitions leading to and from it, particularly into "Depart" and "Book Vehicles". The high number of transitions and relatively significant durations (e.g., 275189.97 for Reschedule  Depart) indicates that there may be uncertainty or inefficiencies in logistics planning leading to frequent rescheduling.

### 4. Inconsistent Resources:
- The transition from **Book Vehicles** across multiple activities points to potential resource constraints or misallocations. High duration paired with frequent occurrences might signal that vehicle resources are either limited or incorrectly dispatched, requiring overbooking or last-minute changes, hence causing delays.

### 5. Activity Uncertainty:
- The overall high frequency of events without further progression (e.g., "Bring to Loading Bay" and its connections) might indicate uncertainties in the process workflow, leading to performance issues. The consistent recurrence of loading, weighing, and placing in stock suggests that these steps may require streamlining to reduce touchpoints and improve flow.

### 6. Repetitive Processes:
- Many steps involve repetitive actions without clear transitions to customer order fulfillment. This hint at process inefficiencies, particularly around warehouse operations (loading/unloading), that can slow down the entire logistics process.

### Summary:
In summary, the primary root causes of performance issues in the given process are linked to repetitive operations (self-loops), extended wait times for specific activities, frequent rescheduling indicating logistical inefficiencies, and potential resource constraints. Streamlining these processes, reducing unnecessary self-loops, addressing bottlenecks, and optimizing scheduling efforts could help alleviate performance issues.
