In this context, attributes that are sensitive for fairness are those that are related to demographics or personal characteristics of the candidates. These attributes include:

- case:citizen
- case:gender
- case:german speaking
- case:religious

These attributes can potentially lead to discrimination or bias in the hiring process if not properly managed. Monitoring and addressing any disparities or biases related to these attributes is important to ensure fairness and equality in the recruitment process.
