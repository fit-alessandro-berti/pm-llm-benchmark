Certainly! Below is a hypothetical example of a temporal profile for a simplified "Purchase-to-Pay" (P2P) process. This process typically involves several stages such as Request Creation, Approval, Purchase Order Generation, Receipt Processing, and Payment. The times are expressed in seconds to maintain consistency.

Here's an example of what the Python dictionary might look like:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Request Creation', 'Approval'): (21600, 7200),   # Average: 6 hours, Standard Deviation: 2 hours
    ('Approval', 'Purchase Order Generation'): (14400, 3600),  # Average: 4 hours, Standard Deviation: 1 hour
    ('Purchase Order Generation', 'Receipt Processing'): (86400, 18000),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 5 hours
    ('Receipt Processing', 'Payment'): (21600, 7200),   # Average: 6 hours, Standard Deviation: 2 hours
}
```

### Explanation of the Temporal Profile:
- **Request Creation -> Approval**: The average time between creating a request and its approval is 6 hours, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.
- **Approval -> Purchase Order Generation**: Once approved, it takes an average of 4 hours to generate the purchase order, with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
- **Purchase Order Generation -> Receipt Processing**: It typically takes 1 day (86400 seconds) from generating the PO until receipt processing begins, with some variability (standard deviation of 5 hours).
- **Receipt Processing -> Payment**: After receipt is processed, it generally takes another 6 hours on average to process payment, with a standard deviation of 2 hours.

### Note:
This example assumes that each phase in the P2P cycle follows the previous one linearly and directly. In real-world scenarios, there might be more activities or branches, and some steps may not always follow others sequentially. Adjustments would be needed based on specific business processes and observed data.

You can use this temporal profile to identify deviations if you define a `ZETA` value (e.g., ZETA=2 for 2 standard deviations) and compare real process execution times against these averages and standard deviations.
