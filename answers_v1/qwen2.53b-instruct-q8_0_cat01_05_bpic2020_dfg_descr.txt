Based on the provided flow, I can outline a high-level description of the process:

The primary process revolves around employee submissions and approvals for payments or declarations. It involves multiple stages: submission by an employee, approval by different levels (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER), final approval by SUPERVISOR, and ultimately payment handling.

### Key Stages:
1. **Declaration Submission**:
   - EMPLOYEE submits a declaration.
   
2. **Approval Workflow**:
   - DECLARATION SUBMITTED -> DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION
   - DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR (automatically triggered)
   - There are also other approvals and rejections at different levels, such as:
     - DECLARATION APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER
     - DECLARATION FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER
     - DECLARATION FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION

3. **Payment Request**:
   - When a declaration reaches the final approval stage (DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR), it triggers a request for payment.
   
4. **Payment Handling Process**:
   - PAYMENT HANDLED follows the DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR.

### Decision Points and Loops:
- There are also loops where declarations might be rejected multiple times, such as:
  - DECLARATION REJECTED -> DECLARATION REJECTED
  - DECLARATION REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> DECLARATION SUBMITTED (and then potentially re-rejected or approved)
  
- Some actions like payment requests and rejections can trigger additional stages of approval or rejection.

### Summary:
This process involves a series of sequential approvals from different levels within an organization, with each action triggering potential further interactions. Declarations start as employee submissions that go through various administrative reviews before being potentially paid out. Throughout the process, there are multiple points where actions like rejections can loop back to submission stages.

The data highlights the complexity and workflow intricacies involved in a payment or approval process within an organization. Each step has specific performance metrics attached, indicating how often each action occurs compared to others.
