In the context of process mining and fairness analysis, the following attributes are considered sensitive and may impact fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether a case belongs to a citizen or not. Citizen status could be a sensitive attribute, as it may impact the lending decision process. For example, citizens may have different credit requirements or eligibility criteria compared to non-citizens.
2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates whether a case belongs to a male or female individual. Gender could be a sensitive attribute, as lending decisions may be influenced by stereotypes or biases related to gender.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether a case belongs to an individual who speaks German or not. This attribute may be relevant in a loan application process, where language proficiency could impact the borrower's ability to understand loan terms and conditions.
4. **resource**: This attribute indicates the resource (e.g., Loan Officer, Hotline, etc.) that handled the case. Resource allocation may be biased, leading to unequal treatment of cases.
5. **time:timestamp**: While not directly related to fairness, the time attribute can help identify temporal biases, such as differences in loan approval rates at different times of the day or week.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they may be related to:

* Personal characteristics (e.g., citizen status, gender, language proficiency)
* Systemic biases (e.g., resource allocation)
* Contextual factors (e.g., time of day or week)

To ensure fairness, it's essential to analyze these attributes and identify any potential biases in the lending process. This may involve techniques such as:

* Feature importance analysis to identify the most influential attributes
* Correlation analysis to detect relationships between attributes and outcomes
* Fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) to evaluate the bias in the model

By examining these sensitive attributes, you can gain a deeper understanding of the fairness issues in the loan application process and develop strategies to mitigate any biases.
