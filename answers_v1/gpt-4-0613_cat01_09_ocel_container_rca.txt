Based on the data given, the following observations can be identified as potential root causes for the performance issues in the process:

1. Object type: Truck - "Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" takes more time (duration = 84119.09) compared to other events, indicating there might be delays in driving to terminal or loading the truck.

2. Object type: Container - "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" has a high duration (368943.92), indicating a lot of time spent between ordering and picking up empty containers. The process time could be reduced by synchronizing these two activities more closely.

3. Object type: Container - The activities "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (duration = 743380.51) and "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" (frequency (number of events) = 35, frequency (number of objects) = 35, duration = 177997.60) also show very high durations, possibly indicating inefficiencies or bottlenecks in these stages.

4. Object type: Vehicle - The "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" step has a high frequency (number of events = 585) and high duration (295965.56), indicating inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process.

5. Object type: Forklift - The event pair "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (duration = 112600.53) shows a high duration, which might suggest a possible inefficiency in these processes.

6. Object type: Transport Document - "Depart" -> "Depart" shows superseding time (duration = 1051301.41). This suggests that there is too much idling between transports departures, causing potential inefficiencies.

By focusing on these areas, it may be possible to improve the overall efficiency and performance of the process.
