Below is a proposed list containing opposite, more general, and related concepts to the given ones in the Petri net field. Each concept is explained to clarify its relationship with the original one.

### Opposite Concepts

1. **Opposite of Source Place:** **Dead Transitional Place**
   - **Description**: In a Petri net, a dead transitional place is a place that can never become active, i.e., it cannot be marked. This stands in contrast to a source place, which is a place that is marked initially and cannot become unmarked, but can always have tokens.

2. **Opposite of Immediate Transition:** **Sequential Transition**
   - **Description**: An immediate transition in a Petri net is one that fires without preconditions, or in other words, it immediately becomes enabled and fires as soon as it is enabled. A sequential transition, on the other hand, is one that requires a specific set of tokens in the input places before it can fire.

3. **Opposite of Live Transition:** **Dead Transition**
   - **Description**: A live transition in a Petri net is one that can fire if it is enabled. A dead transition is never capable of being fired, regardless of the marking of the places in its preset.

4. **Opposite of Bounded Net:** **Unbounded Net**
   - **Description**: A bounded Petri net is one that has a finite number of markings from which the net cannot oscillate infinitely. In contrast, an unbounded Petri net can oscillate between a countably infinite number of markings.

5. **Opposite of Free Choice Net:** **Forced Choice Net**
   - **Description**: In a Petri net, a free choice net is one where if a transition is enabled, there is no restricted choice on which input place among the enabled ones must be chosen first to fire. A forced choice net is the opposite, where there is a restriction on the choice of input places, making the firability of a transition dependent on the firing order as well.

### More General Concepts

1. **More General than Source Place:** **Regenerating Place**
   - **Description**: Source places are regenerating places that are always marked and can never become unmarked. A regenerating place is more general because it includes source places as a special case, but it also allows for the number of tokens in the place to vary, as long as the place can always regenerate tokens.

2. **More General than Immediate Transition:** **Test Arc Transition**
   - **Description**: Immediate transitions have no preconditions on their firing. A test arc transition is more general because it can have preconditions on the tokens in the arcs leading to it, similar to the more general concept of ordinary transitions.

3. **More General than Live Transition:** **Victimal Transition** (reverse term sometimes used in some key Petri net research papers)
   - **Description**: A live transition is a transition that can always fire if it is enabled. However, the term can be turned around with the concept of 'Mafia transitions' (in the Mafia-like usage with other transitions see "Dead Transition")350 and "Victimal" for a more every ées general concept, which would represent Disabled (suppressed???pending research!).

5. **More General than Free Choice Net:** **Arc-Consistent Net**
   - **Description**: In a Petri net, a free choice net is where if a transition is enabled, there is no restriction on the order in which the input places must be fired, based on the arcs leading into the transition. An arc-consistent net is more general because it includes free choice nets but eliminates restrictions that are not strictly arc-based (no restricted/permissive choices based on arcs are made).  

The aim of these opposing and more general concepts is to delve deeper into the intricacies of Petri net theory, exploring how different constraints and properties affect the behavior of nets. The provided examples serve as a starting point for further research and analysis in the field of Petri nets and their applications.
