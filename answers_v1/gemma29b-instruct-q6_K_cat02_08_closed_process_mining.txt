Here are some opposite and more general concepts for the list you provided, focusing on the process mining field:

**Concept** | **Opposite Concept** | **More General Concept** | **Explanation**
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Automated Process Discovery | **Manual Process Modeling** | **Process Understanding** | Automated Process Discovery uses data to find patterns and build process models, while manual modeling involves human experts defining the process structure. Process Understanding encompasses both approaches and aims to gain a clear picture of how a process works.
Predictive Monitoring | **Reactive Monitoring** | **Process Performance Management** | Predictive Monitoring uses data to anticipate potential problems, while Reactive Monitoring detects issues after they occur. Process Performance Management is a broader concept that includes both types of monitoring and aims to optimize process performance.
Bottom-up Discovery | **Top-down Design** | **Process Modeling** | Bottom-up Discovery builds process models from data logs, while Top-down Design starts with a predefined process model and refines it based on data. Process Modeling encompasses both approaches and refers to the creation of a representation of a process.
Process Simulation | **Process Execution** | **Process Analysis** | Process Simulation uses a model to predict the behavior of a process, while Process Execution involves running the actual process. Process Analysis is a broader concept that includes both simulation and execution and aims to understand and improve process behavior.
Process Efficiency | **Process Complexity** | **Process Optimization** | Process Efficiency refers to how well a process achieves its goals with minimal resources, while Process Complexity describes the number of steps and dependencies in a process. Process Optimization aims to improve both efficiency and complexity by streamlining processes.
Real-time Monitoring | **Batch Processing** | **Process Visibility** | Real-time Monitoring provides continuous updates on process status, while Batch Processing analyzes data in predefined intervals. Process Visibility refers to the level of insight into process activities and can be achieved through both real-time and batch processing.
