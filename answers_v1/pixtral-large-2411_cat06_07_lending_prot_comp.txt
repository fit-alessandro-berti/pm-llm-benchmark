To identify the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, we need to analyze both the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are some key observations based on the provided data:

### 1. Frequency of Process Variants
- **Application Rejection**:
  - Protected Group: 960 instances with an average performance of 219999.156.
  - Unprotected Group: 664 instances with an average performance of 260002.042.
  - **Observation**: The protected group has a significantly higher frequency of application rejections compared to the unprotected group.

- **Appointment Denial**:
  - Protected Group: 599 instances with an average performance of 90000.623.
  - Unprotected Group: 363 instances with an average performance of 80001.088.
  - **Observation**: The protected group has a higher frequency of appointment denials.

- **Loan Denial**:
  - Protected Group: Multiple variants leading to loan denial, with frequencies ranging from 229 to 26.
  - Unprotected Group: Multiple variants leading to loan denial, with frequencies ranging from 2709 to 1.
  - **Observation**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of loan denials, particularly in the most common variant (2709 instances).

- **Loan Approval**:
  - Protected Group: Multiple variants leading to loan approval, with frequencies ranging from 39 to 13.
  - Unprotected Group: Multiple variants leading to loan approval, with frequencies ranging from 1656 to 1.
  - **Observation**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher frequency of loan approvals, particularly in the most common variant (1656 instances).

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **Average Performance for Loan Denial**:
  - Protected Group: Variants range from 310015.991 to 390055.423.
  - Unprotected Group: Variants range from 340005.309 to 489840.000.
  - **Observation**: The unprotected group generally has higher performance times for loan denial variants, indicating longer processing times.

- **Average Performance for Loan Approval**:
  - Protected Group: Variants range from 310018.097 to 349945.923.
  - Unprotected Group: Variants range from 260013.446 to 440103.800.
  - **Observation**: The unprotected group has a wider range of performance times for loan approval variants, with some variants showing significantly lower times (e.g., 260013.446) and others showing significantly higher times (e.g., 440103.800).

### 3. Unique Process Variants
- **Skipped Examination**:
  - Unprotected Group: 332 instances with an average performance of 260013.446.
  - **Observation**: This variant is unique to the unprotected group and shows a relatively low performance time, indicating a potentially streamlined process.

### 4. Overall Trends
- **Higher Frequency of Loan Denials and Approvals in Unprotected Group**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of both loan denials and approvals, suggesting a higher volume of processed applications.
- **Longer Processing Times in Unprotected Group**: The unprotected group generally has longer processing times for both loan denials and approvals, which could indicate more thorough or complex processing.

### Conclusion
The main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups include:
- **Frequency of Outcomes**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of both loan denials and approvals.
- **Processing Times**: The unprotected group generally experiences longer processing times for similar process variants.
- **Unique Process Variants**: The unprotected group has unique process variants, such as the "skipped examination" variant, which could indicate different processing rules or exceptions.

These differences suggest potential disparities in the treatment of the two groups, which could be further investigated to ensure fairness and equity in the loan application process.
