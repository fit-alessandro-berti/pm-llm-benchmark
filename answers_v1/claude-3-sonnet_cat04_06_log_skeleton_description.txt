Based on the declarative constraints provided, I can describe the underlying process as follows:

This appears to be a process for handling expense declaration and reimbursement within an organization. The process involves several roles or actors, including an Employee, a Pre-Approver, an Administration department, a Supervisor, and a Budget Owner.

The process typically starts with an Employee submitting a declaration (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). This declaration then goes through various approval stages:

1. The Administration department reviews the declaration (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION) and can either approve it (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION), reject it (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION), or forward it to other parties for further approval.

2. If forwarded, the declaration may go to a Pre-Approver (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER), who can approve (Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER), reject (Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER), or forward it to the Supervisor.

3. The Supervisor (Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR) can approve (Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR), reject (Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR), or forward it to the Budget Owner.

4. The Budget Owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER or Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER) provides the final approval or rejection.

If the declaration is approved by the necessary parties, a Request for Payment (Request Payment) is initiated, and the Payment is eventually Handled (Payment Handled).

The process also includes constraints on the ordering and co-occurrence of activities. For example, certain activities cannot occur together (Never Together constraints), while others must happen before or after certain activities (Always Before and Always After constraints). Additionally, there are constraints on the number of occurrences for each activity (Activity Occurrences constraints) and the immediate succession of some activities (Directly-Follows Constraints).

The Equivalence constraints suggest that certain activities are considered equivalent or have the same effect in the process.

Overall, this process model captures the various paths, constraints, and rules governing the expense declaration and reimbursement process within the organization.
