The underlying process appears to be a medical procedure involving use of ultrasound and a catheter. The process begins with a start event, and follows a series of tasks that must be executed in a specific order to complete the procedure.

The process includes tasks such as:

- Preparation of implements
- Hand washing
- Getting in sterile clothes
- Cleaning and preparing the puncture area
- Configuring the ultrasound
- Applying gel to probe
- Covering the probe
- Positioning the probe and patient
- Performing a Doppler, anatomic, and compression identification
- Anesthetizing the patient
- Performing puncture
- Installing a guidewire
- Checking the position of the wire
- Widening the pathway and advancing the catheter
- Checking the catheter position
- Checking the flow and reflow

Between these tasks, it appears that there are decision points defined by ExclusiveGateways, likely meant to handle potential complications or divergent paths in the procedure.
