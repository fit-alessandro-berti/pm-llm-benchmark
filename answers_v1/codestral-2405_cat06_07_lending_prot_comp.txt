The main differences in the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group can be summarized as follows:

1. Length of process: The protected group's processes are generally longer and more complex compared to the unprotected group's processes. This is evident from the additional steps such as making visits to assess collateral, requesting co-signers on loan, and multiple visits to assess collateral in the protected group's processes.

2. Application outcomes: The protected group has a higher rate of loan denials and application rejections compared to the unprotected group. For example, 960 applications in the protected group were rejected, while the unprotected group had only 664 rejections. Similarly, the protected group's loan denial frequency is higher in various process variants compared to the unprotected group.

3. Unfavorable outcomes: The protected group experiences more unfavorable outcomes such as loan denials and application rejections. The unprotected group also experiences loan denials and appointment denials, but at a lower frequency. Additionally, the unprotected group has a process variant where credit applications are directly denied without any prior examination, which is not present in the protected group's process variants.

4. Signing loan agreements: The protected group has a lower number of successful loan agreements compared to the unprotected group. For instance, only 31 instances in the protected group resulted in a signed loan agreement, while the unprotected group had 1656 such instances.

5. Performance: The average performance time for the protected group's processes is higher than that of the unprotected group's processes. This could be due to the additional steps and complexity in the protected group's processes, as well as the unfavorable outcomes that require more time to process.

In conclusion, the protected group experiences more complex and lengthy processes, higher rates of loan denials and application rejections, and fewer successful loan agreements compared to the unprotected group. These differences may indicate potential unfair treatment or disparate impact, which could be subject to further investigation and analysis.
