2. `case:gender`: This attribute may indicate the gender of individuals applying for a loan. If this attribute is used to make decisions about loan applications, it may lead to unfair outcomes because of biases or discrimination based on gender.
3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute may indicate the language proficiency of individuals applying for a loan. If this attribute is used to make decisions about loan applications, it may lead to unfair outcomes for individuals who do not speak German.
