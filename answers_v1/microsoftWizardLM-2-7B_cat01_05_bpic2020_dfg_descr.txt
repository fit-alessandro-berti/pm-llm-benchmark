Based on the provided data, it appears to describe a workflow or process for handling declarations through various stages of approval, rejection, payment handling, and other actions. Each step in the process has associated metrics for frequency (how often a transition occurs) and performance (a measure of the transition's efficiency). Here's a high-level description of the process:

1. **Declaration Submitted by Employee**: This is the initial step where an employee submits a declaration for review.

2. **Declaration For Approval by Supervisor/Admin/Pre-Approver**: In some cases, the declaration is initially marked for approval by a supervisor, administrator, or pre-approver. This is a preparatory step for the formal approval process.

3. **Declaration Approved by Administrator/Budget Owner/Pre-Approver**: The declaration is officially approved by the administrator, budget owner, or pre-approver, moving it closer to the final approved stage.

4. **Declaration Final Approved by Supervisor**: After initial approval, the declaration is finally approved by the supervisor, marking the end of the approval process. This is a critical step where the declaration is fully authorized.

5. **Request Payment**: Once the declaration is final approved, a payment request can be made. This step is infrequent (only 1 out of 8202 times after administrative approval) but has a relatively high performance score.

6. **Payment Handled**: This step indicates that the payment request has been processed and handled. This is a relatively frequent step (happening 10037 times) with a moderate performance score.

7. **Declaration Rejected by Various Actors**: At various stages, the declaration can be rejected by the supervisor, employee, administrator, pre-approver, budget owner, or missing (a potential placeholder for a process step or actor).

8. **Declaration Saved by Employee**: This indicates that the employee has saved the declaration for later processing, which then leads to a payment request, suggesting an intermediate step or intention to submit for approval again.

9. **Declaration For Approval by Supervisor/Admin/Pre-Approver (Repeated)**: Similar to the initial for approval step, the declaration is marked for approval by the respective roles again, which could be due to it being saved and resubmitted.

10. **Declaration Submitted/Resubmitted by Employee**: The cycle can repeat with the employee resubmitting the declaration for review.

11. **Declaration Rejected by Missing**: This step suggests a rejection due to a missing element or step in the process, which seems to lead to a high performance score despite being an abortive step.

12. **Other Transitions**: There are a few other transitions that don't fit neatly into the approval workflow, such as "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE," which might represent a situation where the supervisor's rejection is being formally confirmed or endorsed by the employee.

The frequency and performance data provide insights into the typical path of a declaration and the efficiency of each transition. For example, the transition from "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" is both frequent (5133 times) and efficient (performance score of 164330.770), indicating that this is a key and smooth part of the process.

Overall, the process seems to involve multiple rounds of approval, with the possibility of payment processing, and includes mechanisms for handling rejected declarations and saving drafts for later review. It's also notable that some transitions have very low frequency but can have high performance scores, which suggests that while they may not be common, they are executed quickly when they do occur.
