Okay, here's a list of 20 relevant questions about the process, along with a confidence score for each. The confidence score reflects how well the provided data allows us to answer the question. A high confidence score means the data directly supports answering the question, while a lower score indicates the data might only provide partial insight or that the answer might require further assumptions.

**Questions about the Process & Associated Confidence Scores**

1.  **What is the most common path for a declaration?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - The provided data clearly shows the most frequent variant is "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled".
2.  **What is the overall average time for a declaration to complete the main path (without rejections)?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - We can calculate the weighted average performance for the main variants using the provided frequency and performance data. It only becomes less reliable as the number of rejections increase.
3.  **How frequently do declarations get rejected by the Administration?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - We can count the occurrences of "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" across all variants and then divide by the total number of declarations to calculate a frequency of that specific event.
4.  **What is the average time difference for a declaration that includes a rejection from the Administration compared to the main variant?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - We can estimate this by comparing the 'performance' of process variants that include 'REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' against the common 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' path. 
5.  **What percentage of declarations require pre-approval?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - We can count the variants containing "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" and get an estimation of its frequency.
6.  **How frequently do declarations get rejected by the Supervisor?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - similar to question 3, the occurrences of "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" can be used to calculate its relative frequency.
7.  **What is the average time it takes for a declaration that gets rejected by a PRE_APPROVER to be processed to the point before it was rejected?**
    *   **Confidence:** 7/10 - We can estimate an average time for the entire process, but it is difficult to isolate the time spent on individual steps. This is a limitation of the data, we only have the global performance of a variant of the process.
8.  **Which rejection step introduces the highest delays into the process?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - By comparing average process performance with different rejection steps, we can identify which rejections correlate with the highest impact on total process time.
9.  **How often does a declaration get rejected multiple times (more than once) during the process?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - We can identify process variants with rejections, and calculate how frequent it is for declarations to include more than one rejection.
10. **How often does a declaration get rejected by MISSING?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - By identifying process variants containing the activity "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" we can directly calculate the total number of affected declarations.
11. **What is the average time difference for a declaration that includes a rejection from the Budget Owner compared to the main variant?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - Similar to the question about Administration rejections, this allows us to see the performance impact of Budget Owner rejections, comparing it with the performance of the common path.
12. **Are there significant performance differences for a variant that includes Budget Owner approval against those that do not?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - We can compare the performance metrics for variants with and without "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER".
13. **What is the percentage of declarations that reach the 'Payment Handled' step?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - This can be calculated by summing up the frequencies of all paths ending with 'Payment Handled' and divide this by the overall number of declarations (sum of all frequencies).
14. **What percentage of declarations do not complete the payment process?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - This can be calculated by summing up the frequencies of all paths that do *not* end with 'Payment Handled' and divide this by the overall number of declarations (sum of all frequencies).
15. **Is there a substantial delay associated with a supervisor rejection that results in the declaration reaching the end process (payment)?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - Compare process times for variants with "REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" that eventually lead to 'Payment Handled' against the common path without rejections.
16. **How many declarations are saved but not submitted?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - The data shows 134 declarations that are saved but not submitted.
17. **What is the average performance time of a declaration that has 3 rejections?**
    *   **Confidence:** 7/10 - We can find variants that include three rejections and compute the weighted average. It's not perfect, since some variants might have several different paths.
18.  **Is the payment step (Request Payment -> Payment Handled) always the last step before the process ends?**
    *   **Confidence:** 10/10 - According to the provided data, the payment step is always the final step for all completed processes.
19. **Are there any loops in the process (other than re-submissions after rejection)?**
    *   **Confidence:** 9/10 - The data represents common sequence of events, we can state that the most common "loop" that is present is resubmitting the declaration after a rejection from a given entity.
20. **Is there any significant variance of the process for a successful declaration, against one which is rejected by missing information?**
    *   **Confidence:** 8/10 - We can compare the process variants with "REJECTED by MISSING" against the successful variants.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these or calculate the actual answers based on the provided data!
