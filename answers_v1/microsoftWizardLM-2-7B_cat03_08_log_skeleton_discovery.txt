To generate a Log Skeleton model for the given process variants, we need to extract the activities, their occurrences, and the relationships between them based on the constraints mentioned earlier. Let's identify the activities first:

Activities:
- CreateFine
- SendFine
- InsertFineNotification
- AddPenalty
- Payment
- SendForCreditCollection
- InsertDateAppealToPrefecture
- AppealToJudge
- ReceiveResultAppealFromPrefecture
- NotifyResultAppealToOffender

Now, let's determine the frequency of each activity based on the provided data:

Frequency (activities and their occurrences):
```python
activities_freq = {
    'CreateFine': {46371, 56482, 20385, 3736, 3301, 3131, 2497, 362, 2089, 139, 126, 114, 108, 89, 88, 69, 61, 58, 49, 45, 34, 32, 30, 23, 22, 20, 20, 19, 17, 16, 15, 15, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 9, 9},
    'SendFine': {46371, 56482, 20385, 3736, 3301, 3131, 2497, 362, 2089, 139, 126, 114, 108, 89, 88, 69, 61, 58, 49, 45, 34, 32, 30, 19, 17, 16, 15, 15, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 9, 9},
    'InsertFineNotification': {46371, 56482, 20385, 3736, 3301, 3131, 2497, 362, 2089, 139, 126, 114, 108, 89, 88, 69, 61, 58, 49, 45, 34, 32, 30, 19, 17, 16, 15, 15, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 9, 9},
    'AddPenalty': {9520, 56482, 3736, 3301, 3131, 1515, 114, 108, 89, 69, 61, 56, 522, 443, 3301, 3131, 1515, 114, 522, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48},
    'Payment': {46371, 56482, 20385, 1486, 126, 114, 362, 2089, 139, 126, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5},
    'SendForCreditCollection': {56482, 46371, 20385, 9520, 1515, 522, 443, 3301, 114, 89, 69, 58, 522, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 18},
    'InsertDateAppealToPrefecture': {2497, 126, 108, 9, 139, 114, 362, 88, 61, 58, 51, 45, 44, 37, 33, 31, 29, 25, 22, 20, 19, 17, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8},
    'AppealToJudge': {135, 114, 108, 89, 88, 3131, 3301, 2089, 1515, 108, 89, 58, 522, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 10},
    'ReceiveResultAppealFromPrefecture': {139, 114, 108, 89, 61, 1515, 114, 108, 89, 69, 58, 56, 522, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 8},
    'NotifyResultAppealToOffender': {114, 108, 89, 61, 1515, 114, 89, 58, 56, 522, 48, 48, 48, 24},
    'SendForCreditCollection': {56482, 46371, 20385, 9520, 1515, 522, 443, 3301, 114, 89, 69, 58, 522, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 18}
}
```

Now, let's define the constraints based on the Log Skeleton model:

1. Equivalence: If one activity occurs, it must have the same occurrences as another. This is derived from the frequency data.
2. Always Before: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. This is derived from the sequential order of activities.
3. Always After: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. This is also derived from the sequential order of activities.
4. Never Together: The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case. This implies that if one activity occurs, the other must not occur in the same case.
5. Activity Occurrences: We have already defined the frequency for each activity.
6. Directly-Follows Constraints: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after. This is derived from consecutive occurrences of activities in the frequency data.

Given these constraints, we can construct the Log Skeleton model in Python as follows:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # For example, if CreateFine with frequency 46371 occurs, then all other activities with the same frequency will also occur.
        ('CreateFine',): 46371,
        # ... other equivalence pairs can be added based on the frequency data
    },
    'always_before': {
        # For example, if SendFine with frequency 46371 occurs, then InsertFineNotification with frequency 46371 must have occurred previously.
        ('SendFine', 'InsertFineNotification'): 46371,
        # ... other always_before constraints can be added based on the sequential order of activities.
    },
    'always_after': {
        # For example, if InsertFineNotification with frequency 46371 occurs, then SendFine with frequency 46371 will occur after.
        ('InsertFineNotification', 'SendFine'): 46371,
        # ... other always_after constraints can be added based on the sequential order of activities.
    },
    'never_together': {
        # For example, if CreateFine occurs, then Payment should not occur in the same case.
        ('CreateFine', 'Payment'): {},
        # ... other never_together constraints can be added based on mutual exclusion of activities.
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        # For example, if SendFine with frequency 20385 occurs, then InsertFineNotification will occur immediately after.
        ('SendFine', 'InsertFineNotification'): 20385,
        # ... other directly_follows constraints can be added based on the sequential order of activities.
    },
    'activ_freq': activities_freq,
    'acts_in_parallel': {
        # Activities that can occur in parallel based on the frequency data and mutual exclusion.
        # This is derived by analyzing the frequency data and identifying activities that do not prevent each other from occurring.
        # ... parallel constraints can be added here.
    }
}
```

The `acts_in_parallel` set will depend on the specific mutual exclusions between activities, which are not directly provided in the frequency data but can be inferred based on the frequency of occurrences and the context of the activities. For example, if two activities never occur at the same frequency across all variants, they might be considered to not occur in parallel.

Please note that the Log Skeleton model is quite complex for the given process variants, and the above Python dictionary is a simplified representation. In practice, the model might need to be refined further to accurately capture all the constraints and relationships between activities.
