 The process described by the provided DECLARE declarative process model involves a sequence of activities related to the approval and handling of payment declarations within an organization. Here's a description of the underlying process based on the constraints provided:

1. **Initialization**: The process begins with the activity 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. This is the starting point of the process, where an employee submits a declaration for payment.

2. **Existence and Exactly 1**: Each of the four main activities must occur exactly once in the process. These activities are:
   - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'
   - 'Request Payment'
   - 'Payment Handled'

3. **Responded Existence**: If any of the four main activities occurs, then the other three must also occur. This ensures that once the process starts, all necessary steps will be taken.

4. **Alternate Response**: This constraint ensures that once an activity occurs, the next activity in the sequence must be the one it is related to, without repetition. The sequences are:
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, the next activity must be 'Payment Handled'.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, the next activity must be 'Payment Handled'.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, the next activity must be one of 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', or 'Payment Handled'.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, the next activity must be 'Request Payment'.

5. **Precedence**: This constraint defines the order in which activities must have occurred. For example, 'Payment Handled' must follow 'Request Payment', and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must follow 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

6. **Chain Precedence**: This is a stronger version of precedence where activities must directly follow one another. In this case:
   - 'Request Payment' must directly follow 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.

7. **Alternate Precedence**: Similar to alternate response, but for the preceding activities. This ensures that the activities alternate without repetition in the reverse order.

8. **Response**: If certain activities occur, others must occur later in the process.

9. **Chain Response**: This is a stronger version of response where the response activity must directly follow the initiating activity. In this case:
   - 'Request Payment' must directly follow 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.
   - 'Payment Handled' must directly follow 'Request Payment'.

10. **Succession**: This constraint combines both response and precedence. For example, 'Payment Handled' must follow 'Request Payment', and 'Request Payment' must have been preceded by 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'.

11. **Alternate Succession**: This combines the conditions of alternate response and alternate precedence, ensuring that activities in the succession relationship alternate without repetition.

12. **Chain Succession**: This is the combination of chain response and chain precedence, ensuring a direct sequence of activities.

13. **Co-Existence**: If any of the four main activities occurs, the other three must also occur within the process. This is similar to responded existence but emphasizes that the occurrence of one implies the occurrence of the others.

14. **Absence**: Certain activities are not part of the process and will not occur. These are:
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER'
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'
   - 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'
   - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR'
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER'
   - 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER'
   - 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'

The process, therefore, involves an employee submitting a declaration, which then goes through a final approval by a supervisor. Once approved, a payment request is made, and finally, the payment is handled. The process is linear and strictly enforced, with no room for rejections or alternative paths once it has started. Each step must follow directly after the previous one without any other activities in between, except where 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' can be followed by any of the three subsequent activities.
