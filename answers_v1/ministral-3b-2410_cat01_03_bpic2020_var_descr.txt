Based on the provided process variants and their respective frequencies and performance data, we can describe the underlying process as follows:

### Process Flow

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
   - This is the initial step where the submission of a declaration is made by an employee.

2. **Approval Routes**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**
     - The declaration is approved by the administration.
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**
     - The declaration is approved by a pre-approver.

3. **Additional Approvals**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER**
     - The declaration is approved by a budget owner.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**
     - The declaration is rejected by the administration.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER**
     - The declaration is rejected by a pre-approver.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**
     - The declaration is rejected by a supervisor.
   - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER**
     - The declaration is rejected by a budget owner.

4. **Final Approval**
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
     - The declaration is finally approved by the supervisor.

5. **Payment Handling**
   - **Request Payment**
     - A request for payment is made.
   - **Payment Handled**
     - The payment is handled.

### Process Variants

#### Main Variant
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
  - This is the primary process route with the highest frequency and performance.

#### Significant Variants
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
  - This variant includes an additional approval by a budget owner.

- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
  - This variant skips some approval steps.

#### Rejected Variants
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
  - The declaration is rejected by the administration and then by the employee.

- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
  - This variant loops back to the employee after initial rejection.

#### Mixed Approval and Rejection
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
  - This variant includes a mix of approval and rejection with multiple iterations.

#### Other Notable Variants
- Variants where the process is terminated with rejections at various stages.
- Variants with specific approvals and rejections by different roles.
- Variants where the process ends with a final approval followed by payment handling.

### Conclusion

The process involves multiple stages of approval and rejection by different roles (employee, administration, pre-approver, budget owner, supervisor). The primary process routes demonstrate that most declarations end with final approval and payment handling. Significant variations include additional approvals, skipped steps, and loops due to rejection and resubmission. Understanding these variants helps in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing approval workflows, and enhancing overall process efficiency.
