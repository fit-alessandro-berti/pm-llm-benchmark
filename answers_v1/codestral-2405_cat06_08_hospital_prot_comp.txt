Based on the provided data, the main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group are:

1. Frequency of processes: The unprotected group has significantly more occurrences of certain process variants compared to the protected group. For example, the "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" process occurs 1466 times in the unprotected group, whereas it only occurs 73 times in the protected group.

2. Complexity of processes: The unprotected group also has more complex processes compared to the protected group. For instance, the "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" process occurs in the unprotected group, which is not present in the protected group's processes.

3. Outcomes of treatments: The protected group has more treatment outcomes that do not result in discharge. For example, the "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" and "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment" processes occur in the protected group but not in the unprotected group. Conversely, the unprotected group has more treatments that are unsuccessful but eventually lead to successful treatments and discharge.

4. Registration locations: The protected group has processes that start with registration at both "ER" (emergency room) and "FD" (doctor's office), while the unprotected group primarily starts with registration at "FD" or "ER". However, the frequency of registration at "ER" in the unprotected group is similar to the protected group.

5. Performance: The average performance times for similar process variants differ between the two groups. For example, the process "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has an average performance of 260,006.914 in the protected group and 260,005.208 in the unprotected group, with a slight difference in performance.

Based on these observations and domain knowledge, it appears that the unprotected group may be undergoing more complex treatments that involve additional examinations, thorough examinations, and unsuccessful treatments before achieving a successful outcome. Moreover, it seems that the protected group may have more instances of treatments that do not lead to discharge, which could indicate a different outcome or follow-up treatment.
