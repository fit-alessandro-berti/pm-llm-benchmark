Based on the given data, it appears that the underlying process is related to the submission, approval, and payment of declarations or requests. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration goes through various approval stages:
   - Administration approval
   - Pre-approver approval (in some cases)
   - Budget owner approval (in some cases)
   - Supervisor final approval
3. If the declaration is rejected at any stage, it may be resubmitted by the employee after addressing the issues.
4. Once the declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is made.
5. The payment is then handled.

The process variants show different paths that the declaration can take, involving different combinations of approvals and rejections. Some key observations:

- The most frequent path is the straightforward one where the declaration is approved by administration, then supervisor, and payment is handled.
- In some cases, additional approvals from budget owners or pre-approvers are required.
- Rejections can occur at various stages (administration, supervisor, budget owner, pre-approver), leading to resubmissions by the employee.
- There are instances where a "missing" step leads to resubmission or rejection.
- The process can involve multiple resubmissions due to rejections at different stages.

The data also includes performance metrics (assumed to be processing times in some unit) for each process variant, which can provide insights into the efficiency and bottlenecks of different paths.

Overall, the data represents a complex approval and payment process for declarations, with various possible paths involving multiple stakeholders and potential rejections and resubmissions.
