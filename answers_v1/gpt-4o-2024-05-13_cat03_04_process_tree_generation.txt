Certainly! For a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, we might define it with multiple steps and decision points. Let's assume the following process flow:

1. **Receive Purchase Requisition** (PR)
2. **Validate PR**
3. Perform either:
   - **Approve PR** 
   - **Reject PR**
4. If approved, proceed to **Place Order**.
5. **Receive Goods**

We could model the above in a process tree with the following relationship:

- Sequence: 
  1. **Receive PR** 
  2. **Validate PR**
  3. Exclusive choice between **Approve PR** and **Reject PR**
  4. If **Approve PR**, continue to:
     - **Place Order**
     - **Receive Goods**

Below is the Python code to construct such a process tree in `pm4py`:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Step 1: Create the root of the process tree with a SEQUENCE
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Step 2: Add the initial steps as children with labels
receive_pr = ProcessTree(label="Receive Purchase Requisition", parent=root)
validate_pr = ProcessTree(label="Validate Purchase Requisition", parent=root)

# Step 3: Construct the exclusive choice (XOR) for approval/rejection
xor_decision = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
approve_pr = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Requisition", parent=xor_decision)
reject_pr = ProcessTree(label="Reject Purchase Requisition", parent=xor_decision)

# Assign the children to the xor_decision node
xor_decision.children.append(approve_pr)
xor_decision.children.append(reject_pr)

# Step 4: Create the sequential steps post-approval
sequence_after_approval = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=approve_pr)
place_order = ProcessTree(label="Place Order", parent=sequence_after_approval)
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=sequence_after_approval)

# Add the children to the sequence node post-approval
sequence_after_approval.children.append(place_order)
sequence_after_approval.children.append(receive_goods)

# Step 5: Add all the children to the root
root.children.append(receive_pr)
root.children.append(validate_pr)
root.children.append(xor_decision)

# Resulting process tree:
# SEQUENCE (
#     'Receive Purchase Requisition',
#     'Validate Purchase Requisition',
#     XOR (
#         SEQUENCE (
#             'Approve Purchase Requisition',
#             'Place Order',
#             'Receive Goods'
#         ),
#         'Reject Purchase Requisition'
#     )
# )

# Note: The actual process tree in pm4py would have more functionality.
# For visualizing such a tree, pm4py offers functions that allow plotting or converting to other notations.

# Example usage, no actual output calls
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pm4py.visualization.process_tree import visualizer as pt_vis
    gviz = pt_vis.apply(root)
    pt_vis.view(gviz)
```

Explanation of the code:

1. Initially, set a root node with the `SEQUENCE` operator.
2. Add the process steps `Receive Purchase Requisition` and `Validate Purchase Requisition`.
3. Construct an exclusive choice (XOR) for `Approve PR` and `Reject PR`.
4. If `Approve PR` is selected, create another sequence of `Place Order` followed by `Receive Goods`.
5. Append all children to their respective parent nodes accordingly.

This structure closely follows the hierarchical model required for a Purchase-to-Pay process, capturing different steps and decision points effectively.
