Based on the information you provided, there are several potential differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group. Here are some possibilities:

1. Frequency of occurrence: The unprotected group has several process variants that are much more frequent than their protected group counterparts. For example, the unprotected group has 2709 instances of "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied," compared to only 960 instances for the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is experiencing a higher rate of these specific issues.
2. Performance: The unprotected group also has several process variants with significantly worse performance times than the protected group. For example, the unprotected group has a process variant with a performance time of 440103.800, compared to the best performance time of 219999.156 for the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is experiencing slower processing times for certain tasks.
3. Specific pathways: The unprotected group has several process variants that involve a specific pathway of steps that is not present in the protected group. For example, the unprotected group has a process variant that involves "Request Co-Signer On Loan" twice in a row, which is not present in the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is experiencing a different set of steps in the loan application process.
4. Skipped examination: The unprotected group has a process variant that involves "skipped_examination," which is not present in the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is experiencing a different approach to the loan application process.

Overall, these differences could suggest that the unprotected group is experiencing different issues at each step of the loan application process, and that these issues are leading to worse performance times and different outcomes. It's important to consider these differences and investigate further to understand the root causes and potential solutions.
