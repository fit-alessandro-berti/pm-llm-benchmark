This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process of requesting and receiving a credit score. It involves three main participants:

1. **Credit Scoring Frontend (Clerk):** Represented in the top lane, this is likely the interface or system through which a user initiates a credit score request.
2. **Credit Scoring (Bank):** Shown in the middle lane, this represents the bank's internal processes for handling the credit score request.
3. **Scoring Service:** Depicted in the bottom lane, this is an external service responsible for actually calculating the credit score.

**Here's a breakdown of the process flow:**

**Credit Scoring Frontend (Clerk):**

*   The process starts with a user action (not explicitly shown) that triggers the credit scoring request.

**Credit Scoring (Bank):**

1. **Request Credit Score:** The bank receives the request and initiates the process.
2. **Report Delay/Credit Score Received:** The bank waits for either a delay notification or the actual credit score from the Scoring Service. This is indicated by a message intermediate event with two outgoing flows.
3. **Send Credit Score:** Once the credit score is received, the bank sends it to the frontend, presumably to be displayed to the user.
4. **Scoring Request Handled:** The process ends for the bank.

**Scoring Service:**

1. **Scoring Request Received:** The service receives the request from the bank.
2. **Compute Credit Score (Level 1):** The service initially attempts to compute the score using a basic level of calculation.
3. **Score Available?:** A decision point (gateway) checks if the level 1 calculation was successful.
    *   **Yes:** If the score is available, it's sent back to the bank.
    *   **No:** If not, the service reports a delay to the bank.
4. **Compute Credit Score (Level 2):** If the level 1 calculation fails, the service performs a more complex level 2 calculation.
5. **Send Credit Score:** The score from the level 2 calculation is sent to the bank.
6. **Scoring Request Handled:** The process ends for the Scoring Service.

**Key elements in the diagram:**

*   **Lanes:** Represent the different participants or systems involved.
*   **Tasks:** Rectangular boxes representing activities.
*   **Gateways:** Diamond shapes representing decision points or parallel actions.
*   **Events:** Circles representing triggers or results. In this case, message events (circles with envelopes) are used to show the exchange of information between participants.
*   **Sequence Flows:** Solid arrows showing the order of activities within a lane.
*   **Message Flows:** Dashed arrows showing the exchange of messages between lanes.

**Overall, this BPMN diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the credit scoring process, highlighting the interactions between the frontend, the bank, and the scoring service.** It also illustrates how the process handles potential delays in receiving the credit score.
