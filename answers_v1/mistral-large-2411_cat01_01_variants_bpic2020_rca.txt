Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performances, several root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions have significantly higher performance times. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 36: Performance = 2542497.917
     - Variant with frequency 29: Performance = 2790977.310
     - Variant with frequency 11: Performance = 2544294.364
   - Each rejection and resubmission cycle adds considerable time to the process.

2. **Additional Approval Steps**:
   - Variants involving additional approval steps, such as approval by the BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER, tend to have higher performance times. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 2473: Performance = 1084338.407
     - Variant with frequency 575: Performance = 861058.409
   - These additional steps introduce delays and increase the overall processing time.

3. **Rejection by MISSING**:
   - Variants where the declaration is rejected by MISSING and then resubmitted also show higher performance times. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 40: Performance = 1947246.400
   - This indicates that handling missing information or documents adds significant time to the process.

4. **Complex Approval Chains**:
   - Variants with complex approval chains, involving multiple levels of approval and rejection, have higher performance times. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 77: Performance = 1728631.623
     - Variant with frequency 49: Performance = 1685420.041
   - The complexity and number of steps in the approval process contribute to longer processing times.

5. **High Frequency of Simple Variants**:
   - The most frequent variant (frequency 4618) has a relatively lower performance time (810187.903), suggesting that simpler, more straightforward processes are more efficient.
   - Variants with fewer steps and no rejections have better performance.

6. **Specific Bottlenecks**:
   - Certain steps, such as approval by the BUDGET OWNER or rejection by the SUPERVISOR, appear to be bottlenecks. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 20: Performance = 2247841.050
     - Variant with frequency 10: Performance = 2054847.800
   - These steps may require more time or resources, leading to delays.

7. **Repeated Rejections by ADMINISTRATION**:
   - Variants where the declaration is repeatedly rejected by ADMINISTRATION show very high performance times. For example:
     - Variant with frequency 5: Performance = 13805869.200
   - This suggests that repeated rejections by ADMINISTRATION are a significant cause of delays.

By addressing these specific issues, such as streamlining approval processes, reducing the number of rejections, and optimizing the handling of missing information, the overall performance of the process can be improved.
