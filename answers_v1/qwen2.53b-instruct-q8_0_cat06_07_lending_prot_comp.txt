To identify significant differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we can analyze both groups based on their process variants and execution times.

### Differences in Process Variants:

1. **Initial Appointment**:
   - The protected group tends to have a higher number of variants where they "Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application" compared to the unprotected group.
   - This could indicate that there might be more frequent or varied initial interactions with customers for approval processes in the protected group.

2. **Verification and Assessment Steps**:
   - The protected group has multiple paths through a series of steps such as "Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral" which are not present in significant numbers in the unprotected group.
   - This suggests that there is more scrutiny, deeper assessment, or additional verification processes for loans in the protected group compared to the unprotected group.

3. **Loan Approval vs. Rejection**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of "Application Rejected" and "Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied."
   - There is also an increased number of instances where customers do not receive loans in the unprotected group, which could be due to different criteria or decision-making processes.

### Differences in Execution Times:

1. **Significantly Longer Execution Time**:
   - The protected group has a higher average execution time (sum of performance times divided by count) compared to the unprotected group.
   - For instance, the protected group's longest path ("Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied") takes approximately 350,000 seconds (over 9 hours) on average.
   - The unprotected group's longest path ("Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement") takes approximately 380,000 seconds (over 10 hours) on average.

### Summary of Key Differences:

- **Additional Verification Steps**:
  - The protected group has more detailed verification and assessment processes that are not as prominent in the unprotected group.
  
- **Higher Number of Rejections/Later Loan Denials**:
  - There is a higher frequency of loan rejections or later loan denials for customers in the protected group compared to the unprotected group.

- **Slower Execution Time**:
  - The average execution time (time taken from initial request to final action) is longer for the protected group, which could imply slower decision-making processes or deeper scrutiny.

These differences suggest that there might be a more stringent and thorough loan approval process in place for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. This difference could stem from various factors such as regulatory compliance requirements, internal company policies, or specific customer segmentation criteria used by the protected group.
