Based on the DECLARE constraints provided, I can describe the following business process for handling declarations:

The process represents a declaration handling workflow that always starts with an employee submitting a declaration ("Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" - Initialization constraint).

The main activities in the process are:
1. Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
2. Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
3. Request Payment
4. Payment Handled

Each of these activities must occur exactly once in any process instance (Exactly 1 constraint).

The process flow follows this general pattern:
1. The employee must first submit the declaration
2. After submission, the declaration needs to be approved by a supervisor
3. Once approved, a payment must be requested
4. Finally, the payment must be handled

More specifically:
- After an employee submits a declaration, it must be followed by supervisor approval, payment request, and payment handling (Response constraints)
- The supervisor's approval must come after submission but before payment request (Chain precedence/response)
- Payment request must be directly followed by payment handling (Chain succession)
- Activities must happen in sequence without repetitions (Alternate constraints)

The model explicitly excludes several activities (Absence constraints) such as:
- Various rejection scenarios (by pre-approver, administration, supervisor, etc.)
- Intermediate approval states (FOR_APPROVAL)
- Employee saving the declaration

This suggests a "happy path" process model focusing on successful declaration processing without considering rejection or revision scenarios.

All activities are tightly coupled (Co-Existence constraints), meaning if any one activity occurs, all others must also occur, ensuring the process is completed end-to-end.
