Here's an analysis of opposite and more general concepts for the given process mining terms:

1. Automated Process Discovery
- Opposite: Manual Process Documentation/Mapping
  (Human-driven documentation of processes without algorithmic assistance)
- More General: Process Understanding/Analysis
  (Any method to comprehend how processes work, whether automated or manual)

2. Predictive Monitoring
- Opposite: Historical/Retrospective Analysis
  (Looking back at what happened rather than predicting future events)
- More General: Process Performance Analysis
  (Any type of process analysis, whether forward-looking or backward-looking)

3. Bottom-up Discovery
- Opposite: Top-down Design
  (Defining processes from management level rather than inferring from actual execution data)
- More General: Process Architecture Development
  (Any approach to understanding or designing process structures)

4. Process Simulation
- Opposite: Direct Process Observation
  (Studying actual process execution rather than simulated scenarios)
- More General: Process Behavior Analysis
  (Any method to understand process behavior, whether simulated or real)

5. Process Efficiency
- Opposite: Process Waste/Inefficiency
  (Areas where resources are not optimally used)
- More General: Process Performance
  (Overall measurement of how a process operates, including both efficient and inefficient aspects)

6. Real-time Monitoring
- Opposite: Batch/Periodic Analysis
  (Analyzing process data at fixed intervals rather than continuously)
- More General: Process Monitoring
  (Any form of process observation, whether real-time or periodic)
