Process enhancement in process mining refers to the use of process mining techniques to improve or optimize a business process. It involves analyzing event data to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, or deviations from the desired process behavior, and then making changes to the process to address these issues. The goal of process enhancement is to improve process performance, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction.

Process enhancement differs from process discovery and conformance checking in the following ways:

1. Process Discovery:
   - Process discovery is the technique used to automatically discover the actual process model from event data. It aims to create a visual representation of the process flow based on the recorded events.
   - The focus of process discovery is on understanding and documenting the current process as it is being executed.
   - Process enhancement, on the other hand, uses the discovered process model as a starting point and aims to identify areas for improvement.

2. Conformance Checking:
   - Conformance checking compares the actual process behavior captured in the event data against a predefined process model. It identifies deviations and compliance issues.
   - The goal of conformance checking is to ensure that the process is being executed correctly and according to the defined rules or guidelines.
   - Process enhancement builds upon the findings of conformance checking by not only identifying deviations but also analyzing the root causes and proposing changes to improve the process.

In summary, while process discovery focuses on understanding the current process, conformance checking focuses on ensuring compliance with the desired process, and process enhancement focuses on improving the process based on the insights gained from both discovery and conformance checking.
