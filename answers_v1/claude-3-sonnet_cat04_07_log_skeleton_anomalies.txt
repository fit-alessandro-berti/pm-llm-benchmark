Based on the provided declarative constraints, I can identify the following potential anomalies in the proposed process model:

1. **Contradictory Constraints**:
   - The `Never Together` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`) contradicts the `Equivalence` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - The `Never Together` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`) contradicts the `Equivalence` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Request Payment`).

2. **Redundant Constraints**:
   - The `Equivalence` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`) is redundant with the `Never Together` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`).
   - The `Equivalence` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Request Payment`) is redundant with the `Never Together` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`).

3. **Potentially Contradictory Activity Occurrences**:
   - The `Activity Occurrences` constraint for `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` allows up to 7 occurrences, but the `Always Before` constraints (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) and (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) may contradict this if the activities `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR` and `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER` occur more than once.

4. **Potentially Redundant Constraints**:
   - The `Always Before` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) might be redundant if the `Directly-Follows Constraints` (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) is enforced, and the `Equivalence` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`) is also enforced.
   - The `Always Before` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) might be redundant if the `Directly-Follows Constraints` (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) is enforced, and the `Never Together` constraint (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`) is enforced.

5. **Potentially Missing Constraints**:
   - There is no constraint explicitly defining the relationship between `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` and `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`.
   - There is no constraint explicitly defining the relationship between `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`.

It's important to note that some of these potential anomalies might be intentional based on the specific requirements of the process model. However, it would be beneficial to review these constraints and ensure that they accurately represent the desired behavior of the process.
