Sure, I'd be happy to help explore the opposite and more general concepts for these Petri net terms.

1. **Source Place** - A place with no incoming arcs, i.e., it has no predecessors.
   - **Opposite Concept**: Sink Place - A place with no outgoing arcs, i.e., it has no successors.
   - **More General Concept**: Place - Any node in a Petri net that can hold tokens, regardless of whether it's a source, sink, or neither.

2. **Immediate Transition** - A transition that fires as soon as its preconditions are met, i.e., it has no inhibitor arcs.
   - **Opposite Concept**: Inhibitor Transition - A transition that can only fire when its inhibitor conditions are not met, i.e., it has inhibitor arcs.
   - **More General Concept**: Transition - Any node in a Petri net that can fire when its preconditions are met, regardless of whether it's immediate, inhibitor, or has other types of arcs.

3. **Live Transition** - A transition that is eventually enabled if the net is unbounded and infinite tokens are available.
   - **Opposite Concept**: Dead Transition - A transition that can never be enabled again once it has fired, due to the net's structure or lack of tokens.
   - **More General Concept**: Transition - Any node in a Petri net that can potentially be enabled and fired, regardless of whether it's live, dead, or has other liveness properties.

4. **Bounded Net** - A net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded by a finite number.
   - **Opposite Concept**: Unbounded Net - A net where the number of tokens in at least one place can grow without bound.
   - **More General Concept**: Net - Any directed graph with places and transitions that can hold and manipulate tokens, regardless of whether it's bounded, unbounded, or has other properties.

5. **Free Choice Net** - A net where every place has at most one output transition.
   - **Opposite Concept**: Net with Choice - A net where at least one place has more than one output transition.
   - **More General Concept**: Net - Any directed graph with places and transitions that can hold and manipulate tokens, regardless of whether it's a free choice net, has choice, or has other structural properties.

Here's a simple illustration of the opposite concepts:

- Source Place (no incoming arcs)  Sink Place (no outgoing arcs)
- Immediate Transition (no inhibitor arcs)  Inhibitor Transition (has inhibitor arcs)
- Live Transition (eventually enabled)  Dead Transition (never enabled again)
- Bounded Net (finite tokens)  Unbounded Net (infinite tokens)
- Free Choice Net (one output transition per place)  Net with Choice (more than one output transition per place)
