Event abstraction is a technique used to simplify complex process models by abstracting away unnecessary details, making them more readable and manageable. Here are some ways to effectively utilize event abstraction to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs:

1. **Identify common patterns**: Look for recurring patterns in the event log, such as similar activities, sub-processes, or conditional logic. Abstract these patterns into reusable components, making it easier to understand and maintain the process model.
2. **Group related events**: Group events that are closely related in terms of their purpose, functionality, or impact. This helps to reduce the complexity of the process model and makes it easier to understand the relationships between events.
3. **Use abstraction levels**: Apply different abstraction levels to different parts of the process model. For example, focus on high-level activities and abstract away low-level details, such as specific tool interactions or database queries.
4. **Apply event aggregation**: Aggregate events that have similar characteristics, such as arrival times, durations, or frequencies. This helps to reduce the noise in the process model and makes it easier to identify patterns and trends.
5. **Use hierarchical modeling**: Organize process models in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level activities encompassing lower-level sub-processes. This allows for easier navigation and understanding of the process model.
6. **Simplify conditional logic**: Simplify conditional logic by using high-level constructs, such as decision tables or decision trees, rather than complex conditional statements.
7. **Use graphical abstraction**: Use graphical techniques, such as swimlane diagrams or phase diagrams, to abstract away unnecessary details and focus on the key aspects of the process model.
8. **Focus on essential processes**: Identify the essential processes and abstract away non-essential activities, such as administrative tasks or technical details.
9. **Apply domain knowledge**: Leverage domain expertise to identify relevant concepts, terminology, and patterns in the process model, making it more understandable and maintainable.
10. **Iterate and refine**: Continuously refine and iterate on the process model, applying event abstraction techniques to simplify and clarify the model.

By applying these techniques, you can effectively utilize event abstraction to:

* Simplify complex process models
* Improve readability and maintainability
* Reduce noise and irrelevant details
* Increase understanding and trust in the process model
* Enhance collaboration and communication among stakeholders
* Support business process analysis, improvement, and optimization

Keep in mind that event abstraction should be applied in a way that balances simplicity with accuracy and completeness. The goal is to simplify the process model without losing essential details or sacrificing accuracy.
