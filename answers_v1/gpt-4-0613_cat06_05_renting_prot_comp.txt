Given the process variants above, here are some notable differences between the 'protected' and 'unprotected' group: 

1. The most frequent process variant for the protected group involves the prospective tenant submitting their application, viewing the property, and being rejected. This variation results in a shorter process. For the unprotected group, the most common variant involves a more thorough screening of the tenant before they are rejected.

2. In the protected group, there seems to be more instances of 'extensive screening' before rejection or contract signing than in the unprotected group. This might indicate that the protected group is potentially subjected to more scrutiny before making a decision.

3. The protected group seems to have more cases where they are rejected right after applying or viewing the properties, with fewer cases of getting into the paperwork and screening steps. This might indicate a quicker rejection process for the protected group compared to the unprotected one.

4. Performance (or processing time) for similar process variants involving contract signings and moving in appears to be slightly higher for the protected group than the counterparts in the unprotected group. 

5. When considering the process variants involving contract signing, moving in, and paying rent, these variants occur less frequently in the protected group than in the unprotected group. This might indicate that the protected group gets fewer renting opportunities than the unprotected group.

6. Finally, the process variants regarding rent missing and eviction is observed only in the protected group which might hint towards some kind of biasness. 

Remember these are pure observations based on the given data. To confirm any kind of unfair treatment, further investigation and proper statistical tests would be required.
