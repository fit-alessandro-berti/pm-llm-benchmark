 The DECLARE declarative process model you've provided includes a set of constraints that define the behavior of the process. However, there are some potential anomalies and conflicts within the constraints that need to be addressed:

1. **Conflict between Existence and Absence Constraints:**
   - The Existence constraint states that certain activities must occur at least once in the process.
   - The Absence constraint states that certain activities should not occur at all.
   - If an activity is subject to both Existence and Absence constraints, this creates a conflict because the process cannot satisfy both constraints simultaneously. For example, if 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' has an Existence constraint but is also listed under Absence, this is a conflict.

2. **Conflict between Exactly 1 and Responded Existence Constraints:**
   - The Exactly 1 constraint indicates that an activity should occur exactly once.
   - The Responded Existence constraint between two activities A and B implies that if A occurs, B must also occur, but it does not specify how many times B must occur.
   - If 'Request Payment' has an Exactly 1 constraint and there is a Responded Existence constraint with 'Payment Handled', then 'Payment Handled' must occur at least once if 'Request Payment' occurs. However, if 'Payment Handled' also has an Exactly 1 constraint, it could lead to a situation where 'Payment Handled' is expected to occur exactly once and more than once due to the Responded Existence constraint, which is a conflict.

3. **Conflict between Alternate Response/Precedence and Co-Existence Constraints:**
   - Alternate Response and Alternate Precedence constraints require that activities A and B must alternate without repetitions.
   - Co-Existence constraint between A and B implies that if A occurs, B must also occur, and vice versa.
   - These constraints could conflict if the process requires A and B to alternate but also requires them to co-exist, which would necessitate repetitions of A and B.

4. **Redundancy in Constraints:**
   - The Alternate Succession constraint already implies both Alternate Response and Alternate Precedence. Therefore, listing all three for the same pair of activities is redundant.
   - Similarly, Succession implies both Response and Precedence, so specifying all three for the same pair of activities is also redundant.

5. **Chain Succession vs. Chain Precedence and Chain Response:**
   - Chain Succession implies both Chain Precedence and Chain Response. If Chain Succession is specified between A and B, specifying Chain Precedence and Chain Response separately for the same pair is redundant.

6. **Initialization and Other Constraints:**
   - The Initialization constraint specifies that the trace must start with a specific activity, which is 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.
   - Other constraints involving 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must be consistent with this Initialization constraint. For example, it would be anomalous to have a Precedence constraint where 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' is preceded by another activity since it is supposed to start the trace.

7. **Non Co-Existence and Co-Existence Conflicts:**
   - If there are Non Co-Existence constraints between activities A and B, but also Co-Existence constraints between the same activities, this is a direct conflict because the process cannot satisfy both constraints.

8. **Non Succession and Succession Conflicts:**
   - Similar to the above point, if there are Non Succession or non Chain succession constraints between activities A and B, but also Succession or Chain Succession constraints, this is a conflict.

To resolve these anomalies, the process model should be reviewed to ensure that:
- No activity is subject to conflicting constraints.
- Constraints are not redundant.
- The process model is internally consistent and can be satisfied by at least one trace of activities.

It's important to validate the process model against the actual process requirements and to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the constraints and their implications.
