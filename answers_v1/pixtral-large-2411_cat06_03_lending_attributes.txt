In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are those that can potentially lead to biased or discriminatory outcomes if used in decision-making processes. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics that are protected by law or ethical guidelines. From the provided list of attributes, the following are typically considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether an individual is a citizen. Citizenship status can be sensitive because it may lead to differential treatment based on national origin or immigration status.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual. Gender is a sensitive attribute because it can lead to discrimination based on sex or gender identity.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German. Language proficiency can be sensitive because it may correlate with national origin or ethnicity, which are protected characteristics.

Other attributes, such as **activity**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp**, are generally not considered sensitive for fairness as they do not relate to protected demographic characteristics. However, it's important to note that even non-sensitive attributes can sometimes lead to indirect discrimination if they are correlated with sensitive attributes.

To ensure fairness, it is crucial to monitor and evaluate the impact of these sensitive attributes on the outcomes of the process. This can involve techniques such as fairness audits, bias mitigation strategies, and the use of fairness-aware algorithms in decision-making processes.
