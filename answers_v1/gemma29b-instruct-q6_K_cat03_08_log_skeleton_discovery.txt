```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),
    'always_before': set(),
    'always_after': set(),
    'never_together': set(),
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Fine': {0, 1},
        'Send Fine': {0, 1},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {0, 1},
        'Add penalty': {0, 1},
        'Payment': {0, 2},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {0, 1},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {0, 1},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {0, 1},
        'Appeal to Judge': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': set()
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **equivalence**: This set will be empty as there are no explicit equivalence constraints mentioned in the provided information.
* **always_before**: This set will be empty as there are no explicit "Always Before" constraints mentioned.
* **always_after**: This set will be empty as there are no explicit "Always After" constraints mentioned.
* **never_together**: This set will be empty as there are no explicit "Never Together" constraints mentioned.
* **activ_freq**: This dictionary defines the allowed number of occurrences for each activity within a case.  For example, 'Create Fine' can occur 0 or 1 time, 'Send Fine' can occur 0 or 1 time, and so on. The values are sets containing the allowed occurrences (0 or 1 in this case).
* **directly_follows**: This set will be empty as there are no explicit "Directly Follows" constraints mentioned.

**Note:**

This is a basic Log Skeleton model based on the provided information.  

You'll need to populate the sets with specific activity pairs based on the actual constraints in your process.
