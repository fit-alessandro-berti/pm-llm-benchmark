The Log Skeleton process model, which is based on a simple workflow architecture, describes a process involving three main activities: Declaration, REJECTION, and Payment. The activities are grouped into phases or cases to represent different stages of the process flow.

1. Declaration: This activity involves submitting a declaration for approval. It typically occurs before any other activity in the case, as indicated by the Always Before constraint. In this model, Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE is bound by an occurrence count of 0-5, depending on the number of activities that precede it (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Payment Handled, etc.).

2. REJECTION: If the declaration is not approved in the first case, there may be a subsequent case for rejection, as indicated by the Always After constraint between Activity Occurrences and Declare REJECTION. The activity Declare REJECTION has an occurrence count of 0-3, depending on the number of activities that precede it (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Payment Handled, etc.).

3. Payment: This case involves processing payment for an approved declaration. If there is no payment in this case, a separate case called Payment Handled can be executed immediately after Declare REJECTION to handle the payment processing. In this model, Payment Handled is bound by an occurrence count of 0-2, depending on the number of activities that precede it (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, etc.).

The process flow can be summarized as follows:

1. Submit Declaration for Approval (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE)
2. If Declaration is Approved, proceed to Payment Handled or other subsequent cases (Payment Handled or Declare REJECTION).
3. If Declaration is Rejected, proceed to REJECTION case (Declare REJECTION) and then to Declare REJECTION again after the approval of another declaration (if needed).
4. If there are no payments in this process, a Payment Handled activity can be executed immediately after the first REJECTION case if required (Payment Handled).

This data structure helps organize the workflow into discrete cases and activities, facilitating the understanding of the entire process flow for approval and payment processing.
