Certainly! The data describes a declarative process involving multiple steps and possible rejections, leading to a final payment handling. Here’s a summary of the typical process flow and the common variants, including the key actors involved (EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, and BUDGET OWNER).

### Key Steps in the Process:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED**: The EMPLOYEE submits a declaration.
2. **Declaration APPROVED**: The ADMINISTRATION approves or rejects the declaration.
3. **Approval from BUDGET OWNER**: Depending on the variant, the ADMINISTRATION might have already approved the proposal and it may be sent for approval by the BUDGET OWNER.
4. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED**: The SUPERVISOR gives the final approval on the declaration.
5. **Request Payment** and **Payment Handled**: After final approval, the payment request is made, and then it is handled.

### Possible Variants:
1. **Direct Path**:
    - **EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION -> SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
    - This is the shortest path where all necessary approvals are done in sequence without requiring additional steps or rejections.

2. **Approval from BUDGET OWNER**:
    - **EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION -> BUDGET OWNER -> SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
    - This variant includes an additional approval step where the BUDGET OWNER reviews and approves the declaration.

3. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
    - **EMPLOYEE -> ADMINISTRATION (reject) -> EMPLOYEE (reject case) -> EMPLOYEE (re-submit) -> ADMINISTRATION -> SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
    - If the declaration is initially rejected, the EMPLOYEE may rectify the issues and resubmit it. This brings it back through the approval process from the ADMINISTRATION after it was initially rejected.

4. **Pre-Approval**:
    - **EMPLOYEE -> PRE_APPROVER -> SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**
    - Sometimes, an additional pre-approval by a PRE_APPROVER is required before the ADMINISTRATION’s involvement.

### Common Patterns:
- **Rejection and Resubmission**: In some scenarios, declarations are rejected back to the EMPLOYEE, who may revise and resubmit them.
- **Route Deviations**: Some declarations require an additional approval from the BUDGET OWNER, adding an extra layer of scrutiny.
- **Payment Handling Stages**: Regardless of the number of approvals, the final stages are always a payment request and subsequent handling, indicating that each declaration results in a financial transaction once validated.

### Important Performance and Frequency:
- **Frequencies**: Some paths are much more common (e.g., direct path between EMPLOYEE and SUPERVISOR) with frequencies like 1392, while others involving multiple rejections happen rarely (e.g., multiple rejections leading to final approval with a frequency of 4).
- **Performance Metrics**: Performance can be affected by multiple rejections or additional approvals, leading to higher performance times (e.g., multiple rejections can take significantly longer, 810187.903 vs. 3502608.250).

### Summary of the Process:
The primary process involves an EMPLOYEE submitting a declaration which progresses through a series of approvals from ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, and potentially BUDGET OWNER. Rejections along the way may require the EMPLOYEE to rework the declaration and resubmit it. Once all approvals are completed, the process concludes with a payment request and subsequent handling. The process includes multiple variations in terms of the steps and the number of rejections which influence the overall performance.
