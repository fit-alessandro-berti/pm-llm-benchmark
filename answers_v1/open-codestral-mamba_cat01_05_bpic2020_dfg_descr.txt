The process described by the data appears to be a workflow for the approval and payment of expenses. Here's a high-level overview:

1. Employees can submit an expense for approval. This is represented by the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" event.

2. The expense can be approved by the employee's supervisor (Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) or by the employee's budget owner (Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER) or by the administration (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION).

3. If the expense is approved by the supervisor, it moves to the next step, which is the request for payment. If it's approved by the budget owner or administration, it goes through an additional approval step before reaching the request for payment.

4. After the request for payment, the payment is handled.

5. If the payment is approved, the process moves to the "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" event, indicating that the expense has been fully approved and the final approval has been given by the supervisor.

6. If the payment is rejected at any step, the employee can submit the expense again for approval.

7. If an employee rejects the expense, the process loops back to the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" event, allowing the employee to resubmit the expense for approval.
