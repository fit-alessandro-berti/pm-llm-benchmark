In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those that could potentially lead to biased or unfair outcomes if they influence the decision-making process. These attributes often relate to demographic characteristics or personal traits that are protected under anti-discrimination laws. Based on the provided attributes, the following are considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. Discrimination based on citizenship status is a sensitive issue, and it is important to ensure that the process does not unfairly disadvantage non-citizens.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual. Gender-based discrimination is a well-known issue, and ensuring fairness in processes regardless of gender is crucial.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German. Language-based discrimination can also be a sensitive issue, and it is important to ensure that the process does not unfairly disadvantage individuals who do not speak German.

These attributes should be carefully considered when analyzing the process for fairness. It is important to check if the outcomes (e.g., loan approval or denial) are independent of these sensitive attributes, indicating that the process is fair and does not discriminate based on these characteristics.

Other attributes such as **activity**, **concept:name**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp** are not typically considered sensitive for fairness, as they do not relate to personal characteristics that are protected under anti-discrimination laws. However, it is still important to ensure that the process is fair and unbiased with respect to these attributes as well.
