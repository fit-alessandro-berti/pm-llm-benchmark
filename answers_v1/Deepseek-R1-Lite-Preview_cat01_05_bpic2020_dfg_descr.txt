The data you've provided describes a complex workflow process, likely related to a declaration and payment system within an organization. The process involves multiple stages, actors, and possible transitions between states. Here's a breakdown of the process:

### **Actors:**
- **Employee**
- **Supervisor**
- **Administration**
- **Budget Owner**
- **Pre-Approver**
- **Missing** (possibly a placeholder for a missing actor or step)
- **Request Payment** (likely an automated or system-driven step)

### **Key Stages:**
1. **Declaration Submission:**
   - The process begins with an **Employee** submitting a declaration.
   - This can lead to various outcomes, such as approval, rejection, or further actions.

2. **Approval Pathways:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** can be:
     - **Approved by ADMINISTRATION**
     - **Approved by BUDGET OWNER**
     - **Approved by PRE_APPROVER**
     - **Rejected by ADMINISTRATION**
     - **Rejected by BUDGET OWNER**
     - **Rejected by PRE_APPROVER**
     - **Rejected by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Rejected by EMPLOYEE** (self-rejection)
     - **Saved by EMPLOYEE** (possibly saved for later submission)

3. **Final Approval:**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION** can be:
     - **Final Approved by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Rejected by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Rejected by BUDGET OWNER**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER** can be:
     - **Final Approved by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Rejected by SUPERVISOR**
   - **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER** can be:
     - **Final Approved by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Rejected by SUPERVISOR**

4. **Payment Handling:**
   - Once a declaration is **Final Approved by SUPERVISOR**, it can lead to:
     - **Request Payment**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** (an unusual transition, possibly indicating a missing step or error)
   - **Request Payment** can lead to:
     - **Payment Handled**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING**

5. **Rejection and Resubmission:**
   - Rejections can lead to resubmission or further actions:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION** can lead to:
       - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
       - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER** can lead to:
       - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
       - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER** can lead to:
       - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
       - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR** can lead to:
       - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
       - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** can lead to:
       - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - There are some less common transitions, such as:
     - **Declaration REJECTED by MISSING** leading to **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
     - **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**, **PRE_APPROVER**, or **ADMINISTRATION** leading to various outcomes
     - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE** leading directly to **Request Payment**

### **Performance Metrics:**
- **Frequency:** Indicates how often a particular transition occurs.
- **Performance:** Likely represents some form of time (e.g., seconds, milliseconds) or cost associated with the transition.

### **Summary:**
The process is a multi-stage approval workflow where declarations are submitted by employees and undergo a series of approvals or rejections by various stakeholders (e.g., Administration, Budget Owner, Pre-Approver, Supervisor). The goal is to eventually reach a **Final Approval** by the Supervisor, which leads to **Payment Handling**. However, there are multiple points of rejection, which can lead to resubmission or further actions. The workflow includes feedback loops, allowing rejected declarations to be resubmitted or corrected before progressing further.

### **Potential Areas for Improvement:**
- **Bottlenecks:** Identify stages with high performance metrics or low frequencies that may be causing delays.
- **Rejection Paths:** Analyze the frequency and performance of rejection paths to understand common points of failure or areas where additional training or process improvements may be needed.
- **Missing Steps:** Investigate transitions involving "MISSING" to determine if there are gaps in the process that need to be addressed.

This workflow is typical in environments where financial declarations or expenses need to be strictly controlled and approved by multiple parties before payment can be made.
