There are several potential differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group that could be considered unfair. Some of the main differences include:

  1. The protected group may be subjected to a more extensive screening process than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group may be required to undergo an "Extensive Screening" step that the unprotected group does not have to go through.
  2. The protected group may be more likely to be rejected for a viewing appointment or to have their application for a viewing appointment rejected. This could be seen in the fact that the "Reject Prospective Tenant" step occurs more frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group.
  3. The protected group may be more likely to have their application for a viewing appointment rejected without ever being given the opportunity to view the property. This could be seen in the fact that the "Reject Prospective Tenant" step occurs more frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group, and the "View The Property" step occurs less frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group.
  4. The protected group may be more likely to have their application for a viewing appointment rejected without ever being given the opportunity to hand in paperwork or have their paperwork checked. This could be seen in the fact that the "Reject Prospective Tenant" step occurs more frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group, and the "Hand In The Paperwork" and "Check Paperwork" steps occur less frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group.
  5. The protected group may be more likely to have their application for a viewing appointment rejected without ever being given the opportunity to sign a contract or move in. This could be seen in the fact that the "Reject Prospective Tenant" step occurs more frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group, and the "Sign Contract" and "Move In" steps occur less frequently for the protected group than for the unprotected group.
