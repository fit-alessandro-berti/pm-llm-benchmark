The provided directly follows graph gives us a detailed insight into how various activities and transitions occur between different entities involved in an event-driven logistics or supply chain management system. Here's a breakdown of the overall process described by your data:

### Core Process

1. **Handling Units (e.g., Goods)**:
   - The first activity is "Collect Goods," followed by "Load Truck."
     - This indicates that goods are collected and then loaded onto trucks.
   
2. **Trucks**:
   - Trucks experience a cycle of being loaded, driving to terminals, and sometimes returning back for another load.
     - After loading goods ("Load Truck"), trucks may drive to the terminal ("Drive to Terminal") before potentially looping back to be reloaded.

3. **Containers**:
   - The handling of containers involves several stages including picking up empty ones, loading them onto vehicles/trucks, and driving these loaded containers to terminals.
     - Containers go through a process where they are picked up from an initial location ("Pick Up Empty Container"), moved into trucks or other vehicles ("Load Truck"), driven to the terminal ("Drive to Terminal"), weighed ("Weigh"), placed in stock ("Place in Stock"), and then brought back to the loading bay if necessary.
   
4. **Vehicles**:
   - The process for vehicles involves booking them, loading containers onto them, and having them depart on their routes.
     - Vehicles may be booked ("Book Vehicles") before being loaded with containers or rescheduled if needed ("Reschedule Container").

5. **Forklifts**:
   - Forklift activities mostly revolve around bringing containers to the loading bay for weighing or placing in stock.
   
6. **Customer Orders and Transport Documents**:
   - Customer orders are registered, leading to creating transport documents that book vehicles and order empty containers as necessary.
     - The document process also involves rescheduling if there's a need based on the status of container movement.

### Summary

- **Initial Collection & Loading**: Goods are collected ("Collect Goods") and loaded onto trucks or other modes of transportation ("Load Truck").
  
- **Transportation to Terminals**: Loaded units then typically move towards terminals for further processing ("Drive to Terminal").

- **Handling Containers**: Empty containers are picked up, moved around based on the needs for loading, weighing, stock placement, and rescheduling if necessary.

- **Vehicle Booking & Dispatching**: Vehicles (trucks) are booked according to transport documents created from customer orders. These vehicles then load containers and depart with them.
  
- **Cycles and Rescheduling**: There is an indication of cycles where trucks may loop back for additional loads or be involved in rescheduled activities if there's a delay or change in the schedule.

This sequence highlights how different entities interact within this logistics process, from initial goods collection to final customer order fulfillment, through various stages including loading/unloading, transportation, storage, and reassignment of resources as needed.
