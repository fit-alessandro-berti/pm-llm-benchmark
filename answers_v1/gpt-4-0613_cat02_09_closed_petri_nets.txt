1. Source Place
   - Opposite Concept: Sink Place. While a source place in a Petri net is an initial state with no incoming arcs, a sink place is a final state with no outgoing arcs. It represents the end of a process.
   - More General Concept: Place. In Petri nets, a place is a passive component representing a condition or situation during a process. It can be specialized into different types such as source place or sink place depending on the role it plays in the Petri net.

2. Immediate Transition
   - Opposite Concept: Time-Delayed Transition. In contrast to immediate transitions which fire instantly whenever enabled, Time-Delayed transitions have a delay before they fire after becoming enabled.
   - More General Concept: Transition. Transition is a basic concept in Petri nets representing an event or an action that causes the system to change state. Immediate transition and time-delayed transition are two types of transitions based on their firing time characteristics.

3. Live Transition
   - Opposite Concept: Dead Transition. While a live transition can always eventually be fired, regardless of the system's state, a dead transition is one that can never be fired.
   - More General Concept: Transition Liveness. It is a property of net transitions involving their potential to be enabled or fired. This concept covers various conditions such as liveness, deadliness, safeness, and others.

4. Bounded Net
   - Opposite Concept: Unbounded Net. While a bounded net has a limit on the number of tokens that can be held in a place, an unbounded net doesn't have such limit.
   - More General Concept: Net Boundedness. It is a property of Petri nets indicating the maximum number of tokens any place in the net can hold. It includes bounded and unbounded nets as two different conditions.

5. Free Choice Net
   - Opposite Concept: Arbitrary Net. If a free-choice net allows for any enabled transition to fire, an arbitrary net involves complex enabling and firing rules and dependencies.
   - More General Concept: Net Structure. It is a basic concept in Petri nets that concerns the architecture and design of a net and includes various types of nets such as free choice nets, state machines, marked graphs, etc.
