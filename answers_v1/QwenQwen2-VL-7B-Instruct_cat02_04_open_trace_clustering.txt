Trace clustering is a technique used in process mining to group similar process instances together based on their behavior. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous process data, where process instances may have different characteristics or be generated by different sources. The main idea behind trace clustering is to identify and group process instances that exhibit similar behavior, regardless of their specific details. This can help to identify patterns and anomalies in the data, and can be used to improve process understanding and analysis. The implications of trace clustering for dealing with heterogeneous process data are significant, as it allows for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of the data. This can lead to better decision-making and improved process performance, as well as a deeper understanding of the underlying processes and their underlying causes.
