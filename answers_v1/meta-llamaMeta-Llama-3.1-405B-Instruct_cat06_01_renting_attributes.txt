What a delightfully detailed process log!

After reviewing the attributes, I've identified the following as sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. This could be a sensitive attribute, as it may lead to biases in the process, particularly if certain groups are more likely to be rejected or have their applications delayed.
2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates the individual's gender. As with citizenship, this attribute could lead to biases in the process, especially if certain genders are more likely to be rejected or face delays.
3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German or not. While language proficiency might be relevant for certain aspects of the process, it could also lead to biases against non-German speakers.
4. **case:married**: This attribute indicates whether the individual is married or not. Marital status could be a sensitive attribute, as it may influence the application process or lead to biases in the evaluation of applicants.

These attributes are considered sensitive because they may lead to biases or discriminatory practices in the process, potentially affecting the fairness of the outcomes. It's essential to consider these attributes when analyzing the process for fairness and to ensure that they do not unjustly influence the decisions made.

In contrast, attributes like **concept:name**, **resource**, **start_timestamp**, **time**, and **time:timestamp** are more related to the process itself and do not contain sensitive information about the individuals involved.

Please note that the specific sensitive attributes may vary depending on the context and the laws of the country or region where the process is taking place.
