Based on the attributes shown in the event log, there are several attributes that are typically considered sensitive from a fairness perspective:

1. case:gender (True/False values) - Gender is a protected characteristic and using it in decision-making processes could lead to discrimination.

2. case:citizen (True/False values) - Citizenship status is a sensitive attribute as it relates to national origin and could lead to unfair treatment of non-citizens.

3. case:religious (True/False values) - Religious affiliation is a protected characteristic, and using it in hiring decisions could result in religious discrimination.

4. case:german speaking (True/False values) - While language requirements might be job-related in some cases, language ability can be proxy for national origin or ethnicity, making it potentially sensitive from a fairness perspective.

These attributes are considered sensitive because:
- They are personal characteristics that are often protected by anti-discrimination laws
- Using them in decision-making processes could lead to unfair treatment or discrimination
- They are generally unrelated to a person's ability to perform job duties (unless specifically required for the position)

To ensure fairness in the hiring process, these attributes should be carefully monitored to prevent any discriminatory patterns in the recruitment workflow, particularly at decision points like "Application Rejected" or "Make Job Offer."
