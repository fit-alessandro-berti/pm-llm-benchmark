6. **Are there specific approval paths that expedite the final approval and subsequent payment processing?**
   - Confidence: 0.90

7. **What is the completion rate for declarations that are initially saved by employees but not immediately submitted?**
   - Confidence: 0.85

8. **Is there a correlation between the number of approval stages and the overall performance time for each process variant?**
   - Confidence: 0.91

9. **How often do declarations experience multiple cycles of rejection and resubmission before final approval is achieved?**
   - Confidence: 0.89

10. **What role do PRE_APPROVERs play in both approving and rejecting declarations, and what impact does this have on performance time?**
    - Confidence: 0.87

11. **Is there a significant performance difference between declarations that involve the budget owner and those that do not?**

    - Confidence: 0.88

14. **What impact does the number of resubmission cycles have on the overall process performance and efficiency?**
    - Confidence: 0.90

15. **Are there specific patterns in declaration submissions that are more prone to rejection by specific approvers?**
    - Confidence: 0.89

16. **How does performance change when declarations bypass some approval steps, such as direct submission to the SUPERVISOR?**
    - Confidence: 0.92

17. **What process improvements could be proposed to reduce the high performance metric in the final rejected cases?**
    - Confidence: 0.93

18. **Do declarations that are rejected by multiple approvers face significantly different performance outcomes compared to others?**
    - Confidence: 0.88

19. **What insights can be derived from examining the performance of declarations that have been both rejected and later approved?**
