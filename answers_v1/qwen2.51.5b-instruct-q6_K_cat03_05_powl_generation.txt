Certainly! Below is the Python code that implements a partially ordered workflow (POWL) model for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using PM4Py. This example demonstrates how to structure and connect different activities in a process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition

# Define the activities as transitions with label 'M'
A = Transition(label="purchase")
B = Transition(label="invoice")
C = Transition(label="payment")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Create a loop node (exclusive choice between A and B)
loop_A_B = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

# Create an XOR operation with C as one of the alternatives
xor_C_skip = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[C, skip])

# Define a partial order over these POWL models
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_A_B, xor_C_skip])
root.order.add_edge(loop_A_B, xor_C_skip)

# Print the resulting partial order to verify it
pm4py.view_powl(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Activities as Transitions**: The activities "purchase", "invoice", and "payment" are defined as transitions labeled 'M'.
2. **Loop Node (Exclusive Choice)**: A loop node is created, which specifies that either activity `A` or `B` should be executed.
3. **XOR Operation**: An XOR operation between a specific alternative (here, `C`) and a silent transition (`skip`) is defined to represent the choice of one or another action.
4. **Partial Order**: A partial order is created with two nodes: the loop node and the XOR node. The edges define that after completing the loop, you then execute either `A`, `B`, `C`, or an optional silent transition.

This code sets up a basic structure for a POWL model representing a P2P process where the sequence of activities can be chosen in specific ways within a loop, and there's an alternative choice outside the loop. You can further extend this model by adding more details such as start nodes, end nodes, or additional operators like parallel composition.
