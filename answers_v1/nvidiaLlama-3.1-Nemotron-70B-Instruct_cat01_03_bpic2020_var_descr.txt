Based on the provided process variants, I'll attempt to describe the underlying process, highlighting its key elements, decision points, and potential complexities.

**Process Name:** Employee Declaration and Payment Processing

**Primary Objective:** To process employee-submitted declarations, obtain necessary approvals, and facilitate payment handling upon successful approval.

**Key Process Steps:**

1. **Declaration Submission**:
	* **Actor:** Employee
	* **Action:** Submits a declaration
	* **Possible Outcomes:**
		+ Submission successful ( Proceeds to step 2)
		+ Saved for later (Variant: "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE", frequency: 134, performance: 0.000) *possibly indicating a draft or incomplete submission*
2. **Administrative Review**:
	* **Actor:** Administration
	* **Action:** Reviews the submitted declaration
	* **Possible Outcomes:**
		+ **Approved**: Proceeds to step 3 or 4 (depending on the variant)
		+ **Rejected**: Returns to the employee (step 5)
3. **Additional Approvals (if required)**:
	* **Actors (in various variants):** 
		- Budget Owner
		- Pre-Approver
	* **Action:** Provides an additional approval layer
	* **Possible Outcomes:**
		+ **Approved**: Proceeds to step 4 or directly to payment handling (depending on the variant)
		+ **Rejected**: Returns to the employee (step 5) or potentially loops within the approval stages
4. **Supervisory Final Approval**:
	* **Actor:** Supervisor
	* **Action:** Grants final approval
	* **Possible Outcomes:**
		+ **Approved**: Proceeds to payment handling
		+ **Rejected**: Returns to the employee (step 5)
5. **Employee Re-submission/Resolution (after rejection)**:
	* **Actor:** Employee
	* **Action:** Addresses rejection reasons, potentially resubmits the declaration
	* **Possible Outcomes:**
		+ Re-submission successful, re-enters the process at step 2 or later, depending on the prior rejection point
		+ Multiple rejections may lead to termination of the process (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" with no further actions)

**Payment Handling**:
	* **Trigger:** Successful final approval
	* **Actor(s):** Assume internal/external financial departments or automated systems
	* **Action:** Processes the payment
	* **Outcome:** Payment Handled (final process state in successful variants)

**Insights and Complexities:**

- **Variants Indicate Flexibility and Complexity**: The numerous variants suggest a process with multiple approval paths, potentially based on declaration types, employee roles, or financial thresholds.
- **Rejection and Re-submission Loops**: Many variants involve rejection and re-submission, indicating a non-linear process flow that can significantly extend the overall process duration.
- **Performance (Duration) Variability**: The significant range in performance (duration) across variants (from 0.000 to over 16 million) highlights the impact of approval paths and potential bottlenecks on process efficiency.
- **Missing Approver/root Cause in Some Variants**: The presence of "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" suggests either system flags for missing approvers or root causes not explicitly listed, possibly indicating areas for process improvement.
- **Termination States**: Variants without a clear resolution or payment handling (e.g., multiple rejections ending in employee rejection) may indicate process termination points that could benefit from clearer communication to stakeholders.

**Recommendations for Further Analysis:**

1. **Map the Process Visually**: Utilize BPMN or a similar notation to visually map the process, highlighting decision points and all identified actors.
2. **Analyze Rejection Reasons and Rates**: Investigate the most common reasons for rejections and their impact on the overall process efficiency.
3. **Evaluate the Need for Process Simplification**: Assess whether reducing the number of approval variants or introducing more streamlined approval paths could enhance process speed without compromising control.
4. **Investigate "Missing" Approver/Root Cause**: Clarify the reason behind the "MISSING" flag to address potential operational gaps.
