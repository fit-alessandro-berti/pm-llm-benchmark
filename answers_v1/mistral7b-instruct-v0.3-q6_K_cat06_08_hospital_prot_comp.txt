 From the provided data, it appears that there are several differences between the treatment processes of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups:

1. **Number of Process Variants**: The unprotected group has fewer unique process variants compared to the protected group. This suggests that there may be less variation in the treatment paths for the unprotected group, or that they follow a more standardized treatment process.

2. **Frequency of Thorough Examinations**: In the unprotected group, more processes include a Thorough Examination as part of the treatment path compared to the protected group. This could indicate a more intensive diagnostic process for the unprotected group.

3. **Frequency of Expert Examinations**: The unprotected group seems to have fewer processes involving Expert Examinations, which could suggest that these examinations are more frequently used in the treatment of the protected group.

4. **Treatment Unsuccessfullness**: There are more instances of unsuccessful treatments and subsequent re-treatments in the unprotected group. This could indicate a higher rate of treatment failure or complications for the unprotected group.

5. **Execution Time**: The execution times for both groups vary widely, but on average, the processes for the protected group seem to have slightly shorter execution times than those for the unprotected group. However, this difference is not significant and could be influenced by various factors other than the protection status.

6. **Discharge Without Treatment**: There are instances where members of both groups were discharged without undergoing treatment, but these cases are more frequent in the protected group. This might suggest that patients in the protected group are being discharged earlier for reasons unrelated to their condition, or it could be an indication of a more lenient approach to treatment.

To confirm these observations and identify potential unfair differences, further analysis would be needed, including statistical testing and possibly a review of medical records to understand the reasons behind the observed differences.
