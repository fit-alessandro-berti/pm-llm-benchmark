To determine the root causes of performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the data and identify the factors that may be contributing to the slower performance. Here are some potential causes that could be contributing to the performance issues:

  1. High frequency of rejections: Rejection rates of 20-40% are relatively high and could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to the complexity of the process, unclear criteria for approval, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

  2. Multiple approvals required: Processes that require multiple approvals (e.g., 3-4 approvals) could be taking longer to complete. This could be due to the time it takes to gather all the necessary information and make decisions, or the time it takes for each approval to be completed.

  3. High number of rejections in the final approval stage: Rejection rates of 40-50% in the final approval stage could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to unclear criteria for approval, lack of communication between the parties involved, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

  4. High number of rejections after payment: Rejection rates of 5-10% after payment could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to unclear criteria for approval, lack of communication between the parties involved, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

  5. High number of rejections due to missing information: Rejection rates of 10-15% due to missing information could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to unclear criteria for approval, lack of communication between the parties involved, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

  6. High number of rejections due to insufficient information: Rejection rates of 5-10% due to insufficient information could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to unclear criteria for approval, lack of communication between the parties involved, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

  7. High number of rejections due to errors: Rejection rates of 5-10% due to errors could be causing delays in the process. This could be due to unclear criteria for approval, lack of communication between the parties involved, or insufficient training of the employees involved.

To address these potential causes, it may be useful to conduct a root cause analysis to identify the specific factors that are contributing to the performance issues. This could involve reviewing the process flow, identifying any bottlenecks, and understanding the communication and collaboration between the parties involved. Additionally, it may be useful to gather feedback from the employees involved and make any necessary changes to the process to improve its performance.
