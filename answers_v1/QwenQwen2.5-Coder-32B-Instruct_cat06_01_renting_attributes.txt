Assessing which attributes are sensitive for fairness depends on the context and the specific goals and regulations relevant to the process described. However, in general, in a process like renting an apartment, attributes that could be considered sensitive for fairness are those that might inadvertently lead to discrimination based on protected characteristics under equal opportunity laws. Here are some considerations:

1. **case:citizen:** Depending on the jurisdiction, citizenship status might be a sensitive attribute if there are regulations against discrimination based on this factor. In some places, it is illegal to discriminate based on citizenship status, especially if it affects the ability to rent an apartment.

2. **case:gender:** Gender is generally considered a sensitive attribute. Discrimination based on gender is prohibited in many countries, and it is crucial to ensure that the process does not unfavorably treat any gender over another.

3. **case:german speaking:** Language spoken, especially if related to the country's official language, might be considered sensitive if it could result in unfair treatment. However, language proficiency might be more relevant if it affects the interaction quality, but it should not be a deciding factor for renting an apartment.

4. **case:married:** Marital status is often sensitive. While some countries do not strictly regulate discrimination based on marital status, it is generally considered to be in the same category of personal attributes that should not influence the decision-making process in renting an apartment.

From a fairness perspective, **gender** and **citizenship** status are typically regarded as the most sensitive attributes in many contexts. They are protected characteristics under many anti-discrimination laws, and it's essential to ensure that the process treats all candidates equally regardless of these attributes. 

However, it's also important to consider other contextual factors, such as the specific policies of the company, the nature of the process (e.g., whether it's an automated system or manual decision-making), and local laws and regulations. Fully ascertaining the fairness of the process might require conducting a more detailed analysis, including tests for bias and other evaluation metrics.
