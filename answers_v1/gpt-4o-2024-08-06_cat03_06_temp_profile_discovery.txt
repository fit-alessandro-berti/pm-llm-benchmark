To generate a temporal profile for the given process, we need to analyze the provided process variants and their performances (times taken in milliseconds to execute). The goal is to derive the average and standard deviation of the times between pairs of activities that eventually follow one another in at least one trace (process variant). 

First, we must extract all the pairs of activities from each trace and calculate the time between these activities. Using this data, we can then compute the average and standard deviation for each relevant pair.

Here's a general breakdown of how to approach this task:

1. **Extract Activity Pairs**
   Extract all possible pairs `(i, j)` of activities such that activity `i` comes before activity `j` in a trace.

2. **Compute Intermediate Times**
   Use the performance metric (time in milliseconds for each process variant) to estimate time distribution across all pairs.

3. **Calculate Averages and Standard Deviations**
   For each extracted pair across all traces, calculate the average time and the standard deviation.

4. **Create Temporal Profile**
   Build a dictionary where keys are pairs of activities and values are tuples representing the average and standard deviation of times between those activities.

To provide a simplified example of how this might be done in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np

# Sample data input
process_variants = [
    # Example format of entries (trace, frequency, performance): 
    # (["Create Fine", "Send Fine", ...], 56482, 59591524.946)
    (["Create Fine", "Send Fine", "Insert Fine Notification", "Add penalty", "Send for Credit Collection"], 56482, 59591524.946),
    # Add all other traces similarly
]

# Dictionary to store results as (total_time, count) for each activity pair
activity_pairs = defaultdict(lambda: (0, 0))

for trace, frequency, performance in process_variants:
    num_activities = len(trace)
    time_per_activity = performance / (num_activities - 1)  # Distributing time among transitions
    for i in range(num_activities - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_activities):
            pair = (trace[i], trace[j])
            total_time, count = activity_pairs[pair]
            activity_pairs[pair] = (total_time + time_per_activity * frequency, count + frequency)

# Calculate average times
averages = {pair: total_time / count for pair, (total_time, count) in activity_pairs.items()}

# Calculate standard deviations
activity_variances = defaultdict(list)
for trace, frequency, performance in process_variants:
    num_activities = len(trace)
    time_per_activity = performance / (num_activities - 1)
    for i in range(num_activities - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_activities):
            pair = (trace[i], trace[j])
            # Collect deviation squared from the average
            avg_time = averages[pair]
            activity_variances[pair].append(((time_per_activity - avg_time) ** 2) * frequency)

stdevs = {pair: np.sqrt(sum(variance) / activity_pairs[pair][1]) for pair, variance in activity_variances.items()}

# Building the temporal profile dictionary
temporal_profile = {pair: (averages[pair], stdevs[pair]) for pair in averages}

print(temporal_profile)
```

Note: This code assumes an equal time distribution between activities in a trace, which might not be accurate in a real scenario where different activities might take different amounts of time. Furthermore, the `frequency` and total `performance` are used to weigh the impact of each trace variant, assuming they are averaged across different occurrences.

This is a guideline to implementing the solution, as real implementation might require more detailed understanding of how the performance values are distributed across activities. You can refine the distribution logic based on more specific information about how the performance time should be interpreted.
