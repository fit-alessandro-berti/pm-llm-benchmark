**7.5**

The answer is generally insightful and identifies significant key differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, including:

1. **Loan Denial Frequencies**: The answer correctly points out that there is a higher likelihood of loan denials for the protected group.
  
2. **Additional Steps for Protected Group**: The answer also identifies that the protected group experiences more steps in the loan approval process, which could contribute to processing delays.

However, the score is not higher because:

- The answer could have gone deeper into exploring specific numerical differences in loan denial frequencies or the relative performance (execution time) of certain process variants to support the claims about biases and delays. For example, more concrete differences between execution times for similar tasks in both groups could have been highlighted.
  
- The justification for "systemic bias or discrimination" could have been linked more clearly with data-driven evidence rather than just inferred based on trends.
   
In sum, while the response captures the core unfair treatment issues and highlights potential biases, more depth and specificity using the provided data would have strengthened the analysis.
