**9.0**

The answer almost fully captures the tasks present in the BPMN process model. It correctly lists the majority of the tasks, but it misses one task, **"reject request"**, which is also clearly defined in the model. 

To achieve a full score of 10.0, the missing task should be added. 

Nevertheless, the answer is clear, structured correctly, and almost complete, hence earning a score of 9.0.
