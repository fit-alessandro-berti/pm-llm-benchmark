9.0

The provided answer is very comprehensive and clearly identifies several key differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups in the rental application process. The use of specific data points, such as frequencies and performance times, strengthens the analysis by backing up claims with evidence. The implications drawn from the data are logical and aligned with the patterns showcased in the process variants. The structure is also clear, providing detailed comparisons of critical stages in the process such as early rejection, progression to paperwork, extensive screening, and outcomes like signing contracts and tenancy retention.

Some suggestions for improvement:
1. The comparison could simplify the information a bit more in certain sections, as the sheer detail in some places makes the points less digestible. 
2. While the analysis of eviction procedures is mentioned, the interpretation could be expanded slightly to consider the missing details further.
   
These are minor issues though, overall, the answer is well-rounded and demonstrates strong domain knowledge. Hence, a grade of 9.0 is given.
