**9.5**

The answer correctly identifies **all the tasks** present in the BPMN 2.0 XML with their corresponding IDs. The response is well-structured and provides a clear list of the tasks. However, one tiny improvement could be to mention that there are *no missing tasks*. While this may be assumed, being explicit would make the response even more comprehensive at an instructional level.

Aside from that, the thorough explanation of identifying “specific activities that are part of the workflow described by this BPMN process model” is accurate and adds clarity.

Very well done overall!
