The answer provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the process described in the data with clear and structured insight into key actors, states, and the overall process flow. It correctly identifies the main stages, emphasizes rejection-resubmission cycles, and differentiates the simpler and more frequent workflows from more complex or edge cases. The inclusion of insights such as "saved but not submitted" cases and post-final-approval rejections ("REJECTED by MISSING") adds value.

However, there could be minor improvements. For example:
- The performance metric could have been better contextualized (e.g., what the number represents and why certain process variants have longer durations).
- A more explicit discussion of the relationship between frequency and performance might be beneficial, tying the observed inefficiencies or bottlenecks directly to how they impact the process's duration.

Other than that, the answer is highly accurate, detailed, and comprehensive.
