3.0

The score is 3.0 because the answer identifies relevant sensitive attributes, but it contains several inaccuracies and ambiguities. 

1. Correct identification: Attributes like "case:citizen," "case:gender," and "case:german speaking" are indeed sensitive to fairness, as they relate to demographic characteristics that can be prone to bias.

2. Incorrect explanation of "time" attribute: While temporal information could play a role, the explanation provided ("date, hour, and minute of each event might be biased") lacks justification and is generally misplaced.

3. Inappropriate consideration of "resource" attribute: The classification of resource attributes as "sensitive" requires more context, and simply stating "bias towards certain resources" is vague. Additionally, attributing bias without explaining the mechanism (such as workload distribution across loan officers) doesn't follow from the direct-follows graph or data provided.

Some aspects are valid, but the overall argumentation and explanation are weak or incomplete, resulting in a lower score.
