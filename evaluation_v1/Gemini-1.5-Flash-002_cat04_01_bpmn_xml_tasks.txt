The answer correctly lists most of the tasks in the process model. However, it misses one task: "examine thoroughly," which can be found in the XML (`idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2`). Therefore, the list should also include this one to be fully complete. Other than that, the structure is clear, and the task names are properly referenced.
