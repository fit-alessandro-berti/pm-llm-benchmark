Process Explanation – From “a customer clicks send” to the moment the customer receives a definite confirmation.

1. Start Event – Business trigger  
   Some channel (web form, e-mail, EDI,…) creates a new customer request inside the order-management system.

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   Purpose: Make the request official.  
   Activities typically include  
   - logging the instance;  
   - enriching it with default data (customer master data, delivery methods, etc.);  
   - calculating an internal SLA timestamp.

3. Gateway 1 – XOR “Check Request Type”  
   Purpose: classify the request; the outcome decides which template to use later in the process.  
   Business meaning: a simple data-based decision. If the “customisation-flag” has value “standard”  upper path; otherwise  lower path. Only one of the two branches can be taken.

--- Standard Path ---
4. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   Purpose: verify that the order content itself is compliant with the standard catalogue rules (price lists valid, quantities within limits, mandatory attributes filled, etc.).  
   After validation the order is considered “technically doable”, but we still have to worry about money and stock.

5. Parallel Gateway 2 (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   Purpose: from this point onward two independent checks must BOTH finish before anyone calculates a delivery promise.  
   No business decision is made here – it is purely used to model concurrency.

   5a. Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
        Risk management step: does the customer have sufficient credit limit / payment history.

   5b. Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
        Supply-chain step: is the requested quantity on hand (or obtainable within lead-time) in the chosen warehouse.

   5 (continued) – AND Join – waits until C1 and C2 are both returned.

6. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   Purpose: produce a legally binding promise (date window + carrier + incoterms) based on the results of C1 and C2.

--- Custom Path ---
4 alt. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   Purpose: determine if we are *able* to manufacture the custom specification (tooling availability, cost, regulatory constraints, etc.). This step may involve engineering, procurement and legal teams.

5 alt. Gateway 3 – XOR “Is Customisation Feasible?”  
   - “Yes”: go to E1 and keep working with the customer.  
   - “No”: create an automated rejection letter (E2) and terminate the flow with an End Event.

6 alt. Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
   If we decide we *can* build it, we now assemble price, timeline and terms into a formal quotation and send it to the customer for approval. (Note: this step happens *inside* this process – the sales quotation is not an external pool.)

--- Convergence after Standard vs. Custom ---  
Above the two branches we had an XOR split; therefore only the messages/objects produced by the *chosen* branch live in the token that continues.  
After the Standard path finishes task D, and the Custom path finishes task E1, the two flow-lines meet (“implicit AND join”) and the process continues again as a single token.

7. Gateway 4 – XOR “Is Approval Needed?”  
   Purpose: apply release rules from the management policy matrix.  
   Typical decision variables:  
   - order line total value > 50 000 €  
   - custom variant being offered for the first time  
   - credit check flagged “amber”  
   - customer on probation list  
   If any rule flags true  “Approval needed”  Task F.  
   If none  skip straight to Task G.

--- If approval is required ---  
8. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   A responsible manager receives a task in his/her work list, evaluates according to release guidelines and signs off (digitally or otherwise).

9. Gateway 5 – XOR “Is Approval Granted?”  
   - “Yes” – the token proceeds to Task G.  
   - “No” – the path drops into **Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions”**, whose purpose is to *rectify* the proposal rather than simply reject the customer. The task produces one of two data artefacts:

        – a new revised quotation (if we were on the custom branch); therefore we loop back to E1;  
        – a new delivery-date calculation (if we were on the standard branch); loop back to D.

   This allows the sales rep/engineering team to tweak segmentation, change delivery
