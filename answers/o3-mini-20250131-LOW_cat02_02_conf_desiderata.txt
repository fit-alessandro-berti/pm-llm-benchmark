Below is an analysis of each case based on the provided normative rules and desiderata:


1. Normative Rules Violations  


• Case 1:  
– This case follows the strict prescribed sequence:  
Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
– No violations observed.

• Case 2:  
– Normative violation 1: The Risk Assessment occurs before the Credit Check. Specifically, after the application is received, Risk Assessment is performed at 08:20, and the Credit Check is later performed at 09:00.  
– Normative violation 2: After a Loan Decision (in this case, “Rejected”), Finalize Documentation is performed. According to the rules, if the loan is rejected, documentation must not be finalized.  
– As a result, Case 2 clearly breaks the required sequence and decision logic.

• Case 3:  
– All activities occur in the correct order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
– There are no normative sequence or ordering violations.


2. Desiderata Deviations (Suboptimal Behavior)  


• Case 1:  
– All timing and optional recommendations appear to be met. The Credit Check (09:30) follows closely after Application Received (09:00), and Inform Applicant (13:00) and Finalize Documentation (13:30) occur promptly.  
– There is no mention of a Follow-up Call; however, since the Follow-up Call is recommended but not required, its absence is not a violation.

• Case 2:  
– Although there is no specific timing information about the desired time window for Credit Check or Inform Applicant beyond the normative time stamps, the primary issues are normative and not merely timerelated.  
– Additionally, there is no Follow-up Call, but this is a desiderata (recommended) issue rather than a normative one.

• Case 3:  
– Desideratum deviation 1: The Credit Check occurs on January 14 at 10:00 while the Application was received on January 12 at 09:00. This exceeds the preferred 24hour window highlighted in the desiderata.  
– Desideratum deviation 2: The Inform Applicant activity is performed on January 16 at 15:00 while the Loan Decision was made on January 14 at 12:00. This delay goes beyond the recommended 48hour window.  
– Optional recommendation: There was no Follow-up Call before the case was closed. Although including a Follow-up Call is encouraged, its absence is considered suboptimal but not a strict violation.


3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors  


• For Case 2:  
– One possible explanation for performing the Risk Assessment before the Credit Check might be an operational or logging error. In practice, the team might have initiated risk analysis in parallel or misrecorded the events, but according to the prescribed process, this ordering is not permitted.  
– The presence of Finalize Documentation after a rejection could be an accidental application of a common procedure regardless of outcome; however, given the strict rules, it indicates a significant process breakdown that must be addressed.

• For Case 3:  
– The delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant activities may be due to workload constraints, resource limitations, or external dependencies (e.g., waiting for thirdparty credit score reports). These delays are not critical rule breaks but do indicate areas for process improvement in terms of speed and customer communication.  
– The absence of a Follow-up Call might be justified if the process owner believes that other communications (like Inform Applicant) sufficiently cover the necessary client interaction. However, adding the Follow-up Call could enhance clarity and customer satisfaction.


Summary  


1. Normative Violations:
– Case 2 violates two key normative rules: the order of Risk Assessment and Credit Check, and inappropriately finalizing documentation after a rejected loan.

2. Desiderata Deviations:
– Case 3 does not meet the recommended timing for both the Credit Check (beyond 24 hours) and informing the applicant (beyond 48 hours), and omits a suggested Follow-up Call.
– Case 2 also loses out on the Follow-up Call recommendation, but its most critical issues relate to strict order violations.

Understanding and addressing these issues can help streamline process adherence and improve both operational efficiency and customer experience.
