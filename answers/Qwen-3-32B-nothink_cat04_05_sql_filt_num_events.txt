Here's a well-structured and clear **benchmark prompt** based on your request:

---

**Prompt:**

You are working with an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in this table represents a single event in a business process. The table contains at least the following columns:

- `case_id`: A unique identifier for a process instance (case).
- `activity`: The name or type of the event.
- `timestamp`: The time at which the event occurred.

Your task is to write a **DuckDB SQL query** that performs the following steps:

1. **Count** the number of events per `case_id`.
2. **Filter out** any `case_id` that has **more than six events**.
3. **Return all events** for the remaining `case_id`s (i.e., those with **six or fewer events** in total).

Your query should ensure that the filtering is done correctly using appropriate grouping and subqueries. The final output should include all the columns from the original `event_log` table for the qualifying events.
