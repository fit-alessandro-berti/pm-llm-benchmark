### Explanation

#### **Case Identification Logic**
To group events into meaningful process cases, I used a combination of:
- **Application context**: Events in the same application working on the same document or task are grouped together.
- **Temporal proximity**: Events occurring in sequence and within a short time frame are assumed to belong to the same logical unit of work.
- **Task continuity**: When a user switches applications and returns, the original task is resumed under the same case if contextually relevant.

Cases identified:
- **Case_1**: Working on `Document1.docx` — includes creation, editing, saving, and later returning to it.
- **Case_2**: Handling email tasks — from switching to email app to replying and sending an email.
- **Case_3**: Reviewing a PDF (`Report_Draft.pdf`) — focused on reading and highlighting content.
- **Case_4**: Updating a spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`) — entering and saving data.
- **Case_5**: Finalizing `Quarterly_Report.docx` — resuming work on a separate document.

#### **Activity Naming Logic**
Raw actions were abstracted into semantically meaningful and standardized activity names:
- **FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE**  grouped into document editing lifecycle (e.g., *Edit Document Content*, *Save Document*).
- **SWITCH**  interpreted based on direction and purpose (e.g., *Switch to Email Application*, *Switch Back to Document Editing*).
- **CLICK, SCROLL**  interpreted as part of higher-level tasks like *Read Email Content*, *Reply to Email*, or *Review PDF Content*.
- **HIGHLIGHT**  directly translated to *Highlight Text in PDF* for clarity and specificity.

This transformation ensures that the event log is analyst-friendly and suitable for process discovery, conformance checking, and other process mining tasks.
