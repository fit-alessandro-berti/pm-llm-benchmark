Here is the Python code to construct the DECLARE model dictionary:

```python
declare_model = {
    # 'existence' represents the activities that must always be executed
    'existence': {
        'IG': (1.0, 1.0), 'DD': (1.0, 1.0), 'TFC': (1.0, 1.0), 'CE': (1.0, 1.0), 'PC': (1.0, 1.0),
        'LT': (1.0, 1.0), 'UT': (1.0, 1.0), 'AG': (1.0, 1.0), 'MP': (1.0, 1.0), 'FL': (1.0, 1.0)
    },
    
    # 'absence' represents the activities that must never be executed
    'absence': {},
    
    # 'exactly_one' represents the choice between activities such that only one can be executed
    'exactly_one': {'DD': (1.0, 1.0), 'TFC': (1.0, 1.0)},  # Optional but only one between Design Draft and Technical Feasibility Check
    
    # 'init' represents the starting activity in the process
    'init': {'IG': (1.0, 1.0)},
    
    # 'responded_existence' represents that if activity a is executed, then activity b must also be executed
    'responded_existence': {'IG': {'DD': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'DD': {'TFC': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'TFC': {'CE': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'CE': {'PC': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'PC': {'LT': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'LT': {'UT': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'UT': {'AG': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'AG': {'MP': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'MP': {'FL': (1.0, 1.0)}},
    
    # 'coexistence' represents that if activity a is executed, then activity b must also be executed
    'coexistence': {},
    
    # 'response' represents that activity a is executed only if activity b is executed
    'response': {},
    
    # 'precedence' represents that if activity a is executed, then it is always followed by the execution of activity b
    'precedence': {},
    
    # 'succession' represents that if activity a is executed, then activity b is executed afterwards
    'succession': {'IG': {'DD': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'DD': {'TFC': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'TFC': {'CE': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'CE': {'PC': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'PC': {'LT': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'LT': {'UT': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'UT': {'AG': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'AG': {'MP': (1.0, 1.0)}, 'MP': {'FL': (1.0, 1.0)}},
    
    # 'altresponse' represents that if activity a is executed, then exactly one of the activities in b must be executed
    'altresponse': {},
    
    # 'altprecedence' represents that if activity a is executed, then exactly one of the activities in b must be executed afterwards
    'altprecedence': {},
    
    # 'altsuccession' represents that if activity a is executed, then the choice between the activities in b is enabled
    'altsuccession': {},
    
    # 'chainresponse' represents that if the activities in a are executed, in any order, then activity b must also be executed
    'chainresponse': {},
    
    # 'chainprecedence' represents that if activity a is executed, then the activities in b must be executed afterwards, in any order
    'chainprecedence': {},
    
    # 'chainsuccession' represents that if the activities in a are executed, in any order, then activity b is executed afterwards
    'chainsuccession': {},
    
    # 'noncoexistence' represents that activities a and b cannot be executed together
    'noncoexistence': {},
    
    # 'nonsuccession' represents that activity a and b cannot be executed one after the other
    'nonsuccession': {},
    
    # 'nonchainsuccession' represents that the activities in a cannot be executed and then the activities in b in any order
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

This Python dictionary represents the DECLARE model for the complex product design and launch process. However, please note that you may need to adjust the dictionary's content based on specific requirements or rules not mentioned in the scenario description. The rules in the 'existence' and 'succession' conditions represent the flow of activities in the given scenario, but you might need to modify or add conditions to accurately represent other business rules or constraints that apply to this process.
