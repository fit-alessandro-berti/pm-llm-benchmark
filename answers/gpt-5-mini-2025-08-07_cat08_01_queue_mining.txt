Below I give a practical, data-driven workflow you can run on your six-month event log to find, explain, and reduce patient waiting (queue) times. I cover (1) how to identify and measure queues from the start/complete timestamps, (2) root-cause analysis methods using process- and queue-mining techniques, (3) three concrete optimization strategies (with what they target and expected effects), (4) trade-offs and how to balance them, and (5) the KPIs and monitoring approach to validate and sustain improvements.

1) Queue identification and characterization

A. Definition of “waiting time” (queue time)
- For two consecutive activities in the same case (visit), A then B, define the queue time for the transition AB as:
  - queue_time(AB) = max(0, start_time(B)  complete_time(A))
  - Interpretation: if B starts after A completes, the positive gap is waiting in queue; if B starts before A completes (negative gap), treat as zero waiting or flag as overlap/parallel work or data inconsistency.
- Special cases:
  - Arrival wait before Registration: if you have an arrival timestamp, arrival_wait = start_registration  arrival_time. If arrival not recorded, use registration START as proxy for arrival but flag for future data capture.
  - Resource-level queues: if B requires a shared resource (e.g., ECG room), you can compute waiting from resource’s perspective by comparing reservation/actual start and resource availability times (see resource utilization below).

B. Key queue metrics to compute (by transition AB, by activity, by resource, by patient cohort and by time window)
- Central tendency and tail:
  - Mean (average) waiting time
  - Median waiting time
  - 90th (P90) and 95th percentile waiting times
  - Maximum waiting time
- Frequency and impact:
  - #cases where queue_time > threshold (e.g., >15, >30, >60 minutes)
  - % of total cases experiencing queue_time > threshold
  - Absolute time contribution to total visit duration: sum(queue_time) / sum(total_visit_time)
- Variability:
  - Standard deviation and interquartile range
- Load and concurrency:
  - Instantaneous queue length over time: count of cases whose waiting interval [complete_A, start_B) overlaps each timepoint (gives peaks)
  - Average queue length per hour/day
- Resource utilization and throughput:
  - Resource utilization  = busy_time / available_time (per staff, room, equipment)
  - Throughput rate  (cases/hour) per activity (or per specialty)
  - Service time stats: mean and variance of activity duration (complete - start)
- Derived queueing measure:
  - Use Little’s law where applicable: average queue length L =  * average_waiting_time W (gives consistency checks and helps capacity planning)

C. How to identify the most critical queues
- Rank transitions by multi-criteria, not just mean wait:
  - High average waiting time (long queues)
  - High P90 (long-tail suffering)
  - High frequency (affects many patients)
  - Large contribution to total visit lead time (high impact on patient throughput)
  - Effects on high-priority cohorts (urgent patients, complex cases, new patients)
  - Temporal peaks (queues causing congestion during clinic peaks)
- Practical selection rule: compute a score for each transition, e.g.,
  - Score = w1*(normalized_mean_wait) + w2*(normalized_P90) + w3*(normalized_pct_cases_above_threshold) + w4*(normalized_impact_on_total_time)
  - Select top N transitions by score and then validate with stakeholder input (clinician concerns, patient complaints)
- Also prioritize queues that are upstream in the critical path (a delay there delays everything downstream) or that gate access to expensive downstream resources (e.g., an ECG wait that delays doctor's decision and multiple downstream tests).

2) Root-cause analysis

A. Likely root causes to consider
- Resource bottlenecks:
  - Insufficient staff (nurses/clerks/techs) or rooms/equipment during peak times
  - Uneven allocation of staff across shifts (understaffed peaks)
- Activity dependencies and handovers:
  - Serial-only workflows where activities must wait for preceding completion
  - Inefficient handovers (waiting for documentation, room turnover)
- High variability in service times:
  - Some patients take much longer than average (new / complex cases / language barriers)
  - High variance increases queue length even if mean service time is moderate
- Appointment scheduling policies:
  - Bunching (many appointments at beginning of hour)
  - Poor match between appointment type duration and actual service times
  - No buffer slots or poor no-show/overbooking handling
- Arrival patterns and unscheduled walk-ins:
  - Peak arrivals at particular times (e.g., mornings) creating transient overload
  - Urgent drop-ins that preempt scheduled work
- Patient-type heterogeneity:
  - New patients, urgent cases, multi-test visits have different pathways and longer service times
  - Some specialties require pre-tests which, if not pre-booked, cause waits

B. Process-mining techniques to pinpoint causes (what to run on your event log)
- Performance-annotated process map (or Dotted Chart & Flow Map):
  - Visualize average and percentile waiting times on each edge (AB) and node (activity). This highlights hot transitions and where delays cluster.
- Variant analysis:
  - Cluster traces into variants (common pathways) and compare queue times across variants and patient types (New vs Follow-up, specialty).
  - Identify if a few variants cause most delays (Pareto).
- Temporal analysis (heatmaps/time-of-day):
  - Plot waiting times and queue lengths by hour/day to detect peaks and staffing mismatches.
- Resource analysis:
  - Compute utilization per resource, busy intervals, idle times. High utilization (above ~80–85%) often implies large queues and instability.
  - Identify specific staff or rooms with persistent queuing (e.g., ECG Room #3 has long waiting).
- Correlation and drill-down:
  - Correlate waiting times with service time variability, patient type, scheduled appointment time vs arrival time, and provider.
  - Drill down on example long-tail cases to inspect manual notes, cancellations, or test repeat.
- Conformance checking:
  - Compare actual flow to expected clinical pathways to see if rework or out-of-order activities generate waits.
- Queue-length time series and Little’s law checks:
  - Use instantaneous queue length plots and compare with  and W to validate capacity conclusions.
- What-if modeling / simulation:
  - Build a simple discrete-event simulation or queueing model calibrated from the log (arrival rates, service-time distributions, resources) to test staffing or schedule changes before pilots.

3) Data-driven optimization strategies (three concrete proposals)

I will give three distinct strategies that can be piloted independently or combined. For each I state targets, root cause addressed, data-driven rationale and expected impact (ranges based on typical outpatient clinic results).

Strategy A — Appointment smoothing + differentiated booking rules
- Target queues: Registration  Nurse Assessment and Nurse  Doctor (morning bunching); also reduces peaks before diagnostic tests.
- Root cause: Appointment bunching and mismatch between allocated slot lengths and actual service times; no buffers for variability/no-shows.
- Data/analysis support:
  - Time-of-day heatmaps and arrival histograms show concentrated arrivals between 08:30–10:30.
  - High P90 waits and instantaneous queue lengths co-located with those peaks.
  - Variants show scheduled appointments cluster at same time slots.
- Concrete changes:
  - Move from rigid 15-min blocks to mixed-length blocks tuned to patient type (e.g., 10-min follow-ups, 25-min new patient).
  - Introduce staggered start times across specialties and add small buffer slots (floating 10–15 min slots) to absorb overruns.
  - Enforce pre-visit triage to route walk-ins or urgent cases to designated slots.
- Expected impact:
  - 20–40% reduction in mean waiting time at targeted transitions during peak hours; P90 reductions may be larger (30–60%) as buffers absorb tails.
  - Improve throughput consistency; reduce peak queue length.
- Implementation steps:
  - Use historical service time distributions by patient type to redesign slots.
  - Pilot for 2–4 weeks in 1 specialty and monitor KPIs.

Strategy B — Flexible resource pooling and targeted surge staffing
- Target queues: Nurse Assessment, ECG/Blood/X-Ray test queues, any resource with utilization >80%.
- Root cause: Resource-specific bottlenecks (single ECG room/tech) and inflexible staffing.
- Data/analysis support:
  - Resource utilization heatmaps show specific staff/rooms with sustained high utilization.
  - Instantaneous queue length around these resources spikes coincide with long waits.
- Concrete changes:
  - Cross-train a “float” nurse/tech who is scheduled specifically to cover predicted peak windows (data-driven schedule based on arrival patterns).
  - Pool small rooms/equipment where possible (e.g., combine two small exam rooms into a flexible pool).
  - Use dynamic assignment rules via a coordinator/dashboard that reassigns staff in real time to longest queues.
- Expected impact:
  - If utilization for a resource drops from 90% to 75% during peaks, queueing theory predicts substantial queue reduction—often >50% decrease in waiting times for that resource. (Quantify with simulation using your  and service time distributions.)
- Implementation steps:
  - Calibrate a simple staffing model (queueing model or DES) to estimate the number of float staff needed by hour.
  - Pilot with one float for 2 weeks and measure queue reduction and overtime cost.

Strategy C — Parallelization + front-loading diagnostics & digital pre-registration
- Target queues: Diagnostic tests (ECG, blood tests, X-ray) that occur after the doctor and lengthen overall visit, plus registration/check-out waits.
- Root cause: Serial flow where diagnostic tests occur only after doctor visit, causing back-and-forth; repeated check-in/out overhead; manual registration overhead.
- Data/analysis support:
  - Process variants show repeated back-and-forth between doctor and diagnostics.
  - Long post-doctor waits for tests and test results delaying checkout.
- Concrete changes:
  - Implement pre-visit digital registration (online forms, pre-authorization, payment) to reduce registration and checkout times.
  - For predictable test-necessary pathways (e.g., cardio patients frequently need ECG), schedule tests in parallel before doctor consult when clinically safe (pre-ordering tests by nurse or triage).
  - Deploy self-check kiosks or tablet check-outs to reduce clerk time per patient.
- Expected impact:
  - Reduce registration/check-out time by 30–70% and reduce total visit length by 10–20% for patients requiring diagnostics.
  - Parallelizing tests reduces doctor idle waiting and downstream congestion; for affected variants, total visit time may drop by 20–40%.
- Implementation steps:
  - Identify variants where diagnostics are predictable, pilot pre-ordering with explicit clinical governance.
  - Introduce digital forms and kiosk in a single clinic pod and measure time reductions.

(You can also combine a real-time dashboard + predictive alerts as a fourth strategy: a live queue dashboard fed by the event stream to enable coordinators to reallocate staff dynamically. This targets all queues and reduces reaction time to surges.)

4) Trade-offs and constraints

A. Typical trade-offs / negative side effects
- Shifting the bottleneck: reducing wait at one activity may increase load downstream (e.g., speed registration  queue at nurse or tests grows).
- Cost vs. benefit: adding staff (float or extended hours) increases labor costs—must be justified by throughput gains, reduced overtime, and improved satisfaction.
- Staff workload and morale: staggered schedules or floating roles can cause dissatisfaction if not negotiated; cross-training requires time and may temporarily reduce capacity.
- Potential clinical risk: parallelizing diagnostics may lead to unnecessary tests if pre-ordering rules are not strict; must have clinical governance.
- Complexity and IT effort: digital pre-registration and dashboards need integration and user adoption, plus privacy/security.
- Data quality risk: inaccurate timestamps, clock skew, missing START/COMPLETE events can mislead analysis.

B. Balancing conflicting objectives
- Use staged pilots and measure both effectiveness (waits, throughput) and cost (staff hours, overtime, IT) — proceed where net benefit is positive.
- Use optimization objective functions (e.g., minimize weighted sum of patient wait and staffing cost) and sensitivity analysis via simulation before full roll-out.
- Prioritize interventions that are low-cost/high-impact first (scheduling tweaks, buffers, small floating shifts), then invest in higher-cost items if needed.
- Involve clinicians in trade-off decisions; set clinical constraints (e.g., no change that reduces minimum consultation quality).
- Implement feedback loops: monitor crowding and staff satisfaction so policies can be adjusted quickly.

5) Measuring success and ongoing monitoring

A. KPIs to measure post-implementation
- Patient-facing:
  - Average waiting time per transition (mean, median, P90) — e.g., RegistrationNurse, NurseDoctor, DoctorDiagnostics, DiagnosticsDoctor, Check-out wait.
  - Average total visit time (arrival  complete_check_out)
  - % of visits with total visit time > target (e.g., >120 minutes)
  - Patient satisfaction / Net Promoter Score (NPS) or targeted waiting-time satisfaction survey
- Throughput and operational:
  - Number of visits per clinic/day (throughput)
  - #cases completed within planned clinic hours (overtime incidence)
  - Resource utilization per role/room (monitor to avoid over/under staffing)
  - Queue length metrics: average and peak instantaneous queue length per activity
- Quality and safety:
  - % of urgent patients seen within target time
  - Rate of rework or repeated tests due to parallelization errors
- Financial:
  - Additional staffing cost vs. revenue/benefit (e.g., reduced cancellations, improved throughput)

B. How to monitor continuously (using the event log)
- Build automated dashboards that update daily/real-time from the event stream:
  - Performance-annotated process map showing current mean and P90 waits per transition
  - Time-of-day heatmaps and live queue length charts
  - Resource utilization panels (live % utilization and projected utilization for rest of day)
  - Alerts when any KPI breaches thresholds (e.g., P90(wait) > 45 min or queue length > X)
- Use statistical process control:
  - Control charts on mean waiting times and P90; test for special-cause variation after interventions
- A/B or phased roll-out with control group:
  - Pilot intervention in one department while tracking a comparable control to isolate effect from seasonal trends
- Periodic re-analysis:
  - Recompute variant clusters monthly to detect new problematic flows
  - Re-run simulation models quarterly to update staffing needs as demand evolves

C. Validation and continuous improvement
- After pilot, use pre/post analysis with significance testing (e.g., comparing P90 waits) and effect sizes.
- Combine quantitative KPIs with qualitative staff and patient feedback.
- If bottleneck shifts, re-run the same pipeline (identify  root-cause  plan) and iterate.

Operational checklist to start (practical next steps)
1. Data health check and preparation:
   - Ensure START/COMPLETE timestamps are synchronized, handle missing or negative waits, enrich log with arrival info if available, derive patient-type flags.
2. Exploratory analysis:
   - Compute queue_time(AB) for all adjacent pairs, produce top-10 list by multi-criteria score.
   - Visualize process map annotated with mean and P90 waits.
3. Drill-down & validate:
   - Run variant, resource utilization and time-of-day analyses for the top queues; verify with front-line staff.
4. Prototype interventions:
   - Build small simulation models to estimate impact and required staff changes.
5. Pilot and measure:
   - Implement scheduling change or float nurse in one clinic for 2–4 weeks; monitor KPIs and staff/patient feedback.
6. Scale or iterate:
   - If successful, roll out gradually with continuous monitoring and control limits.

Summary
- Use start/complete timestamps to compute queue_time = max(0, start_next  complete_prev) for every transition and aggregate mean/median/P90, frequency, and contribution to total visit time.
- Use process mining artifacts (performance map, variant analysis, resource utilization, time-of-day heatmaps) to find and validate root causes (bunching, high utilization, service-time variability, serial dependencies).
- Pilot three kinds of interventions: (A) appointment smoothing and differentiated booking, (B) flexible pooling/ surge staffing and real-time coordination, (C) parallelization of predictable diagnostics and digital pre-registration — each with concrete targets and measurable benefits.
- Anticipate trade-offs (shifted bottlenecks, cost, staff impact), use simulation to balance objectives, and start with low-cost pilots.
- Monitor with a set of KPIs (waiting percentiles by transition, total visit time, utilization, throughput, patient satisfaction) via automated dashboards and SPC; iterate based on data and frontline feedback.

If you’d like, I can:
- Sketch the exact queries/algorithms (pseudo-SQL or Python/pandas/pm4py code) to compute the transition queue times and queue-length time series from your log format.
- Build a small example discrete-event simulation calibrated to your log (you’d provide aggregated  and service time distributions).
- Draft a pilot plan (timeline, staff roles, expected metrics) tailored to one specialty you identify.
