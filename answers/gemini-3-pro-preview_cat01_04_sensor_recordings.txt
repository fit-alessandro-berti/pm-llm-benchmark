Based on the analysis of the sensor log, I have applied process mining techniques to segment the data into distinct phases. I looked for correlations between energy consumption, physical tool movement, and environmental byproducts (heat/vibration) to infer the specific manufacturing context.

Here is the breakdown of the inferred activities.

### Process Map & Activity Labels

| **Event IDs** | **Inferred Activity** | **Key Indicators** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 – 3** | **Idle / Standby** | Baseline Energy, 0 Vibration, Tool at Home (0mm) |
| **4 – 6** | **Cutting / Machining** | High Flow, Increasing Temp, High Vibration, Tool Advancing |
| **7 – 8** | **Assembling / Pressing** | High Pressure, Stable Tool Position, Reduced Vibration |
| **9** | **Welding** | Temperature Spike (80°C), Peak Energy, Peak Vibration |
| **10** | **Cooling / Inspection** | Rapid Temp Drop, Low Energy, Zero Material Flow |
| **11 – 12** | **Packaging / Unloading** | Low Vibration, Tool moving to exit (20mm), Low Temp |
| **13 – 15** | **Idle / Reset** | Return to Baseline Energy, Tool Reset to Home (0mm) |

### Rationale & Analysis

Here is the detailed logic used to derive these labels from the numerical patterns:

#### Phase 1: Idle / Standby (Events 1–3)
*   **Rationale:** The machine is powered on but not performing work.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Tool Position:** 0 mm (Home position).
    *   **Vibration & Flow:** 0 (No movement).
    *   **Energy:** ~0.45 kWh. This represents the "baseload" power required just to keep the machine's electronics and sensors active.
    *   **Temp:** ~20°C (Ambient room temperature).

#### Phase 2: Cutting / Machining (Events 4–6)
*   **Rationale:** The machine initiates a high-friction operation involving material removal.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Vibration:** Jumps significantly (30–38 Hz), characteristic of a cutting tool making contact with raw material.
    *   **Material Flow:** Increases to 5 units/s, indicating raw material is being fed into the cutter.
    *   **Temperature:** Rises quickly (50°C–58°C) due to friction.
    *   **Tool Position:** Linearly increases (5mm $\to$ 10mm), indicating the tool is cutting *through* the material.

#### Phase 3: Assembling / Pressing (Events 7–8)
*   **Rationale:** The cutting stops, and the machine likely clamps parts together.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Pressure:** Increases to the maximum recorded level (2 bar), suggesting a clamping or pressing action.
    *   **Vibration:** Drops to a low hum (10 Hz), indicating the chaotic friction of cutting has stopped.
    *   **Tool Position:** Stabilizes at 15mm. The tool is holding a position rather than moving through material.
    *   **Temperature:** Stabilizes/Cools slightly (40°C), as friction generation has stopped.

#### Phase 4: Welding (Event 9)
*   **Rationale:** A short, high-intensity burst of energy and heat used to permanently join the assembled parts.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Temperature:** Sudden spike to 80°C (Highest recorded).
    *   **Energy:** Spike to 5.00 kWh (Highest recorded).
    *   **Vibration:** Spikes to 50 Hz. In welding, this often represents the resonance of the welding transformer or the arc intensity.
    *   **Material Flow:** 0 units/s. The part is stationary during the weld.

#### Phase 5: Cooling / Quality Inspection (Event 10)
*   **Rationale:** A pause immediately following the high-heat operation to allow the part to set or be scanned.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Temperature:** Drops rapidly to 30°C (likely active cooling applied).
    *   **Vibration:** Almost zero (1 Hz).
    *   **Energy:** Drops to 1.00 kWh. It is higher than the "Idle" state (0.5), suggesting cameras or fans are running, but lower than active machining.

#### Phase 6: Packaging / Unloading (Events 11–12)
*   **Rationale:** The finished part is moved out of the work area.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Tool Position:** Moves to 20mm (Maximum extension), pushing the part out or placing it onto a conveyor.
    *   **Material Flow:** Slight bump (1 unit/s), indicating the finished product moving away.
    *   **Vibration:** Low (5 Hz), consistent with a conveyor belt or robotic arm movement.
    *   **Temp:** Returns to near ambient (25°C).

#### Phase 7: Idle / Reset (Events 13–15)
*   **Rationale:** The cycle is complete, and the machine resets for the next item.
*   **Data Evidence:**
    *   **Tool Position:** Snaps back to 0mm.
    *   **Sensors:** All readings return to the exact baseline values seen in Events 1–3.
