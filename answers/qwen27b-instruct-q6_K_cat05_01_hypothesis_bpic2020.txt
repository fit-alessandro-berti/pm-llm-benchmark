Based on the data provided, I would propose the following 20 relevant questions that could help analyze and understand the process better:

### Questions

1. **What is the average performance in terms of payment handling time?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*
   
2. **How often does a Declaration get APPROVED by both ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER before SUPERVISOR final approval?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

3. **Which employee or role has the highest number of DECLARATION rejections at any stage (except PAYMENT HANDLED)?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*
   
4. **What is the average time from SUBMISSION to final APPROVAL when SUPERVISOR's approval leads directly to final APPROVAL by the supervisor without REJECTION?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

5. **How many declarations were rejected multiple times before they eventually got approved, and what was the longest number of rejections before final approval?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*
   
6. **What is the average time taken for a DECLARATION to go through all stages when APPROVED by both ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER prior to SUPERVISOR's approval?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

7. **Does the performance (payment handling) change significantly with the involvement of PRE_APPROVER before final supervisor approval, or does it remain relatively constant?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*
   
8. **How often do employees directly APPROVE their DECLARATIONS without going through SUPERVISOR approval?**  
   *Confidence Score: Low*

9. **What is the average time from SUBMISSION to final APPROVAL when a DECLARATION gets REJECTED by missing information or an error before being finalized?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

10. **Can you identify any patterns in DECLARATION approval based on performance (payment handling)? For instance, are there specific roles or stages that consistently take longer than others to complete?**  
    *Confidence Score: High*
   
11. **How does the frequency and performance of DECLARATION APPROVAL vary across different categories (like category of employee, role, etc.) involved in the process?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

12. **Does involving a PRE_APPROVER influence the overall process time or outcome significantly?**  
    *Confidence Score: Medium*

13. **What percentage of DECLARATION submissions result directly in APPROVAL by the supervisor without any rejections, compared to those requiring multiple stages of approval or rejection before final approval?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*

14. **Is there a noticeable difference in the payment handling performance between declarations submitted during different time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly)?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

15. **What is the average number of days taken for DECLARATION approval when it involves two or more rejections before final approval?**  
    *Confidence Score: High*

16. **Can you identify any correlations between employee performance (based on their declaration submission history) and their likelihood to get DECLARATION approvals or rejections at specific stages?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

17. **Does the involvement of multiple approval stages (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) significantly affect payment handling time, or do these stages primarily influence declaration submission flow rather than payment process timing?**  
   *Confidence Score: High*

18. **How does the performance (payment handling speed) differ between declarations that have been through fewer rejections vs those with more?**  
   *Confidence Score: Medium*

19. **Is there an average time gap observed between a declaration being SUBMITTED and reaching its first stage of approval?**  
    *Confidence Score: High*

20. **Can you analyze if any specific roles (like PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR) consistently have issues leading to higher rejection rates or longer approval times than others?**  
    *Confidence Score: Medium*
