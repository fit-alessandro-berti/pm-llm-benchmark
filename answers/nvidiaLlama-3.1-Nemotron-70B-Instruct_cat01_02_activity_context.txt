**Justification for Naming Choices:**

- **Initial/Re-verification of Documents**: Differentiates between the first verification attempt and subsequent checks after receiving additional information or making account adjustments.
  
- **Outbound for Missing Documents**: Clearly indicates the purpose of the initial call in cases where documents are lacking.
  
- **Clarification/Follow-up Call**: Captures the essence of calls made for either clarifying discrepancies or following up on actions taken, regardless of the case specifics.
