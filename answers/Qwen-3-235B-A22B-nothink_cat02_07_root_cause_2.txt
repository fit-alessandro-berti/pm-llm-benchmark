To identify performance issues and determine their root causes in the **Insurance Claims Processing** process, we'll follow a structured approach:

---

##  **Step 1: Calculate Case Durations**

We'll compute the total time from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim** for each case:

| Case ID | Submit Claim Timestamp    | Close Claim Timestamp       | Duration (hours) |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| 2001   | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30            | 1.5              |
| 2002   | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00            | 25.9             |
| 2003   | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30            | 48.3             |
| 2004   | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45            | 1.4              |
| 2005   | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30            | 77.1             |

---

##  **Step 2: Identify Cases with Performance Issues**

Let’s define **“significantly longer”** as cases exceeding **24 hours** (approx. 1 workday). Based on that:

###  **Cases with Performance Issues:**
- **2002** – 25.9 hours
- **2003** – 48.3 hours
- **2005** – 77.1 hours

> These cases are **taking significantly longer** than the average 1.5-hour case (e.g., Case 2001 and 2004).

---

##  **Step 3: Analyze Root Causes Using Attributes**

We’ll now examine the attributes of these cases and compare them with the rest of the dataset to find correlations.

###  **Case 2002: 25.9 Hours**
- **Region**: B
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Resource**: Adjuster_Lisa
- **Process Flow**:
  - Submitted  Evaluated  Requested Documents (once)  Approved  Paid  Closed
  - **Document request delayed approval by ~20 hours**

> **Observation**: Medium-complexity case with one document request led to a **20-hour delay** before approval.

---

###  **Case 2003: 48.3 Hours**
- **Region**: A
- **Complexity**: High
- **Resource**: Adjuster_Mike
- **Process Flow**:
  - Submitted  Evaluated  Document Request (twice)  Approved  Paid  Closed
  - Two document requests occurred before approval
  - **Each document request added ~6–10 hours of delay**

> **Observation**: High-complexity case with **two document requests** caused **significant delays**.

---

###  **Case 2005: 77.1 Hours**
- **Region**: B
- **Complexity**: High
- **Resource**: Adjuster_Lisa
- **Process Flow**:
  - Submitted  Evaluated  Document Request (three times)  Approved  Paid  Closed
  - **Three document requests** spread over 3 days before approval
  - **Each request added ~15–20 hours of delay**

> **Observation**: High-complexity case with **three document requests** led to a **multi-day delay**.

---

##  **Step 4: Correlation Analysis**

###  **1. Impact of Complexity:**
- **Low Complexity**: 1.5 and 1.4 hours
- **Medium Complexity**: 25.9 hours
- **High Complexity**: 48.3 and 77.1 hours

>  **Conclusion**: **High-complexity claims take significantly longer**, often requiring **multiple rounds of document requests**, which **add up to significant delays**.

---

###  **2. Impact of Region:**
- **Region A**:
  - Case 2001 (Low): 1.5h
  - Case 2003 (High): 48.3h
- **Region B**:
  - Case 2002 (Medium): 25.9h
  - Case 2004 (Low): 1.4h
  - Case 2005 (High): 77.1h

>  **Conclusion**: **Region B handles more high-complexity cases** and also shows **longer durations**, though complexity seems to be the **primary driver**.

---

###  **3. Impact of Resource:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)**:
  - Case 2002 (Medium): 25.9h (1 request)
  - Case 2005 (High): 77.1h (3 requests)
- **Adjuster_Mike (Region A)**:
  - Case 2003 (High): 48.3h (2 requests)

>  **Conclusion**: Both adjusters are handling high-complexity claims with **multiple document requests**, suggesting **process inefficiencies** rather than individual underperformance.

---

##  **Step 5: Root Causes Summary**

| Root Cause | Evidence from Data |
|------------|--------------------|
| **High Complexity  More Document Requests** | High-complexity cases required **2–3 document requests**, each adding **6–20+ hours** of delay |
| **Document Request Process is Slow** | Time between document request and next step is **long**, indicating **slow turnaround**, **lack of automation**, or **communication delays** |
| **Region B Handles More High-Complexity Claims** | Region B has **2 high-complexity cases** vs. Region A’s **1**, contributing to **higher average duration** |
| **Adjusters Requesting Documents Repeatedly** | Adjusters are **not resolving issues in one go**, indicating **lack of clarity**, **process guidance**, or **training** |

---

##  **Step 6: Recommendations to Mitigate Issues**

###  **1. Improve Document Request Workflow**
- **Automate document requests** with templates and reminders
- Implement a **centralized communication hub** between claimant and insurer
- **Set SLAs** for document turnaround to reduce delays

###  **2. Training for Adjusters**
- Train adjusters on **comprehensive initial evaluation** to reduce **repeat document requests**
- Provide **checklists or decision trees** for high-complexity claims

###  **3. Redistribute Complex Claims**
- Balance **high-complexity workload** across regions or adjusters
- Consider **specializing adjusters** in high-complexity claims

###  **4. Use Predictive Analytics**
- Predict **claim complexity early** to route to the right adjuster
- Flag cases at risk of delay based on **document request patterns**

##  **Final Summary Table**

| Case ID | Complexity | # of Requests | Region | Duration | Performance Issue? |
|--------|------------|---------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| 2001   | Low        | 0             | A      | 1.5h     |  No               |
| 2002   | Medium     | 1             | B      | 25.9h    |  Yes              |
| 2003   | High       | 2             | A      | 48.3h    |  Yes              |
| 2004   | Low        | 0             | B      | 1.4h     |  No               |
| 2005   | High       | 3             | B      | 77.1h    |  Yes              |

##  **Conclusion**

- **High-complexity claims** are the **main driver** of long durations.
- **Multiple document requests**, often from the same adjuster, **significantly delay resolution**.
- **Region B** is handling more complex cases and shows **longer durations**, but complexity seems to be the root cause, not regional inefficiency.
- **Improving the document request process**, **training adjusters**, and **redistributing complex cases** can help **reduce case durations** and **improve customer satisfaction**.
