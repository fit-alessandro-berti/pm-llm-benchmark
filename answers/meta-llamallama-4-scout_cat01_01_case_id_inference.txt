## Step 1: Identify Key Attributes for Case Grouping
To group the events into separate cases, we first need to identify key attributes that can help us distinguish between different patients and their journeys. These attributes include `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the sequence of activities.

## 2: Analyze Events for Unique Patient Attributes
Looking at the events, we can see that each event has a `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. These attributes can be used to identify distinct patients if we assume that a patient does not change their age or gender across events.

## 3: Sequence Events by Timestamp
The events are already listed in chronological order based on their timestamps. This will help in understanding the flow of activities for each patient.

## 4: Group Events by Patient Attributes
Let's list the events with their attributes and try to group them:
1. (08:05:13, Register patient, 45, M)
2. (08:07:02, Register patient, 62, F)
3. (08:07:15, Register patient, 28, M)
4. (08:10:50, Initial triage, 45, M)
5. (08:12:29, Initial triage, 62, F)
6. (08:13:00, Doctor consultation, 28, M)
7. (08:15:42, X-ray imaging, 45, M)
8. (08:16:10, Lab test requested, 62, F)
9. (08:16:45, Surgery preparation, 28, M)
10. (08:20:27, Lab test completed, 62, F)
11. (08:22:54, Doctor consultation, 45, M)
12. (08:23:10, Doctor consultation, 28, M)
13. (08:25:19, Surgery performed, 28, M)
14. (08:27:00, Prescription created, 62, F)
15. (08:30:05, Patient discharged, 45, M)
16. (08:31:37, Recovery room, 28, M)
17. (08:35:29, Patient discharged, 62, F)
18. (08:40:13, Patient discharged, 28, M)

## 5: Infer Case Groupings
Based on `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, let's try to group these events:
- Patient 1: 45, M
- Patient 2: 62, F
- Patient 3: 28, M
- Patient 4: 45, M (second event for the same patient)

## 6: Detailed Grouping
1. **Patient 1 (45, M)**: 
   - 08:05:13: Register patient
   - 08:10:50: Initial triage
   - 08:15:42: X-ray imaging
   - 08:22:54: Doctor consultation
   - 08:30:05: Patient discharged

2. **Patient 2 (62, F)**:
   - 08:07:02: Register patient
   - 08:12:29: Initial triage
   - 08:16:10: Lab test requested
   - 08:20:27: Lab test completed
   - 08:22:10 is not present, assuming 08:22:54 is incorrect and it refers to 08:22:00 for Patient 2: Doctor consultation
   - 08:27:00: Prescription created
   - 08:35:29: Patient discharged

3. **Patient 3 (28, M)**:
   - 08:07:15: Register patient
   - 08:13:00: Doctor consultation
   - 08:16:45: Surgery preparation
   - 08:25:19: Surgery performed
   - 08:31:37 Recovery noted but seems incorrect based on timestamp and activity; likely refers to post-op recovery or a similar event.

## 7: Correcting and Finalizing Groups
Upon closer inspection:
- The first event for Patient 1 happens at 08:05:13 (Register patient, 45, M).
- The second event for Patient 2 at 08:07:02 (Register patient, 62, F).
- The third event at 08:07:15 is for Patient 3 (Register patient, 28, M).

## 8: Accurate Case Identification
1. **Case 1 (45, M)**: 
   - Register patient (08:05:13)
   - Initial triage (08:10:50)
   - X-ray imaging (08:15:42)
   - Doctor consultation (08:22:54 is not directly provided but inferred from context)
   - Patient discharged (08:30:05)

2. **Case 2 (62, F)**:
   - Register patient (08:07:02)
   - Initial triage (no direct match but 08:12:29 seems to be for this patient)
   - Lab test requested (08:16:10)
   - Lab test completed (08:20:27)
   - Doctor consultation and Prescription (inferred around 08:22:54 and 08:27:00)
   - Patient discharged (08:35:29 - seems slightly misplaced but likely correct)

3. **Case 3 (28, M)**:
   - Register patient (08:07:15)
   - Surgery preparation (08:16:45)
   - Doctor consultation/Surgery (inferred, 08:13:00 and onwards)

4. **Case 4 (45, M) seems correctly identified but ensure sequence logic**:
   - Initial triage and subsequent events need to align with a single patient journey.

## 9: Logical Case Grouping
- **Case 1**: Patient 1 (45, M) - Events 1, 4, 7, 9.
- **Case 2**: Patient 2 (62, F) - Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 14.
- **Case 3**: Patient 3 (28, M) - Events 3, 6, 11, 12.
- **Case 4**: Patient 4 (45, M) - Already identified.

## 10: Final Case Grouping
Given the complexity and the need for clear grouping:
- **Patient 1 (45, M)**: Events 1, 4, 7, 9.
- **Patient 2 (62, F)**: Events 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.
- **Patient 3 (28, M)**: Events 3, 6, 13, 15.
- **Patient 4 (45, M)**: Already correctly grouped.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$
