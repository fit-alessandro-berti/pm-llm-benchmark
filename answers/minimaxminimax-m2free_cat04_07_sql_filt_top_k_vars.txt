First, I need to understand the task clearly. I have a table called `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. A process variant is the sequence of activities for a case, ordered by timestamp.

My goals are:

1. For each `case_id`, get the sequence of activities sorted by timestamp.

2. Group cases by their activity sequence to find unique variants.

3. Count how many cases have each variant.

4. Find the top K variants by frequency.

5. Return all events from the original log that belong to cases in these top K variants.

The final output should be the events filtered to only those cases that are part of the top K variants.

Now, I need to write a DuckDB SQL query to do this. DuckDB supports window functions and arrays, which might be useful for handling sequences.

Let me break this down step by step in SQL terms.

Step 1: Extract the ordered sequence of activities per case.

I can use `STRING_AGG` or `ARRAY_AGG` to concatenate or collect the activities in order. Since the sequence is important, I should order by timestamp.

DuckDB has `LIST_AGG` or `ARRAY_AGG` functions. I think `LIST_AGG` is for strings, but I need a sequence of activities. Perhaps I can use `ARRAY_AGG` with order by.

Let me check DuckDB documentation quickly. Since I'm an AI, I should recall that DuckDB supports `ARRAY_AGG` with ORDER BY.

Yes, in DuckDB, I can do something like:

SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

FROM event_log

GROUP BY case_id;

This will give me an array of activities for each case, ordered by timestamp.

Step 2: Group cases by their activity sequence to identify unique variants.

I can use this activity_sequence as the grouping key. But activity_sequence is an array, so I need to handle it in a way that I can group by the entire sequence.

In SQL, arrays can be compared for equality. So I can group by the array directly.

For example:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as case_count

FROM (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

) grouped

GROUP BY activity_sequence

ORDER BY case_count DESC

LIMIT K;

This will give me the top K variants by frequency, where K is a parameter I need to set.

The query should return the top K variants. But I need to keep this information to filter the cases later.

Step 3: Count cases per variant and get top K.

In the above, I'm counting cases per variant and ordering by count descending, then limiting to K.

But I need to return the events for cases in these top K variants.

So, I need to join this back to the original event_log table to get all events for those cases.

Let me outline the entire query.

First, I'll create a subquery that gets the activity sequence for each case and the variant frequency.

Then, I'll use that to identify the cases that belong to top K variants.

Finally, I'll select all events from event_log where case_id is in the set of cases from the top K variants.

In SQL, I can do this with a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery.

Let me write the query step by step.

I'll start by defining the CTE for the variant frequencies.

WITH variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT 

        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence,

        COUNT(*) as frequency

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

top_variants AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence

    FROM variant_frequencies

    ORDER BY frequency DESC

    LIMIT K  -- K is a parameter; I'll need to specify it later

)

But wait, in the variant_frequencies CTE, I have one row per case, but I need to group by the sequence, not by case_id.

I think I messed up.

In the first CTE, I want to group by the sequence to get the frequency per variant.

So, I should first get the sequence per case, then group by that sequence.

Let me correct:

WITH case_sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as frequency

    FROM case_sequences

    GROUP BY activity_sequence

),

top_variants AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence

    FROM variant_frequencies

    ORDER BY frequency DESC

    LIMIT K

)

Now, top_variants has the activity sequences of the top K variants.

But I need to get the cases that belong to these sequences.

In other words, for each sequence in top_variants, I want the case_ids from case_sequences that have that sequence.

So, I can join case_sequences with top_variants on activity_sequence.

Then, I have a set of case_ids that are in the top K variants.

Finally, I can select from event_log where case_id is in that set.

The final query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as frequency

    FROM case_sequences

    GROUP BY activity_sequence

),

top_variant_cases AS (

    SELECT cs.case_id

    FROM case_sequences cs

    JOIN variant_frequencies vf ON cs.activity_sequence = vf.activity_sequence

    WHERE vf.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)  -- this might be redundant

    ORDER BY vf.frequency DESC

    LIMIT K  -- but this limits cases, not variants; I need to limit variants first.

I have a problem here.

In the top_variants CTE, I have the top K variant sequences. But when I join with case_sequences, I get multiple case_ids per variant. If I then limit to K case_ids, that might not be what I want.

The requirement is: count cases per variant, and take top K variants. Then, for those top K variants, get all cases that belong to them.

So, I don't want to limit the number of cases; I want to limit the number of variants, and then take all cases for those variants.

In my CTE, I have variant_frequencies which has frequency per variant. Then top_variants selects the top K variants by frequency. But in top_variants, I only have the sequences, not the frequencies yet.

I need to keep the frequency information to order, but for joining, I only need the sequence.

But when I join case_sequences with variant_frequencies, I get all cases with their variant frequency.

Then, I can select case_ids where the variant frequency is among the top K.

But since I'm limiting K variants, I need a way to identify the top K variants.

I can use a window function or something to rank the variants.

DuckDB supports window functions, so I can use RANK() or DENSE_RANK() to rank the variants by frequency.

Let me try a different approach.

I'll create a CTE that ranks the variants by frequency.

WITH case_sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as frequency

    FROM case_sequences

    GROUP BY activity_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, frequency, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rank

    FROM variant_frequencies

),

top_variant_sequences AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rank <= K  -- K is the top K

)

Now, top_variant_sequences has the sequences of the top K variants.

Then, I can select cases from case_sequences where activity_sequence is in this set.

Finally, select events from event_log where case_id is in that set.

The full query:

WITH case_sequences AS (

    SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence

    FROM event_log

    GROUP BY case_id

),

variant_frequencies AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) as frequency

    FROM case_sequences

    GROUP BY activity_sequence

),

ranked_variants AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence, frequency, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rank

    FROM variant_frequencies

),

top_variant_sequences AS (

    SELECT activity_sequence

    FROM ranked_variants

    WHERE rank <= K  -- K is a parameter; I'll set it when running the query

),

top_cases AS (

    SELECT case_id

    FROM case_sequences

    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variant_sequences)

)

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases)

This should work.

But I need to handle the case where there are ties for the K-th rank. The RANK() function will handle ties, so if multiple variants have the same frequency at rank K, all will be included.

The requirement says "top K variants", so including ties is probably fine, as per standard interpretation.

I could use DENSE_RANK() if I want exactly K distinct ranks, but RANK() might be better to include all variants with high frequency.

The problem doesn't specify, so I'll go with RANK().

Now, about the parameter K: in the query, I need to replace K with a number. But in a real scenario, K should be a parameter. For the purpose of this response, I'll assume K is given, or I can write the query with K as a placeholder.

Since the user didn't specify a value for K, I should write the query to accept K. But in DuckDB, I can use a parameter or a literal. I'll write the query with K as a variable, and in the response, I can mention that K needs to be set.

For the sake of this exercise, I'll write the query with K, and in the explanation, I'll say to replace K with the desired number.

Now, let's verify the logic.

- First, for each case, I aggregate the activities in order to get a sequence.

- Then, I group by the sequence to get the frequency of each variant.

- Then, I rank the variants by frequency descending.

- Then, I select the top K sequences based on rank.

- Then, I find all cases that have one of these sequences.

- Finally, I select all events from those cases.

This should satisfy the requirement.

I need to make sure that the sequences are correctly compared. Since arrays in DuckDB can be compared for equality, this should work.

Also, for the final output, I'm returning all events from the original event log for the filtered cases.

The query might be inefficient for large datasets, but for the purpose of this task, it should be fine.

Now, I need to write the SQL code.

I'll write it as a single query, but using CTEs for clarity.

In DuckDB, I can also use subqueries, but CTEs are cleaner.

Let me write the code.

One thing: in the final SELECT, I'm selecting all columns from event_log. That should be fine, as per the requirement to return all events.

The requirement says: "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So, yes, all columns from event_log for those cases.

Now, for the response, I should provide the SQL code.

But the user might want me to run it or something, but since it's a query, I'll just provide the code.

Also, I need to specify that K should be replaced with the actual value.

In the query, I can use a parameter. DuckDB supports parameters with $1 or something, but I'll assume K is a literal for simplicity.

I'll write the query with K as a placeholder.

Final query:
</think>

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task. This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Generate case sequences**: For each `case_id`, aggregate the activities in chronological order.
2. **Calculate variant frequencies**: Group cases by their activity sequence and count the frequency of each variant.
3. **Identify top K variants**: Use a window function to rank variants by frequency and select the top K variants.
4. **Filter events**: Select all events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

The query assumes that `K` is replaced with the desired number (e.g., `5` for top 5 variants). You can set `K` as a parameter when running the query.

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence, 
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence, 
        frequency, 
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_frequencies
),
top_variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE rank <= K  -- Replace K with the desired number (e.g., 5)
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variant_sequences)
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_cases);
```

### Explanation:
- **CTE `case_sequences`**: Creates an array of activities for each case, ordered by timestamp.
- **CTE `variant_frequencies`**: Groups cases by their activity sequence and counts how many cases follow each variant.
- **CTE `ranked_variants`**: Assigns a rank to each variant based on its frequency, with ties handled by the `RANK()` function.
- **CTE `top_variant_sequences`**: Selects the sequences of the top K variants by rank.
- **CTE `top_cases`**: Finds all unique `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants.
- **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original table where the `case_id` is in the top K variant cases.

### Usage:
- Replace `K` with the desired number (e.g., `5` for top 5 variants). For example, change `WHERE rank <= 5`.
- Run the query in DuckDB. The output will include all columns from `event_log` for cases in the top K variants.

This query efficiently handles the requirements while leveraging DuckDB's array functions and window functions.
