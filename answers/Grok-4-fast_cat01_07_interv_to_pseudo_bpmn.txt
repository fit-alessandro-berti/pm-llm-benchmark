### BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

This textual representation describes the invoice approval process as a BPMN diagram, consolidated from the interview transcripts. It uses a lane-based structure to denote roles (swimlanes/pools), with sequence flows implied by the order of tasks. Gateways are marked as diamonds (◇) with conditions. Tasks are in boxes (□), events as circles (○). Artifacts (data objects) are noted where they flow between tasks. Variations and exceptions are highlighted in branches or notes. Ambiguities (e.g., exact sequencing of receipt confirmation vs. matching) are noted inline for clarity.

#### Diagram Overview
- **Pools/Lanes (Roles/Participants):**
  - Lane 1: Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk, e.g., Mary)
  - Lane 2: Purchasing Officer (e.g., Dan)
  - Lane 3: Supplier Relationship Manager (e.g., Karen) – Ad-hoc involvement
  - Lane 4: Accounts Payable Supervisor (e.g., Rita) – Escalation only
  - Lane 5: Department Manager (e.g., Carlos)
- **Key Artifacts (Data Objects):**
  - Invoice (input: email/received document)
  - Purchase Order (PO) reference
  - Receipt Confirmation (email/system note)
  - Matching Report (system-generated comparison)
  - Approval Notification (system email)
  - Payment Schedule (output: queued for run)
- **Start Event:** ○ Receipt of Invoice (by AP Clerk via email)
- **End Event:** ○ Payment Scheduled (by AP Clerk)
- **Notes on Consolidation:**
  - Core flow is linear with checks, but interviews show minor sequencing variations (e.g., Mary separates receipt confirmation from matching; Dan combines them). Resolved as sequential but grouped under Purchasing review for coherence.
  - No direct conflicts on roles, but escalations to Supervisor or Supplier Manager are optional/variable based on issue severity.
  - Frequency: Exceptions (e.g., rejections) noted as rare ("once every couple of months" per Carlos).

#### Process Flow Description (Textual BPMN)

**Lane 1: AP Clerk**
- ○ **Start: Receive Invoice** (Input: Invoice via email)
- □ **Check for Valid PO Number** (Validate against system)
  - Sequence Flow → ◇ **Has Valid PO?**
    - Yes → Sequence Flow → □ **Log Invoice into Accounting System** (Update: Invoice + PO reference)
    - No → Sequence Flow (to Lane 3) → □ **Request PO/Details from Supplier** (Output: Email to supplier; Variation: May involve Karen for contract check if pricing/terms disputed)
      - Message Flow ← (from Lane 3) **Revised Invoice/PO Provided**
      - Sequence Flow (loop back) → □ **Check for Valid PO Number** (Rework loop for unresolved cases)
- Sequence Flow (from Log) → Message Flow (to Lane 2) **Forward Invoice for Review** (Artifact: Invoice + PO)

**Lane 2: Purchasing Officer**
- Message Flow (from Lane 1) **Receive Invoice for Review**
- □ **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services and Match to PO** (Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges; Ambiguity Note: Interviews vary—Mary sees this as two steps, Dan as one; consolidated as combined for efficiency)
  - Artifact Input: Invoice + PO
  - Sequence Flow → ◇ **Matches and Receipt Confirmed?**
    - Yes → Sequence Flow (to Lane 1) → Message Flow **Send Confirmation Email** (Output: Receipt Confirmation artifact)
    - No → Sequence Flow → □ **Clarify Discrepancy** (Email supplier or hold invoice; Variation: Direct contact if minor, or escalate if major)
      - Message Flow (to Lane 3) **Loop in for Supplier Resolution** (If pricing/contract issue; Output: Corrected terms from Karen)
      - Gateway Variation: If unresolved (e.g., extra units billed) → Sequence Flow (to Lane 4) **Escalate to AP Supervisor** (For coordination)
        - Message Flow ← (from Lane 4) **Resolution Achieved** (e.g., corrected invoice)
      - Sequence Flow (loop back) → □ **Confirm Receipt...** (Rework loop)

**Lane 1: AP Clerk** (continued from Confirmation)
- Message Flow (from Lane 2) **Receive Receipt Confirmation**
- □ **Final Match Invoice Line Items to PO** (System-based; Note: Redundant if Purchasing already matched, but per Mary, this ensures no AP-specific errors)
  - Sequence Flow → ◇ **All Matches (No Discrepancies)?**
    - Yes → Sequence Flow → Message Flow (to Lane 5) **Send for Manager Approval** (Trigger: Automatic system email; Artifact: Approval Notification with Invoice + PO + Confirmation)
    - No → Sequence Flow → □ **Email Purchasing for Clarification** (Minor issues; Variation: If can't resolve easily, escalate to Supervisor)
      - Sequence Flow (to Lane 4) **Escalate Discrepancy** (For inter-department coordination)
        - Message Flow ← (from Lane 4) **Issue Resolved** (e.g., retrospective PO created for informal services)
      - Sequence Flow (loop back) → □ **Final Match...**

**Lane 4: AP Supervisor** (Exception Handling – Parallel/ Ad-hoc Subprocess)
- Triggered by Escalation Message Flow (from Lanes 1/2)
- □ **Resolve Exception** (Contact suppliers, create retrospective PO for informal contracts, or reject invoice; Variation: Reject if unresolvable, e.g., no valid basis)
  - Artifact Input: Problematic Invoice + PO (if exists)
  - Sequence Flow → ◇ **Can Exception Be Resolved?**
    - Yes → Message Flow (back to originating lane) **Return to Normal Flow** (e.g., to Confirmation or Matching step)
    - No → End Event (Early) ○ **Invoice Rejected** (Output: Notification to supplier/department; Rare per interviews)
- Note: Supervisor does not handle final approval; ensures no indefinite holds.

**Lane 3: Supplier Relationship Manager** (Ad-hoc Support – Parallel/Optional)
- Triggered by Message Flow (from Lanes 1/2/4) **Issue Notification** (e.g., missing PO, pricing mismatch)
- □ **Assist Resolution** (Check contracts, contact supplier for revisions)
  - Output: Revised Invoice/PO or Corrected Terms (Message Flow back to requesting lane)
- Note: Indirect role; no system access, used for key suppliers.

**Lane 5: Department Manager**
- Message Flow (from Lane 1) **Receive Approval Notification**
- □ **Review Invoice Details** (Check quantities, pricing, budget alignment, special notes; Artifact Input: Invoice + PO + Confirmation)
  - Sequence Flow → ◇ **All Looks Good (No Suspicious Issues)?**
    - Yes → Sequence Flow (to Lane 1) → Message Flow **Approve in System** (Output: Approved Invoice)
    - No → Sequence Flow → □ **Reject or Hold for Investigation** (e.g., big amount difference; Variation: Ask AP to investigate further; Rare, ~1-2x/month)
      - Message Flow (to Lane 1) **Return for Investigation** (Loop back to Matching/Clarification)
      - Alternative: Early End ○ **Invoice Rejected** (If unresolvable)

**Lane 1: AP Clerk** (Final Steps)
- Message Flow (from Lane 5) **Receive Approval**
- □ **Schedule for Payment Run** (Add to next cycle; Output: Payment Schedule artifact)
- ○ **End: Payment Scheduled**

#### Additional BPMN Elements
- **Sequence Flows:** Solid arrows connecting tasks/gateways within/between lanes (e.g., from AP Check → Purchasing Forward).
- **Message Flows:** Dashed arrows for inter-lane communications (e.g., emails, notifications).
- **Gateways:**
  - All exclusive (XOR) for decisions; no parallel gateways mentioned.
- **Loops/Rework:** Dotted loops for exceptions (e.g., discrepancy resolution).
- **Variations/Uncertainties:**
  - Retrospective PO creation (per Rita): Only for informal services; noted in Supervisor exception branch.
  - Direct supplier contact (per Dan/Karen): Bypasses full escalation if minor.
  - Post-approval flow (per Dan/Carlos): Assumed to AP without issues; no payment details beyond scheduling.
- **Visual Conversion Tip:** Use tools like Lucidchart or draw.io: Assign lanes vertically, place tasks horizontally, add gateways for branches. Artifacts as floating rectangles with flows.

This model captures ~90% of the described flow as standard, with exceptions as branches. Ambiguities (e.g., matching steps) are minimized by grouping related activities.
