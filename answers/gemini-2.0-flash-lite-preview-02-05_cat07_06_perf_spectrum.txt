Here's a description of the visualization:

**Type:** The image appears to be a Sankey diagram, a type of flow diagram that visually represents the flow of data or quantities between different categories.

**Elements:**

*   **Horizontal Lines**: There are three horizontal lines representing steps or stages in a process:
    *   "Send Fine" (Top line)
    *   "Insert Fine Notification" (Middle Line)
    *   "Send for Credit Collection" (Bottom Line)
*   **Vertical Lines:** Representing the timeline, there are a few dates on the bottom of the image:
    *   2000-01-25 01:00:00 (far left)
    *   2006-09-09 02:00:00 (middle)
    *   2013-04-24 02:00:00 (far right)
*   **Flows/Connections:** The data flow is shown by lines connecting the stages. There are lines going from the top line "Send Fine" all the way down to "Send for Credit Collection" and others that terminate in the middle line "Insert Fine Notification". There are also two colors for the flow lines, grey and red.

**Overall Impression:** The diagram depicts a process over time, likely related to fines and their collection. The gray flow lines may have a different meaning than the red flow lines.
