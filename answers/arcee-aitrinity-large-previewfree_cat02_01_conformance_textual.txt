Starting from the first case, everything follows the expected sequence: receive, check inventory, authorize payment, package, ship, and close. No issues there.

The second case, however, raises a red flag. After checking inventory, the process moves straight to packaging before authorizing payment. The description is explicit that payment should be authorized before packaging—packaging should only occur after authorization and before shipping. This sequence breaks that rule, so this case violates the normative flow.

The third case also presents a problem. After authorizing payment, it jumps to canceling the order. The process description makes it clear that once inventory is checked and found insufficient, cancellation should happen immediately afterward, skipping payment authorization entirely. Here, authorization happened first, which is illogical if the order was ultimately canceled for lack of stock. Then, to make matters worse, the case proceeds to ship the order after cancellation, which is explicitly forbidden—nothing should be shipped after a cancellation. This case has multiple violations.

The fourth case looks fine. The flow is receive, check inventory, cancel, close. This matches the expected path for insufficient inventory, so no violations here.

The fifth case is missing the packaging step entirely. The normative description states that items should be packaged after payment authorization and before shipping. Here, authorization is followed immediately by shipping, which skips the required packaging activity. This is a clear violation.

In summary, the cases that violate the process are 2, 3, and 5. Case 2 skips payment authorization before packaging. Case 3 authorizes payment before cancellation and ships after cancellation. Case 5 skips packaging before shipping.
