**Analysis and Anomalies Identification:**

**POWL Model 1 Anomalies:**  
1. **Severe Anomaly - Decision Before Interview:**  
   The model allows `Make_Hiring_Decision` to occur *before* `Conduct_Interviews` (via `Screen → Decide` and `Screen → Interview` edges). This violates the fundamental logic of hiring, as interviews must precede the final hiring decision.  
2. **Partial Order Issue:**  
   While `Screen_Candidates` is correctly placed after `Post_Job_Ad`, the lack of ordering between `Conduct_Interviews` and `Make_Hiring_Decision` introduces non-compliant process paths (e.g., hiring without interviewing).  

**POWL Model 2 Anomalies:**  
1. **Critical Anomaly - Interview Before Screening:**  
   The model permits `Conduct_Interviews` to execute *before* `Screen_Candidates` (via `Post → Interview` and `Post → Screen` edges), which is illogical. Screening is a prerequisite for interviews.  
2. **Critical Anomaly - Skipping Payroll:**  
   The `XOR` operator allows skipping `Add_to_Payroll`, a mandatory step. Omitting payroll would prevent employee payment, violating labor laws and process integrity.  
3. **Minor Anomaly - Redundant Onboarding Loop:**  
   The `LOOP` operator on `Onboard_Employee` allows unnecessary repetitions of onboarding, which is atypical but less severe.  

**Alignment with Normative Process:**  
**Model 1** more closely aligns with the standard Hire-to-Retire process. While it erroneously allows the hiring decision to precede interviews, it enforces the correct high-level sequence of `Post_Job_Ad → Screen_Candidates → ... → Close_Case`. In contrast, **Model 2** contains two critical flaws (interview/screening order and optional payroll) that fundamentally undermine the process.  

**Justification:**  
- **Model 1’s** anomaly allows *some* invalid paths (e.g., premature hiring decisions) but retains the core structure of the workflow. A compliant execution (screening → interviews → decision) is still possible.  
- **Model 2’s** anomalies permit *structurally invalid* executions (e.g., interviews without screening, omitting payroll), which are irreconcilable with the process’s purpose. These deviations risk legal non-compliance and operational failure, making Model 2 less viable.  

**Conclusion:**  
Model 1, despite its flaw, preserves the essential workflow sequence. Model 2’s violations are more severe and render the process non-functional in key areas.
