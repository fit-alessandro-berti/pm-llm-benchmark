This appears to be a business process model or workflow diagram using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) symbols. The process flow starts with an initial event (circle) and moves through several steps:

1. First is "register request"
2. The flow then splits (using XOR gateways shown as diamonds with X marks) into parallel paths that include:
   - "examine thoroughly"
   - "examine casually"
   - "check ticket"

3. These paths converge and lead to a "decide" activity

4. After the decision, the flow splits again into three possible outcomes:
   - "reject request"
   - "pay compensation"
   - "reinitiate request"

5. The process ends with a final event (bold circle)

The diagram uses standard BPMN notation including:
- Start and end events (circles)
- Activities (rounded rectangles)
- Gateway decision points (diamonds)
- Sequence flow arrows showing the direction of the process

This appears to be modeling some kind of request handling or claim processing workflow where requests can be approved, rejected, or reinitiated after examination.
