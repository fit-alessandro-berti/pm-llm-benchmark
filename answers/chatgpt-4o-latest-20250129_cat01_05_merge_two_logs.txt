### **Merged Event Log & Justification**

Here is the merged event log that integrates **Log A (System A)** and **Log B (System B)** while aligning similar events, resolving timestamp mismatches, and enriching records with additional attributes.

### **Justification & Approach**

#### **1. Event Matching Strategy**
- **Timestamp tolerance:** A tolerance of **2 seconds** was used to align events between Log A and Log B.
- **Event name mapping:**  
  - `"Order Received"` (A) → `"OrderReceived"` (B)  
  - `"Order Validated"` (A) → `"OrderValidation"` (B)  
  - `"Payment Processed"` (A) → `"PaymentCheck"` (B)  
  - `"Item Shipped"` (A) → `"Shipping"` (B)  
- **Order ID alignment:** Only `Order#1234` exists, making direct correlation possible.

#### **2. Handling of Timestamp Differences**
- In cases where timestamps were slightly off (≤2 seconds), the earlier timestamp was chosen for consistency.
- Example: `"Order Received"` in Log A (`10:00:00Z`) was adjusted to Log B’s (`09:59:58Z`) as the primary timestamp.

#### **3. Handling of Missing or Unique Events**
- `"Quality Check"` (10:03:00Z) from Log B had no equivalent in Log A. It was **included independently**.
- `"Item Delivered"` (10:20:00Z) was **present in Log A but missing from Log B**, so it was retained separately.

#### **4. Attribute Integration**
- **User ID & Resource ID:** Retained from Log B where available.
- **Notes:** Enriched from Log B when present.
- **Source Events:** Indicated whether each event was matched from both logs (`A & B`) or appeared in only one (`A only` or `B only`).

This approach ensures **chronological consistency, attribute enrichment, and accurate event alignment.**
