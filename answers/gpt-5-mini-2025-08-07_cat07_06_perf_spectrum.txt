This is a time-based flow diagram that shows how three event types are distributed over time and how occurrences of earlier events connect to later events.

What’s shown
- Horizontal axis is time (labels at about 2000-01-25, 2006-09-09 and 2013-04-24).
- There are three horizontal “lanes” (y-positions) for event types:
  - Top: “Send Fine”
  - Middle: “Insert Fine Notification”
  - Bottom: “Send for Credit Collection”
- Each thin vertical line in the top lane marks a single “Send Fine” event occurring at a particular date. Those top lane lines are dense and cover the full time span.
- Triangular, tapered ribbons connect individual events in earlier lanes to later events in lower lanes. The ribbons fan downwards from many earlier Send Fine (and/or notification) events into fewer, later collection events.
- Color and opacity encode intensity: pale grey ribbons show general flows, while red/pink ribbons highlight stronger or selected flows (darker red = more prominent/important connections).

Key patterns / interpretation
- “Send Fine” events occur continuously across the whole time range (very many vertical lines).
- “Insert Fine Notification” events and especially “Send for Credit Collection” events are more sparse and appear as distinct, localized clusters on the timeline.
- The fan-shaped ribbons indicate that many fines (and notifications) are aggregated into discrete credit-collection actions: a single collection event often links back to many earlier fines.
- Red tinted ribbons emphasize the specific flows that end in credit collection, showing which earlier fines/notifications contributed to those collection batches and the time lag between sending the fine and sending it to collection.

In short: the plot visualizes time, event type, and the many-to-few flows from initial fines through notifications to periodic credit-collection actions, with color/opacity showing flow strength.
