1. What strategic considerations led to the decision to source each critical component from a different country rather than consolidating suppliers in fewer regions?

2. How might geopolitical tensions or trade policy changes in any one supplier country disrupt the parallel component-securing activities, and what contingency plans exist to mitigate those disruptions?

3. In what ways could concurrent engineering or co-design with component suppliers shorten the cycle time between prototype design and component procurement?

4. What criteria determine whether a failed unit is reworked or scrapped during the quality-check gateway, and how are the long-term cost and brand-reputation impacts of that decision evaluated?

5. How is real-time data from the 24/7 assembly operation captured and visualized to trigger proactive maintenance or process adjustments before defects occur?

6. Given the parallel freight strategy (air versus sea), how are carbon footprint, cost, and delivery-speed trade-offs quantified and communicated to both internal and external stakeholders?

7. What risk-sharing or liability agreements are in place with logistics partners to handle delays, damage, or loss during international transport and customs clearance?

8. How does the company ensure that customs and regulatory compliance knowledge is kept current across multiple regions, and what mechanisms exist for rapid updates when regulations change?

9. In the distribution split, how are allocation decisions among retail, e-commerce, and VIP channels optimized to maximize margin and customer satisfaction simultaneously?

10. What performance indicators are tracked at each gateway (e.g., component availability, assembly yield, on-time delivery) to enable end-to-end visibility, and how are exceptions escalated?

11. How could advanced analytics or AI improve the accuracy of the “Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast” task, and what organizational changes would be required to act on those insights swiftly?

12. To what extent are ethical and sustainability criteria (e.g., labor standards, environmental impact) incorporated into supplier selection and auditing throughout the process?

13. How are knowledge and lessons learned from rework or scrap events fed back into the design and supplier-qualification phases to create a continuous-improvement loop?

14. What scenarios would trigger a strategic shift from a Malaysia-centric assembly plant to a multi-site or near-shoring model, and how would that affect cost and risk profiles?

15. How is cybersecurity managed when sharing sensitive demand-forecast and design information with geographically dispersed suppliers and logistics partners?

16. In the event of a pandemic or natural disaster that halts 24/7 assembly, what alternative manufacturing or postponement strategies could maintain supply continuity?

17. How are stakeholder expectations—ranging from investors to end-users—balanced when deciding between speed-to-market and cost optimization at each gateway?

18. What collaborative mechanisms (e.g., joint dashboards, war rooms, cross-functional squads) exist to resolve bottlenecks that span multiple gateways and functional silos?

19. How does the organization measure and reward the effectiveness of its risk-management practices across the supply chain, rather than just traditional efficiency metrics?

20. Looking ahead five years, what emerging technologies (e.g., additive manufacturing, blockchain traceability, autonomous freight) could fundamentally reshape one or more segments of this BPMN process, and how is the company preparing for that transformation?
