Below is a Python dictionary representing a **DECLARE model** for the given product design and launch process. The model includes constraints based on typical workflows in such processes, with **support = 1.0** (indicating the rule holds in all observed traces) and **confidence** values reflecting the strength of each constraint.

We'll define constraints for **existence**, **absence**, **exact occurrence**, **initiation**, and **temporal relations** (e.g., response, precedence, succession, etc.) based on logical dependencies in the process.

###  Notes on the Model:

- **`existence`**: All core activities are expected to occur, with varying confidence.
- **`init`**: The process always starts with `IG`.
- **`exactly_one`**: `IG` and `FL` typically occur once.
- **`response`/`precedence`/`succession`**: Enforce temporal order (e.g., `IG  DD`, `MP  FL`).
- **`chainresponse`/`chainprecedence`**: Enforce immediate succession (e.g., `AG  MP`, `MP  FL`).
- **`noncoexistence`**: Early activities (`IG`, `DD`) cannot coexist with final launch (`FL`).
- **`nonsuccession`**: Prevents invalid sequences (e.g., `FL` cannot be followed by anything).

This DECLARE model captures both **mandatory** and **probabilistic** constraints in a realistic product design and launch workflow. You can use this with **pm4py** for conformance checking or process discovery.
