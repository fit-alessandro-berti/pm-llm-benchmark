# Manufacturing Process Event Log Analysis

After examining the event log data, I've identified clear patterns that can be grouped into meaningful high-level manufacturing process steps. Here's my analysis:

## Identified High-Level Steps

### 1. Material Preparation
**Events included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:** These events represent the initial handling and preparation of the raw material. They occur in sequence at the beginning of the process, involve the same physical component (metal sheet), and prepare the material for subsequent processing. The events flow logically from retrieval to preparation for welding.

### 2. Welding & Assembly
**Events included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:** This group represents the core fabrication activities where the material is transformed through welding. These events are performed in close temporal proximity, involve the same tool type (welding equipment), and include the immediate quality check of the welding work. The measurement of weld integrity is included here as it's directly tied to the welding activity.

### 3. Finishing & Coating
**Events included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:** These events represent the surface treatment phase of the manufacturing process. They occur after the structural work is complete and involve applying and curing a protective layer. These steps are performed by specialized equipment (Coating Unit and Heating Unit) and form a distinct phase focused on product protection and appearance.

### 4. Final Quality Control
**Events included:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:** This represents the final verification before the product moves to the next stage. While this is currently a single event, it's conceptually distinct as it represents the final approval of the completed product and is performed by a dedicated quality control operator.

## Structured Representation of High-Level Activities

```

## Additional Observations

1. The process follows a consistent pattern across different cases (A1 and B2), suggesting these groupings would apply to the entire dataset.

2. The high-level activities follow a logical manufacturing sequence: preparation → assembly → finishing → quality control.

3. Each high-level activity tends to involve different resources or resource types, further supporting the natural boundaries between process steps.

4. The temporal clustering of events also supports these groupings, with clear time gaps between some activities.

This aggregation provides a more intuitive view of the manufacturing process while preserving the essential information about what happens at each stage. It transforms a detailed 12-step sequence into a more manageable 4-step process that better represents the conceptual workflow.
