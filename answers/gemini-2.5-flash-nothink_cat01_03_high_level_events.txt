Here's a proposal for grouping the low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps, along with justifications and proposed names.

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

Based on the provided event log, I've identified the following high-level process steps:

1.  **Material Handling & Preparation**
2.  **Primary Assembly (Welding)**
3.  **Intermediate Quality Inspection**
4.  **Surface Treatment & Curing**
5.  **Final Quality Verification**

### Detailed Grouping, Justification, and Naming

Here's a breakdown of each proposed high-level activity:

#### 1. Material Handling & Preparation

*   **Low-Level Events Grouped:**
    *   `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
    *   `Scan barcode`
    *   `Place metal sheet on table`
    *   `Align metal sheet`
    *   `Preheat metal sheet`

*   **Justification:**
    *   **Logical Cohesion:** These events collectively focus on getting the raw material (metal sheet) ready for the first major transformation (welding). They cover the initial physical retrieval, identification, positioning, precise alignment, and pre-processing (preheating) required before any fabrication work begins.
    *   **Temporal Proximity:** These events occur in close succession at the very beginning of each product's journey.
    *   **Resource Focus (Initial Setup):** While different resources are involved (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1), their combined actions are all geared towards setting up the material.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Material Handling & Preparation**
    *   *Alternative Names Considered:* Initial Setup, Raw Material Processing, Component Preparation.

#### 2. Primary Assembly (Welding)

*   **Low-Level Events Grouped:**
    *   `Pick up welding tool`
    *   `Weld corner A`
    *   `Weld corner B`

*   **Justification:**
    *   **Action-Oriented:** These events represent the core fabrication/assembly work being performed on the prepared metal sheet.
    *   **Tool and Skill Focus:** They involve the specific action of picking up a welding tool and then executing the welding task.
    *   **Resource Consistency:** All these actions are performed by "Operator B," indicating a dedicated role or workstation for this phase.
    *   **Sequential Dependence:** Picking up the tool is a direct prerequisite for the welding actions.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Primary Assembly (Welding)**
    *   *Alternative Names Considered:* Welding Process, Component Assembly, Fabrication.

#### 3. Intermediate Quality Inspection

*   **Low-Level Events Grouped:**
    *   `Measure weld integrity`

*   **Justification:**
    *   **Dedicated Quality Check:** This event is a clear and distinct quality control step specifically assessing the output of the preceding welding process.
    *   **Specialized Resource:** It's performed by a "Quality Sensor #1," highlighting its automated and objective nature.
    *   **Process Flow Break:** It often represents a point where a decision might be made (e.g., rework) before proceeding to the next major step. It's "intermediate" because it's not the final check.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Intermediate Quality Inspection**
    *   *Alternative Names Considered:* Weld Quality Check, Automated Quality Control.

#### 4. Surface Treatment & Curing

*   **Low-Level Events Grouped:**
    *   `Apply protective coating`
    *   `Dry coating`

*   **Justification:**
    *   **Thematic Cohesion:** Both events are directly related to applying and processing a surface treatment on the component. "Dry coating" is a necessary follow-up to "Apply protective coating."
    *   **Specialized Units:** They are performed by dedicated units ("Coating Unit #3" and "Heating Unit #2") that serve a similar purpose in surface finishing.
    *   **Post-Assembly/Pre-Final Inspection:** This step typically occurs after primary assembly and before any final comprehensive checks.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Surface Treatment & Curing**
    *   *Alternative Names Considered:* Coating Application, Finishing Process.

#### 5. Final Quality Verification

*   **Low-Level Events Grouped:**
    *   `Visual check`

*   **Justification:**
    *   **End-of-Process Check:** This is the last recorded event in the log for each case, indicating a final verification before completion or shipment.
    *   **Comprehensive Assessment:** A "visual check" often implies a general assessment of the finished product, encompassing all prior steps.
    *   **Human Oversight:** Performed by "Operator C," suggesting a final human gatekeeping step.

*   **Proposed Name:** **Final Quality Verification**
    *   *Alternative Names Considered:* Final Inspection, Product Verification, Outgoing Quality Check.
