Proposed HighLevel Activities (for each CaseID – e.g. A1, B2 – the same five steps apply)

1. StepName: Material Preparation  
   LowLevel Activities:  
     • Retrieve raw metal sheet  
     • Scan barcode  
     • Place metal sheet on table  
     • Align metal sheet  
     • Preheat metal sheet  
   Rationale:  
     These five events occur at the very start of the process, are temporally adjacent, all concern handling and readying the raw sheet, and involve the same resource types (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit). Together they form a coherent “preparation” phase before any assembly.

2. StepName: Welding Assembly  
   LowLevel Activities:  
     • Pick up welding tool  
     • Weld corner A  
     • Weld corner B  
   Rationale:  
     This group covers the core joining operations. Picking up the tool is preparatory to welding, and the two weld actions complete the assembly. They are performed by the same resource (Operator B) in a tight time window.

3. StepName: Weld Quality Check  
   LowLevel Activities:  
     • Measure weld integrity  
   Rationale:  
     Immediately after welding, a quality sensor checks the weld’s integrity. Although a single event, it represents a distinct inspection subphase focused solely on weld quality.

4. StepName: Coating Process  
   LowLevel Activities:  
     • Apply protective coating  
     • Dry coating  
   Rationale:  
     Once the weld is verified, the part receives its protective finish. The “apply” and “dry” steps are logically linked (same coating system chain) and temporally adjacent, forming the finishing operation.

5. StepName: Final Quality Inspection  
   LowLevel Activities:  
     • Visual check  
   Rationale:  
     A human operator performs a last visual inspection of the fully processed part. This standalone event closes out the workflow and verifies overall conformance.

Mapping Example for CaseID A1:  
 • Material Preparation: 20240301 08:00:05 … 08:00:20  
 • Welding Assembly: 08:01:00 … 08:01:10  
 • Weld Quality Check: 08:01:20  
 • Coating Process: 08:01:30 … 08:01:45  
 • Final Quality Inspection: 08:02:00

Same grouping and naming apply to CaseID B2 (timestamps slightly shifted).
