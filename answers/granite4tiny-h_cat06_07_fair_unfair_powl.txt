Here are two POWL models representing the hiring process described in the text. The first model includes a potential unfairness due to an XOR branch that gives a subtle advantage to applicants with community affiliations or local residency. The second model removes this unfairness by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation without any special treatment based on affiliation.

## 1 POWL Model With Potential Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities as defined in the process description
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")          # Loop node (for missing info)
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
# CommunityAffiliationCheck represents the XOR branch that can introduce bias
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Constructing the workflow with XOR branching for cultural fit evaluation
cultural_fit_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[cultural_fit_check])
x_or_branch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[community_affiliation_check, cultural_fit_loop])

root_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    data_completeness_check,
    request_more_info,
    skill_assessment,
    x_or_branch,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define a partial order specifying that some activities must precede others.
# Here we ensure that after SkillAssessment, the workflow can either go into XOR or CulturalFitCheck first.
root_model.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, x_or_branch)  # After skill assessment, choose path

# Example of adding silent transitions (no label) for missing info handling
root_model.add_silent_transition(data_completeness_check, request_more_info)

# Visual representation (for debugging / visualization purposes)
print("POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:")
print(root_model.to_dot())
```

**Explanation:**

- **Activities:** The model includes all stages described in the process, including `ReceiveApplication`, `DataCompletenessCheck`/`RequestMoreInfo` for completeness checks, `SkillAssessment`, and two XOR branches (`CommunityAffiliationCheck` vs. `CulturalFitCheck`).

- **XOR Branch (Unfairness Point):**  
  - One branch leads to `CommunityAffiliationCheck`, which gives a subtle advantage based on community membership.
  - The other branch leads directly to the standard `CulturalFitCheck`.

- **Partial Order:** Ensures that once skill assessment is completed, the system proceeds either into the XOR branching or continues with the cultural fit evaluation. This ordering helps illustrate where flexibility exists in the process.

## 2 POWL Model Without Unfairness

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities as defined in the simplified version of the process description
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")          # Loop node (for missing info)
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Constructing the workflow without any XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation
root_model_no_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    data_completeness_check,
    request_more_info,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define a partial order specifying that after SkillAssessment, the workflow proceeds with CulturalFitCheck.
root_model_no_unfairness.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)

# Example of adding silent transitions (no label) for missing info handling
root_model_no_unfairness.add_silent_transition(data_completeness_check, request_more_info)

# Visual representation (for debugging / visualization purposes)
print("\nPOWL Model Without Unfairness:")
print(root_model_no_unfairness.to_dot())
```

**Explanation:**

- **Simplified Workflow:** This model mirrors the original process but omits any XOR branch that might favor candidates with community affiliations.

- **Standard Cultural Fit Evaluation:** All applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck`, eliminating the potential bias introduced in the unfair model.

### Summary

- **Model 1** demonstrates a hiring process where an XOR choice can inadvertently create bias by giving preferential treatment to certain groups.
- **Model 2** simplifies the workflow to ensure fairness, removing any selective advantages based on affiliation or community ties. 

Both models use similar activity labels and structural elements (loops for completeness checks, sequential ordering) but differ fundamentally in how they handle cultural fit evaluation—highlighting the impact of such a choice on potential bias.
