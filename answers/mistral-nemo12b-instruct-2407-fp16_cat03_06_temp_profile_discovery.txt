Based on the provided process variants, I've created a temporal profile dictionary where each key is a tuple representing a couple of activities, and the value is a list containing the average time (in seconds) between those activities and its standard deviation. I've considered all directly following activity pairs in each trace.

Here's the generated temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): [(86400, 3600), (172800, 5400), (10800, 0), (10800, 0)],
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): [(3600, 3600), (3600, 3600), (7200, 4500), (10800, 0)],
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0), (3600, 3600), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0)],
    ('Create Fine', 'Payment'): [(10800, 0), (172800, 5400), (10800, 0)],
    ('Send Fine', 'Payment'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0), (10800, 0), (172800, 5400)],
    ('Create Fine', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'): [(10800, 0)],
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): [(3600, 3600), (10800, 0), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'): [(10800, 0), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Add penalty', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'): [(3600, 3600), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Notify Result Appeal to Offender'): [(10800, 0), (10800, 0)],
    ('Notify Result Appeal to Offender', 'Payment'): [(3600, 3600), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Send Appeal to Prefecture', 'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture'): [(10800, 0), (10800, 0)],
    ('Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture', 'Appeal to Judge'): [(3600, 3600), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Appeal to Judge', 'Payment'): [(10800, 0), (7200, 4500)],
    ('Send for Credit Collection', 'Payment'): [(10800, 0)],
}
```

This dictionary can be used to calculate deviations based on the given `ZETA` value. To get the average and standard deviation for each couple of activities, you can take the mean of the respective lists in the temporal profile dictionary.
