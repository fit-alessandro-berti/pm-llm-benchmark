Here is a self-contained DuckDB query that keeps every event **except** those that belong to a case which  

• contains the three consecutive activities  
  ‘Approve Purchase Requisition’  ‘Create Order’  ‘Confirm Order’ (in exactly that order, back-to-back, no other activity in between), **and**  
• where the time between the ‘Create Order’ and the immediately following ‘Confirm Order’ of that triple is more than five days.

```sql
-- ----------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Give every event a position number inside its own case
-- ----------------------------------------------------------
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_no
    FROM event_log
),

-- ----------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Look at every triple of *adjacent* events and keep the
--    cases that match the required pattern *and* timing rule
-- ----------------------------------------------------------
pattern_hits AS (
    SELECT
        o3.case_id
    FROM ordered  o3                                   -- current row  (seq_no  = n)
    JOIN ordered  o2 ON o2.case_id = o3.case_id
                   AND o2.seq_no  = o3.seq_no - 1      -- previous row (seq_no  = n-1)
    JOIN ordered  o1 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id
                   AND o1.seq_no  = o3.seq_no - 2      -- two rows back (seq_no = n-2)
    WHERE  o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND  o2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND  o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND  (o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY
),

-- ----------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Distinct list of cases that must be removed
-- ----------------------------------------------------------
cases_to_remove AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM pattern_hits
)

-- ----------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. Return every event that is *not* in one of those cases
-- ----------------------------------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_remove)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

Explanation of the steps  
1. `ordered` numbers the events of each case in their timestamp order; this gives us an unambiguous notion of “direct succession”.  
2. `pattern_hits` aligns three consecutive rows (`o1`, `o2`, `o3`) and keeps only those triples that match the exact activity pattern.  
   The extra condition `(o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY` enforces the “more than 5 days” rule between ‘Create Order’ and its succeeding ‘Confirm Order’.  
3. `cases_to_remove` isolates every `case_id` that produced at least one such triple.  
4. The final `SELECT` simply returns all events whose `case_id` is **not** in that list, thereby satisfying the requirement that the result set consist solely of cases that do **not** meet both the sequence and timing conditions.
