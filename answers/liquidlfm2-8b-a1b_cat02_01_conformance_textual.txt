**Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process**

---

### Step 1: Summary of Normative Process Flow

The normative process describes the ideal order handling flow as follows:

- **Receive order** (start)  
- **Check inventory** (before all decisions)  
- **Authorize payment** (upon confirmed inventory sufficiency)  
- **Package items** (after payment authorization)  
- **Ship order** (only after packaging)  
- **Close order** (final step in all cases)

Deviations that violate these dependencies are norm violations.

### Step 2: Detailed Case-by-Case Analysis

#### Case 1 (Case 1, ID #1)

- **Sequence:**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package  Ship  Close  

- **Analysis:**  
  This follows the expected logical order: inventory checked before payment, payment authorized, then packaging and shipping in sequence.  
  ** No violation.**

---

#### Case 2 (Case 2, ID #2)

- **Sequence:**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Package  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  

- **Violation:**  
  In the normative process, payment authorization must occur *after* inventory confirmation — which it does — but *patterns* imply that authorization should only happen *before* packaging, and payment authorization is typically paired with validation and securing funds, ideally after confirming inventory sufficiency and before packaging.

  However, the *key issue* is that **authorization occurs inside the fulfillment path**, which is acceptable **only if** it follows the checklist. But more critically, the sequence *fits the normative path*, since:

  - Inventory checked   
  - Authorization follows   
  - Package follows authorization   
  - Ship and close follow   

  So **no violation** — this aligns with expected behavior, though in reality, authorization *before* preparing packaging is unusual but not inherently incorrect unless rules strictly require prep first. Since the norm only requires authorization after inventory check (not necessarily before packaging), this sequence is acceptable.

  ** No violation.**

#### Case 3 (Case 3, ID #3)

- **Sequence:**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship  Close  

- **Violation(s):**  
  - At **Check inventory**, payment authorization occurs — this is acceptable provided inventory sufficiency is confirmed, so this step is procedurally valid.  
  - However, **after checking inventory, the process cancels the order**.  
  - **Then immediately ship order.**  
  - **Close order at the end.**

- The critical violation is that **“Ship order” occurs after cancellation** — but the normative model explicitly states shipment must only occur *after* packaging, never after cancellation. Moreover, **cancellation itself should follow the Check-Inventory step, but because it leads directly to shipment, this skips the standard preparation and packaging step.**

  More precisely, the logic implies:  
  > After inventory is checked and cancellation is triggered, **no packaging or shipping should take place**. Shipment is illogical post-cancellation, even if authorization occurred.

  Since the sequence includes shipment **after cancellation**, violating the core principle that *ship order only happens post-packaging and well before cancellation*. Also, shipment occurs *before* true closure is appropriate if the order is canceled — though closure is standard, the sequence *prior* to closure misplaces shipment.

  The canonical expected order:  
  Receive  Check  (Fulfill)  Cancel  Close  

  Ship is positioned incorrectly — it should come *after cancellation is finalized* and *only if fulfillment completed* — but here shipment follows cancellation, which violates flow logic.

  ** Violation:** Ship order occurs after cancellation, with shipment preceding final closure in a step that should be logically after fulfillment (which was interrupted). Since the process should end at Close, shipping before closure (and especially out of sequence with fulfillment) is illogical.

#### Case 4 (Case 4, ID #4)

- **Sequence:**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Ship  Close  

- **Violation:**  
  The process **cancels the order immediately after inventory check**, but *still proceeds to ship*.  
  While authorization may have been authorized (not shown, but implied prior to cancellation), **no inventory availability triggers fulfillment—or shipping**.  

  Normatively, **packaging and shipment are conditional on inventory sufficiency and must proceed sequentially after check and authorization**. Shipping without package preparation violates the process.  
  Additionally, cancellation followed by shipment implies preparation failed but shipment still occurred, violating causal logic.

  The normative assumes inventory sufficiency *must be confirmed* before any fulfillment steps. Canceling without fulfillment, then shipping, breaks the required dependency.

  ** Violation:** Proceeding with shipment after cancellation—especially after an inventory check—implies at least partial fulfillment or preparation, which did not occur.

---

#### Case 5 (Case 5, ID #5)

- **Sequence:**  
  Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship  Close  

- **Analysis:**  
  This follows the core correct path: check  payment authorizing  ship  close.  
  Authentication and payment are secured after inventory check, followed promptly by shipment — consistent with normative expectations.  
  ** No violation.**

### Step 3: Summary of Violations

| Case ID | Key Violation                                                                 | ExplanationBasedOnNormativeRules                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3      | Ship order **after** canceling a previously inventory-checked order          | Shipment after cancellation violates the norm: ship only after fulfillment preparation (packaging, shipping), never after reversal. Also, authorization (if applied) precedes cancellation; proceeding shipment invalidates flow logic. |
| 4      | Ship order **after** checking inventory and canceling, skipping package preparation | Payment authorization (if made) requires validated inventory; proceeding to ship without package packaging breaches the canonical fulfillment sequence of Check  Package  Ship. |
| 1, 2, 5  | No violations; sequences follow normative dependencies: Check  Authorize  Package (or Ship), then Close |

### Final Conclusion

**Violating Cases:**  
- **Case 3:** Ship order after canceling the order following inventory check — contradicts the expected fulfillment path by skipping packaging and shipping post-cancellation.  
- **Case 4:** Proceed with shipment after canceling, despite inventory check — violates causal dependency between inventory sufficiency and fulfillment activities.

**Ambiguities Considered:**  
- The exact threshold for "full fulfillment" (e.g., when exactly is packaging required?) is slightly ambiguous, but normatively, package items must follow authorization and precede ship — all respected.  
- The order of "authorize payment" and "check inventory" is fixed: authorization depends on inventory presence, so that dependency is clear.  
- Whether authorization can occur *after* cancellation (if prior checks passed) is contradictory; normatively, authorization (if done) happens *before* cancellation triggers.

### Final Answer

**Deviating Cases:** Case 3 and Case 4.

- **Case 3:** Ship order after canceling, justifying immediate shipment post-cancellation — violates the normative requirement to prepare and ship only after fulfillment steps are complete and inventory is confirmed.  
- **Case 4:** Proceed with shipment after cancellation despite prior inventory check — violates the causal order that shipment cannot occur once cancellation is initiated unless full preparation has happened, which it hasn’t.  

These deviations break the expected logical and procedural dependencies in the normative process.
