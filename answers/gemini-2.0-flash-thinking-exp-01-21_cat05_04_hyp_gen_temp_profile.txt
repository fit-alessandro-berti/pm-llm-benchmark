## Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive to Approve (R to P): Unusually Low Standard Deviation and Relatively Short Average Time.**
   - The average time of approximately 25 hours with a standard deviation of only 1 hour suggests a highly rigid and predictable process. This is unusual for a complex process like claim approval where variability is expected.

2. **Approve to Notify (P to N): Extremely Long Average Time and High Standard Deviation.**
   - An average delay of 7 days between approval and notification is excessively long. The high standard deviation (2 days) further indicates inconsistent notification timing, with some notifications happening quickly and others being significantly delayed.

3. **Assign to Close (A to C): Quick Closure After Assignment.**
   - An average of 2 hours between assignment and closure is surprisingly short. This raises concerns that claims might be closed prematurely after assignment without proper evaluation or approval steps.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (E to N): Very Short Average Time.**
   -  An average time of only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification is suspiciously rapid. This could imply an unrealistic process flow or that the 'Evaluate' and 'Notify' activities are not distinct steps or are highly automated and occur almost instantaneously.

## Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R to P (Low STDEV, Short AVG):**
   - **Hypothesis 1.1: Automated Approval for Specific Claim Types/Amounts:** Claims below a certain amount or of specific types (e.g., very low-value claims, or automatically approved claim types) might be automatically approved shortly after receipt, leading to a consistent and fast R to P time.
   - **Hypothesis 1.2: System Error in Time Recording:** The timestamps for 'P' activities might be incorrectly recorded or automatically generated shortly after 'R' in certain scenarios, causing artificially low variance and short times.

2. **P to N (Long AVG, High STDEV):**
   - **Hypothesis 2.1: Notification Backlog or Batch Processing:** Notifications might be processed in batches at specific intervals (e.g., end of day), causing delays.  Variable batch sizes or processing times could lead to high standard deviation.
   - **Hypothesis 2.2: Manual Notification Process Bottleneck:** The notification step might be manual and subject to resource availability or adjuster workload, causing delays and inconsistencies.
   - **Hypothesis 2.3: Conditional Notification Based on External Factors:** Notification might be triggered by external factors (e.g., system updates, postal service schedules) that introduce variability and potential delays.

3. **A to C (Quick Closure after Assign):**
   - **Hypothesis 3.1: Premature Closure of Invalid Claims:** Claims identified as invalid or duplicates upon assignment might be closed immediately without further processing.
   - **Hypothesis 3.2: System Error in Activity Recording (Skipped Steps):**  Evaluation and Approval steps might be occurring but not recorded in the `claim_events` table for certain claims, leading to a direct and quick A to C transition in the logged data.
   - **Hypothesis 3.3: Incorrect Activity Mapping:** The 'Close' activity might be incorrectly triggered or mapped in the system workflow after assignment in specific scenarios.

4. **E to N (Very Short AVG):**
   - **Hypothesis 4.1: Automated Notification Triggered by Evaluation:** The system might automatically trigger a notification immediately upon completion of the evaluation activity, making the time interval appear artificially short.
   - **Hypothesis 4.2: Misinterpretation of 'Evaluate' Activity:** The 'Evaluate' activity might be a very brief, preliminary check rather than a comprehensive evaluation, followed immediately by notification in standard workflows.
   - **Hypothesis 4.3: System Time Synchronization Issue:**  The timestamps for 'E' and 'N' activities might be recorded with very high precision, and if system clocks are not perfectly synchronized, it could lead to near-zero or unrealistically short time differences.

## Verification Approaches using SQL Queries

**1. Verification for R to P Anomalies:**

   **Query 1.1 (Automated Approval - Claim Amount):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_type,
       c.claim_amount,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_event.timestamp - r_event.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events r_event ON c.claim_id = r_event.claim_id AND r_event.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events p_event ON c.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_event.timestamp - r_event.timestamp)) < (3600 + 600) -- AVG + 1 STDEV
   ORDER BY r_to_p_duration_seconds;
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Identify claims with unusually short R to P durations (within 1 STDEV above average).  Examine `claim_type` and `claim_amount` to see if lower amounts or specific types are associated with fast approvals.

   **Query 1.2 (Automated Approval - Missing Evaluation):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events r_event ON c.claim_id = r_event.claim_id AND r_event.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events p_event ON c.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events e_event
       WHERE e_event.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e_event.activity = 'E'
       AND e_event.timestamp BETWEEN r_event.timestamp AND p_event.timestamp
   )
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_event.timestamp - r_event.timestamp)) < (3600 + 600); -- within 1 STDEV above average
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Find claims with short R to P durations where the 'Evaluate' activity is missing between 'Receive' and 'Approve'. This could indicate skipped evaluation due to automation.

**2. Verification for P to N Anomalies:**

   **Query 2.1 (Notification Backlog - Long Delay):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - p_event.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events p_event ON c.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events n_event ON c.claim_id = n_event.claim_id AND n_event.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - p_event.timestamp)) > (604800 + 2 * 172800) -- AVG + 2 STDEV
   ORDER BY p_to_n_duration_seconds DESC;
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Identify claims with excessively long P to N durations (more than 2 STDEVs above average). This helps pinpoint potential backlog instances.

   **Query 2.2 (Notification Bottleneck - Adjuster/Region Correlation):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       a.region,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - p_event.timestamp))) AS avg_p_to_n_duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events p_event ON c.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events n_event ON c.claim_id = n_event.claim_id AND n_event.activity = 'N'
   JOIN adjusters a ON p_event.resource = CAST(a.adjuster_id AS VARCHAR) -- Assuming resource is adjuster_id as string
   GROUP BY a.region
   ORDER BY avg_p_to_n_duration_seconds DESC;
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Investigate if certain adjuster regions are associated with longer average P to N durations, suggesting regional bottlenecks or resource constraints. (Adapt `JOIN` if 'resource' column represents something other than adjuster ID).

**3. Verification for A to C Anomalies:**

   **Query 3.1 (Premature Closure - Quick A to C):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_event.timestamp - a_event.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events a_event ON c.claim_id = a_event.claim_id AND a_event.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events c_event ON c.claim_id = c_event.claim_id AND c_event.activity = 'C'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_event.timestamp - a_event.timestamp)) < (7200 + 3600) -- AVG + 1 STDEV
   ORDER BY a_to_c_duration_seconds;
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Find claims with short A to C durations (within 1 STDEV above average). These are candidates for premature closures.

   **Query 3.2 (Premature Closure - Missing Evaluation and Approval):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events a_event ON c.claim_id = a_event.claim_id AND a_event.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events c_event ON c.claim_id = c_event.claim_id AND c_event.activity = 'C'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_event.timestamp - a_event.timestamp)) < (7200 + 3600) -- within 1 STDEV above average
   AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events e_event
       WHERE e_event.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e_event.activity = 'E'
       AND e_event.timestamp BETWEEN a_event.timestamp AND c_event.timestamp
   )
   AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events p_event
       WHERE p_event.claim_id = c.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
       AND p_event.timestamp BETWEEN a_event.timestamp AND c_event.timestamp
   );
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Identify claims with short A to C durations where both 'Evaluate' and 'Approve' activities are missing between 'Assign' and 'Close'. Strongly suggests skipped steps.

**4. Verification for E to N Anomalies:**

   **Query 4.1 (Rapid Notification - Short E to N):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - e_event.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_duration_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e_event ON c.claim_id = e_event.claim_id AND e_event.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events n_event ON c.claim_id = n_event.claim_id AND n_event.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - e_event.timestamp)) < (300 + 60) -- AVG + 1 STDEV
   ORDER BY e_to_n_duration_seconds;
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Find claims with short E to N durations (within 1 STDEV above average). These claims are candidates for rapid or automated notification processes.

   **Query 4.2 (Rapid Notification - Approval Order):**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e_event ON c.claim_id = e_event.claim_id AND e_event.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events n_event ON c.claim_id = n_event.claim_id AND n_event.activity = 'N'
   LEFT JOIN claim_events p_event ON c.claim_id = p_event.claim_id AND p_event.activity = 'P'
   AND p_event.timestamp BETWEEN e_event.timestamp AND n_event.timestamp -- Approval between E and N
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_event.timestamp - e_event.timestamp)) < (300 + 60) -- within 1 STDEV above average
   AND p_event.event_id IS NULL; -- No Approval between E and N
   ```
   * **Purpose:** Identify claims with short E to N durations where 'Approve' (P) is missing or does not occur between 'Evaluate' and 'Notify'. This might indicate that approval is skipped or happens after notification in these rapid cases.

These queries are designed to be starting points for investigating the anomalies. Further analysis might involve combining query results, examining `additional_info` fields, and refining queries based on initial findings. Remember to adjust the STDEV multiples in the `WHERE` clauses to explore different levels of deviation from the average.
