Sure, I'd be happy to help describe the process underlying this data. Based on the information provided, it appears that this process is related to the approval and payment of declarations or claims submitted by employees in an organization. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE**: An employee saves a declaration or claim, which is the initial step in the process.

2. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**: The employee then submits the declaration for approval. At this stage, the declaration can be approved by different roles such as PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, or SUPERVISOR. It can also be rejected by the EMPLOYEE, PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR. In some cases, the declaration may be sent back to the employee for further clarification or modification.

3. **Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, or ADMINISTRATION**: The declaration is sent to the appropriate role for approval. If it's approved, the process moves to the next step. If it's rejected, it goes back to the employee or to a different role for further review.

4. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or PRE_APPROVER**: Once approved by any of these roles, the declaration moves to the FINAL_APPROVED stage by the SUPERVISOR. However, it can still be rejected by the SUPERVISOR, in which case it goes back to the employee or to a different role for review.

5. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: If the SUPERVISOR approves the declaration, it moves to the next stage, which is either Request Payment or Payment Handled. However, in rare cases, the declaration can still be rejected by MISSING (which might indicate a system error or a missing step in the process), in which case it goes back to the employee for resubmission.

6. **Request Payment**: After the FINAL_APPROVAL by the SUPERVISOR, a payment request is made. The frequency and performance data suggest that this step is usually successful, but in some cases, the declaration can be rejected by MISSING, and the process goes back to the employee for resubmission.

7. **Payment Handled**: Once the payment request is processed, the
