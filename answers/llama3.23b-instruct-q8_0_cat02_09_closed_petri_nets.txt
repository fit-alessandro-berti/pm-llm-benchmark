Here are three proposed concepts that can be considered as opposites or extensions of each listed concept in Petri nets:

1. Opposite of a Source Place:
**Sink Place**: A sink place is the opposite of a source place in the sense that it represents an outcome of a marking in the net, rather than a starting point. In contrast to a source place, which has a number of outgoing transitions (firing paths), a sink place has only one or no incoming transition(s). This concept highlights the distinction between places that have multiple firing paths and those that represent terminating or end conditions.

2. Opposite of an Immediate Transition:
** Delayed Transition**: An immediate transition is a transition in Petri nets where it holds one token (i.e., firing immediately after marking its associated places). In contrast, a **delayed transition**, also known as a 'simplified place transition', only requires the presence of at least two tokens on all associated places and still allows for further processing before actually firing off. It can be an abstraction to simplify Petri nets while preserving their behaviors.

3. Opposite of a Live Transition:
**Dead Transition**: A live transition corresponds to an unconditional transition in Petri Nets that occurs without restrictions (i.e., it does not depend on the availability of tokens or places). On the other hand, a dead transition is one whose firing depends on its preconditions being fulfilled by other parts of the net. This contrasts with live transitions where there are more control over when to fire the transition.

4. Opposite of a Bounded Net:
**Unbounded Net**: A bounded Petri net has an upper bound to the number of tokens it can contain, generally represented as a fixed or limited size. In contrast to that, an unbounded Petri net (also known as 'infinite petri net'), does not provide any constraints or limits on how many tokens are allowed within it. The presence of unbound tokens would thus indicate that the system is able to handle infinite data sets.

5. Opposite of a Free Choice Net:
**Forced Choice Net**: A free choice Petri net represents different paths, with each node offering multiple destinations (or choices) based on current nodes' token states. In contrast, an unbound net doesn't allow user-defined control but instead has its rules laid out by the design itself and is forced to operate within those set limitations when a condition is met.
