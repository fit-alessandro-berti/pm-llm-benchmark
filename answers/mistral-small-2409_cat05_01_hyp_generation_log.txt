The task is to analyze the given event log data in the `order_event_log` table and identify anomalies or undesirable behaviors. Additionally, the model should hypothesize why these anomalies might occur and propose relevant SQL queries to investigate these hypotheses further.

### Anomalies and Hypotheses

#### Anomaly 1: Out-of-Order Events
- **Example:** Case 1002 has the "Confirm Shipment" event before "Register Order".
- **Hypothesis:** There might be a data entry error or a system bug that allows events to be logged out of order.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND timestamp < (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = oel.case_id AND activity = 'Register Order');
  ```

#### Anomaly 2: Missing Events
- **Example:** Case 1004 does not have "Perform Credit Check" or "Validate Stock" events.
- **Hypothesis:** These steps might have been skipped due to a process oversight or an exception that was not logged.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity
  FROM order_event_log oel
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
  ) e ON oel.case_id = e.case_id
  WHERE e.case_id IS NULL;
  ```

#### Anomaly 3: Late Confirmation
- **Example:** Case 1003 has a "Confirm Shipment" event after the "Ship Goods" event.
- **Hypothesis:** This could be due to a delay in the confirmation process or a manual correction after the fact.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.timestamp AS confirm_timestamp, oel2.timestamp AS ship_timestamp
  FROM order_event_log oel1
  JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
  WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND oel2.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND oel1.timestamp > oel2.timestamp;
  ```

#### Anomaly 4: Invoice Before Payment
- **Example:** Case 1004 has an "Issue Invoice" event before "Receive Payment".
- **Hypothesis:** This might be due to a pre-payment requirement or an invoicing error.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.timestamp AS invoice_timestamp, oel2.timestamp AS payment_timestamp
  FROM order_event_log oel1
  JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
  WHERE oel1.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND oel2.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND oel1.timestamp > oel2.timestamp;
  ```

### Investigative Queries

#### Investigate Resource Performance
- **Hypothesis:** Certain resources might be consistently involved in anomalies.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
    AND timestamp NOT BETWEEN (
      SELECT MIN(timestamp)
      FROM order_event_log
      WHERE activity = 'Register Order'
    ) AND (
      SELECT MAX(timestamp)
      FROM order_event_log
      WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
    )
  )
  GROUP BY resource
  ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC;
  ```

#### Investigate Missing Events
- **Hypothesis:** Certain order types or customers might have more missing events.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT o.order_type, o.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS missing_events
  FROM orders o
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
    FROM order_event_log
  ) e ON o.case_id = e.case_id
  WHERE e.activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
  GROUP BY o.order_type, o.customer_id
  ORDER BY missing_events DESC;
  ```

These queries should help in identifying and investigating the anomalies in the order event log data.
