### 1. Cases Violating Normative Rules

Only **Case 2** violates the strict normative rules. The other cases (1 and 3) fully comply with the required sequence and constraints.

- **Case 2 Violations**:
  - **Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check**: The log shows Risk Assessment at 08:20 followed by Credit Check at 09:00. This directly violates the ordering rule that *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment*. The process skipped the mandatory order.
  - **Finalize Documentation after Loan Decision (Rejected)**: After the loan was rejected at 09:30, Finalize Documentation was still performed at 10:00. This is explicitly not allowed: if the loan is rejected, documentation must not be finalized (the case should close without this step).

These are severe violations of the normative process constraints (wrong sequence and contradictory action based on decision outcome).

- **Case 1**: Fully compliant. All steps follow the exact required sequence: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. No skips, reversals, or contradictory actions.
- **Case 3**: Fully compliant with normative rules. The sequence is correct, and since the decision was Approved, Finalize Documentation properly occurs before Close Case.

### 2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices)

Desiderata are non-mandatory recommendations. Deviations from them are not severe violations but indicate suboptimal or less efficient process execution.

- **Case 1**: Fully meets all mentioned desiderata.
  - Credit Check performed quickly (30 minutes after application).
  - Inform Applicant done promptly (2 hours after decision).
  - A Follow-up Call is not explicitly mentioned, but since none of the cases show one and Case 1 has no noted issues, we assume it either occurred (off-log) or the desideratum is satisfied overall.

- **Case 2**: While it has severe normative violations, it does not show clear desiderata issues in timing (steps are relatively prompt). No Follow-up Call is logged, but this is a minor recommended practice.

- **Case 3**: Fails to meet several desiderata:
  - **Credit Check delayed**: Performed ~49 hours after Application Received (from Jan 12 09:00 to Jan 14 10:00), exceeding the recommended short window (e.g., within 24 hours).
  - **Inform Applicant delayed**: Performed ~51 hours after Loan Decision (from Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 15:00), exceeding the recommended prompt notification (e.g., within 48 hours).
  - **No Follow-up Call**: Explicitly noted as missing. This is encouraged before closing the case but not strictly required.

These deviations in Case 3 represent suboptimal behavior (delays reduce efficiency and customer experience), but they do not constitute serious normative breaches.

### 3. Possible Interpretations or Justifications

- **Case 1**: Ideal execution. Everything follows both normative rules and desiderata closely. This could represent a standard, efficient handling of a straightforward approval case with no complications.

- **Case 2**: The out-of-order steps (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might suggest human error, system glitch, or an attempt to expedite a high-risk case by starting assessment early—perhaps due to preliminary flags in the application. The erroneous Finalize Documentation after rejection could be an automated workflow error or oversight (e.g., a template process that always includes documentation regardless of outcome). Overall, this appears to be sloppy or mistaken process execution rather than intentional deviation.

- **Case 3**: The delays (Credit Check ~2 days later, Inform Applicant ~2 days after decision) could be justified by weekends (Jan 12 was a Friday; Jan 13–14 weekend), staff availability, or backlog. The long gap to Inform Applicant might reflect additional internal reviews for a borderline approval. The missing Follow-up Call could be deemed unnecessary in this case (e.g., applicant was already responsive, or it was handled via email instead). These are plausible real-world operational constraints that explain why recommended timelines were not met, without compromising the core normative sequence.
