### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

#### **Metrics to Focus On**
To analyze the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers, I would focus on the following metrics derived from the event log data:
- **Workload Distribution:** Measure the number of tickets handled by each agent or tier over time (daily/weekly/monthly). This helps identify underutilized or overloaded agents.
- **Activity Processing Times:** Calculate the average time spent per ticket by each agent/tier for specific activities (e.g., "Work L1 Start" to "Work L1 End"). Compare these across tiers to identify inefficiencies.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate (FCR):** Track the percentage of tickets resolved at L1 without escalation. A low FCR indicates inefficiencies in L1 support.
- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:** Analyze how often agents handle tickets requiring specific skills (e.g., "App-CRM," "Networking-Firewall"). This reveals whether specialized skills are being underused or misapplied.
- **Escalation and Reassignment Rates:** Measure the frequency of escalations and reassignments within and between tiers. High rates suggest mismatches in initial assignments or insufficient skill alignment.
- **SLA Compliance:** Correlate SLA breaches with specific agents, tiers, or ticket attributes to pinpoint problematic areas.

#### **Process Mining Techniques**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Use social network analysis (SNA) to map handovers between agents and tiers. For instance, frequent handovers between L1 and L2 for certain ticket categories may indicate inefficiencies in initial assignment logic.
- **Role Discovery:** Identify implicit roles based on actual behavior rather than formal hierarchy. For example, some L1 agents might consistently handle tasks requiring advanced skills, effectively operating as L2 specialists.
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare process variants (e.g., tickets resolved at L1 vs. those escalated multiple times) to understand deviations from the intended workflow. Variants with excessive reassignments can highlight systemic issues.
- **Skill Utilization Analysis:** Cross-reference agent skills with the required skills for resolved tickets. This identifies whether specialized skills are being used optimally or wasted on simpler tasks.

#### **Comparison to Intended Logic**
The current assignment logic appears to rely on round-robin distribution within tiers and manual escalation decisions. Process mining can reveal discrepancies, such as:
- Tickets assigned to agents lacking the required skills, leading to reassignments.
- Delays caused by assigning high-priority tickets to agents already handling complex cases.
- Over-reliance on L2/L3 specialists for tasks that could be handled by L1 agents.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

#### **Bottleneck Identification**
Using the metrics and techniques above, bottlenecks can be identified as follows:
- **Insufficient Availability of Specialized Agents:** Analyze tickets requiring rare skills (e.g., "Database-SQL") to determine if delays correlate with limited availability of qualified agents.
- **Frequent Reassignments/Escalations:** Quantify the average delay introduced per reassignment (e.g., "Assign L2" to "Work L2 Start"). For example, if reassignments add an average of 45 minutes per ticket, this directly impacts SLA compliance.
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments:** Track cases where tickets are reassigned immediately after creation due to mismatched skills or inappropriate prioritization. For instance, P2 tickets routed to L1 agents may lead to unnecessary escalations.
- **Underperforming/Overloaded Agents:** Identify agents with abnormally high processing times or ticket volumes compared to peers. Overloaded agents may contribute to SLA breaches, while underperformers may need additional training.

#### **Impact Quantification**
- **Average Delay per Reassignment:** Calculate the mean time difference between "Reassign" and "Assign" events.
- **Percentage of SLA Breaches Linked to Skill Mismatch:** Correlate SLA breaches with tickets reassigned due to incorrect skill assignments.
- **Cost of Escalations:** Estimate the financial impact of excessive escalations by analyzing resource costs and resolution times.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Deficient Assignment Rules:** Round-robin assignment ignores workload and skill requirements, leading to mismatches.
- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:** Agent skill profiles may not reflect their true capabilities or recent training updates.
- **Poor Initial Categorization:** Ambiguous ticket descriptions or incorrect categorization result in incorrect skill requirements.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Dispatchers lack insight into agent availability and workload, causing inefficient assignments.
- **Insufficient L1 Training:** L1 agents escalate too many tickets because they lack the skills or confidence to resolve them.

#### **Process Mining Insights**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare smooth workflows (e.g., direct resolution at L1) with problematic ones (e.g., multiple reassignments). Identify common factors in problematic flows, such as specific ticket categories or agent groups.
- **Decision Mining:** Extract decision rules from historical data to understand why certain tickets were escalated or reassigned. For example, do all "Security-IAM" tickets get escalated regardless of complexity?

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing**
- **Issue Addressed:** Mismatches between ticket requirements and agent skills.
- **Leveraging Insights:** Use skill utilization analysis to prioritize agents with the exact required skills.
- **Data Required:** Agent skill profiles, ticket required skills, real-time queue status.
- **Expected Benefits:** Reduced reassignments, faster resolution times, improved SLA compliance.

#### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**
- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution.
- **Leveraging Insights:** Incorporate workload metrics (e.g., active tickets per agent) into the assignment logic.
- **Data Required:** Current ticket assignments, agent capacity thresholds, historical processing times.
- **Expected Benefits:** Balanced workloads, reduced SLA breaches, better resource utilization.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Machine Learning**
- **Issue Addressed:** Poor initial categorization and skill identification.
- **Leveraging Insights:** Train a model on historical data to predict required skills and complexity based on ticket attributes (e.g., description keywords).
- **Data Required:** Historical ticket data, including descriptions, categories, priorities, and resolutions.
- **Expected Benefits:** Fewer initial misassignments, proactive escalation prevention.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

#### **Simulation**
- **Approach:** Use business process simulation tools (e.g., Celonis, Disco) to model the impact of proposed strategies. Simulate scenarios like increased ticket volume or changes in agent availability.
- **Outcome Metrics:** Measure simulated improvements in SLA compliance, resolution times, and reassignment rates.

#### **Implementation Plan**
- **Pilot Testing:** Roll out one strategy (e.g., skill-based routing) in a controlled environment to validate effectiveness.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collect feedback from agents and stakeholders to refine the approach.

#### **Monitoring Dashboard**
Track the following KPIs continuously:
- **SLA Compliance Rate:** Percentage of tickets resolved within SLA timelines.
- **Reassignment Rate:** Number of tickets reassigned per day/week.
- **Agent Utilization:** Average workload per agent/tier.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate:** Percentage of tickets resolved at L1.
