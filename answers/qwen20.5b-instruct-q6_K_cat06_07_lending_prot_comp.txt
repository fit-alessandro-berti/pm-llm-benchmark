Based on the details you provided, there seem to be several key differences in the processes and their outcomes:

- **Unprotected group**:
  - Requests are made without the need for an application or signature.
  - The most common outcome is rejection of the request, with a higher frequency than those involving protected groups.

- **Protected group (i.e., requests to set appointments)**
  - Typically involves additional documentation such as a physical presence and an assessment by an attorney. The outcomes are typically more structured, including a signed document to establish the loan amount and date, and confirmation that it is acceptable for underwriter review.

- **Request Appointment Process with Signature required (e.g., set appointment) -> Set appointment -> Hand in Credit application (frequency: 17  performance: 330002.647)**
  - In this process, an attorney must sign the loan agreement to formally authorize a request.
  
- **Request Appointment Process without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application (frequency: 15  performance: 390019.000)**
  - While a legal document is not necessary, it still requires an attorney to sign the loan agreement.

- **Request Appointment with no signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter (frequency: 15  performance: 349945.923)**
  - Similar to the previous process, an attorney is involved during this phase of the loan application.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit To Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter (frequency: 183  performance: 390000.066)**
  - In this case, the attorney is involved, but also a physical visit with the borrower.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Make Visit To Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter (frequency: 183  performance: 390000.066)**
  - While an attorney is involved, this time a visit to the borrower's physical location is also part of the process.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Make Visit To Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter (frequency: 188  performance: 390004.777)**
  - This is similar to the previous process but includes a request for a visit.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit To Assess Colatteral -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency: 12  performance: 439983.167)**
  - This involves the loan agreement being signed by the borrower and a physical visit.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit To Assess Colatteral -> Confirm Underwriter Review (frequency: 5  performance: 439916.000)**
  - In this phase, the borrower is given the option to confirm the loan amount and date before a review by an attorney.

- **Request Appointment without Signature required -> Set appointment -> Hand in credit application -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter (frequency: 12  performance: 439887.000)**
  - This process involves the loan agreement being signed and a physical visit before a review.

In summary, while all processes involve requesting a loan through an attorney, each differs in their specific requirements, outcomes, and structure, reflecting differences in the roles and functions of attorneys within legal structures.
