1) How are insights from market research translated into specific design requirements and manufacturability constraints at the prototype stage, and who arbitrates trade-offs among desirability, feasibility, and viability?

2) At what point are key component suppliers (microprocessors, camera modules, OLEDs, sensors/memory) engaged in co-design, and how are IP sharing, sample lead times, and joint yield-improvement plans governed?

3) Why is component procurement executed in parallel rather than sequenced, and how are heterogeneous lead times synchronized to avoid stranded inventory or idle assembly capacity?

4) What is the sourcing strategy for each critical component (single, dual, or multi-source), and how are time-to-recover, geographic concentration, supplier financial health, and quality variability quantified in that decision?

5) How are geopolitical, export-control, and tariff risks monitored across source and assembly countries, and what predefined triggers shift volumes to alternate suppliers or geographies?

6) What logistics and trade structures (Incoterms, bonded/FTZ usage, consolidation strategies, packaging/handling specs, insurance) govern inbound component flows to Malaysia, and how are scenarios like port closures or pandemics stress-tested?

7) How is 24/7 assembly capacity planned (line balancing, OEE targets, preventive maintenance windows, labor scheduling), and under what conditions do you invest in automation versus additional shifts or lines?

8) What decision rules differentiate rework from scrap at quality gates, and how is defect data fed back in real time to adjust processes, drive supplier corrective actions, and inform design changes?

9) How can packaging and labeling be postponed or modularized to enable late-stage localization (regulatory marks, languages), reduce SKU proliferation, deter counterfeits (serialization), and minimize rework at distribution centers?

10) Beyond demand urgency, how do you decide between air and ocean freight (cost-to-serve, lead-time commitments, launch windows, carbon footprint), and when do you reroute or reallocate in-transit inventory?

11) How are regulatory and product certifications (FCC, CE, PSE, KC, RoHS/REACH, battery transport) embedded upstream to avoid border delays, and what governance manages late regulatory changes without halting shipments?

12) How are multi-echelon inventory targets set across RDCs (service levels, safety stock, seasonality, lead-time variability), and what allocation rules govern constrained supply across regions and channels?

13) When retailer, e-commerce, and VIP/pre-order demands conflict, how is allocation prioritized, who decides, and how are trade-offs communicated to maintain trust and brand equity?

14) What data and models power inventory and sales monitoring (demand sensing, causal ML, near-real-time signals), how is forecast bias quantified, and how do insights loop back to procurement and capacity planning?

15) What thresholds and constraints trigger “adjust orders to suppliers” versus “proceed to next cycle” (confidence intervals, MOQ/MPQ, contractual penalties), and how do you dampen bullwhip effects during rapid demand shifts?

16) What cross-functional operating rhythm (S&OP/IBP cadence, control tower, escalation playbooks) ensures timely communication among R&D, procurement, logistics, QA, compliance, sales, and customer support?

17) How are supply chain security risks mitigated (counterfeit components, tampering, IP leakage, cyberattacks on EDI/APIs), and what traceability mechanisms validate component provenance and firmware integrity end-to-end?

18) How are sustainability goals embedded into decisions (Scope 3 emissions, ethical sourcing of minerals, labor standards), and how are trade-offs among speed, cost, and ESG performance resolved?

19) What is the reverse logistics strategy (returns, repair, refurbish, recycle), and how do RMA and field-failure analytics inform design-for-reliability, supplier scorecards, and warranty policies?

20) Which end-to-end KPIs define success (cash-to-cash, OTIF/perfect order, yield/FPY/DPPM, cost-to-serve, time-to-recover), how are targets cascaded to teams and incentives, and what leading indicators trigger proactive intervention?
