If you look at the span from the first “Submit Claim” to the final “Close Claim”, the cases break down as follows:

- Case2001 (A, Low): 09:0010:30 on 20240401, ~1½hours.
- Case2004 (B, Low): 09:2010:45 on 20240401, ~1¼hours.

These lowcomplexity cases flow straight through without any rework.

- Case2002 (B, Medium): 09:05 on 2024040111:00 on 20240402, ~26hours. One “Request Additional Documents” on the first afternoon pushes approval into the next day.
- Case2003 (A, High): 09:10 on 2024040109:30 on 20240403, just under 48hours. Two separate document requests on 20240401, with approval not until the following afternoon.
- Case2005 (B, High): 09:25 on 2024040114:30 on 20240404, a little over 3days. Three rounds of “Request Additional Documents” spread over three days before approval.

Cases 2002, 2003 and especially 2005 are significantly longer than the quick, lowcomplexity flows.

Correlating that with the attributes:

- **Complexity** has the strongest signal: both highcomplexity cases (2003, 2005) have multiple “Request Additional Documents” loops and take 2–3days. The medium case (2002) has one document request and takes ~1day. The lowcomplexity cases have no rework and complete within a couple of hours.
- **Region/Resource** differences appear in how the highcomplexity work is handled. RegionA’s highcomplexity case (2003) handled by Adjuster_Mike generated two document requests on day1 and was approved late on day2. RegionB’s highcomplexity case (2005) handled by Adjuster_Lisa generated three document requests spanning three days before approval on day4, making it the slowest. Adjuster_Lisa’s medium case (2002) also needed extra documents. This suggests that in RegionB, or with this adjuster, highcomplexity claims may be escalated more cautiously, leading to more backandforth.
- **Manager** assignment also differs by complexity: low/medium cases are approved by Manager_Ann on the same or next morning, whereas highcomplexity cases go to Manager_Bill and sit longer before approval. That could be workload/capacity or additional scrutiny on highrisk claims rather than a root cause per se.

Finance and CSR steps are relatively prompt once approval is given, so the bottlenecks are in evaluation and approval of highercomplexity claims.

Based on this, plausible root causes for the extended durations are:

- More complex claims legitimately require more documentation and reviews, leading to multiple “Request Additional Documents” cycles.
- The way those cycles are managed in RegionB/by Adjuster_Lisa is resulting in more iterations and a longer elapsed time than in RegionA.
- Highcomplexity approvals are routed to Manager_Bill, whose queue or review process may add a day or more.

To mitigate these issues you could:

- Introduce checklists/templates for highcomplexity claims to reduce the number of separate document requests; aim to collect all needed evidence in one go.
- Triaging highcomplexity cases to adjusters with deep expertise or giving additional training to Adjuster_Lisa to tighten the evaluation and documentation request process.
- Set SLAs around document request turnaround and monitor rework loops, especially in RegionB, to identify and address capacity or process issues.
- Balance approval workload or provide additional support to the manager handling complex cases to shorten the approval wait once documentation is complete.
