This is a business process model diagram (appears to be in BPMN - Business Process Model and Notation format) that illustrates an order fulfillment process across multiple organizational swim lanes.

The diagram is divided into 4 horizontal swim lanes representing different organizational units or roles:

1. **Order** (top lane): Contains the main order processing flow, including:
   - Check customer's order subprocess
   - Activities for checking order completeness and adding customers to the database
   - Sending order details and creating draft invoices

2. **Production** (second lane): Shows the production workflow with:
   - Plan production and Manufacture product activities
   - Decision points for material availability
   - Connection to order details from the Order lane

3. **Procurement** (third lane): Handles material procurement with:
   - Material Compensation Subprocess containing order and return materials activities
   - Check materials activity
   - Order cancellation endpoint

4. **Warehouse** (bottom lane): Manages product shipping with:
   - Send product activity
   - Product completion and sending endpoints

The diagram uses standard BPMN notation including:
- Circles for start/end events
- Rectangles for tasks/activities
- Diamonds for gateways/decision points
- Dashed lines for message flows between lanes
- Solid lines for sequence flows within lanes

The overall process flows from order receipt through production planning, material procurement (if needed), manufacturing, and finally product shipment, with various decision points and parallel processes throughout.
