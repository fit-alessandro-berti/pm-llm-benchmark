### Assumptions:
1. **Chronological Sequencing**: Events are strictly ordered based on timestamps.
2. **Resources Mapping**: Resource IDs (e.g., picker, sales, billing) were linked to their roles using the Resources Table.
3. **Splitting Activities**: Multiple picking, dispatching, or invoice events per order are logged separately for granularity.
4. **Payments for Invoices**: Each payment is linked to a specific invoice but not directly to the order.

This event log aligns with process mining requirements and captures the lifecycle comprehensively. Let me know if any additional customizations are needed!
