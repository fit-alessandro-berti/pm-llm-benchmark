To mitigate bias in the loan application review process, we need to introduce constraints that ensure fairness and consistency. Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to enforce this.

### Updated `declare_model` Dictionary

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "FinalDecision": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - `FinalDecision` must coexist with `ManualReview` to ensure that every decision step is reviewed manually.
   - `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` must coexist with `ManualReview` to ensure that decisions involving sensitive attributes are reviewed manually.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace` must be followed by `BiasMitigationCheck` to ensure that any check of sensitive attributes is followed by a bias mitigation step before making a final decision.

3. **Precedence Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace` must not be directly followed by `FinalDecision` to prevent immediate biased decisions after checking sensitive attributes.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - `RequestAdditionalInfo` must be followed by `FinalDecision` to ensure that additional information requests are properly followed up with a decision.
   - `BiasMitigationCheck` must be followed by `FinalDecision` to ensure that bias mitigation is properly followed up with a decision.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace` must not be directly followed by `FinalDecision` to prevent immediate biased decisions after checking sensitive attributes.

These constraints collectively ensure that the process does not discriminate based on sensitive attributes and that every decision is fair and consistent.
