Based on the provided process variant data, here are the root causes for performance issues, focusing on process and data-specific considerations:

**1. Rework and Rejections:**

*   **Frequent Rejections:**  Several variants involve multiple rejections, particularly by "ADMINISTRATION," "BUDGET OWNER,"  "SUPERVISOR," and "PRE_APPROVER." This indicates potential issues with:
    *   **Data Quality:**  Declarations may be incomplete, inaccurate, or lack necessary supporting information, leading to rejections.
    *   **Policy Clarity:**  Unclear or inconsistently applied policies regarding declaration approvals could cause confusion and rejections.
    *   **Insufficient Training:** Employees, approvers, or administrators might lack adequate training on the declaration process or requirements.
*   **Rework Loops:**  The presence of "REJECTED by... -> REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" sequences signifies significant rework. This points to:
    *   **Feedback Quality:**  Rejection messages may be unhelpful or unclear, preventing employees from making necessary corrections effectively.
    *   **Process Complexity:**  The declaration process might be overly complex, making it difficult for employees to get it right the first time.
    *   **User Interface Issues:** A poorly designed user interface could contribute to errors and rejections.

**2. Variant-Specific Bottlenecks:**

*   **Budget Owner Approval:** Variants including "APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" consistently exhibit higher performance times compared to those without, suggesting this step is a bottleneck. Potential causes include:
    *   **Budget Owner Availability:** Budget owners might be slow to respond due to workload or other commitments.
    *   **Information Accessibility:** Budget owners may lack easy access to the information needed to make informed decisions.
    *   **Approval Process Complexity:** The budget approval process might be too intricate or require excessive manual intervention.
*   **Administration Approval:**  Similar to the budget owner, the administration approval step seems to contribute to longer processing times in certain variants. Possible causes include:
    *   **High Workload:**  Administrators might be overloaded with requests, causing delays.
    *   **Complex Validation Rules:** The administration approval might involve complex validation rules that take time to execute.

**3. Missing Information Handling:**

*   The "REJECTED by MISSING" step implies that declarations frequently lack essential data. This suggests:
    *   **Mandatory Fields:**  The system may not adequately enforce mandatory fields or data requirements.
    *   **Guidance and Support:** Employees might not have clear guidance on what information is required for a successful declaration.

**4. Process Variability:**

*   The large number of process variants itself indicates a lack of standardization. This can lead to:
    *   **Confusion:**  Employees and approvers may be unsure which process path to follow, leading to errors and delays.
    *   **Inefficiency:**  Different paths may have varying levels of efficiency, and non-optimal routes might be frequently chosen.

**Data-Specific Considerations:**

*   The significantly high performance time for the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" variant (frequency = 5, performance = 13805869.200) suggests there might be some specific data conditions or edge cases that are causing these declarations to take an exceptionally long time to process or cause some system errors.
*   While frequency seems to be a factor for some longer running variants, it is not always a direct causal factor. For example, some variants with high frequency like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" still have a relatively low average performance time. More data analysis would be needed to establish the correlation between different data attributes and the performance time.
