To solve this problem, we need to carefully construct a DuckDB SQL query that adheres to the requirements step by step. Here's how we can approach it:

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Identify Cases with the Specific Sequence**:
   - We need to find cases (`case_id`) where the activities `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `'Create Order'`, and `'Confirm Order'` appear in direct succession.
   - To achieve this, we use the `LAG()` and `LEAD()` window functions to check the previous and next activities for each event in the log.

2. **Filter Cases Based on Timing Condition**:
   - For cases that match the sequence, calculate the time difference between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events.
   - Only include cases where this time difference exceeds 5 days.

3. **Exclude Matching Cases**:
   - Once we identify the cases that meet both the sequence and timing conditions, exclude all events from these cases from the final result.

4. **Return Remaining Events**:
   - Return all events from the `event_log` table that do not belong to the excluded cases.

### **SQL Query**

Here is the DuckDB SQL query that implements the above logic:

```sql
WITH sequence_check AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
    FROM event_log
),
matching_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM sequence_check
    WHERE
        activity = 'Create Order'
        AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
timing_filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        sc.case_id
    FROM matching_cases mc
    JOIN event_log e1 ON mc.case_id = e1.case_id AND e1.activity = 'Create Order'
    JOIN event_log e2 ON mc.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE
        e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM timing_filtered_cases
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **`sequence_check` CTE**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) uses the `LAG()` and `LEAD()` functions to determine the previous and next activities for each event within the same case (`case_id`), ordered by the `timestamp`.
   - This allows us to check if the sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'` exists.

2. **`matching_cases` CTE**:
   - Filters the results from `sequence_check` to find cases where the sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'` occurs in direct succession.
   - It selects distinct `case_id` values for these cases.

3. **`timing_filtered_cases` CTE**:
   - Joins the `matching_cases` with the `event_log` table twice:
     - Once to get the `timestamp` of the `'Create Order'` event.
     - Once to get the `timestamp` of the `'Confirm Order'` event.
   - Filters cases where the time difference between these two events exceeds 5 days.

4. **Final Query**:
   - Selects all events from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is **not** in the list of cases identified in `timing_filtered_cases`.
   - Orders the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity.

### **Key Points**
- The use of `LAG()` and `LEAD()` ensures that we only consider sequences of activities that occur in direct succession.
- The timing condition is enforced using an interval comparison (`e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'`).
- The final query excludes all events from cases that meet both the sequence and timing criteria.

This query is efficient and adheres to the requirements of the benchmark.
