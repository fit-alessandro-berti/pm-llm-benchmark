**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

1.  **Coexistence Constraint:**
    ```python
    declare_model["coexistence"][mitigation_activity_manual_review][decision_activity] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    declare_model["coexistence"][decision_activity][mitigation_activity_manual_review] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    ```
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint ensures that whenever a `FinalDecision` activity occurs in a process instance, a `ManualReview` activity must also occur in the same instance (and vice-versa, due to the nature of coexistence). This adds a layer of human oversight to all final decisions, making it less likely for biases to lead to unfair outcomes.  Manual review can help catch and correct potentially biased decisions made by automated systems or individual decision-makers.

2.  **Non-succession Constraints:**
    ```python
    for sensitive_check in sensitive_attribute_checks:
        declare_model["nonsuccession"][sensitive_check][rejection_activity] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    ```
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints prevent a direct succession from checking a sensitive attribute (like `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`) to a `RejectApplication` decision. This means that a `RejectApplication` activity cannot immediately follow an activity where a sensitive attribute is checked. By enforcing this, we prevent potentially biased decisions based solely on sensitive attributes without any intervening checks or balances.  It forces the process to have other steps between checking sensitive attributes and rejecting an application, allowing for more considered and less biased decision-making.

3.  **Succession Constraints:**
    ```python
    for sensitive_check in sensitive_attribute_checks:
        declare_model["succession"][sensitive_check][mitigation_activity_bias_check] = {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    ```
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints mandate that after each sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must follow. This ensures that whenever the process involves checking for sensitive attributes, a subsequent step to mitigate potential bias is automatically triggered. This makes bias mitigation an integral part of the process, especially when sensitive information is involved, promoting fairness and preventing discriminatory practices.

By adding these constraints, the process model is made more robust against potential biases. It enforces manual review for all final decisions, prevents immediate rejections after sensitive attribute checks, and ensures a bias mitigation check is performed whenever sensitive attributes are examined. These measures collectively work to create a fairer and more equitable loan application review process.
