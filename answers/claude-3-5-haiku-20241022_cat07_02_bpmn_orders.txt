This is a business process diagram showing a complete order fulfillment workflow divided into four swim lanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

The process begins in the Sales lane on Monday morning with checking order completeness and customer database verification. If a customer is not in the database, they are added. The process then moves to sending order details and drafting an invoice.

In the Production lane, the workflow includes planning production and manufacturing the product, with a notification path for material not being ready.

The Procurement lane contains a Material Compensation Subprocess that handles ordering and checking materials, with options to return materials if needed.

Finally, the Warehouse lane shows the final steps of sending the completed product.

The diagram uses standard BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) symbols including:
- Start and end events (circles)
- Tasks (rectangles)
- Gateways (diamonds)
- Message events
- Subprocess boundaries
- Flow connectors (solid and dashed lines)

The entire process is well-structured with clear handoffs between departments and conditional paths for different scenarios in the order fulfillment process.
