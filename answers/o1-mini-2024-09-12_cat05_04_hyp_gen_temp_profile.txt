### **Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

1. **Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`):**
   - **Average Time:** ~25 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** Very low
   - **Issue:** The consistently short and rigid time frame for approval may not align with typical business processes, suggesting possible automation or system-imposed constraints.

2. **Approve to Notify (`P` to `N`):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 2 days
   - **Issue:** The lengthy and highly variable delay between approval and notification indicates potential bottlenecks or inconsistent handling during this phase.

3. **Assign to Close (`A` to `C`):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - **Issue:** The rapid closure post-assignment, bypassing intermediate steps like evaluation or approval, may lead to premature claim closures.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (`E` to `N`):**
   - **Average Time:** 5 minutes
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 minute
   - **Issue:** The exceptionally swift transition from evaluation to notification raises concerns about the thoroughness of the evaluation process or the omission of necessary subsequent steps.

### **Hypotheses for Identified Anomalies**

1. **Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`):**
   - **Automated Processing:** Claims might be automatically approved based on predefined criteria, reducing the need for manual intervention.
   - **System Errors:** A malfunction in the system could be triggering approvals prematurely or bypassing necessary review stages.
   - **Rigid Scheduling:** The approval process may be bound by strict time constraints that do not account for case-specific complexities.

2. **Approve to Notify (`P` to `N`):**
   - **Resource Constraints:** Limited staffing or resources may cause delays in the notification process.
   - **Process Bottlenecks:** Inefficient workflows or approval queues could be causing inconsistent notification times.
   - **Manual Intervention:** Reliance on manual steps for notification might introduce variability and delays.

3. **Assign to Close (`A` to `C`):**
   - **Skipped Steps:** Intermediate activities like evaluation or approval might be inadvertently skipped, leading to swift closures.
   - **Inadequate Training:** Adjusters may lack proper training, resulting in premature claim closures without thorough evaluation.
   - **Incentive Misalignment:** Performance metrics might incentivize quick closures over accurate and fair claim handling.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (`E` to `N`):**
   - **Process Optimization:** The process may have been streamlined excessively, potentially omitting critical review stages.
   - **Automation Shortcomings:** Automated notifications might be triggered before evaluations are fully completed.
   - **Data Entry Errors:** Inaccurate or incomplete data could cause the system to send notifications prematurely.

### **Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries**

1. **Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`):**
   - **Identify Claims with Rapid Approval:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         ce1.claim_id,
         ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
         ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'R' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'P'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 20000; -- Threshold below average minus multiple STDEVs
     ```
   - **Correlate Rapid Approvals with Adjusters or Regions:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         c.claim_id,
         a.adjuster_id,
         a.region,
         COUNT(*) AS rapid_approvals
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     JOIN 
         claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
     JOIN 
         adjusters a ON ce2.resource = a.name
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'R' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'P'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 20000
     GROUP BY 
         c.claim_id, a.adjuster_id, a.region
     ORDER BY 
         rapid_approvals DESC;
     ```

2. **Approve to Notify (`P` to `N`):**
   - **Find Claims with Extended Notification Delays:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         ce1.claim_id,
         ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
         ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'P' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 800000; -- Threshold above average plus multiple STDEVs
     ```
   - **Analyze by Claim Type or Region:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         c.claim_type,
         a.region,
         COUNT(*) AS delayed_notifications
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     JOIN 
         claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
     JOIN 
         adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'P' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 800000
     GROUP BY 
         c.claim_type, a.region
     ORDER BY 
         delayed_notifications DESC;
     ```

3. **Assign to Close (`A` to `C`):**
   - **Identify Claims Closed Shortly After Assignment:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         ce1.claim_id,
         ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
         ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'A' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'C'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200; -- Threshold below average minus multiple STDEVs
     ```
   - **Check for Missing Intermediate Activities:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         c.claim_id
     FROM 
         claims c
     WHERE 
         NOT EXISTS (
             SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
             WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
               AND ce.activity IN ('E', 'P')
         )
         AND EXISTS (
             SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
             WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
               AND ce.activity = 'A'
         )
         AND EXISTS (
             SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
             WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
               AND ce.activity = 'C'
         );
     ```

4. **Evaluate to Notify (`E` to `N`):**
   - **Find Claims with Extremely Quick Notifications:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         ce1.claim_id,
         ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
         ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'E' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 600; -- Threshold below average minus multiple STDEVs
     ```
   - **Assess if Notifications Occur Without Proper Evaluations:**
     ```sql
     SELECT 
         c.claim_id,
         ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
         ce2.timestamp AS notify_time
     FROM 
         claim_events ce1
     JOIN 
         claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     JOIN 
         claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
     WHERE 
         ce1.activity = 'E' 
         AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND ce2.timestamp < ce1.timestamp + INTERVAL '10 minutes';
     ```
