Below is a structured, detailed approach using process mining to analyze Speedy Parcels’ operations, identify inefficiencies, and propose data-driven improvements.


1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

A. Data Integration and Preprocessing  
•Data Collection & Harmonization:  
– Combine streams from GPS trackers, driver scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs into an integrated event log.  
– Align events by standardizing timestamps (time zones, formats) and using a common case identifier (e.g., Vehicle-Day ID such as “V12-20241205”) to link events.  
– Enrich events with metadata: For example, map geocoordinates to neighborhood or route segments, and annotate driver/scanner events with parcel statuses and maintenance alerts.

•Challenges Encountered:  
– Inconsistent time stamps and missing data: Some events may have delays, gaps, or inaccuracies.  
– Data synchronization and mapping: Events recorded at different granularities require careful matching (e.g., GPS logs are high-frequency whereas scanner logs capture milestones only).  
– Heterogeneous formats: Different systems might record events in different formats, necessitating a preprocessing layer to unify the schema.  
– Noise filtering: For example, GPS “Low Speed Detected” events during known traffic jam locations might need filtering to avoid misinterpretation.

B. Process Discovery  
•Selection of Algorithms:  
– Use discovery methods such as the -algorithm, heuristic mining, or fuzzy mining to capture the “actual” process from depot departure through delivery, unscheduled stops, and return.  
•Visualization:  
– Generate a process map showing sequence flows: starting from “Start Shift” and “Route Assigned,” followed by “Depart Depot,” various customer delivery events, “Unscheduled Stops” (e.g., maintenance, engine warning incidents), and finally “Arrive Depot”/“End Shift.”  
– Identify decision points and loops where drivers may re-attempt deliveries, detour for maintenance, or get caught in traffic (low speed events).  

C. Conformance Checking (Comparing Actual vs. Planned)  
•Comparison Methodology:  
– Overlay the discovered process map against the planned routes from the dispatch system.  
– Use conformance checking algorithms to highlight deviations in sequence, timing, or activity that are not in line with the designed route.  
•Types of Deviations to Look For:  
– Sequence Deviations: Missing planned stops, unplanned stops (unscheduled maintenance), or deviations in stop order.  
– Timing Deviations: Longer-than-planned dwell times at stops, excessive travel times between points, or extended periods of idle time due to traffic or unexpected delays.  
– Activity Deviations: Unexpected events (e.g., repeated “Low Speed Detected” events signaling traffic jams, unplanned "Engine Warning" events that align with higher maintenance costs).


2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

A. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
•On-Time Delivery Rate:  
– Calculated by comparing actual delivery times to the customer-requested time windows from the dispatch system.  
•Average Time per Delivery Stop:  
– Derived by measuring the time difference between “Arrive Customer” and “Depart Customer” events per stop.  
•Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:  
– Travel time from “Depart Customer” to the next “Arrive Customer” divided by the dwell time at stops.  
•Fuel Consumption per km/Package:  
– If available from integrated fuel logs, correlate fuel usage with distance traveled (from GPS) and number of deliveries.  
•Vehicle Utilization Rate:  
– Assessed from active operation time relative to idle or maintenance time.  
•Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:  
– Identified by “Low Speed Detected” events and prolonged dwell times, particularly during known peak hours or in hotspots.  
•Rate of Failed Deliveries:  
– Calculated by the proportion of “Delivery Failed” events relative to total delivery attempts.

B. Process Mining Techniques for Bottleneck Identification  
•Dwell Time Analysis:  
– For each activity, compute average and variance in dwell times. Excessive dwell times at specific stops may indicate issues with customer interaction or difficulty in finding parking.  
•Variant Analysis:  
– Group case variants (e.g., routes, times of day, driver-specific process variants) to contrast high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers.  
•Trace Clustering:  
– Cluster similar traces to delineate whether delays are more associated with particular routes, vehicle types, or geographies (e.g., traffic hotspots).  
•Correlation Analysis:  
– Correlate observed delays with external factors such as traffic patterns (via “Low Speed Detected” events) or unscheduled maintenance events.  
•Quantifying Impact:  
– Calculate average delay per route or driver and simulate overall impact on fuel consumption and labor costs. This helps to isolate bottlenecks like recurring traffic jams or prolonged vehicle downtime.


3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

A. Potential Root Causes  
•Suboptimal Route Planning:  
– Static route planning might not account for real-time traffic conditions or dynamic customer distribution.  
•Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:  
– Planned durations not aligned with real conditions, leading to unrealistic schedules and delays.  
•Traffic Congestion Patterns:  
– High frequency of “Low Speed Detected” events during peak hours indicates recurring congestion.  
•High Variability in Service Time:  
– Variability at customer stops (e.g., due to difficulties in accessing customer premises or parking) leads to delays.  
•Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance Issues:  
– Evidence from unscheduled stops and engine warnings may indicate preventative maintenance is lagging behind or that vehicles are pushed past optimal operation thresholds.  
•Driver Behavior:  
– Differences in how drivers handle delays, take breaks, or reattempt failed deliveries may exacerbate inefficiencies.  
•Failed Delivery Attempts:  
– Poorly timed delivery windows or inadequate customer communication can result in failed attempts, requiring costly re-deliveries.

B. Process Mining Analyses for Validation  
•Variant Analysis:  
– Compare routes with high on-time performance to those with delays. Identify if high-performing routes have superior route planning, less traffic exposure, or faster service times.  
•Correlation Metrics:  
– Link instances of “Low Speed Detected” or “Unscheduled Stop” events with increases in dwell time or fuel consumption.  
•Dwell Time Distribution Analysis:  
– Identify which stops have unusually long service times, and then correlate these with customer feedback or location characteristics.  
•Maintenance Pattern Analysis:  
– Overlay vehicle maintenance logs with delivery traces to see if unscheduled maintenance correlates strongly with particular routes, vehicle models, or driving patterns.  
•Driver-Level Analysis:  
– Compare individual drivers’ trace variants to detect whether differences in driver behavior (e.g., time taken to complete a delivery, response to delays) contribute to overall inefficiencies.


4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

A. Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments  
•Targeted Inefficiency:  
– Addresses suboptimal static routing and prolonged travel times due to traffic congestion.  
•Underlying Root Cause:  
– Inflexible routing that does not account for real-time traffic delays and changing conditions in urban settings.  
•Data & Process Mining Insight:  
– Analysis of “Low Speed Detected” events and journey time deviations highlights segments with persistent delays.  
•Proposed Action:  
– Integrate real-time traffic data with the dispatch system to adjust routes dynamically. Use predictive algorithms to reroute drivers away from high congestion areas.  
•Expected KPIs Impact:  
– Improved On-Time Delivery Rate and reduced Travel Time, lowered Fuel Consumption per km.

B. Strategy 2: Optimizing Delivery Sequence and Territory Design  
•Targeted Inefficiency:  
– Reduces prolonged dwell times and inefficient route sequencing.  
•Underlying Root Cause:  
– Non-optimal clustering of delivery points and poor territory allocation that forces drivers to travel unnecessarily.  
•Data & Process Mining Insight:  
– Findings from variant and cluster analysis show that certain sequences lead to repeated travel in congested areas or inefficient back-and-forth movements.  
•Proposed Action:  
– Use historical process data to re-design delivery territories and optimize route sequences. A simulation model could be developed to test how new sequences impact service time and travel distance.  
•Expected KPIs Impact:  
– Higher Vehicle Utilization Rate, reduced Average Time per Delivery Stop, and a more balanced Workload across drivers.

C. Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance and Driver Training Initiatives  
•Targeted Inefficiency:  
– Decreases unscheduled stops, engine warning incidents, and service disruptions caused by vehicle breakdowns, while minimizing delays from inefficient driver practices.  
•Underlying Root Cause:  
– Poor maintenance scheduling and variability in driver performance leading to operational interruptions.  
•Data & Process Mining Insight:  
– Frequent unscheduled maintenance events or engine warnings extracted from event logs indicate that vehicles are using suboptimal maintenance schedules. Also, process mining can show variance in dwell times, hinting that some drivers “linger” at stops more than others.  
•Proposed Action:  
– Develop a predictive maintenance schedule based on vehicle usage, engine warning frequencies, and fault logs.  
– Initiate targeted driver training by providing feedback based on comparative process performance (e.g., speed of transitioning between stops, adherence to schedules).  
•Expected KPIs Impact:  
– Reduced unscheduled stops and maintenance downtime, improved Average Time per Delivery Stop, and higher On-Time Delivery Rate.


5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

A. Operational Constraints  
•Driver Working Hours:  
– Any routing or scheduling changes must comply with labor regulations. Optimize routes within allowable shift durations and schedule regular breaks.  
•Vehicle Capacities:  
– Adjust route assignments to ensure that load limits are not exceeded and that fuel consumption considerations are factored into dynamic routing decisions.  
•Customer Time Windows:  
– Maintain flexibility for last-minute delivery adjustments while ensuring that changes do not compromise hard time-window commitments.  
•Action:  
– Incorporate these constraints as parameters in routing algorithms and simulation models. Validate optimization proposals with real-world constraints (using scenario testing within the process mining environment).

B. Continuous Monitoring Plan with Process Mining Dashboards  
•Key Metrics and Process Views to Track:  
– On-Time Delivery Rate and the percentage of failed deliveries by route or driver.  
– Average dwell times at delivery stops and travel times between stops, continuously monitoring for spikes that indicate emerging bottlenecks.  
– Frequency and duration of “Low Speed Detected” events to gauge traffic issues in near-real time.  
– Fuel consumption trends and cost per delivery, linking back to vehicle utilization data.  
– Vehicle maintenance events such as unscheduled stops to evaluate the efficacy of predictive maintenance schedules.  
•Dashboard Requirements:  
– Real-time visualization of route performance with drill-down capabilities (e.g., by driver, vehicle, or territory).  
– Conformance dashboards that compare actual vs. planned processes, automatically flagging significant deviations.  
– Alerts for emerging issues (e.g., repeated unscheduled stops, extreme dwell time deviations) so that corrective actions can be enacted promptly.  
•Sustainability:  
– Schedule regular review meetings with operations and fleet management teams to review dashboard outputs, refine KPIs, and adjust strategies based on new insights.


Conclusion

By integrating data from various sources into a unified event log and applying process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis techniques, Speedy Parcels can pinpoint where delays and cost overruns originate. The proposed strategies—dynamic routing, optimized delivery sequencing, and improved maintenance/driver training—directly address root causes identified via process mining. With careful attention to operational constraints and a structured monitoring plan, these data-driven initiatives can significantly enhance delivery punctuality while reducing operational costs over the long term.
