Based on the interview transcripts, here is a textual representation of the invoice approval process in BPMN-like notation. This description captures the essential elements to convert into a BPMN diagram:

**Process Name: Invoice Approval Workflow**

1. **Start Event:** Invoice Arrival
    - _Trigger:_ Invoice received (typically via email)
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)

2. **Activity: Check Invoice for Valid PO Reference**

9. **Exclusive Gateway: Receiving Confirmation by Purchasing**
    - _Conditions:_
        - Confirmed: Proceed to Invoice Matching
        - Unconfirmed (with issue): Request Supplier Resolution or Hold Invoice
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) / Purchasing Officer (Dan)

10. **Activity (if issues unresolved): Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor**
    - _Input:_ Issue Report
    - _Output:_ Supervisor Resolution Coordination
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
    - _Note:_ May involve Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) to reach suppliers or provide pricing details

11. **Exclusive Gateway: Post-resolution Path**
    - _Conditions:_
        - Successfully Resolved: Return to Purchasing Confirmation
        - Rejected or Uncleared: End Process
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) / Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

12. **Activity: Invoice Matching (Accounts Payable)**
    - _Input:_ Confirmed Invoice +  PO
    - _Output:_ Matched Invoice
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
    - _Note:_ Includes resolving discrepancies

13. **Activity: Send to Department Manager for Approval**
    - _Output:_ Manager Approval Request
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) with System Automation

14. **Activity: Department Manager Reviews and Approves**
    - _Input:_ Invoice + PO + Confirmation
    - _Output:_ Manager's Approval/Rejection
    - _Role:_ Department Manager (Carlos)
    - _Note:_ May reject or hold invoices with suspicious or unusual elements

15. **Exclusive Gateway: Manager's Decision**
    - _Conditions:_
        - Approved: Proceed to Scheduling Payment
        - Rejected: Return to Accounts Payable for correction/reassessment
    - _Role:_ Department Manager (Carlos)

16. **Activity: Schedule for Payment**
    - _Input:_ Approved and Matched Invoice
    - _Output:_ Scheduled Payment
    - _Role:_ Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)

17. **End Event:** Payment Scheduling Completion

**Artifacts:**
- Invoices
- PO (Purchase Order) Documents
- Email Notifications/System Messages for Triggers and Confirmations
- Discrepancy/Issue Reports

**Roles Involved:**
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
- Suppliers

The process is triggered by the arrival of an invoice at Accounts Payable. The flow primarily proceeds sequentially, with main decision points on PO validation, Purchasing confirmation, discrepancy resolution, and manager's approval. The diagram reflects exception handling (escalation to supervisor and department head for unresolved issues or retrospective PO creation) and external interactions with suppliers and supplier relationship management.

In summary, the process is generally linear but accommodates divergences through exclusive gateways for conditional paths, illustrating a clear model to be easily converted into a BPMN diagram format, detailing roles, inputs, outputs, and the sequence flow with decision points.

**Disclaimer:** This model represents an interpretation of the narrative data provided, focusing on clarity and consistency despite a few inherent ambiguities (e.g., escalations to supervisor and occasional manual vs. system-triggered approvals).
