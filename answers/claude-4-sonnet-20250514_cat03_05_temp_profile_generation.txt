Looking at this global supply chain process, I'll construct a temporal profile dictionary that captures the realistic time delays between activities that eventually follow each other. I'll consider both direct sequential relationships and longer-term relationships across multiple process steps.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential relationships
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 43200),      # 2 days ± 12 hours (supplier selection to order)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200),    # 14 days ± 3 days (order to receipt)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),       # 1 day ± 6 hours (receipt to inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),      # 3 days ± 1 day (inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (432000, 129600),     # 5 days ± 1.5 days (assembly to testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (172800, 43200),      # 2 days ± 12 hours (testing to packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 14400),       # 12 hours ± 4 hours (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (345600, 172800),     # 4 days ± 2 days (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 259200),     # 7 days ± 3 days (distribution to support)
    
    # Medium-range relationships (skipping 1-2 activities)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1382400, 302400),    # 16 days ± 3.5 days (selection to receipt)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1296000, 280800),    # 15 days ± 3.25 days (order to inspection)
    ('RC', 'CA'): (345600, 108000),     # 4 days ± 1.25 days (receipt to assembly)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (691200, 216000),     # 8 days ± 2.5 days (inspection to testing)

This temporal profile reflects realistic supply chain timings where:
- Procurement activities (SSOPRC) have longer lead times with higher variability
- Manufacturing activities (QICAPT) have moderate timings with process-dependent variations
- Distribution activities (PKWSDTAS) have mixed timings based on logistics complexity
- Cross-phase relationships show cumulative times with increased standard deviations reflecting compounded uncertainties
- End-to-end relationships capture the full process variability from initial supplier selection through after-sales support
