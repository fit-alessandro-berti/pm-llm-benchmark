Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the given event log and use process mining techniques to infer the activities being performed. The data includes timestamps, machine IDs, and various sensor readings. My goal is to group related events into phases that correspond to activities like Cutting Metal, Assembling Parts, Welding, etc.

First, I'll start by looking at the event log and observing how the sensor readings change over time. The key sensors here are temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption. Each of these might indicate different stages of the manufacturing process.

Looking at the events one by one:

Events 1-3 (8:00:00 to 8:00:10) show low readings across the board. Temperature is around 20-21°C, pressure is 1 bar, vibration is 0 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position is 0 mm, and energy is around 0.4-0.5 kWh. This seems like an idle or standby state. Maybe the machine is not actively working here.

At event 4 (8:00:15), there's a jump in temperature to 50°C, vibration to 30 Hz, material flow to 5 units/s, tool position to 5 mm, and energy jumps to 2.00 kWh. These increases suggest some active process starting. The tool position moving from 0 to 5 mm might indicate a tool engaging. The vibration and temperature rising could mean a cutting operation because cutting usually generates heat and vibration. Material flow starting up suggests parts are moving through. So maybe this is the Cutting Metal phase.

Events 4-6 (8:00:15 to 8:00:25) continue to show rising temperature (50 to 58°C), pressure increases to 1.5 bar, vibration up to 38 Hz, and tool position increases to 10 mm. Energy consumption also rises. The material flow remains steady at 5 units/s. This looks like the cutting process is ongoing and maybe intensifying. So these events are part of the same activity.

At event 7 (8:00:30), temperature drops to 40°C, pressure jumps to 2 bar, vibration decreases to 10 Hz, material flow drops to 2 units/s, and tool position jumps to 15 mm. Energy consumption also drops to 2.00 kWh. This seems like a transition. The pressure increase might be a different process. Lower vibration and temperature could indicate a different activity. Material flow is lower but still present. Tool position moving to 15 mm. Maybe this is Assembling Parts? Because assembling might involve lower vibration, perhaps using pressure to join parts. The material flow is still present but lower, which could be parts being moved into place.

Events 7-8 (8:00:30 to 8:00:35) remain steady with same readings. So this is a steady state for that activity.

Event 9 (8:00:40) shows a significant jump in temperature to 80°C, vibration to 50 Hz, and energy spikes to 5.00 kWh. Material flow drops to 0, and tool position stays at 15 mm. The high temperature and vibration might indicate a welding process. Welding often involves high heat and maybe some vibration. Since material flow is zero, maybe the parts are stationary during welding. So this could be Welding.

Event 10 (8:00:45) sees a drop in temperature to 30°C, vibration down to 1 Hz, material flow remains 0, and energy drops to 1.00 kWh. But tool position stays at 15 mm. This might be cooling down after welding, so maybe part of the same activity or a transition to another phase.

Event 11 (8:00:50) has temperature at 25°C, pressure back to 1 bar, vibration at 5 Hz, material flow resumes at 1 unit/s, tool position moves to 20 mm. Energy is 1.50 kWh. The material flow starting again, tool position moving further. Maybe this is Assembling Parts again? Or perhaps Packaging? Wait, material flow is low (1 unit/s) compared to the earlier 5. Maybe it's a different phase. The tool position moving to 20 mm could indicate a new tool engaging. But vibration is low here. Maybe this is Quality Inspection? Or Packaging? Alternatively, maybe another assembly step.

Events 11-12 (8:00:50 to 8:00:55) remain stable here. Then events 13-15 (8:01:00 to 8:01:10) drop back to baseline: temperature 20-21°C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0, material flow 0, tool position 0 mm, energy around 0.4-0.5 kWh. This looks like the machine returning to idle or completion of a cycle.

Putting this all together:

- The cycle starts with idle (events 1-3), then transitions into Cutting Metal (events 4-6), followed by Assembling Parts (events 7-8), then Welding (event 9, possibly including 10), then another phase (events 11-12) which might be Quality Inspection or Packaging, and finally back to idle (13-15).

Wait, event 10's temperature drops significantly. Is that part of welding or a new phase? If welding is done, maybe the machine cools down, which is part of the welding phase. Then events 11-12 might be another activity. The material flow here is 1 unit/s, tool position moves to 20 mm. Maybe this is Quality Inspection? Inspection might involve moving the part to a new position, using sensors (but in this data, maybe it's a different setup). Or perhaps Packaging, where the product is being moved for packaging. The energy usage here is 1.5-1.6 kWh, which is moderate. Let's think: after welding, the part might be inspected for quality, then packaged. But how to differentiate between inspection and packaging?

Alternatively, event 9 is Welding, events 10-12 could be Quality Inspection (since temperature is dropping, maybe sensors are checking the weld), followed by Packaging starting at 11-12? But in events 11-12, material flow is 1 unit/s, which is low. Maybe packaging involves moving the final product out, but material flow here is low. Alternatively, maybe after welding and cooling, the part is moved to another position for inspection, which might involve some movement (material flow) and tool adjustment (position to 20 mm). Then events 11-12 could be Quality Inspection. Then the machine idles again.

Alternatively, maybe event 10 is part of the Welding activity (cool down), and events 11-12 are Assembling again, but that doesn't fit well. Let me re-examine the tool positions:

Cutting: tool position 5-10 mm.

Assembling: 15 mm.

Quality Inspection or Welding: tool position stays at 15 mm during welding (event 9), then in event 10, tool position remains 15, but in event 11, moves to 20 mm. So the change to 20 mm might indicate a new activity.

So perhaps:

- Events 1-3: Idle

- 4-6: Cutting

- 7-8: Assembling

- 9: Welding

- 10: Cooling (part of welding phase?)

- 11-12: Packaging or Inspection

- 13-15: Idle again

But how to determine if event 10 is part of welding or a separate phase. The temperature drops sharply here, but the tool position remains at 15. Maybe welding stops and cooling occurs. So welding phase includes event 9 and 10.

Then events 11-12 have tool position at 20 mm, material flow 1. Maybe Packaging, since after all manufacturing steps are done, it could be moved to packaging with lower flow. Also, energy usage here is 1.5-1.6, which is lower than assembling (which was 2.0 kWh) but higher than idle.

Alternatively, maybe the activity after welding is Quality Inspection. High energy usage might not fit, but 1.5 is moderate. The tool moving to 20 mm might be positioning for inspection.

Alternatively, maybe events 11-12 are part of Assembling, but that seems inconsistent because they come after welding.

Hmm. Let me summarize the transitions:

Event 1-3: Idle

Event 4-6: Cutting starts, tool at 5-10mm.

Event 7-8: Assembling, tool at 15mm, lower vibration.

Event 9: High temp, high vibration – Welding.

Event 10: Temp drops, vibration low, tool still at 15 – maybe part of welding (post-welding cooling?)

Event 11-12: Tool moves to 20mm, material flow 1, maybe Packaging or Inspection.

Then Event 13-15: Back to idle.

So possible labels:

1. Idle (1-3)

2. Cutting Metal (4-6)

3. Assembling Parts (7-8)

4. Welding (9-10)

Wait, event 10's temperature is 30, which is dropping from 80. If welding is high heat, maybe welding is just event 9, and event 10 is a transition. But process mining usually groups consecutive events into phases. Maybe the welding phase is event 9 only, and event 10 is a new phase (Cooling?), but that's not one of the listed possible activities. The problem says to use the given labels like Cutting, Assembling, Welding, Quality Inspection, Packaging. So Cooling might not be a label we can use. Therefore, perhaps Welding includes event 9 and 10 if it's considered part of the same process. Alternatively, maybe the welding is only event 9, and event 10 is another activity. But what activity would that be?

In event 10, material flow is zero, tool position remains at 15. Maybe Quality Inspection could involve sensors checking the weld, but how would that show in sensor data? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe event 10 is part of welding (the hold time or cooling phase within welding activity).

Then after welding, events 11-12: tool moves to 20, material flow starts again (1 unit/s). Maybe this is moving the part to the packaging area. Packaging could involve moving the product, so material flow of 1 unit/s (maybe slower than assembling's 5 or cutting's 5), tool position at 20 mm (new position for packaging area). Then events 11-12 could be Packaging.

Then events 13-15, back to idle.

So the breakdown would be:

- Events 1-3: Idle (not an activity, but maybe labeled as "Setup/Idle")

But the problem says to use the example labels, not including idle. The instructions say to assign labels like Cutting, Assembling, Welding, Quality Inspection, or Packaging. So maybe the phases are:

1. Cutting Metal (4-6)

2. Assembling Parts (7-8)

3. Welding (9-10)

Wait, but event 10's temperature is low. If welding requires high heat, maybe only event 9 is welding, but that's a single event. That might not be ideal. Alternatively, perhaps the welding process starts at event 9 and ends at event 10, even though temperature drops. Because maybe the welding operation is brief, and the high temperature lingers a bit. But in the data, event 9 is 80°C, event 10 drops to 30. That seems like a big drop in 5 seconds. Maybe a malfunction? Or maybe it's a very quick weld followed by cooling.

Alternatively, perhaps the welding activity is event 9 only. Then event 10 could be Quality Inspection. How?

Quality Inspection might involve lower energy, no material flow, but maybe some sensor checks. In event 10, material flow is 0, vibration is 1 Hz (very low), energy is 1.00 kWh. Maybe this is a check without moving parts. But how to connect sensor readings to inspection. Maybe the tool is stationary (position 15) while sensors check the product.

Then events 11-12: material flow resumes at 1 unit/s, tool moves to 20 mm. Packaging could involve moving the finished product, so maybe this is Packaging.

Alternatively, maybe the order is Cutting -> Assembling -> Welding -> Packaging.

But the problem is to group consecutive events into phases and assign labels. Let's try to map each group:

Group 1: 1-3: Baseline readings. Machine idle.

Group 2: 4-6: High vibration, temp rise, material flow 5, tool moving. Cutting.

Group 3: 7-8: Lower temp, higher pressure (2 bar), low vibration, some material flow (2 units/s). Assembling.

Group 4: 9: High temp (80), high vibration (50), high energy (5.00). Welding.

Group 5: 10: Sharp temp drop, very low vibration. Maybe Cooling (not one of the examples, but maybe part of Welding?)

Group 6: 11-12: Tool at 20, material flow 1. Packaging or Inspection.

Group 7: 13-15: Back to idle.

But since the labels must be from the examples, perhaps:

After Cutting and Assembling, Welding (event 9), then Quality Inspection (event 10-12), then Packaging? Not sure.

Alternatively, event 11-12 is Packaging. Event 10 could be part of Welding.

Alternatively, considering the tool position:

- Cutting: 5-10 mm

- Assembling: 15 mm

- Welding: remains at 15 mm for event 9-10

- Then tool moves to 20 mm at 11-12, which could be Packaging.

Another angle: Energy consumption.

Cutting (events 4-6) peaks at 3.00 kWh.

Assembling (7-8) is 2.00 kWh.

Welding (event 9) jumps to 5.00 kWh, which is the highest. So welding might be the most energy-intensive.

Event 10 drops to 1.00 kWh, which is closer to idle. Hmm, but welding might only consume high energy during the weld, then stop. So maybe event 9 is the welding phase, and event 10 is a cooldown or transition.

After that, event 11-12: 1.5-1.6 kWh. Maybe this is Packaging, which uses some energy to move and pack the product.

Putting it all together:

- Events 4-6: Cutting Metal. High vibration, temp increase, material flow starts, energy rises.

- Events 7-8: Assembling Parts. Pressure increases, vibration lower, material flow moderate, energy at 2.00.

- Event 9: Welding. Very high temp and vibration, highest energy.

- Events 10: Quality Inspection? Material flow zero, maybe sensors check product. But energy drops to 1.00. Or maybe this is still Welding phase.

Alternatively, maybe events 10-12 are part of the same activity. Event 10 has tool at 15, event 11 moves to 20. So a new activity starts at 11.

Alternatively, event 10 could be a separate phase, but with only one event? Not sure.

But process mining groups consecutive events. So transitions are key.

Looking at the tool position changes:

Change from 0 to 5 (event 4): Cutting starts.

Then increases to 10 (event 6), then jumps to 15 (event 7): transition to assembling.

Stays at 15 until event 10. Then jumps to 20 at event 11.

So transitions:

Cutting (4-6, tool 5-10), Assembling (7-8, tool 15), Welding (9-10, tool 15), then Packaging (11-12, tool 20).

But why would welding be at the same tool position as assembling? Maybe after assembling parts, the machine welds them in the same position.

So Welding (event 9-10), then Packaging (11-12), then idle.

But how to explain event 10's data. If Welding is event 9 only, then event 10 might be a quick cooldown. But in process mining, activities can have varying durations. If Welding is event 9, but maybe the sensor data spikes for just a moment.

Alternatively, maybe the Welding phase includes event 9 and 10 if there's a rapid heat and cool.

Alternatively, event 10 could be Quality Inspection. If the product is stationary (material flow 0), tool in position 15, sensors might be checking quality, which could be non-invasive in sensor data. The rationale could be that after welding, the machine pauses to inspect.

Then events 11-12: material flow resumes (but at 1 unit/s), tool moves to 20 mm. Maybe Packaging involves moving the product to a packaging area (lower flow rate) and tool position changes to handle packaging operations.

Putting it all together:

1. Events 1-3: Machine idle before starting the process.

2. Events 4-6: Cutting Metal. Temperature and vibration rise, tool engages at 5 mm, material flows in.

3. Events 7-8: Assembling Parts. Higher pressure, lower vibration, steady material flow, tool moves to 15 mm.

4. Event 9: Welding. High temperature and vibration at same tool position, energy peaks.

5. Event 10: Quality Inspection. Material flow stops, energy drops, possible sensors checking weld quality.

6. Events 11-12: Packaging. Tool moves to 20 mm, material flows at low rate, preparing for packaging.

7. Events 13-15: Machine idles again.

But is there a better way to group events 10-12? Event 10 is a single event. If we group events 10-12 together, but tool position changes at 11. So event 10 remains at 15, event 11 jumps to 20. So transitions at 11.

Therefore:

- Event 9: Welding

- Event 10: Transition or separate phase?

- Event 11-12: Packaging

But event 10's material flow is 0, vibration very low, energy 1.00. Maybe it's a short pause between Welding and Packaging. However, process mining typically doesn't model such short intervals unless necessary. Maybe the Welding activity ends at 9, then Packaging starts at 11. But there's a gap in events. Alternatively, maybe the Quality Inspection spans event 10 and Packaging events 11-12. But how?

Alternatively, maybe events 9-10 are Welding. Even though temperature drops in event 10, the activity could still be welding if the process involves applying heat and then holding or cooling under certain conditions. But energy drops from 5.00 to 1.00, which might indicate the welding stops and cooling happens passively. So maybe Welding is event 9 only.

Then event 10 could be Quality Inspection. If inspection requires the part to be stationary (material flow 0), tool position 15 mm. Then events 11-12 are Packaging: material moves at low flow (packaging materials?), tool at 20 mm.

This seems plausible. Let's outline the labeled activities:

1. Cutting Metal: Events 4-6

   - Rationale: Increased temperature (50-58°C), vibration (30-38 Hz), material flow starts (5 units/s), tool engages (5-10 mm), energy increases. These are typical of a cutting process that generates heat and vibration.

2. Assembling Parts: Events 7-8

   - Rationale: Temperature drops to 40°C, pressure increases to 2 bar, low vibration (10 Hz), moderate material flow (2 units/s), tool position steady at 15 mm. Assembly might involve lower vibration, using pressure to join parts with steady but lower material flow.

3. Welding: Event 9

   - Rationale: Sharp temperature increase to 80°C, high vibration (50 Hz), peak energy (5.00 kWh), material flow stops (0), tool still at 15 mm. High heat and vibration suggest welding, possibly joining assembled parts.

4. Quality Inspection: Event 10

   - Rationale: Rapid temperature drop to 30°C, near-zero vibration (1 Hz), no material flow, continued energy use (1.00 kWh). This could indicate a brief inspection phase where the system checks the weld without moving parts.

5. Packaging: Events 11-12

   - Rationale: Tool moves to 20 mm, material flow resumes at 1 unit/s, low vibration (5 Hz), stable temperature (25°C). Packaging might involve slower material movement and different tooling for boxing or sealing.

6. Idle: Events 1-3 and 13-15

   - Rationale: Sensor readings return to baseline (low temperature, no material flow, zero vibration, low energy use). Indicates the machine is inactive or resetting.

But wait, the problem says to group related events. Event 10 alone might not be enough for a phase, unless necessary. Maybe Quality Inspection is too brief. Alternatively, merge events 9-10 as Welding, considering that welding might be event 9's spike and then release.

If we consider Welding as event 9 and Packaging as events 10-12, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps event 10 and 11-12 are part of Packaging. Let's re-express:

Alternative grouping:

- Events 9-12: Packaging. But the sensor readings don't align with that. High temp at event 9 wouldn't fit packaging.

Hmm. Another approach: check for similarity in consecutive events. If two consecutive events have similar readings, they're in the same phase. Changes indicate phase transitions.

Looking at the data:

Events 1-3 similar: idle.

Event 4 changes temp, vibration, flow, tool pos, energy: new phase (Cutting).

Events 5-6 continue similar trends.

Event 7: temp drops, pressure up, vibration down, flow down, tool pos up. New phase (Assembling).

Event 8 same as 7.

Event 9: temp jumps, vibration jumps, flow zero, energy jumps. New phase (Welding).

Event 10: temp drops sharply, vibration drops, same tool pos, energy down. Still welding? Or new phase?

Event 11: pressure back to 1, temp drops slightly, vibration same, flow up to 1, tool jumps to 20. New phase starts (Packaging/Inspection).

Event 12 similar to 11.

Event 13: back to idle.

So transitions at events 4,7,9,10,11. But event 10 could be a transition to another phase. If event 10 has tool still at 15, but event 11 moves. So:

- Event 9: Welding

- Event 10: Quality Inspection (single event)

- Events 11-12: Packaging

But single-event phases are possible but less likely. Alternatively, merge 9-10 as Welding:

High energy and temperature at event 9, followed by a cooldown in 10. If welding involves heating and then holding or cooling under controlled conditions, then both could be part of the welding phase.

In that case:

Welding: events 9-10.

Rationale: The welding process includes a high-heat phase (event 9) followed by a controlled cool-down period (event 10), maintaining the tool position and gradually reducing energy.

Then events 11-12 Packaging.

This would make sense. Even though temperature drops in event 10, it's part of the welding process's cooldown.

So revised grouping:

1. Cutting Metal: 4-6

2. Assembling Parts:7-8

3. Welding:9-10

4. Packaging:11-12

This way, each phase has at least two events except the Packaging which has two (11-12), and the Quality Inspection isn't used. But according to the possible labels, Quality Inspection is an option. Did I miss it?

Alternatively, if the problem requires using Quality Inspection, but where?

In this grouping, maybe events 11-12 are Quality Inspection instead of Packaging. Let's think:

After welding, maybe inspect, then package.

In events 11-12: tool moves to 20, material flow resumes. If Packaging involves moving the product out, maybe material flow of 1 unit/s is the product being ejected. Alternatively, Quality Inspection could involve moving the product to a new position (tool 20) and checking while flowing slowly. But material flow rate is low.

Alternatively, maybe:

Events 11-12: Quality Inspection. Tool at 20 mm could position the product for scanning, with low material flow.

Events 13-15: Packaging. But events 13-15 are idle. Hmm, conflicting.

This is tricky. Based on the sensor data:

Packaging might involve material flow again, perhaps. If after inspection, the product is moved to packaging. But in events 11-12, material flow is 1, which could be packaging materials or the product itself. Tool position at 20 might be packaging machinery.

In the absence of explicit labels, I'll proceed with the grouping that best fits sensor data patterns and the example activities.

Final grouping:

- Events 4-6: Cutting Metal. High vibration, temp rise, material flow starts, energy up.

- Events 7-8: Assembling Parts. Higher pressure, lower vibration, steady flow.

- Events 9-10: Welding. Very high temp/vibration then cooldown.

- Events 11-12: Packaging. Tool moves to 20, material flow resumes at low rate.

Quality Inspection isn't clearly identified here, unless it's absent in this cycle.

Rationale:

Cutting: High vibration and temperature, material moving, tool in cutting position.

Assembling: Pressure increases (clamping?), lower vibration, slower material movement to position parts.

Welding: Sharp spike in temperature and vibration, highest energy consumption, then cooldown.

Packaging: Tool repositions, low material flow possibly moving into package, energy moderate.

This seems logical. Even though the problem lists Quality Inspection as a possible label, if the data doesn't clearly support it, maybe it's not present in this log. Alternatively, maybe events 11-12 are Quality Inspection:

Inspection could involve moving the product to a scanner (tool 20), with low material flow while checks are performed. Energy usage (1.5-1.6 kWh) might be consistent with sensors operating.

If the problem expects using Quality Inspection, this could fit. The difference between Inspection and Packaging in sensor data might be subtle. Packaging could involve more material flow, but here it's 1 unit/s. Alternatively, after inspection, packaging starts, but in this data, only events 11-12 occur before idling.

I think I'll settle on:

Cutting (4-6), Assembling (7-8), Welding (9-10), Quality Inspection (if present) might not be in this log, but wait events 11-12 need a label. Maybe:

After welding, events 11-12 are Packaging. Tool changes to 20 mm, slow material flow to package.

So final labels:

1. Cutting Metal: 4-6

2. Assembling Parts:7-8

3. Welding:9-10

4. Packaging:11-12

That uses all example labels except Quality Inspection. Alternatively, if the problem allows some not used.

Alternatively, maybe events 7-8 are Quality Inspection. No, because material flow is present. The initial analysis makes sense.

Now, writing the final answer with labeled activities, grouped events, and rationale.
</think>

### Labeled Manufacturing Activities Derived from Event Log

---

#### **1. Idle (Events 1–3 and 13–15)**  
**Rationale:**  
- Sensor readings remain at baseline levels:  
  - **Temperature**  20–21°C, **Pressure** = 1 bar, **Vibration** = 0 Hz, **Material Flow** = 0 units/s, **Tool Position** = 0 mm, **Energy**  0.4–0.5 kWh.  
- These values indicate the machine is idle or in a standby state, with no active operations occurring.  
- Events 13–15 mirror the initial idle phase, suggesting the completion of a full manufacturing cycle.

---

#### **2. Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
**Rationale:**  
- **Temperature** rises sharply from 50°C to 58°C, **Vibration** increases to 30–38 Hz, and **Energy Consumption** jumps to 2.00–3.00 kWh.  
- **Material Flow** begins at 5 units/s, and the **Tool Position** advances from 5 mm to 10 mm.  
- These patterns align with a high-energy cutting process:  
  - Heat and vibration are generated by the tool engaging with metal.  
  - Steady material flow suggests parts are being fed into the cutting zone.  
  - Energy spikes reflect the mechanical effort required for cutting.

---

#### **3. Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)**  
**Rationale:**  
- **Temperature** drops to 40°C, **Vibration** decreases to 10 Hz, and **Pressure** increases to 2 bar.  
- **Material Flow** remains moderate (2 units/s), and the **Tool Position** jumps to 15 mm.  
- These changes indicate a shift to assembly:  
  - Lower vibration and temperature suggest mechanical motion without aggressive cutting or welding.  
  - Increased pressure may reflect clamping or joining actions.  
  - Steady material flow and tool repositioning align with positioning and assembling components.

---

#### **4. Welding (Events 9–10)**  
**Rationale:**  
- **Temperature** spikes to 80°C (Event 9), **Vibration** peaks at 50 Hz, and **Energy Consumption** reaches 5.00 kWh.  
- **Material Flow** halts (0 units/s), while the **Tool Position** remains at 15 mm.  
- These readings strongly suggest welding:  
  - High temperature and vibration are consistent with a welding torch or laser.  
  - Energy peaks due to concentrated thermal energy.  
  - Event 10 shows rapid cooling (30°C) and reduced vibration (1 Hz), likely representing post-weld cooling or tool retraction.  
  - The stationary tool and lack of material flow confirm the part is being welded in place.

---

#### **5. Packaging (Events 11–12)**  
**Rationale:**  
- **Tool Position** shifts to 20 mm, **Material Flow** resumes at 1 unit/s, and **Vibration** remains low (5 Hz).  
- **Temperature** stabilizes at 25°C, and **Energy Consumption** drops to 1.50–1.60 kWh.  
- These patterns align with packaging:  
  - Tool repositioning (20 mm) may indicate movement to a packaging station.  
  - Low material flow suggests the finished product is being transported for boxing or labeling.  
  - Reduced energy and vibration reflect minimal mechanical effort compared to earlier stages.

### Conclusion  
By analyzing sensor trends, we mapped the raw event log to a sequence of high-level manufacturing activities. Transitions between phases were identified through abrupt changes in temperature, vibration, tool position, and material flow. This approach demonstrates how process mining can derive actionable insights from numerical sensor data without explicit activity labels.
