The picture is a “multi-object” process map that stitches together five different but inter-related object types and shows how each of them travels through the overall procure-to-pay / order-to-cash workflow.  
(Each object type is represented by its own colour; the little filled-in circles in each activity box show which objects can visit that step.  Thin coloured lines are the paths, annotated with average time lags in milliseconds.)

Object types and their volumes  
• VendorInvoiceItem – 1.2 M instances (green)  
• ReturnOrderItem – 0.8 M instances (red)  
• PurchaseRequisitionItem – 2.0 M instances (violet)  
• SalesOrderItem – 3.5 M instances (orange)  
• PurchaseOrderItem – 5.0 M instances (blue)

Main sections of the map

1. Starts  
Each object has its own “Start” bubble at the top of the diagram.

2. Requisition branch (violet + others)  
Purchase-requisition items go through “Create Requisition” (3.0 M) and converge with other objects in “Approve Requisition” (5.7 M).  
From here they may:  
• go directly to “Send Order”, or  
• detour via “Check Stock”, or  
• be side-tracked into “Process Return” if it is a return flow.

3. Order fulfilment branch (orange & blue)  
Sales- and purchase-order items enter “Create Order” (8.5 M).  
Sales orders continue through the warehouse chain:  
Pack Goods (2.0 M)  Ship Goods (1.8 M)  Confirm Delivery (1.7 M)  Close Order (1.7 M)  End.  
Purchase orders supply material back to the requisition branch (hence the blue lines feeding into “Send Order” and “Approve Payment”).

4. Returns branch (red)  
ReturnOrderItems are born in “Start”, meet the other objects in “Approve Requisition”, pass to “Process Return” (0.8 M) and then re-join the financial chain.

5. Financial settlement branch (green & blue)  
After goods are shipped, services rendered or returns processed, objects funnel into “Approve Payment” (1.5 M) and on to “Create Invoice” (2.0 M) before ending.

6. Ends  
Five separate “End” bubbles illustrate that the objects can finish at different points although many of them terminate after “Send Order”, “Create Invoice”, or “Close Order”.

Time information  
Edges are labelled with the average waiting time between activities (e.g., 400 ms from “Start” to “Create Order”, 300 ms from “Create Order” to “Pack Goods”, 120 ms from “Check Stock” to “Send Order”, etc.).  The numbers convey relative speed and bottlenecks; for example, the passage from “Approve Requisition” to “Process Return” (650 ms) is slower than from “Approve Requisition” to “Send Order” (200 ms).

Key take-aways at a glance  
• “Approve Requisition” and “Create Order” are the two largest hubs (5.7 M and 8.5 M executions).  
• The shipping path (Pack  Ship  Confirm  Close) is linear and time-consistent (300 ms, 200 ms, 220 ms, 180 ms).  
• Returns incur the heaviest single hop (650 ms) and loop back into the invoicing chain.  
• Financial closure (“Create Invoice”) receives flow from three different upstream routes and is shared by both purchases and returns.

Overall, the diagram gives a compact overview of how multiple object types interact, where the high-volume and high-latency steps sit, and how the operational and financial sides of the business meet in a single end-to-end process.
