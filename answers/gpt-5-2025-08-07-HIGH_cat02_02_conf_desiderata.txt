Part 1 – Normative (hard-rule) compliance

- Case 1: Compliant
  - Correct order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No skipped steps; no contradictory actions.

- Case 2: Non-compliant
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check (08:20 vs 09:00) violates “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.”
  - Inform Applicant missing after Loan Decision (skipped required step).
  - Finalize Documentation executed after a rejection (contradictory action); for a rejected decision, the case should be closed without finalization.
  - Closing occurred after the improper finalization, so the “decision logic” for closing was not followed.

- Case 3: Compliant
  - Correct order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
  - No contradictory actions.

Part 2 – Desiderata (soft-rule) adherence

- Case 1
  - Credit Check within 24 hours: Yes (30 minutes).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision: Yes (2 hours).
  - Follow-up Call: Not shown. If it did not happen, that’s only a minor (soft) miss.

- Case 2
  - Credit Check within 24 hours: Yes (1 hour).
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours: No, there is no “Inform Applicant” event (this is both a hard-rule violation and fails the soft timing recommendation).
  - Follow-up Call: Not shown; if omitted, that’s a minor (soft) miss.

- Case 3
  - Credit Check within 24 hours: No (about 49 hours after application) – soft violation.
  - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision: No (about 51 hours) – soft violation.
  - Follow-up Call: Explicitly missing – soft violation.
  - These are suboptimal but not serious, since all hard rules were satisfied.

Part 3 – Possible interpretations and improvement suggestions

- Case 2
  - Why it might have happened:
    - A preliminary triage or automated risk screen may have run before the formal Credit Check.
    - “Finalize Documentation” may have been used to wrap up rejection paperwork (misuse of an approval-only step).
    - The applicant may have been auto-notified outside the system without an event logged.
  - Suggestions:
    - Gate Risk Assessment so it cannot start until Credit Check is completed (system control).
    - Split “Finalize Documentation” into distinct tasks, e.g., “Issue Approval Package” (only for approvals) and “Record Rejection/Archive” (for rejections).
    - Make “Inform Applicant” mandatory before enabling “Close Case” and ensure the notification is event-logged.

- Case 3
  - Why the delays might have happened:
    - Weekend/holiday or third-party bureau delays for the Credit Check.
    - Backlog or manual handoffs delaying the notification.
  - Suggestions:
    - SLA monitoring with alerts for >24h Credit Check and >48h notification.
    - Escalation or auto-reminders; optionally send an interim status update to the applicant.
    - Encourage a brief Follow-up Call before close to improve customer experience.

- Case 1
  - This is a good reference instance; consider using it as a template path for conformance checking and training.
