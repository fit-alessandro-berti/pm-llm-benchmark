 The given text appears to represent an audit log or workflow of a financial document submission and approval system, specifically related to invoice submissions by employees. Here is a summary of the processes involved based on the sequence provided:

1. An employee submits a declaration (presumably for payment processing).
2. This submission goes through various levels of review/approval with varying frequencies and associated performance metrics, which could represent some form of system efficiency or productivity measure related to each approval stage (e.g., SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER).
3. Each declaration may go through several stages such as being "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE," "Declaration APPROVED by [entity]," or "Declaration REJECTED." These actions have different frequencies and performance values assigned to them.
4. The frequency numbers indicate how often a particular sequence occurs, whereas the 'performance' value likely corresponds to some metric of system efficiency or processing time at each step (though their exact meaning isn't explicitly described).
5. If a submission is rejected at any point in this chain, it can be sent back for further review, rejection may happen by different entities like "Declaration REJECTED by [entity]."
