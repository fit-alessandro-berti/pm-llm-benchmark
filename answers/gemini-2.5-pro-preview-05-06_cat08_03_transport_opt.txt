Okay, Speedy Parcels has a classic set of challenges for a last-mile delivery operation. Process mining is an excellent approach to dissect these issues. Here's a comprehensive plan:

## Process Mining Engagement Plan for Speedy Parcels

**Introduction:**

Speedy Parcels is experiencing common last-mile delivery challenges: late deliveries and rising operational costs. The rich event data collected provides an excellent foundation for a process mining initiative. Our goal is to transform this raw data into actionable insights, enabling Speedy Parcels to understand their *actual* operations, identify specific inefficiencies, uncover root causes, and implement data-driven optimization strategies for improved punctuality and cost-effectiveness.

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

**A. Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

The first crucial step is to create a high-quality, cohesive event log.

*   **Case ID Definition:**
    *   The primary Case ID will be `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., "V12-20241205"), representing a single vehicle's operational shift on a specific day. This allows us to analyze the end-to-end process for each vehicle's workday.
    *   A secondary, more granular Case ID could be `Package ID` to trace the journey of individual packages, especially useful for analyzing delivery success/failure reasons and end-to-end package delivery times. For this, we'd need to link package-specific scanner events to the broader `Vehicle-Day` case.

*   **Activity Definition:**
    *   Translate raw events into meaningful activities. Examples:
        *   `Driver Start Shift` (Driver Log)
        *   `Route Assigned` (Dispatch)
        *   `Vehicle Loading` (Implied or Scanner 'Scan at Depot' for first package)
        *   `Depart Depot` (Vehicle GPS/Scanner)
        *   `Travel to Customer` (Calculated from GPS: time between 'Depart Previous Stop' and 'Arrive Customer')
        *   `Arrive Customer` (Scanner)
        *   `Service Customer` (Calculated: time between 'Arrive Customer' and 'Delivery Success/Failed')
        *   `Delivery Success` (Scanner)
        *   `Delivery Failed` (Scanner, with reason if available)
        *   `Depart Customer` (Scanner)
        *   `Unscheduled Stop - Traffic` (Derived from GPS: prolonged low speed/idle in transit)
        *   `Unscheduled Stop - Maintenance Issue` (Vehicle GPS + Maintenance Log correlation)
        *   `Vehicle Maintenance - Scheduled` (Maintenance Log)
        *   `Vehicle Maintenance - Unscheduled` (Maintenance Log)
        *   `Arrive Depot (End Shift)` (Vehicle GPS/Scanner)
        *   `Driver End Shift` (Driver Log)

*   **Timestamp:** Use the `Timestamp` column. Ensure all timestamps are converted to a consistent timezone and format.
*   **Resource:** `Vehicle ID` and `Driver ID` are key resources.
*   **Attribute Enrichment:** Add other relevant data as attributes to each event: `Location (Lat/Lon)`, `Speed`, `Package ID` (for package-related events), `Planned Delivery Window`, `Vehicle Capacity`, `Number of Planned Stops`, `Maintenance Type` (scheduled/unscheduled), `Failure Reason` (for failed deliveries).

*   **Integration & Challenges:**
    *   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Clocks across different systems (GPS, Scanners, Dispatch) might not be perfectly synchronized. We may need to apply heuristics or establish a "master" timestamp source for ordering events, possibly favoring GPS for movement and scanner for delivery milestones.
    *   **Event Granularity & Correlation:** GPS data is frequent; scanner data is milestone-based. Linking these correctly (e.g., correlating a GPS "stop" with a "Scanner Arrive Customer") is key. Location and time proximity will be used for this.
    *   **Missing Data/Outliers:** Develop strategies for handling missing timestamps or critical events (e.g., a missing "Depart Customer" scan). Imputation might be possible based on subsequent events, or cases might be flagged.
    *   **Defining "Idle" vs. "Stop":** Differentiate between traffic-induced idling (from GPS low speed/stationary) and purposeful stops (customer delivery, maintenance). This requires rules based on duration, location (near customer vs. on highway), and correlation with scanner/maintenance data.
    *   **Implicit Events:** Some activities like "Vehicle Loading" or "Travel" are not explicitly logged but are derived from sequences of other events and their timestamps.

**B. Process Discovery:**

Using algorithms like the Heuristics Miner or Inductive Miner (which are robust to noisy, real-world data), we will visualize the *actual* end-to-end delivery process. This model will show:

*   The common paths taken by vehicles from depot departure to return.
*   The sequence of activities: depot operations, travel, customer arrival, service, departure.
*   Frequencies of different paths and activities.
*   Average/median durations of activities and transitions (waiting times).
*   Discovered deviations:
    *   Unplanned stops (e.g., long idle times not near customers, maintenance events).
    *   Loops (e.g., re-visiting an area due to failed delivery, returning to depot mid-shift).
    *   Sequence variations (e.g., some drivers performing pre-departure checks, others not).
    *   The flow of failed deliveries and any subsequent re-attempt logic visible in the data.

**C. Conformance Checking:**

We will compare the discovered "as-is" process models against the "to-be" or planned processes derived from the Dispatch System.

*   **Reference Model:** The planned route sequence for each `Vehicle-Day` will serve as the reference model.
*   **Types of Deviations to Look For:**
    *   **Sequence Deviations:**
        *   Delivering to customers in a different order than planned.
        *   Skipped planned stops (packages not attempted).
        *   Added unplanned stops (customer visits not on the original route, or non-delivery stops).
    *   **Unplanned Activities:**
        *   Unscheduled maintenance stops during the route.
        *   Extended idle times indicative of personal breaks beyond policy or undocumented issues.
        *   Returning to the depot mid-route unexpectedly.
    *   **Timing Deviations:**
        *   Significant differences between planned vs. actual travel times between stops.
        *   Significant differences between planned vs. actual service times at customer locations.
        *   Late departures from the depot or early/late arrivals at customer locations relative to time windows.
    *   **Resource Deviations:**
        *   Driver or vehicle swaps mid-shift (if this data is captured and relevant).

Conformance checking will quantify these deviations (e.g., "30% of routes have sequence deviations," "Average delay due to unplanned stops is 25 minutes").

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**A. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

We will calculate the following KPIs from the event log:

1.  **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:**
    *   `Calculation:` (Number of packages delivered within customer-requested or system-defined time window) / (Total number of attempted deliveries).
    *   `Data Needed:` Scanner `Delivery Success/Failed` timestamps, Dispatch `Planned Delivery Time Window`.
2.  **Average Time per Delivery Stop:**
    *   `Calculation:` Average duration from `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`. This can be further broken down into time to first scan (finding package), service time, and time to depart.
    *   `Data Needed:` Scanner timestamps.
3.  **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
    *   `Calculation:` (Total time spent in `Travel to Customer` activity) / (Total time spent in `Service Customer` activity) per `Vehicle-Day`.
    *   `Data Needed:` Derived `Travel` and `Service` activities.
4.  **Fuel Consumption (Proxy if direct data unavailable):**
    *   `Proxy KPIs:` Average speed during travel, % of time spent idling, total distance traveled (from GPS) per package or per route. If fuel data per vehicle fill-up is available, it can be correlated with distance/idling time from logs.
    *   `Data Needed:` GPS data, potentially external fuel logs.
5.  **Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
    *   `Calculation:` (Total time vehicle is actively on route or servicing customers) / (Total shift duration or available operational hours).
    *   `Data Needed:` `Depart Depot`, `Arrive Depot (End Shift)`, `Start Shift`, `End Shift` timestamps, duration of maintenance.
6.  **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:**
    *   `Calculation:` Number and total duration of `Unscheduled Stop - Traffic` or periods of significantly low speed detected by GPS during transit.
    *   `Data Needed:` GPS data.
7.  **Rate of Failed Deliveries (and Reasons):**
    *   `Calculation:` (Number of `Delivery Failed` events) / (Total delivery attempts). Further segmented by `Failure Reason`.
    *   `Data Needed:` Scanner `Delivery Failed` events, `Notes` field for reasons.
8.  **Cycle Time (Vehicle-Day):**
    *   `Calculation:` Time from `Depart Depot` to `Arrive Depot (End Shift)`.
    *   `Data Needed:` Vehicle GPS/Scanner timestamps.

**B. Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

*   **Performance Dashboards & Process Maps:** Visualizing KPIs directly on the discovered process map (e.g., average duration of activities, waiting times on arcs) will highlight slow activities or long waits.
*   **Activity Duration Analysis:** Identify activities with the longest average durations or highest variability (e.g., "Service Customer," "Find Parking" if derivable).
*   **Waiting Time Analysis:** Analyze time spent between activities (e.g., waiting at depot before departure, waiting for customer response).
*   **Filtering and Segmentation:**
    *   **Routes:** Compare performance of different predefined routes or routes in different geographical zones.
    *   **Time of Day:** Analyze if bottlenecks are more prevalent during peak traffic hours.
    *   **Drivers/Vehicle Types:** Identify if certain drivers or vehicle types are consistently associated with longer durations or more deviations (while being mindful of confounding factors like route difficulty).
    *   **Traffic Hotspots:** Correlate GPS location data during "Low Speed Detected" events with known traffic congestion areas.
    *   **Specific Activities:** Deep dive into activities like "Service Customer" – are delays due to package searching, customer interaction, or issues with the handheld scanner?

*   **Quantifying Impact:** Bottlenecks will be quantified by their frequency and the cumulative time lost. For example, "Traffic delays on Route X between 8-10 AM account for an average of 45 minutes lost per affected vehicle-day, impacting 20% of vehicles on this route."

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Beyond identifying *where* delays occur, we'll investigate *why*.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning (Static vs. Dynamic):**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Conformance checking will reveal frequent deviations from planned routes. If routes leading to high travel times or late deliveries consistently deviate in similar ways, it suggests the plan itself is flawed. Variant analysis can compare planned route performance vs. actual driver-chosen routes.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Compare `Dispatch System` planned travel times with actual travel times calculated from GPS. Consistent underestimation, especially for certain road segments or times of day, indicates issues with the estimation model.
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Correlate "Low Speed Detected" or "Unscheduled Stop - Traffic" events with specific locations (using Lat/Lon) and times of day. Overlaying this on a map can reveal traffic hotspots affecting routes.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Analyze the distribution of "Service Customer" activity durations. High variability might be due to: access issues (apartments, businesses), package search time, customer not ready, payment issues. Correlate with `Notes` or `Package Type` if available.
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Filter for cases including `Unscheduled Stop - Maintenance Issue` or `Vehicle Maintenance - Unscheduled`. Analyze frequency, duration, and impact on remaining deliveries for that day. Correlate with `Vehicle ID` and `Maintenance Logs` to see if certain vehicles are problematic.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Use variant analysis to compare process models of high-performing drivers vs. low-performing drivers (based on OTD, stops/hour, etc.), controlling for route difficulty. This can reveal efficient vs. inefficient practices (e.g., pre-sorting packages, parking strategies). *Caution: Handle this sensitively and look for systemic issues rather than blaming individuals.*
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts:**
    *   *PM Analysis:* Analyze traces leading to `Delivery Failed`. What activities preceded it? What were the logged reasons? How often are re-deliveries attempted on the same day vs. next day? What's the "cost" of a failed delivery in terms of time and resources for re-attempts?

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the insights, here are three distinct strategies:

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Route & Schedule Adjustment**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** Delays due to unforeseen traffic, inaccurate static travel time estimates, rigid adherence to suboptimal planned sequences.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Static route plans failing to adapt to real-world conditions; planning based on averages rather than predictive insights.
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   Identification of frequent traffic-related delays on specific segments/times (from GPS "Low Speed Detected").
    *   Conformance checking showing drivers deviating (sometimes for good reason) from static plans.
    *   Analysis of travel time variance showing unreliability of planned times.
*   **Proposed Action:** Implement a system (or enhance the existing dispatch system) that allows for:
    1.  **Real-time Traffic Integration:** Feed live traffic data into the routing engine.
    2.  **Dynamic Re-routing:** If significant delays are detected on a planned route, the system suggests or automatically implements an alternative sequence or path.
    3.  **Predictive Travel Times:** Use historical travel time data (from PM analysis of actuals) combined with real-time conditions to provide more accurate ETAs to customers and for internal planning.
*   **Expected KPI Impacts:**
    *   Improved On-Time Delivery Rate.
    *   Reduced Travel Time vs. Service Time ratio.
    *   Potentially reduced Fuel Consumption (by avoiding congestion).
    *   Reduced driver stress.

**Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories & Stop Sequencing based on Historical Performance**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** Suboptimal clustering of stops within routes, inefficient travel patterns between stops, imbalanced workloads across vehicles/drivers.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Route planning based on simple geographic proximity or outdated assumptions, not reflecting actual travel difficulties or service time variations.
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   Variant analysis showing that certain driver-initiated route sequences consistently outperform planned sequences for similar sets of stops.
    *   Identification of routes with excessive travel time between stops despite geographic proximity (e.g., due to one-way systems, difficult turns, learned from actual GPS traces).
    *   Discovery of imbalanced actual work durations (travel + service) for routes planned to be similar in effort.
*   **Proposed Action:**
    1.  **Territory Re-evaluation:** Use historical actual travel times and service times (from PM) to redefine delivery zones/territories to ensure more balanced workloads and logical stop clustering.
    2.  **Sequence Learning:** Analyze frequently occurring, high-performing subsequences of stops from the discovered process models. Incorporate these "learned best practices" into the routing algorithm's logic.
    3.  **Stop Profiling:** Categorize stops by historical average service time (e.g., "quick drop-off," "business delivery with signature," "apartment complex"). Factor this into route planning density.
*   **Expected KPI Impacts:**
    *   Improved On-Time Delivery Rate.
    *   Reduced Travel Time (and thus fuel).
    *   Increased Vehicle Utilization Rate (more stops per hour/day).
    *   More equitable workload distribution for drivers.

**Strategy 3: Proactive Failed Delivery Prevention & Management**

*   **Targeted Inefficiency/Bottleneck:** Wasted time and resources on failed delivery attempts and subsequent re-deliveries.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Customer unavailability, inaccurate delivery windows, poor communication, access issues.
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   High frequency of "Delivery Failed" events identified in the process model.
    *   Analysis of reasons for failed deliveries (from `Notes` or scanner codes) pointing to common issues (e.g., "Customer Not Home," "Business Closed," "Access Code Needed").
    *   Correlation of failed deliveries with specific customer types, times of day, or lack of pre-delivery notification.
*   **Proposed Action:**
    1.  **Enhanced Customer Communication:** Implement more precise ETA notifications (e.g., "Driver is 3 stops away / 15 minutes out") based on real-time GPS and predictive models. Offer flexible re-scheduling options via SMS/app.
    2.  **Refined Time Window Management:** Use historical data on delivery success rates by time window to offer customers more realistic and reliable windows.
    3.  **"Attempt Saver" Protocols:** For historically problematic addresses or customer types, implement a pre-call/SMS by the driver when they are en route to the stop, or by dispatch if a first attempt fails within a specific timeframe, to see if the customer can be available shortly.
    4.  **Data Capture for Failure Reasons:** Standardize and enforce the capture of detailed, structured reasons for failed deliveries in the handheld scanners to enable better root cause analysis.
*   **Expected KPI Impacts:**
    *   Reduced Rate of Failed Deliveries.
    *   Improved On-Time Delivery Rate (by succeeding on the first attempt).
    *   Reduced operational costs (less fuel/time spent on re-deliveries).
    *   Increased customer satisfaction.
    *   Improved Vehicle Utilization Rate.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

**A. Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

All proposed strategies must operate within Speedy Parcels' real-world constraints:

*   **Driver Working Hours:** Route optimization and dynamic adjustments must respect legal driving hour limits and scheduled breaks. PM analysis can identify if current routes often push drivers close to or over these limits.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route planning (initial and dynamic) must not assign more packages than a vehicle can physically or legally carry. PM can help analyze if current capacity utilization is optimal or if under/over-utilization is common.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** These are paramount. Dynamic adjustments should prioritize meeting committed windows. If a dynamic change makes a window unachievable, the system should flag this for proactive customer communication. PM helps assess current adherence to these windows.
*   **Depot Cut-off Times:** Routes must be planned to allow vehicles to return to the depot by the required time.

These constraints will act as boundary conditions for any optimization algorithms or rule changes.

**B. Continuous Monitoring Plan:**

Implementation is not the end. Continuous monitoring is vital.

*   **Process Mining Dashboards:** Develop interactive dashboards to track key metrics and process views:
    1.  **Overall Process Health:** A simplified view of the main delivery process flow, highlighting average durations, frequencies, and conformance rates.
    2.  **KPI Dashboard:** Trend charts for all defined KPIs (OTD, Avg Time per Stop, Failed Delivery Rate, etc.) filterable by date, route, driver, vehicle.
    3.  **Deviation Tracker:** Monitor the frequency and types of deviations from planned routes (sequence, unplanned stops, timing). Set thresholds for alerts.
    4.  **Bottleneck Monitor:** Track performance of previously identified bottleneck activities to see if improvements are holding.
    5.  **Failed Delivery Analysis:** Dashboard dedicated to failed delivery reasons, trends, and locations.
    6.  **Traffic Impact View:** Map showing real-time and historical traffic delay hotspots overlaid with active routes.

*   **Monitoring Focus:**
    *   **Effectiveness of Implemented Changes:** Are the strategies delivering the expected KPI improvements? (e.g., is OTD increasing after dynamic routing is implemented?).
    *   **Sustainability:** Are the improvements maintained over time?
    *   **New Emerging Issues:** Are new bottlenecks or inefficiencies appearing as a result of changes or evolving external factors?
    *   **Conformance Drift:** Is the actual process drifting away from the newly optimized "to-be" process?

This continuous feedback loop will allow Speedy Parcels to adapt, refine strategies, and maintain a high level of operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It turns process mining from a one-off project into an ongoing operational management tool.
