### Merged Event Log

The merged log below integrates events from both systems into a unified chronological sequence. I used the minimum timestamp from matching events as the primary timestamp for sorting and display (to reflect the earliest recorded occurrence). All events share the same `order_id` (Order#1234), so it is included but consistent across the log. For merged events, attributes from both logs are combined: Log A's event type as the base name (since Log A is the primary timeline), appended with Log B's equivalent in parentheses for transparency. Log B's richer attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) are included where available. Events unique to one log are marked with their origin.

| Timestamp            | Event Type                  | Order ID  | User ID | Resource ID | Notes                          | Origin   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | Order Received (OrderReceived) | Order#1234 | u45    | r10        | Event captured at warehouse system | Merged  |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | Order Validated (OrderValidation) | Order#1234 | u12    | r10        | Cross-check inventory         | Merged  |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed (PaymentCheck) | Order#1234 | u12    | r99        | Payment gateway delay         | Merged  |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check              | Order#1234 | u45    | r11        | Random inspection             | B       |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Item Shipped (Shipping)    | Order#1234 | u45    | r10        | Package handed to courier     | Merged  |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | Item Delivered             | Order#1234 | -      | -          | -                             | A       |

### Reasoning for Merging Decisions
- **Matching Criteria**: Events were matched primarily by semantic similarity in event names (e.g., "Order Received" ≈ "OrderReceived"; "Payment Processed" ≈ "PaymentCheck"; "Item Shipped" ≈ "Shipping") combined with timestamp proximity. I calculated exact differences using datetime parsing:
  - Order Received: 2 seconds (A at 10:00:00Z, B at 09:59:58Z) → Matched (within tolerance).
  - Order Validated: 1 second (A at 10:01:30Z, B at 10:01:29Z) → Matched (well within <2-second example tolerance).
  - Payment Processed: 5 seconds (A at 10:02:00Z, B at 10:02:05Z) → Matched despite exceeding the 2-second example, as the offset is still a "few seconds" per the context, and no other events align semantically or temporally. This avoids fragmenting the payment step.
  - Item Shipped: 2 seconds (A at 10:05:00Z, B at 10:05:02Z) → Matched (within tolerance).
- **Unmatched Events**:
  - Quality Check (B at 10:03:00Z): No semantic or temporal match in Log A (closest is Payment Processed at ~1 minute earlier or Item Shipped at ~2 minutes later). Included as-is from Log B.
  - Item Delivered (A at 10:20:00Z): No counterpart in Log B (Log B ends at 10:05:02Z). Included as-is from Log A.
- **Timestamp Handling**: For merged events, I selected the minimum timestamp as primary for chronological ordering (reflecting the earliest system record, which may indicate processing delays in Log A). Differences were minor (<6 seconds total), so no averaging was needed; both original timestamps are noted in the reasoning but not duplicated in the table to avoid clutter.
- **Attribute Integration**: Log B's attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) were prioritized for enrichment in merged and B-only events. Log A-only events have placeholders ("-") for missing fields. Event types were unified by basing on Log A but noting Log B's variant in parentheses to preserve naming conventions without losing information.
- **Overall Conflicts Resolved**: No major conflicts (e.g., contradictory attributes). The result is a complete, non-redundant log with 6 events (5 from A + 5 from B, minus 4 merges = 6 unique). Chronological order ensures a coherent fulfillment sequence: receipt → validation → payment → quality → shipping → delivery.
