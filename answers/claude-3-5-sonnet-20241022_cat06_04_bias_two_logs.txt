After analyzing both event logs, I can identify several concerning patterns that suggest systematic bias favoring Group B (Unprotected Group) over Group A (Protected Group). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Score Adjustment Mechanism:
- Group B members who belong to the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 point "Community Boost"
- Group A members receive no score adjustments, regardless of their circumstances
- This creates an inherent advantage for local residents who are part of community groups

2. Approval Thresholds and Outcomes:
- In Group B, case U003 was approved with an initial score of 695, which was boosted to 705
- In Group A, case P002 was rejected with a score of 710, which was higher than U003's initial score
- This suggests that the community boost can push borderline cases into approval territory for Group B, while similar or better scores in Group A lead to rejection

3. Systematic Advantages:
- Local Resident status (TRUE for Group B, FALSE for Group A) appears to be a prerequisite for receiving community-based advantages
- Community Group membership is only present in Group B entries
- The combination of these factors creates a compounded advantage for Group B

4. Process Discrimination:
There appears to be a two-tier system where:
- Group B members have access to additional scoring mechanisms (community boost)
- Group A members are evaluated purely on their base scores without access to similar adjustments

This bias is particularly problematic because:
1. It creates indirect discrimination through seemingly neutral factors (community membership)
2. It systematically disadvantages Group A members who may not have access to local community groups
3. The score adjustment mechanism amplifies existing social advantages

To address this bias, the system should:
- Review the fairness of community-based adjustments
- Create equivalent opportunities for score improvements for Group A
- Implement consistent evaluation criteria across all applications
- Consider whether local residence and community group membership are appropriate factors for decision-making
