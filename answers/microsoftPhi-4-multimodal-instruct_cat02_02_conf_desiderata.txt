### Part 1: Violations of Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)

**Case ID 2 Violations:**
- **Credit Check before Risk Assessment:** The sequence of events started with a Risk Assessment prior to the Credit Check, which is against the normative rules that require a Credit Check to occur before performing a Risk Assessment.
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Finalize Documentation was attempted after a Loan Decision of rejection, which violates the strict rule that if a loan is rejected, the process should not finalize the documentation as Part 1 of the process strictly rules out documentation finalization upon rejection before closing the case.

**Case ID 3 Violations:**
- No identified violations of the normative process behavior.

**Case ID 3 Justification (Demerits by Desiderata, Not Normative Violations):**
- Experiencing a Credit Check 32 hours after the Application Received: It occurred more than the recommended 24 hours. However, it doesn’t break the sequence rules, meaning while not ideal, it's still a procedural occurrence.
- Inform Applicant 56 hours after Loan Decision: It occurred outside of the recommended 48-hour window. This tardiness falls into the realm of desiderata and doesn’t constitute a normative rule violation, but it's delayed communication.
- No Follow-up Call: Lacking a follow-up call pre-closing the case is simply not meeting the recommended best practice and does not represent a failure of the normative process.

### Part 2: Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Strict)

**Case ID 2 Desiderata Violations:**
- Late Credit Check: The Credit Check was completed after 24 hours post-Application Received, defying the desirability recommendation of rectifying it within the 24-hour timeframe.
- Late Inform Applicant Notice: With the applicant informed 12 hours later than the recommended 48 hours following the Loan Decision, this breaches the timing recommendation to promptly inform the applicant.

**Case ID 3 Desiderata Violations:**
- Again, the Credit Check was done 32 hours subsequent to the Application Received, and the applicant was informed 56 hours post-Loan Decision. These instances showcase a deviation from the recommended timing standards.
- Absence of Follow-Up Call: The case lacked a follow-up call before close, missing the recommended best practice even though the absence might not interfere with the strict outcome-dependent task flow.

### Suggestions for Interpretation:

- In Case ID 2, the chronological order of events almost seemed to fit the narrative, albeit the Credit Check and Risk Assessment order being ignored is a significant deviation and may indicate a misunderstanding of the process by the operators.
- For Case ID 3, and taking into account the aim for swift processing times per best practices, it infers either understaffing, workload pressure, or simply insufficient process adherence discipline. The procedural chain was maintained, so while the outcomes are correct, the process's efficiency and follow-ups to the applicant were neglected, possibly leading to a perception of low service quality.
- The lack of follow-up calls and compliance with timing in Case ID 3 also indicates potential gaps in training or communication within the team, and a reinforcement of adherence to best practices might be warranted to ensure all parties receive optimal service handling.
