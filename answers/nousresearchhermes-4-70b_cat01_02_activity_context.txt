<think>

We are given an event log with three cases (C001, C002, C003). We notice that the same activity names appear multiple times within the same case and across cases.
 The activities that are repeated and need disambiguation are:
   - "Verify Documents": appears multiple times in C001, C002, and C003 with different contexts.
   - "Call Customer": appears twice in C002 and once in C003 and once in C001, but with different purposes.
   - "Adjust Account": appears in C002 and C003, but note that in C003 it is preceded by a different context.

 Let's break down by activity and case:

 Activity: "Verify Documents"
   - In C001:
        First occurrence: Initial verification of identity documents (by BackOfficeAgent).
        Second occurrence: Re-check after customer submitted additional documents (by BackOfficeAgent).
   - In C002:
        First occurrence: Initial verification (by BackOfficeAgent).
        We don't have a second occurrence of "Verify Documents" in C002? Actually, we have two in C001 and C003, but only one in C002.
        Correction: In C002, there is only one "Verify Documents".
   - In C003:
        First occurrence: Physical verification of ID by BranchOfficer.
        Second occurrence: Re-verify after account adjustment (by BranchOfficer).

 So for "Verify Documents", we have:
   Case C001: two instances -> "Initial Document Verification" and "Reverification of Documents"
   Case C002: one instance -> we can leave as is? But note: the same activity name might be used in different contexts, so we should also rename it to be consistent with the case context? 
        However, in C002, it's the first and only verification, so we can call it "Initial Document Verification" as well? But let's see the context: it's just "Identity verification", which is the same as the first in C001 and C003? 
        But note: in C003 the first verification is by a branch officer and the second by the same (re-verify). In C002, the context is the same as the first in C001 and C003? Actually, in C002, the context is "Identity verification" and done by BackOfficeAgent, same as the first in C001. 
        So we can have a pattern: 
          - The first verification in a case is "Initial Document Verification"
          - Any subsequent verifications in the same case are named with increasing numbers or by purpose.

        However, in C001 the first verification is by BackOfficeAgent and the second is also by the same role. In C003 the first and second are by BranchOfficer.

        We can standardize by the position (first, second) and the role? Or by the context? Let's look at the context string:

        C001:
          First: "Agent checks identity documents."
          Second: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."

        So we can have:
          C001: 
            First: "Initial Document Verification" (or "First Document Verification") 
            Second: "Document Reverification" (or "Second Document Verification")

        But note: in C002, we have only one verification, so we can call it "Initial Document Verification". In C003, we have two: the first is "Initial Document Verification" and the second is "Document Reverification". However, the second in C003 is after an account adjustment and is done to re-verify the documents. The context says "Re-verify docs after account adjustment". 

        So we can name the second in C001 as "Document Reverification (After Additional Submission)" and in C003 as "Document Reverification (After Account Adjustment)"? But that might be too specific.

        Alternatively, we can note the purpose from the context and use that to rename.

        Let's try:
          C001: 
            First: "Initial Document Verification"
            Second: "Document Reverification"  [because the context says "re-checks"]

          But then in C003, the second is also a "re-check" but after an account adjustment. We can have a generic "Document Reverification" for both? 

        However, the problem says: "carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur". So we should reflect the reason for the reverification.

        Alternatively, we can use the order and the context as a suffix? 

        Actually, the task is to rename the activities so that the names reflect the context. We can do:

          For "Verify Documents":
            - If it's the first occurrence in a case: "Initial Document Verification"
            - If it's the second occurrence: 
                * In C001: the context is about having received additional documents -> "Document Reverification (Additional Docs Received)"
                * In C003: the context is after an account adjustment -> "Document Reverification (Post-Account Adjustment)"

        But note: the activity name in the log should be a fixed string for each occurrence, and we are allowed to change it arbitrarily? The problem says "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences".

        We can do:

          C001: 
            First: "Initial Document Verification"
            Second: "Document Reverification (Additional Docs)"

          C002: 
            Only one: "Initial Document Verification"

          C003:
            First: "Initial Document Verification"
            Second: "Document Reverification (Post Adjustment)"

        However, note that in C003 the first verification is done by BranchOfficer (at branch) and the second by the same BranchOfficer. The first in C001 and C002 is done by BackOfficeAgent. Should the role be reflected? The problem doesn't specify, but we are only to change the activity name. The context already includes the resource. But the activity name should disambiguate without looking at the resource? 

        Alternatively, we can keep the naming without the role and only focus on the sequence and purpose.

        Let's decide on a naming scheme for "Verify Documents" by occurrence number and purpose (if known) in that case.

        We have two reverifications: 
          - After additional documents (in C001)
          - After account adjustment (in C003)

        So we can have:
          Initial: 
            Activity: "Initial Document Verification"

          Reverification in C001: 
            Activity: "Document Reverification (Additional)"
          Reverification in C003:
            Activity: "Document Reverification (Adjustment)"

        But note: the context in C001 for the second verification: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided." 
        and in C003: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."

        So we can use these keywords: "Additional" for C001 and "Adjustment" for C003.

 Activity: "Call Customer"
   - In C001: "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs." -> Purpose: Request missing documents.
   - In C002:
        First call: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."
        Second call: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made."
   - In C003: "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return." -> Purpose: Recall customer.

   We can rename:
     C001: "Call Customer (Request Missing Documents)"
     C002:
        First call: "Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)"
        Second call: "Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)"
     C003: "Call Customer (Recall Customer)"

   But note: the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case", so we are focusing on the same case. 
   In C002, there are two calls in the same case, so we need to disambiguate between them.

   We can name:
     In C002:
        First call: "Call Customer (Clarification)"
        Second call: "Call Customer (Confirmation)"

   However, we can be more descriptive.

   Alternatively, we can note the sequence:
        First call: "Initial Call to Customer" but that doesn't capture the purpose.

   We decide to use the purpose as in the context.

   So:
     C001: "Customer Information Call (Request Missing Docs)"
        But note: the context says "agent calls to request missing docs", so we can call it "Call for Missing Documents"

     C002:
        First: "Call for Clarification (Account Discrepancy)"
        Second: "Call for Confirmation (Adjustments)"

     C003: "Recall Customer Call"

   But the problem says: "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". We are free to choose names.

   However, to keep it concise and clear, we can do:

     C001: "Call Customer (Missing Docs)"
     C002:
        First: "Call Customer (Clarify Discrepancy)"
        Second: "Call Customer (Confirm Adjustment)"
     C003: "Call Customer (Recall)"

   But note: in C002, the context of the first call is "clarify account discrepancy", so we can use "Clarify" and "Confirm" is clear.

 Activity: "Adjust Account"
   This appears in C002 and C003. 
   In C002: "Adjust account details internally after call." -> after the first call, to fix a discrepancy.
   In C003: "Internal correction due to missing info." -> after the call that was to recall the customer? Actually, after the call and before the second document verification.

   But note: in C003, the context says "missing info", whereas in C002 it was due to a discrepancy found in the call.

   We can rename:
        In C002: "Adjust Account (Discrepancy Correction)"
        In C003: "Adjust Account (Missing Information)"

   However, note that the problem does not require renaming across cases, only within the same case. In each case, it appears only once. So we might not need to rename? But the problem says: "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" - but here it doesn't. So we don't need to change? 

   But wait: the task says "activity names appear multiple times within a single case", so for activities that appear multiple times in the same case we rename. For activities that appear only once in a case, we don't need to? However, the prompt says "carry different contextual meanings depending on when and how they occur" - and we are seeing that the same activity name in different cases (or even in the same case if it appears multiple times) has different meanings.

   The problem does not explicitly say to rename activities that appear only once per case, but note the first sentence: "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case". So we are only required to change when there are multiple occurrences in the same case. 

   Therefore, we do not need to change "Adjust Account" because it only appears once per case. However, we note that the same activity name in different cases has different contexts. But the problem does not require us to change the name across cases. We are only to disambiguate within the same case.

   So we leave "Adjust Account" as is.

   But wait: the task says "activity names appear multiple times within a single case" - so we are only concerned with multiple occurrences in the same case. Therefore, we only need to worry about "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer".

   However, note that in C002 we have two "Call Customer" in the same case -> so we do need to change that.

   And in C001 and C003 we have two "Verify Documents" per case -> so we change those.

   And in C001 we have one "Call Customer" and in C003 one "Call Customer", so we don't need to change the name in those cases? But wait: the problem does not require changing if it only appears once. However, we are renaming the same activity name in different contexts even if it's only one occurrence? Actually, the task says to rename the activities that appear multiple times within the same case. So for the same activity name that appears only once in a case, we don't change? 

   But note: the activity "Call Customer" in C001 has a different context than in C002's first call? But that's across cases. The problem doesn't require that. We are only to disambiguate within the same case.

   So we will change:
      - "Verify Documents" within the same case (when it appears multiple times in a case)
      - "Call Customer" within the same case (when it appears multiple times in a case)

   For the same activity that appears only once in a case, we leave the name as is? But note: the task says "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". It might be that the same activity name in different contexts (even across cases) should be renamed? However, the problem specifically says "within a single case" for the recurrence.

   Let's re-read: "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case" -> so the problem is about multiple occurrences in the same case. Therefore, we are only required to change when there is more than one occurrence of the same activity in the same case.

   So we will change:
      - In C001: two "Verify Documents" -> we change the second one to reflect the context (reverification after additional documents)
      - In C002: two "Call Customer" -> change the first to "Call for Clarification" and the second to "Call for Confirmation", and also change the activity names? Actually, we are to rename the activity name for each occurrence to reflect the context.

      - In C003: two "Verify Documents" -> change the second one to reflect the context (reverification after account adjustment). Also, note that in C003 we have one "Call Customer", so we don't change that. And we have one "Adjust Account", so we don't change that.

   However, note that in C001 we also have one "Call Customer", so we don't change that? But wait: the context of that call is different from the calls in C002. But the problem does not require cross-case disambiguation. So we leave it as "Call Customer" for C001? 

   But that would be confusing because in the same log we have a "Call Customer" in C001 and two different ones in C002. The task does not require that we make the entire log have a consistent naming across cases, only that within a case the same activity name that appears multiple times is disambiguated.

   However, the problem says: "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". It might be that the same activity name in different contexts (even in different cases) should be renamed? But the problem states: "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case". So we are to focus on within-case.

   To be safe, we will only change the activities that are repeated within the same case. For activities that appear only once in a case, we leave the name as is, even if the same name in another case has a different meaning.

   But note: the problem says "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case", meaning that the issue is that in one case, the same activity name is used for different things. So we are to fix that. For occurrences in different cases, we don't have to unify because they might be the same or different? The problem does not require that.

   Therefore, we do:

   For "Verify Documents":
     - In C001: 
          First: "Initial Document Verification"
          Second: "Document Reverification (Additional)"
     - In C002: 
          Only one: leave as "Verify Documents" -> but wait, we are changing the first in C001 and C003? We are changing the first occurrence in C001 to "Initial Document Verification", so we should change the first in C003 as well? And what about C002? We should change the first in every case to "Initial Document Verification" to be consistent? 

        Actually, the problem does not say to change every occurrence. We are to change the ones that are repeated in the same case? But note: in C002, we have only one "Verify Documents", so we don't change? 

        However, if we change the first in C001 and C003 to "Initial Document Verification", then in C002 we have one that is the initial and is named "Verify Documents", which might be confusing when comparing cases? 

        We are not required to make the entire log have a universal naming? The task is to disambiguate within a case. But if we change the first in C001 and C003, then we should also change the first in C002 to be consistent? 

        Alternatively, we can change every first occurrence of "Verify Documents" in every case to "Initial Document Verification", and then the second occurrence to a more specific name. In C002, we don't have a second, so we leave it as "Initial Document Verification". 

        That would be consistent.

   Similarly, for "Call Customer", we are going to change the two in C002 to different names. We leave the one in C001 and the one in C003 as "Call Customer"? But that might be acceptable because they are in different cases. 

   However, the problem does not require that. We are only to fix the multiple occurrences in the same case.

   Let's do:

   For "Verify Documents":
     - Every first occurrence in a case: "Initial Document Verification"
     - Every second occurrence in a case:
          In C001: "Document Reverification (Additional Docs)"
          In C003: "Document Reverification (After Adjustment)"

   For "Call Customer":
     - In C001: we leave as "Call Customer" (since only one occurrence)
     - In C002: 
          First: "Clarification Call"
          Second: "Confirmation Call"
     - In C003: we leave as "Call Customer"

   But note: the problem says "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". It doesn't say we have to change every occurrence of the activity. We are only required to change the ones that are ambiguous because they appear multiple times in the same case.

   However, we are also allowed to change the first occurrence? Yes, because we are renaming the activity to reflect context, and the first occurrence is the initial one. 

   But we must be cautious: the task says "for each activity that recurs", meaning only the recurring ones? 

   We'll follow the rule: only change the activities that are repeated within the same case. So:

   - In C001: 
        First "Verify Documents": we change to "Initial Document Verification" -> because without changing it, the two would both be "Verify Documents" and we need to disambiguate.
        Second "Verify Documents": change to "Document Reverification (Additional Docs)"

   - In C002:
        First "Call Customer": change to "Call for Clarification"
        Second "Call Customer": change to "Call for Confirmation"

   - In C003:
        First "Verify Documents": change to "Initial Document Verification"
        Second "Verify Documents": change to "Document Reverification (After Adjustment)"

   We leave the other occurrences of these activities (if they appear only once) unchanged.

   So:

   Revised Log:

   For C001:
      Initiate Request -> unchanged
      Initial Document Verification (was first Verify Documents)
      Call Customer -> unchanged (only one, so we don't change)
      Submit Additional -> unchanged
      Document Reverification (Additional Docs) (was second Verify Documents)
      Approve Request -> unchanged

   For C002:
      Initiate Request -> unchanged
      Verify Documents -> unchanged (only one in C002, so we leave as is? But wait, we changed the first in C001 and C003? We are only changing the ones that are repeated? So we leave the one in C002 as "Verify Documents" because it's the only occurrence in that case. 
        However, note that in C002 we are changing the two "Call Customer", but the "Verify Documents" is only one -> so we leave it.

   For C003:
      Initiate Request -> unchanged
      Initial Document Verification (was first Verify Documents)
      Call Customer -> unchanged (only one)
      Adjust Account -> unchanged (only one)
      Document Reverification (After Adjustment) (was second Verify Documents)
      Approve Request -> unchanged

   But wait: in C002 we have two "Call Customer", so we change both? 

   Revised C002:
      Initiate Request
      Verify Documents   [unchanged, only one]
      Call for Clarification  [was first Call Customer]
      Adjust Account
      Call for Confirmation   [was second Call Customer]
      Approve Request

   However, note that in C002 the first call is before "Adjust Account" and the second is after. We are renaming the activity name, so we change the string in the activity column.

   Now, let's write the revised log.

   We'll create a new table with the same structure, but with the activities renamed as above.

   Additionally, we must justify the naming choices.

   Justification:

   For "Verify Documents" in C001:
      - First occurrence: Renamed to "Initial Document Verification" because it is the first time documents are being verified in the case, as part of the initial processing.
      - Second occurrence: Renamed to "Document Reverification (Additional Docs)" because the context indicates it was re-checked after the customer submitted additional documents.

   For "Verify Documents" in C003:
      - First occurrence: Renamed to "Initial Document Verification" for the same reason as in C001 (it's the first verification in the case).
      - Second occurrence: Renamed to "Document Reverification (After Adjustment)" because the context indicates it was re-verified after an account adjustment.

   For "Call Customer" in C002:
      - First occurrence: Renamed to "Call for Clarification" because the context states it was to clarify an account discrepancy.
      - Second occurrence: Renamed to "Call for Confirmation" because the context states it was a follow-up to confirm adjustments.

   Note: The "Call Customer" in C001 and C003 remain unchanged because they occur only once in their respective cases and do not require disambiguation within the case.

   Similarly, the "Verify Documents" in C002 remains unchanged because it occurs only once in that case.

   Let's write the revised log:

   Note: We are changing the activity name in the log. The other columns (Case ID, Timestamp, Resource, Additional Context) remain the same.

   Revised Event Log:

   | Case ID | Activity                         | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                                                 |

### Renaming Justification  
Key contextual clues used for disambiguation:

1. **`Verify Documents`  Differentiated by sequence and purpose**  
   - **First occurrence** (C001/C002/C003): Renamed to **`Initial Document Verification`**  
     *Clue: First verification step in the workflow, typically for initial identity checks.*  
   - **Second occurrence** (C001/C003): Renamed based on context:  
     - C001: **`Document Re-Verification (Completeness)`**  
       *Clue: Re-check after customer submitted additional documents.*  
     - C003: **`Document Re-Verification (Adjustment)`**  
       *Clue: Re-check after internal account adjustments made earlier in the case.*  

2. **`Call Customer`  Differentiated by purpose**  
   - C001: **`Call: Missing Documents Request`**  
     *Clue: Call triggered by incomplete verification, specifically to request missing docs.*  
   - C002 (Two calls):  
     - First: **`Call: Discrepancy Clarification`**  
       *Clue: Proactive call to resolve an account discrepancy flagged during initial processing.*  
     - Second: **`Call: Confirmation of Adjustments`**  
       *Clue: Follow-up call after internal adjustments, confirming resolution.*  
   - C003: **`Call: Customer Recall`**  
     *Clue: Call to retrieve a customer who stepped away during in-person branch processing.*  

3. **Other Activity Name Enhancements**  
   - `Initiate Request`  `Branch Initiation` (C003 only):  
     *Clue: Walk-in branch submission distinct from web portal initiation.*  
   - `Approve Request`  `Final Approval`:  
     *Clue: Standardized term for the concluding approval step across all cases.*  
   - `Submit Additional`  `Submit Additional Documents`:  
     *Clue: Clarifies action context (document submission flow).*

### Key Observations  
- **Contextual meaning hinges on position and purpose**:  
  - `Verify Documents` as initial vs. re-verification step.  
  - `Call Customer` differentiated by trigger (missing docs vs. discrepancy vs. physical absence).  
- **Resource and workflow channel matter**:  
  - Web portal vs. branch submission.  
  - BackOfficeAgent vs. BranchOfficer verification.  
- **Revised names explicitly capture**:  
  - Sequential actions (initial/re-verification).  
  - Triggers (discrepancy, recall, missing docs).  
  - Outcomes (confirmation, completeness checks, adjustments).  

This disambiguation allows clear visibility into workflow variations while preserving granular process insights.
