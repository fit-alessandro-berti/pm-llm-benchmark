Proposed high-level activities and mapping rules

High-level activity 1: Material Preparation
Definition and rationale:
- Purpose: Prepare and condition the raw material before any joining/assembly.
- Logic: Sequential, tightly timed, starts with acquisition/identification of material, continues with placement/alignment, and conditioning (preheat). Activities are cohesive, preparatory, and involve operator handling, robotics alignment, and heating.
- Temporal: Occur contiguously at the start of each case.
- Resources: Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit.

Included low-level events:
- Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)
- Scan barcode (Operator A)
- Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)
- Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)
- Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)

High-level activity 2: Welding and Joint Formation
Definition and rationale:
- Purpose: Execute the primary joining operation.
- Logic: Tool acquisition followed by welding actions are a cohesive unit of work to form joints.
- Temporal: Immediate sequence after preparation; short intervals; same operator resource for welding.
- Resources: Operator B.

Included low-level events:
- Pick up welding tool (Operator B)
- Weld corner A (Operator B)
- Weld corner B (Operator B)

High-level activity 3: In-process Quality Verification
Definition and rationale:
- Purpose: Check the quality of the just-completed welds prior to downstream finishing.
- Logic: Measurement of weld integrity is a QA action that gates progression.
- Temporal: Immediately follows welding; single sensor event.
- Resources: Quality Sensor #1.

Included low-level events:
- Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)

High-level activity 4: Surface Finishing and Curing
Definition and rationale:
- Purpose: Apply and cure protective coating to complete surface treatment.
- Logic: Coating application followed by drying are intrinsically linked finishing steps.
- Temporal: Occur consecutively after QA measurement.
- Resources: Coating Unit, Heating Unit.

Included low-level events:
- Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)
- Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)

High-level activity 5: Final Visual Inspection
Definition and rationale:
- Purpose: Human verification of final product state after finishing.
- Logic: Distinct end-of-line quality gate, separate from sensor-based measurement.
- Temporal: Last step in the case sequence.
- Resources: Operator C.

Included low-level events:
- Visual check (Operator C)

Reusable grouping rules

1) Segment by case: Group events by CaseID, then sort by Timestamp.

2) Material Preparation: Start from first event; include consecutive events until first joining operation begins. Heuristics:
   - Activities keywords: retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat, clean, fixture, clamp.
   - Resources often: operators handling, robots aligning, heating units preconditioning.
   - Stop when a joining/assembly keyword appears (e.g., weld, solder, screw, bond, rivet) or when a specific tool pick-up related to joining occurs.

3) Welding and Joint Formation: From tool acquisition for joining through all immediate joining actions.
   - Start triggers: pick up welding tool; weld/solder/bond/rivet/screw.
   - End triggers: first downstream QA or finishing action (e.g., measure/inspect, coat, paint).

4) In-process Quality Verification: Sensor or automated measurement right after joining.
   - Keywords: measure, integrity, torque check, dimensional check, sensor reading.
   - Ends when downstream finishing begins.

5) Surface Finishing and Curing: Application and curing/drying of protective or cosmetic layers.
   - Keywords: apply coating/paint/adhesive, cure, dry, bake, polish.
   - Ends before final visual inspection or packaging.

6) Final Visual Inspection: Human/operator inspection or sign-off at end of process.
   - Keywords: visual check, final inspection, QA sign-off, approve/reject.

Notes and extensions
- If rework occurs (e.g., integrity below threshold), insert a Rework step between QA and Finishing; capture repeated joining and re-measure loops.
- If additional steps exist in the full log (e.g., packaging, labeling, palletization), add a Final Packaging and Dispatch activity after final inspection.
- Time gaps: If large idle times occur, maintain step boundaries; do not merge across non-productive delays unless activities are still within the same logical phase.
- Resource-based hints: Tool pick-up events often signal the start of an assembly/joining step; quality sensors indicate QA phases; ovens/heaters after coating indicate curing within finishing.
