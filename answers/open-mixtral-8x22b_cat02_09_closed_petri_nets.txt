Opposite Concept:

1. Sink Place: A source place is a place in a Petri net that only has outgoing arcs, representing the source of tokens. The opposite concept of a source place is a sink place, which is a place that only has incoming arcs, representing the sink or end of tokens.

More General Concept:

1. Place: A source place is a specific type of place that only has outgoing arcs. The more general concept is simply a place, which is a basic component of a Petri net that holds tokens and is connected to transitions through arcs.

Opposite Concept:

2. Timed Transition: An immediate transition is a type of transition in a Petri net that fires as soon as it is enabled, without any delay. The opposite concept is a timed transition, which has a delay associated with it before it fires after being enabled.

More General Concept:

2. Transition: An immediate transition is a specific type of transition that fires immediately. The more general concept is simply a transition, which is another basic component of a Petri net that represents an event or action that can occur, and is connected to places through arcs.

Opposite Concept:

3. Dead Transition: A live transition is a transition in a Petri net that can always eventually fire, no matter what the current marking is. The opposite concept is a dead transition, which is a transition that can never fire, either because it is never enabled or because it is always disabled by some other transition.

More General Concept:

3. Transition: A live transition is a specific type of transition that can always eventually fire. The more general concept is simply a transition, which is a basic component of a Petri net that represents an event or action that can occur, and is connected to places through arcs.

Opposite Concept:

4. Unbounded Net: A bounded net is a Petri net where the number of tokens in each place is always less than or equal to some finite number, no matter what the current marking is. The opposite concept is an unbounded net, which is a Petri net where the number of tokens in one or more places can grow without bound.

More General Concept:

4. Petri Net: A bounded net is a specific type of Petri net that has a finite number of tokens in each place. The more general concept is simply a Petri net, which is a graphical and mathematical modeling tool used to describe and study systems that are characterized as being concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic.

Opposite Concept:

5. Non-Free Choice Net: A free choice net is a Petri net where every transition has at most one input place, and every place has at most one output transition. The opposite concept is a non-free choice net, which is a Petri net where some transitions have multiple input places, and/or some places have multiple output transitions.

More General Concept:

5. Petri Net: A free choice net is a specific type of Petri net that has certain restrictions on the number of input places and output transitions. The more general concept is simply a Petri net, which is a graphical and mathematical modeling tool used to describe and study systems that are characterized as being concurrent, asynchronous, distributed, parallel, nondeterministic, and/or stochastic.
