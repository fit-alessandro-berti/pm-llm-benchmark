### Normative “Hire-to-Retire” fragment (as reflected by the given activities)
A typical (simplified) control-flow expectation is:

`Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case`

Key logic points:
- **The hiring decision should be based on evaluation steps** (screening + interviews), so it should occur **after** them.
- **Onboarding and payroll** are **post-decision** steps and should not occur before a (positive) decision.
- **Closing** should be the end; core pre-hire steps should not happen after closure.

## Model 1: anomalies
**What the model enforces well**
- `Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates` is correct.
- `Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case` is a clean, normative post-decision chain.
- Payroll is **mandatory** (good for correctness/compliance).

**Anomalies (and why they matter)**
1. **Hiring decision is not forced to wait for interviews (severe).**  
   Because both `Make_Hiring_Decision` and `Conduct_Interviews` only depend on `Screen_Candidates`, the model allows:
   - `... Screen_Candidates  Make_Hiring_Decision  ...` **before** `Conduct_Interviews`.
   This undermines the usual logic “interview then decide”.

2. **Interviews can occur after onboarding/payroll/close (severe/integrity-breaking).**  
   Since `Conduct_Interviews` has no outgoing constraints, it may legally happen *very late*, even after `Close_Case`, e.g.:
   - `Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  Interview`  
   That violates the meaning of “interview” as a pre-hire assessment and breaks case lifecycle integrity.

**Overall characterization:** the model is *mostly structured correctly* but **under-constrains interviews**, making it overly permissive in a way that can invert core pre-hire logic.

## Model 2: anomalies
**What the model enforces well**
- `Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision` is enforced (good).
- Decision precedes onboarding; closure is at the end of the main chain (good).

**Anomalies (and why they matter)**
1. **Screening is decoupled from decision and can happen “whenever” (severe).**  
   `Screen_Candidates` depends only on `Post_Job_Ad` and is not required before `Conduct_Interviews` or `Make_Hiring_Decision`. So the model allows:
   - interviewing and deciding **without prior screening**, and even
   - `... Close_Case  Screen_Candidates` (screening after the case is closed)

2. **Onboarding is modeled as a loop with a silent “redo” step (moderate).**  
   `LOOP(Onboard_Employee, skip)` permits **repeating onboarding arbitrarily many times** (effectively “one or more onboardings”).  
   Rework can exist in reality, but repeating *the entire onboarding activity* multiple times is usually not intended at the control-flow level (it can create duplicate accounts, duplicate provisioning, etc.).

3. **Payroll is optional (XOR with skip) (very severe).**  
   `XOR(Add_to_Payroll, skip)` means an employee may be onboarded and the case closed **without ever being added to payroll**.  
   That’s typically a fundamental violation (legal/compliance and operational impossibility) given the meaning of “hire”.

**Overall characterization:** the model enforces “interview before decision” but introduces **multiple structural deviations**, including one that can negate a core outcome of hiring (payroll setup).

## Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?
**Model 1 is closer to the normative process.**

**Why:**
- Model 1 gets the *post-decision backbone* right and **keeps payroll mandatory**, which is a core integrity requirement.
- Its main issue is an **ordering omission**: it fails to require interviews before the hiring decision (and before closure). This is serious, but it’s essentially a missing dependency.
- Model 2 contains **more and deeper integrity problems**:
  - screening is not functionally tied into the selection logic,
  - onboarding can repeat arbitrarily,
  - and—most critically—**payroll can be skipped** even though onboarding and closure proceed.

**Bottom line:**  
Model 1 is “almost the standard flow but too permissive around interviews,” while Model 2 allows outcomes that contradict the essence of hiring (e.g., onboarded but not paid) and has more systemic control-flow anomalies.
