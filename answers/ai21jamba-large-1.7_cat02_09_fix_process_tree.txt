### **Analysis of the Current Underfitting Process Tree Model**

The current model has the following issues:

1. **Activities in Unrestricted Parallel Execution (AND Operator):**
	- The parallel block (AND operator) allows `Create_Purchase_Order`, `Receive_Goods`, `Receive_Invoice`, `Match_Invoice_to_PO`, and `Pay_Invoice` to happen in any order.
	- **Unrealistic Scenarios:**
		- For example, `Pay_Invoice` can occur before `Receive_Goods` or `Receive_Invoice`, which is not domain-appropriate.
		- `Match_Invoice_to_PO` depends on `Receive_Invoice` and `Create_Purchase_Order` but is allowed to occur in parallel with those activities.
2. **No Dependency Between Key Events:**
	- The model does not enforce the logical order of some dependent activities, such as:
		- `Approve_Purchase_Requisition` should precede `Create_Purchase_Order`.
		- `Receive_Invoice` should precede `Match_Invoice_to_PO`.
	- These dependencies are critical to ensure conformance with the Procure-to-Pay process logic.

### **Proposed Corrected Process Tree Model**

To address the issues, the corrected process tree enforces a **strict sequence of dependent activities** and introduces appropriate **exclusion** and **sequence logic**. The model:

- Ensures that each dependent activity occurs only after its prerequisites.
- Removes the parallel block and replaces it with sequences or choices where appropriate.

Here is the corrected **Process Tree (Pseudocode):**

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Sequence 1: Start with requisition and approval
req_approval_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req, approve_req
])

# Sequence 2: Create Purchase Order + Receive Goods (in sequence)
po_goods_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_po, receive_goods
])

# Sequence 3: Receive Invoice + Match Invoice + Pay Invoice (in sequence)
invoice_handling_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    receive_invoice, 
    match_invoice, 
    pay_invoice
])

# Overall Root Process: Sequential Procure-to-Pay logic
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    req_approval_sequence, 
    po_goods_sequence, 
    invoice_handling_sequence, 
    close_case
])
```

### **Explaination of the Corrected Model**

1. **Step 1: Requisition and Approval**
	- `Create_Purchase_Requisition` and `Approve_Purchase_Requisition` occur in sequence, as an order cannot be created until the requisition is approved.
2. **Step 2: Create Purchase Order + Receive Goods**
	- After approval, a `Purchase Order` is created, followed by the receipt of goods, as receiving goods depends on placing the order.
3. **Step 3: Handle Invoice and Payment**
	- The `Receive_Invoice` activity must occur before `Match_Invoice_to_PO`.
	- Once the invoice is matched, `Pay_Invoice` occurs last to ensure payment is only made for verified invoices.
4. **Final Step: Close the Case**
	- After all payments are completed, the case is closed.

### **How the Updated Process Tree Ensures Conformance**

- **Conformance to Process Logic:**
	- Each activity strictly follows the necessary prerequisites.
	- Unrealistic scenarios (e.g., paying an invoice before receiving goods or an invoice) are prevented.
- **Prevention of Unwanted Behavior:**
	- Dependencies such as `Receive_Invoice` before `Match_Invoice_to_PO` are enforced.
	- Activities like `Receive_Goods` naturally occur after `Create_Purchase_Order`.

This updated process tree ensures that all activities follow a logical, domain-appropriate sequence, preventing any out-of-order or parallel execution of dependent activities.
