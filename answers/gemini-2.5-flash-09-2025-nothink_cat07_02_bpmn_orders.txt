The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating an order fulfillment process across four different lanes (pools): **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**.

Here is a breakdown of the process flow in each lane:

### 1. Sales Lane

The process starts here at **"Monday morning"** (a Timer Start Event).

*   **Check order for completeness**: The first task in the process.
*   **Check if customer is already in the database**: After checking completeness, an Exclusive Gateway determines the flow.
    *   **If Customer not in the database**: The flow enters a subprocess called **"Check customer's order"**.
        *   **Add customer to the database**: A task within the subprocess, which also involves interaction with a **database** (Data Store).
    *   **If Customer in the database**: The flow bypasses the "Add customer to the database" task.
*   The flow from both paths converges and exits the subprocess.
*   **Send order details**: The next task. After this task, the process sends a message (indicated by the dashed line and message symbol) labeled **"Order details"** to both the Production and Procurement lanes.
*   **Product sent**: A Message Intermediate Catch Event indicating receipt of confirmation that the product was sent.
*   **Draft invoice**: The final task in the main flow.
*   The process ends with a simple End Event.

### 2. Production Lane

This lane begins when **"Order details arrive"** (Message Start Event from Sales).

*   The process immediately encounters an Inclusive Gateway.
*   **Plan production**: The first task.
*   **Manufacture product**: After planning, an Exclusive Gateway determines the path based on material status.
    *   **Material not faulty**: Proceeds directly to **"Manufacture product"**.
    *   **Material faulty**: A message is sent (indicated by the dashed line and message symbol) to the Procurement lane, and the process waits at a Message Intermediate Catch Event before proceeding to "Manufacture product" (presumably waiting for new materials or compensation).
*   **Manufacture product** is executed, and upon completion, a Message Intermediate Throw Event **"Product complete"** sends a message to the Warehouse lane.
*   The Production process ends with a simple End Event.

### 3. Procurement Lane

This lane also begins when **"Order details arrive"** (Message Start Event from Sales).

*   The process enters the **"Material Compensation Subprocess"**.
    *   **Order materials**: The first task in the subprocess.
    *   A Loop Marker (standard loop) on the "Order materials" task suggests it may be repeated.
    *   **Return material**: An Alternate Flow/Compensation Event (indicated by the dashed line attached to the boundary of "Order materials") suggests this task is related to compensation logic, potentially triggered if materials are faulty.
    *   **Check materials**: After ordering, materials are checked. An Exclusive Gateway (Event-based or similar) is used here.
    *   If materials are satisfactory, the process completes the subprocess.
    *   **Order cancelation**: An alternative path is a Terminate End Event labeled **"Order cancelation"**, which is triggered from the Check materials step.
*   Upon exiting the subprocess, the Procurement process ends with a simple End Event.

### 4. Warehouse Lane

This lane begins when **"Product complete"** (Message Start Event from Production) arrives.

*   **Send product**: The only task in this lane.
*   **Product sent**: Upon completion, a Message Intermediate Throw Event sends the **"Product sent"** message back to the Sales lane.
*   The Warehouse process ends with a simple End Event.

### Overall Flow and Interactions

The diagram uses dashed lines to represent **Message Flow**, indicating communication between the different departments (lanes):

*   **Sales** sends **"Order details"** to **Production** and **Procurement**.
*   **Production** sends **"Product complete"** to **Warehouse**.
*   **Warehouse** sends **"Product sent"** back to **Sales**.
*   There is also communication implicit in the material faulty path between **Production** and **Procurement**.

The process effectively models the steps taken from receiving an order through customer verification, production planning, material acquisition (with compensation logic), manufacturing, and final shipment and invoicing.
