### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

#### **Using Event Log Data for Resource Analysis**
To analyze the performance and behavior of agents and support tiers, I would utilize the event log data to extract the following insights:

- **Workload Distribution:** Calculate the number of tickets handled by each agent/tier, focusing on distribution across tiers (e.g., L1, L2, L3). Identify agents or tiers with consistently high or low workloads.
- **Processing Times:** Measure the average time taken by agents to resolve tickets at each tier. Compare this across agents and tiers to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** Specific to L1 agents, analyze the percentage of tickets resolved during the initial contact without escalation.
- **Ticket Type and Skill Utilization:** Categorize tickets based on their type (e.g., P1-P4 priorities, categories like Hardware, Software, Network) and required skills. Track how often agents with specific skills are assigned tickets that match their expertise.

#### **Process Mining Techniques**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Identify collaboration patterns between agents and tiers. For example, if an L1 agent frequently escalates tickets to the same L2 agent, it may indicate a lack of skill match or inefficiency in the initial assignment.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Visualize handovers and reassignments as a network to understand resource dependencies and identify agents or tiers with high interaction frequencies. This can reveal bottlenecks or over-reliance on certain resources.
- **Role Discovery:** Use clustering techniques to group agents based on their skill profiles and assignment patterns. This helps in identifying specialized roles and whether they are being utilized effectively.

#### **Skill Utilization Analysis**
Analyze the event log to map agent skills against ticket requirements. Use a skills utilization matrix to assess:
- Frequency of tasks requiring specific skills.
- Number of times agents with advanced skills (e.g., L2/L3) are assigned tickets that could be resolved by L1 agents.
- Whether specialized skills are being underutilized or overburdened.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

#### **Bottlenecks and Issues**
- **Insufficient Skilled Resources:** If tickets requiring specific skills (e.g., Database-SQL) are taking longer to resolve, it may indicate a shortage of agents with those skills.
- **Frequent Reassignments:** Track the frequency of reassignments per ticket and identify patterns (e.g., tickets being reassigned multiple times between tiers or agents).
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments:** Analyze L1 assignment success rates and compare them with escalations. Identify tickets that could have been resolved by L1 if assigned correctly.
- **Overloaded Agents:** Use workload distribution metrics to identify agents or tiers with disproportionately high ticket volumes.
- **SLA Breaches:** Correlate SLA breaches with ticket attributes (e.g., priority, category) and agent performance (e.g., resolution times, escalations).

#### **Quantifying Impact**
- Calculate the average delay caused by reassignments: For each reassignment, measure the time difference between the current assignment and the next. Sum these delays across all tickets.
- Determine the percentage of SLA breaches tied to skill mismatches: Analyze tickets where the required skill was not available in the assigned tier.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

#### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Assignment Rules:** The current mix of round-robin and manual escalation may not prioritize skills or workload effectively.
- **Skill Profiles:** Inaccurate or incomplete skill profiles may lead to agents being assigned tickets outside their expertise.
- **Ticket Categorization:** Poor initial categorization (e.g., misclassification of tickets) may result in incorrect assignments.
- **Workload Visibility:** Agents may not have real-time visibility into the workload of others, leading to uneven distribution.
- **L1 Empowerment:** L1 agents may lack the training or authority to resolve certain issues, leading to unnecessary escalations.

#### **Using Process Mining for Root Cause Analysis**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with smooth assignments to those with multiple reassignments to identify patterns in how tickets are handled.
- **Decision Mining:** Analyze the decision points in the process (e.g., when to escalate) to identify where decisions deviate from optimal paths.

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

#### **Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing**
- **Objective:** Ensure tickets are assigned to agents based on their skill profiles, reducing skill mismatches and reassignments.
- **Implementation:** Use a weighted skill-based algorithm that prioritizes agents with higher proficiency in the required skill. Input: Agent skill profiles, ticket skill requirements. Output: Optimal assignments.
- **Benefits:** Reduces reassignments, improves SLA compliance, and enhances agent utilization.

#### **Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment**
- **Objective:** Distribute tickets evenly across agents based on current workload and availability.
- **Implementation:** Use a dynamic assignment algorithm that considers queue lengths, agent capacity, and pending tasks. Input: Real-time workload data, agent availability. Output: Balanced assignments.
- **Benefits:** Reduces overload, improves FCR rates, and ensures more efficient use of resources.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment**
- **Objective:** Use historical data to predict ticket complexity and required skills, enabling proactive assignment.
- **Implementation:** Train a predictive model on ticket attributes (e.g., category, description) and agent expertise to forecast the best assignment. Input: Ticket text, historical data. Output: Proactive resource allocation.
- **Benefits:** Accelerates resolution time, minimizes escalations, and improves agent efficiency.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### **Simulation**
- Use process simulation tools (e.g., AnyLogic, Bizagi) to model the current process and test the impact of new assignment strategies. Input: Process models, historical data. Output: Predictions on resolution times, SLA compliance, and resource utilization.

#### **Monitoring**
- Implement process mining dashboards to track KPIs such as:
  - SLA compliance rate per tier.
  - Average resolution time for each ticket category.
  - Reassignment frequency and delay per ticket.
- Use histograms and heatmaps to visualize resource utilization and identify emerging bottlenecks.
