Okay, I need to tackle this problem step by step. Let me start by understanding what exactly is being asked. The task is to identify cases with performance issues in an insurance claims processing system and determine why they're taking longer. The root causes could be related to the resource (the person handling it), the region, or the complexity of the claim. 

First, I should figure out which cases are taking significantly longer. To do that, I need to calculate the lead time for each case. The lead time is the total time from when the claim was submitted until it was closed. 

Looking at the event log, each case has multiple events. Let me list out each case and compute the duration between the first and last event timestamps. 

Starting with Case 2001:
- Submit Claim: 2024-04-01 09:00
- Close Claim: 2024-04-01 10:30
That's 1 hour and 30 minutes. Seems quick.

Case 2002:
- Submit at 09:05 on 2024-04-01
- Close at 11:00 on 2024-04-02. Let's see: From April 1 09:05 to April 2 11:00. That's 24 hours minus 09:05 plus 13 hours and 55 minutes. Wait, maybe easier to calculate total hours. From 09:05 to next day 09:05 is 24 hours, then from there to 11:00 is another 2 hours. So total 26 hours. Wait, actually, just subtract the two times. Let's convert to hours. 

Submit time (S) = April 1 09:05
Close time (C) = April 2 11:00

Time difference is (April 2 - April 1 = 1 day) plus 2 hours (from 9:05 to 11:00). So 1 day and 2 hours total. Since a day is 24 hours, that's 26 hours. 

Case 2003:
- Submit: 2024-04-01 09:10
- Close: 2024-04-03 09:30. 

From April 1 to April 3 is 2 days. From 09:10 to 09:30 on the 3rd is another 2 days and 20 minutes (since from 9:10 to next day 9:10 is 24 hours, then another 24, plus the extra 20 minutes). Wait, let's compute it properly. The start is April 1 09:10, end is April 3 09:30. So total days: 2 days, so 48 hours, plus 20 minutes. Total about 48h20m. 

Case 2004:
- Submit at 09:20, close at 10:45 on the same day (April 1). So duration is 1 hour 25 minutes. Fast.

Case 2005:
- Submit: April 1 09:25
- Close: April 4 14:30. 

From April 1 to April 4 is 3 days. Let's do exact time difference:
From April 1 09:25 to April 4 14:30. Let's compute days and hours:
Each day is 24h. 3 days is 72 hours. From 09:25 to 14:30 on the fourth day. Wait, actually, the total difference is (April 4 - April 1) is 3 days, but the exact time difference would be 3 days minus 09:25 plus 14:30? Wait no, better to compute as total hours. 

Alternatively, use the start and end times. Let me note all the durations first, then compare.

Calculating all durations:

Case 2001:
Close time minus submit: 10:30 - 9:00 = 1.5 hours (1h30m)

Case 2002:
Close is April 2 11:00 minus April 1 09:05. Let me calculate in hours:

April 1 09:05 to April 2 09:05 is 24 hours. Then from 09:05 to 11:00 on April 2 is 1h55m. Total 24h + 1h55m = 25h55m  26 hours.

Case 2003:
Submit: April 1 09:10
Close: April 3 09:30. 

April 1 to April 3 is 2 days, so 48 hours. From 09:10 to 09:30 next day is 24h + 20 minutes, but over two days. Wait, actually, the duration is (April 3 09:30 - April 1 09:10). Let's compute days between:

April 1 09:10 to April 3 09:10 is exactly 48 hours (2 days). Then add the remaining 20 minutes (since close is at 09:30). So total 48h20m.

Case 2004: same day, 1h25m.

Case 2005:
Submit April 1 09:25
Close April 4 14:30. Let's compute:

From April 1 09:25 to April 4 09:25 is 3 days (72 hours). Then add the extra 5 hours and 5 minutes (from 9:25 to 14:30 is 5h5m). Total 72 +5h5m = 77h5m  77.08 hours.

So the durations are:

2001: ~1.5h

2002: ~26h

2003: ~48h20m  48.33h

2004: ~1.4h (but maybe 1h25m, so 1.416h)

2005: ~77h

So comparing these, the average or what's considered "significantly longer". Looking at the numbers, cases 2003 and 2005 are much longer. The others are under a day except 2002 which took a day and a bit, but 2003 and 2005 are way longer. Let's see the exact numbers again.

Wait, 2002 took just over a day (26 hours), but 2003 took just over two days (48 hours plus 20 mins) and 2005 took nearly 3.2 days (77 hours). So clearly 2003 and 2005 have the longest durations. So those are the cases with performance issues.

Next, I need to analyze why these cases are taking longer. Let's look at the attributes for each case:

Case 2003: Region A, Complexity High.

Case 2005: Region B, Complexity High.

So high complexity seems to be a common factor, but let's check if that's the only cause.

Looking at the activities in each case.

Case 2002 (26h, which is longer than 2001 which was quick). 2002 is in Region B, Complexity Medium, with a Request Additional Documents step. Let me check the steps.

Case 2002 steps:

Submit (09:05), Evaluate (09:45), then Request Docs at 14:00 (same day, so 4.25 hours after evaluate). Then next activity is Approve on April 2 at 10:00. 

Wait, let's see the timestamps:

Case 2002 timeline:

- Apr1 9:05: Submt

- Apr1 9:45: Evaluate

- Apr1 14:00 (2:00 PM): Request Docs (took 4.25 hours between evaluate and request docs? Wait, actually the next event after Evaluate is Request Docs at 14:00, so that's 4.25 hours after Evaluate, but that might not be the main issue. The next event after that is Approve on April 2 at 10:00. So between Request Docs and Approve, there's a gap. Let's see the time between the last Request Docs (April 2?) Wait wait, looking at the data:

Wait the case 2002's events:

- The Request Additional Documents is on the same day, April 1 at 14:00.

Then the next event is Approve Claim on April 2 10:00. So that's a gap of overnight. So from Apr1 14:00 to Apr2 10:00 is 22 hours. That might be a big delay between Request and Approve.

Wait, but maybe the Request Additional Documents could take time to get from the customer, but in the log, the next step after Request is immediately the Approve? Wait, looking at the log:

Looking at the log for 2002:

After the first Request Docs (April 1 14:00), the next step is Approve on April 2 10:00. So that 26 hours? Maybe the submitter had to wait for the documents, but maybe the adjuster is taking time? Hmm. Or maybe there are multiple Request Docs steps? No, there's only one in 2002. Wait, no, in 2002, after the first Request Docs on April 1 14:00, then the next activity is Approve on April 2 10:00. So that's a 26-hour gap? Or maybe the time between the last Request Docs and Approve is the main issue.

But regardless, the total duration is 26 hours, which is longer than 2001's 1.5 hours but maybe acceptable? But since the other cases with high complexity are taking even longer (2003 and 2005), maybe those are the main issues. The question says "significantly longer", so perhaps 2003 and 2005 are the main ones. Let's confirm:

Looking at the durations again:

2001: ~1.5h

2002: ~26h (about a day and 2h)

2003: ~48.33h (about 2 days)

2005: ~77h (about 3.2 days)

So 2003 and 2005 are the ones with significantly longer durations. 

Now, let's analyze the attributes:

First, Complexity:

- 2003: Complexity High

- 2005: Complexity High

2002 is Medium, but still took longer than 2001 (which was low). So maybe high complexity contributes, but let's check others.

Looking at Resources and Region:

Case 2003: Region A, handled by resources like Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill (Approve). The complexity is High, and the steps include multiple Request Additional Documents. Let me check the steps in detail:

Case 2003's events:

- Submit (09:10)

- Evaluate (09:40)

- Then two Request Docs steps on the same day April1: at 11:00 and 17:00 (5pm). Then the next step is Approve on April 2 16:00 (4pm). Wait, wait looking at the data:

Wait for Case 2003's log:

The log shows:

After Evaluate (09:40 on April 1), then two Request Docs steps on April1: at 10am and 5pm. Then Approve is on April2 16:00 (4pm). Then Pay on April3 09:00, and Close at 09:30.

Wait, so after the last Request Docs (April1 17:00), the next step is Approve at April2 16:00. That's a 23-hour gap between the last Request Docs and Approve. That could be a delay.

But the main point is the total duration. Now, the high complexity might require more steps, like multiple document requests, which take time. High complexity might require more back-and-forth, leading to longer process.

Case 2005:

Complexity High, Region B.

Looking at the steps for 2005:

After Submit and Evaluate, there are three Request Docs steps on April1 (11:30, then on April2 17:00 (next day?), then April3 15:00? Wait, let me check the data for 2005:

Case 2005's log:

- Submit: 09:25

Evaluate: 09:50 (so 25 minutes later?)

Then Request Docs first at 11:30 (on same day), then another on the same day? Wait, looking at the entries:

Looking at the table for 2005:

The Request Docs entries are on:

- 2024-04-01 11:30

- 2024-04-02 17:00 (next day)

- 2024-04-03 15:00 (third day)

So three Request Docs steps over three days? Then Approve on April4 10:00. 

So the multiple Request Docs steps would take time because each request may require waiting for the customer to reply, but the log shows the requests as being initiated by the insurer, but perhaps the time between the Requests and the next steps is taking time. But the main point is the total duration is over 3 days.

Now, considering the attributes:

Case 2003 (Region A, High Complexity):

They had two Request Docs steps on the same day, but then a delay until next day for Approve. The high complexity might require more checks, but the multiple document requests (even if done quickly) might lead to longer processing. Also, the Approve was done by Manager_Bill instead of the usual Ann? Maybe different manager? Not sure yet.

Case 2005 (Region B, High Complexity):

Three Request Docs steps on three different days, indicating multiple back and forth, which adds time. Also, the Approve was done by Manager_Bill as well, but maybe the region B's processing is slower?

Now, let's check the other attributes:

For 2003: Region A, Complexity High, handled by Adjuster_Mike (for Evaluate and Requests), but the Approve is by Manager_Bill instead of Ann.

Case 2005: Region B, Complexity High, Adjuster_Lisa is the one handling the requests, and the Approve is by Manager_Bill again. 

Looking at the Resources:

Looking at the Adjuster for high complexity cases:

In 2003, Adjuster_Mike is handling the Evaluate and the two Request Docs. But in 2005, Adjuster_Lisa is handling multiple requests. Maybe some adjusters are slower?

Alternatively, maybe the high complexity claims naturally take longer because they need more steps, but also, the number of Request Docs steps could be the cause.

Additionally, looking at the regions:

Cases in Region A (2001, 2003) and Region B (2002,2004,2005).

2003 is in Region A, 2005 in B. So maybe both regions have issues with high complexity, but maybe the problem is more the complexity.

Now, comparing cases with High Complexity:

Compare the High Complexity cases (2003 and 2005) with others. The low complexity cases (2001 and 2004) are much faster, so high complexity is a strong factor. 

Additionally, looking at the number of Request Docs steps:

- 2001: No Request Docs (since it went straight to Approve).

- 2002: 1 Request Docs.

- 2003: 2 Request Docs steps.

- 2005: 3 Request Docs steps.

So the number of Request Docs increases with complexity, and that's causing more time. Each Request Docs step adds time, perhaps because waiting for customer to reply, but also the time between the requests could be part of the process.

But the total duration for 2003 is around 48h20m (2 days) and 2005 is 77h (~3.2 days). The difference between them could be other factors. 

Looking at the regions, Case 2003 (A) took ~2 days, 2005 (B) took ~3.2 days. Maybe Region B is slower even with same complexity?

Also, looking at the resources, for example, the Approve step in 2003 was done by Manager_Bill (vs Manager_Ann in 2001 and 2002). Maybe Manager_Bill is slower? Or maybe the Approve step in 2005's case took longer? Let me check the Approve to Pay steps:

Case 2003:

Approve is on April2 16:00 (4pm). Then Pay is next day at 09:00, so that's a 17-hour gap (from 16:00 to next day 09:00 is 17 hours. Maybe overnight.

Case 2005:

Approve is on April4 10:00, then Pay same day at 14:00 (so 4 hours later). So the Approve step was on the 4th, but the Approve was on the 4th, but the submit was on 1st, so the delay is before that.

Wait, the main delays are probably in the Request Docs steps and the time between steps.

Alternatively, looking at the steps between each activity to find bottlenecks.

Alternatively, the total duration is mainly caused by the high complexity leading to more steps (multiple Requests), and the time between each step. 

Let me look at the number of steps and their timing:

Case 2003:

Steps:

Submit (9:10)  Evaluate (9:40)  Request Docs (10:00 and 17:00 on same day. Then Approve next day at 16:00 (April2), then Pay on April3. 

Wait, after the last Request Docs on April1 17:00, the next step is Approve on April2 16:00. That's a 23-hour gap. So maybe the approver took time after the last docs.

Case 2005:

After the first Request on April1 11:30, then another on April2 17:00, and April3 15:00. Each of these would require waiting for the customer to reply, which adds time. Each time they request docs, they have to wait, and each Request is a step, but also the time between those requests and the next steps. The Approve is on April4, so between the last Request (April3 15:00) and Approve on April4 10:00: that's 27 hours. 

So high complexity leads to more steps (multiple Requests), each adding time, perhaps because the customer takes time to send the docs, leading to delays. Also, maybe the adjuster handling it (Adjuster_Mike or Lisa) is taking longer between steps?

Alternatively, maybe in Region A vs B, but both have high complexity. 

Now, looking at the Resources:

For Adjusters:

Adjuster_Mike handled 2003's Evaluate and Requests. He is in Region A. 

Adjuster_Lisa handled 2002 and 2005's Evaluate and Requests. 

In 2003, the Adjuster_Mike did 2 Requests on the same day, but the Approve step was handled by Manager_Bike (Bill) instead of Ann?

Wait, in case 2003, the Approve was by Manager_Bike (Manager_Bike? Wait the table shows "Manager_Bike"? Wait in the data for Case 2003, the Approve is by Manager_Bike (assuming that's a typo? Wait in the table:

Looking back at the table:

Case 2003's Approve is by Manager_Bike (assuming that's a typo, but in the log, for Case 2003, the Approve is by Manager_Bike or Manager_Bill? Let me check the exact log.

Looking at the table for Case2003: 

"Approve Claim: Manager_Bike?" Wait, in the data given, for Case 2003, the Approve Claim is "Manager_Bike"? Wait, checking the table:

Looking at the user's given table:

For Case2003:

The Approve Claim is listed as:

Case2003's Approve Claim: "Approve Claim" is on April 2 16:00, resource is "Manager_Bike" or "Manager_Bike"?

Wait actually, looking back at the user's table for Case 2003:

Looking at the table again for 2003:

Row for Approve Claim: "Approve Claim" is on 2024-04-02 16:00, with Resource "Manager_Bike"? Wait according to the user's table:

Looking at the table provided by the user:

Case 2003 has an Approve Claim by "Manager_Bike"? Wait in the provided table:

Looking at the row for Case 2003's Approve Claim:

The row says "Approve Claim" with Resource "Manager_Bike" (assuming "Bill" maybe a typo? Wait, in the user's table:

Wait let me check the exact entries.

Wait looking at the user's data:

Case 2003's Approve Claim is listed as:

"Approve Claim" with Resource "Manager_Bike" (the user's table says "Manager_Bike"?

Wait, in the user's table for Case2003:

The Approve Claim row says "Manager_Bike" or "Manager_Bike"? Wait, actually, let me check the user's exact table entries:

Looking at the user's table for Case2003:

The "Approve Claim" row for Case2003 has "Resource" as "Manager_Bike" (assuming Ann vs Bill? Wait in the table, for Case2003, the Approve is by "Manager_Bike" (Manager Bill, perhaps). The Manager for 2001 was Manager_Ann. Maybe different managers have different processing times?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of Request Docs steps is the key. For 2003 there are two Request Docs steps, and 2005 has three. So the high complexity leads to more steps, each requiring more time, hence longer duration. 

Additionally, the time between the last Request Docs and Approve could be long.

So the root causes would likely be the high complexity leading to multiple Request Docs steps, which take more time. The number of steps and the time between steps is increasing with complexity. 

Additionally, looking at the Resources handling them:

For 2003, the Approver was Manager Bill, whereas in 2005, also Manager Bill. Maybe Manager Bill is slower? But 2002's Approve was done by Manager_Ann (the first two cases in 2001 and 2002 had Manager_Ann. 2003 and 2005 have Manager_Bike (Bill). So maybe Manager Bill is slower, but also, the high complexity cases are assigned to him, so maybe it's the complexity rather than the manager.

Alternatively, perhaps the Region has an impact. 2005 in Region B took longer than 2003 in Region A. But 2003 took 2 days, B took 3.2 days. So maybe Region B is slower even with same complexity. 

Wait let's see:

Case 2003 (Region A, High Complexity): 48h20m

Case 2005 (Region B, High Complexity): 77h (3 days). So B took longer. So Region B might have slower processing even for high complexity. 

Additionally, the number of Request Docs steps: 2 for 2003, 3 for 2005. So more steps mean more time. So high complexity leads to more steps, which causes longer processing.

Now, possible root causes factors:

1. High complexity claims require more steps (multiple Request Docs), leading to longer duration.

2. The number of Request Docs steps is higher for high complexity.

3. Maybe certain regions (like B) take longer for high complexity.

4. The assigned resources: maybe Manager_Bike (Bill) takes longer to approve? But in 2003 and 2005 both were handled by Manager_Bike (Bill), but the durations are different between the two (2003: ~2 days, 2005: ~3.2 days. Hmm, so maybe other factors.

Alternatively, the time between the initial submit and the first Request Docs might vary.

Alternatively, looking at the Adjuster's performance. For 2003, Adjuster_Mike did the Requests on the same day, but maybe in 2005, Adjuster_Lisa took longer between her own steps? 

In 2003, the two Request Docs were on the same day (April1: 10:00 and 17:00, so within the same day. But in 2005, the three Requests are on April1, April2, April3, so spread out over days, leading to more time between steps.

Perhaps the Adjuster's handling time: for example, in 2003, the Adjuster_Mike did two Requests on the same day, but maybe the customer took time to respond, but the log only shows the insurer's actions, so the time between the insurer's requests and the next step could be customer response time, but the log's timestamps are for the insurer's actions, so perhaps the insurer's own steps are taking longer.

Alternatively, maybe in Region B (case2005) the process is slower.

Let me see the steps in 2005:

Case2005:

After each Request Docs, there's a big gap until the next step. The first Request Docs on April1 11:30, next one on April2 17:00 (so next day). That's 29.5 hours between first and second Request. Then another on April3 15:00 (another day). So each Request might be waiting for the customer, but the insurer's own steps between their own actions might be quick, but the total duration includes those waiting times.

However, in the log, the events are the insurer's actions, so the time between events is the processing time by the insurer, but perhaps the customer's response time isn't logged, so the delays between requests are part of the insurer's processing steps?

Hmm, maybe the number of requests is causing more back-and-forth, leading to more time. Since each Request Docs step requires the customer to respond, but the insurer can't proceed until the docs are received, those steps add to the total duration.

Thus, high complexity leads to more document requests, which inherently take more time because they require customer action, hence increasing the total duration.

Therefore, the root causes would be:

- High complexity leading to more Request Docs steps, each requiring customer action, increasing duration.

- The number of Request Docs steps is directly related to complexity.

Additionally, maybe some regions have slower handling even within high complexity. Like Region B's case 2005 took longer than Region A's 2003. Maybe Region B's processes are slower in handling high complexity claims.

Alternatively, the resources: Maybe Manager_Bike (Bill) has longer processing times when approving, but in both high cases, the Approve step's timing:

In 2003, the Approve was on April2 16:00, which is the next day, but after two Request Docs on the same day. The Approve is day 2 at 4pm, so maybe that's prompt, but the Pay step is the next day. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the problem is that high complexity inherently takes longer, but why is 2005 longer than 2003? Maybe the number of Request Docs steps. 2003 has two, 2005 has three. So more steps, more time.

So the main root causes are:

1. High Complexity causing more Request Docs steps, leading to longer durations because each step requires customer input (even if the insurer's own steps are quick, the customer's delay adds time, but in the log, the insurer's steps might include waiting periods. 

2. The number of Request Docs steps is a factor. 

Additionally, in Region B (case2005), Region B took longer than Region A's 2003, so Region B might have longer processing times for high complexity.

Now, the question also asks to check the attributes: Resource, Region, Complexity. 

So possible root causes:

- High complexity claims (Complexity High) have longer durations due to more steps and possible more back-and-forth.

- Higher number of Request Docs steps in high complexity cases.

- Perhaps in Region B, even with same complexity, the processing is slower (2005 took longer than 2003 in Region A).

Additionally, the resources: 

Manager_Bike (Bill) handled both high complexity cases, but 2003 and 2005 had different times. Maybe the number of steps is the key.

Another angle: the Adjuster in 2005 (Adjuster_Lisa) had three Request Docs steps, which may have taken more time between steps. But maybe in Region B, the Adjuster_Lisa is slower in handling or the customer takes longer to respond, but the log doesn't track customer response time.

Alternatively, maybe the Adjuster's efficiency: Maybe Adjuster_Mike in Region A handles high complexity cases faster than Adjuster_Lisa in B?

Alternatively, the Approver: both high complexity cases were handled by Manager_Bike (Bill) but 2003 was in Region A, 2005 in B. Maybe Region B's Approver has slower processing, but since both are the same manager, maybe not. 

Alternatively, the Region B's processes have longer lead times even within the same manager.

Alternatively, the Pay steps: in 2003, the Pay was the next day after Approve (April2's Approve at 16:00, then Pay on April3 09:00 (17 hours later). Maybe Finance handled it the next day.

But the main issue is the number of Requests leading to more steps and waiting time.

So putting this together, the cases with performance issues (long durations) are 2003 and 2005. The root causes:

- High complexity (Complexity High) leading to multiple Requests for Docs, which adds to the duration.

- The Region: Case2005 (Region B) took longer than 2003 (Region A), though both have high complexity, so maybe Region B has slower processing for high complexity claims.

Additionally, the number of Request Docs steps (more steps mean more time between steps, thus longer duration.

So the root causes are linked to Complexity (High), leading to more steps and delays), and possibly regional differences.

Now, for the task, the answer would need to state which cases are problematic (2003 and 2005), then analyze the attributes.

So, the cases with performance issues are 2003 and 2005.

Root causes:

1. High Complexity: Both are High Complexity, leading to multiple Request Docs steps, which require more back-and-forth with customers, increasing duration.

2. Geographic Region: Case2005 (Region B) took longer than 2003 (Region A), also high complexity, but Region B added more time. So Region B might have inefficiencies even with high complexity.

3. The number of Request Docs steps: 2 in 2003, 3 in 2005, leading to more steps and thus longer time.

Additionally, perhaps the specific Adjuster or Manager's performance? For example, Manager_Bike (Bill) perhaps takes longer to process, but since both high cases used him, but one was in A and one in B, maybe it's the region.

Alternatively, looking at the Resources:

In 2003, the Adjuster was Mike in Region A, while in 2005, Adjuster_Lisa in B had to do three Requests. Maybe the Adjuster's efficiency, but that's hard to tell without more data.

Alternatively, the time between the last Request and Approve could be longer in 2005.

Alternatively, perhaps the time between the initial steps and the Approve.

But the main points are complexity and region.

Now, the user also asks for explanations and suggestions.

Possible explanations:

High complexity cases (Complexity High) require more steps (Request Docs), leading to more time. The multiple requests take time between each step (like waiting for customer to respond), but the log shows the insurer's events. Alternatively, the insurer's own process for high complexity takes longer steps between activities.

Region B's high complexity cases (2005) take longer than Region A's (2003), so maybe regional inefficiencies.

Solutions could be:

- Streamline the document request process for high complexity cases, reduce steps where possible.

- Provide additional resources or training for regions handling high complexity claims (like Region B needing more support).

- Automating document collection or improving customer response times for documents.

- Maybe the Approver or specific resources (Manager_Bike) could be a factor, but since both high cases used him, maybe not.

Alternatively, the number of steps (Request Docs) is directly related to complexity, so reducing complexity's impact would help, but complexity is inherent to the claim's nature. 

Alternatively, maybe in Region B, the process for high complexity is slower, so process improvements there.

So to sum up:

Cases with performance issues are 2003 and 2005 due to high complexity requiring more steps (Requests) and possibly regional factors (Region B took longer than A for high complexity).

Now, to structure the answer step by step as per the user's instructions.

First task: Identify the cases with performance issues (long case durations). The longest are 2003 and 2005.

Second: Analyze the attributes.

So the answer should structure:

1. Identify Cases: 2003 and 2005.

2. Analyze attributes:

- Complexity High for both.

- Region: 2003 (A), 2 days), 2005 (B, 3.2 days). So Region B's high complexity cases are slower.

- Resources: Both had Manager_Bike (Bill approving, so maybe not the resource, but the region.

- Number of Request Docs steps: 2 vs 3.

Thus, the root causes are:

- High complexity leading to more Request Docs steps (direct cause).

- Regional differences (Region B taking longer than A for high complexity).

Additionally, the multiple Request Docs steps (more for higher complexity) contribute significantly.

3. Propose explanations and solutions based on these.

So explanations:

High complexity necessitates more documentation, leading to multiple Requests and longer wait times between steps.

Region B has longer durations for high complexity, perhaps due to inefficiencies in that region's process.

Solutions could include:

- Streamlining documentation requests, maybe reducing the need for multiple steps.

- Providing faster processing channels for high complexity cases in Region B.

- Training for Regions to handle high complexity cases more efficiently.

- Automating document submission to reduce delays.

Alright, I think that's the path. Now I'll structure this into the required sections.

**1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues:**  
The cases with significantly longer lead times are:  
- **Case 2003**: Took **48.5 hours (2 days 0.3 hours)** to close.  
- **Case 2005**: Took **77 hours (3.2 days)** to close.  

Other cases (e.g., 2001, 2002, 2004) were resolved within 1 day, except 2002 (26 hours), which is longer than low/medium complexity but not as extreme as the high-complexity cases).
