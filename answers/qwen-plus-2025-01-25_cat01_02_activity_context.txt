### Step 1: Identifying Recurring Activities and Their Contextual Differences

From the event log, we observe that the following activities recur within cases:

1. **Verify Documents**: Appears multiple times in Cases C001, C002, and C003.
   - First occurrence: Initial document verification.
   - Subsequent occurrences: Re-verification after additional information is provided or adjustments are made.

2. **Call Customer**: Appears multiple times in Cases C001, C002, and C003.
   - First occurrence: To request missing information or clarify discrepancies.
   - Subsequent occurrences: Follow-up calls to confirm actions taken or request further action.

3. **Adjust Account**: Appears once in Cases C002 and C003 but could potentially recur in more complex scenarios.
   - First occurrence: Adjustment based on initial findings.
   - Subsequent occurrences (if any): Further adjustments after re-evaluation.

### Step 4: Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Initial Document Verification**: This activity refers to the first time documents are checked, typically during the early stages of the process.
   - **Re-verify Documents After Update**: This activity occurs after new information or corrections have been made, requiring a second round of verification.

2. **Call Customer**:
   - **Request Missing Information**: The first call is typically made to gather additional details or clarify discrepancies.
   - **Follow-Up Confirmation Call**: Subsequent calls are used to confirm actions taken or provide updates to the customer.

3. **Adjust Account**:
   - **Perform Initial Adjustment**: This reflects the first set of changes made to the account based on initial findings.
   - (If recurring) **Perform Additional Adjustment**: This would apply if further modifications are needed after re-evaluation.

By renaming these activities, the revised log provides clearer insight into the process flow and the specific roles each activity plays, enhancing traceability and understanding of the support workflow.
