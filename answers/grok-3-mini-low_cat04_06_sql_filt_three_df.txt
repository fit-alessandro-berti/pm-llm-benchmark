First, the prompt requires identifying cases that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed directly by 'Create Order', followed directly by 'Confirm Order'. No other events from the same case should be in between these three.

Then, among those cases, I need to find ones where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days.

Finally, I have to exclude those cases from the final result. So, the query should return all events from cases that do NOT have this sequence with the time condition.

The output should be all events from the cases that are not filtered out.

To structure this in SQL, I need to:

1. Find the cases that have the exact sequence.

2. For those cases, check the time difference.

3. Exclude those cases entirely from the event log.

I should start by identifying the cases with the sequence.

Since the sequence must be in direct succession, I need to look at the ordered events per case.

I can use window functions or self-joins to check for consecutive events.

One way is to use ROW_NUMBER or LEAD/LAG to check the next activities.

For each case, order the events by timestamp.

Then, for each event, check if it's 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next one is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

More precisely, I need to find triples where activity1 = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', activity2 = 'Create Order', activity3 = 'Confirm Order', and they are consecutive in the ordered list for that case.

After identifying such sequences, measure the time between activity2 and activity3.

If that time > 5 days, then exclude the whole case.

First, I need to detect if such a sequence exists in the case with the time condition.

The prompt says: "identifies any case that contains the following sequence... and among those, where the time elapsed... is more than 5 days. Then exclude them."

So, for a case to be excluded, it must have at least one such sequence where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is > 5 days.

The prompt: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine to only those where the time elapsed... is more than 5 days. After identifying such cases, exclude them."

It implies that for cases that have the sequence and the time condition is met for that sequence, exclude them.

A case might have multiple sequences, but I think as long as it has at least one that meets the condition, exclude it.

The prompt doesn't specify; it just says "those cases that have this specific sequence" and then "where the time elapsed... is more than 5 days", implying for that sequence.

To be precise, I need to check for each such sequence in the case.

In the query, it's probably easier to flag cases that have at least one such sequence with the time condition.

Then, exclude events from those cases.

Plan:

1. First, identify the sequences.

I can use a subquery to find, for each case, the instances where we have three consecutive events matching the sequence.

To do that, I might need to use ROW_NUMBER to assign numbers to events per case, ordered by timestamp.

Then, for each event, check if row N is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', row N+1 is 'Create Order', and row N+2 is 'Confirm Order'.

If so, for that triple, calculate the time difference between row N+1 and row N+2.

If that difference > 5 days, then mark the case for exclusion.

More precisely, if for any such triple in the case, the difference > 5 days, then exclude the case.

So, perhaps, in a subquery, select distinct case_id where such a condition exists.

Let me think about the SQL structure.

First, create a CTE or subquery that adds a row number per case.

Something like:

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn

    FROM event_log

)

From this, I can join to get the next and next-next rows.

To check for three consecutive, I might need to self-join or use LEAD.

I can use LEAD to get the next activity and the one after.

LEAD can get the next one, and LEAD twice for the one after, but I have to be careful.

In ordered_events, for each row, I can add:

LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_activity,

LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_timestamp,

LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_activity,

And perhaps LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY rn) AS next_next_timestamp,

For the sequence, I need the timestamp of the second next for the 'Confirm Order'.

For a row where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and next_activity = 'Create Order', and next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order', then for that row, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is the difference between next_timestamp (of 'Create Order') and next_next_timestamp (of 'Confirm Order').

Let's clarify:

For a row with rn = N, activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

Then, LEAD(1) over that would be rn = N+1, which should be 'Create Order', so next_activity = activity of rn N+1

LEAD(2) over that would be rn = N+2, which should be 'Confirm Order'

The time between 'Create Order' (rn N+1) and 'Confirm Order' (rn N+2) is timestamp of rn N+2 minus timestamp of rn N+1.

In my LEAD, for the row at rn N:

next_timestamp = timestamp of rn N+1  // which is 'Create Order'

next_next_timestamp = timestamp of rn N+2  // which is 'Confirm Order'

So, the time difference is next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp

If activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Create Order' AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

For that case, we want to exclude it.

In the subquery, I can select case_id where such a condition is true for any row.

So, in the CTE:

WITH ordered_events AS (

    SELECT 

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn,

        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp

    FROM event_log

)

Then, select from ordered_events where:

activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

From this, select distinct case_id as the ones to exclude.

Let’s call this excluded_cases.

So,

WITH ordered_events AS ( ... as above ... ),

sequences AS (

    SELECT DISTINCT case_id

    FROM ordered_events

    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

    AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

)

To get the final result: select all from event_log where case_id NOT IN (select case_id from sequences)

That should do it.

One potential issue: what if for a case, there are multiple possible sequences, but only one meets the time condition? The case will still be excluded if at least one does.

That seems to match the prompt.

We assume that the events are properly ordered by timestamp, and there are no ties or issues.

In DuckDB, subtracting timestamps gives an interval, and we can compare to INTERVAL '5 days'.

Yes.

Finally, the query should return all columns from event_log for the cases not excluded.

So, something like:

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequences)

And perhaps order by case_id and timestamp, but the prompt doesn't specify, so maybe just as is.

The prompt says: "Please ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering so that the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."

It doesn't specify the order, but probably it's fine to return them in any order, or perhaps the original order.

To be safe, I can order by case_id and timestamp.

Alright, let's write the full query.
</think>

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
sequences_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequences_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

This query first identifies the cases to exclude by detecting the specified sequence with the time condition, then filters out all events from those cases, returning the remaining events ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`.
