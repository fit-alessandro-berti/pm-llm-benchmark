Below is the merged, chronological event log for Order#1234.  
– We chose System A’s timestamp as the “primary” timestamp whenever available; if an event exists only in B, we use its Btimestamp.  
– We used a 2-second tolerance to match events whose names (or obvious synonyms) and timestamps align.  
– Canonical event names are taken from System A; for Bonly events we keep the original name.

Reasoning and conflict-resolution notes:

1. Timestamps & namemapping  
   • “OrderReceived”  “Order Received” (diff = 2 s)  matched  
   • “OrderValidation”  “Order Validated” (1 s)  matched  
   • “Shipping”  “Item Shipped” (2 s)  matched  
   • “PaymentCheck”  “Payment Processed” are logical synonyms, but timestamps differ by 5 s (exceeds our 2 s tolerance), so we left them as two separate events.  

2. Attribute enrichment  
   • In each merged row (Origin A + B) we include all user_id, resource_id and notes from B plus the primary event_type and timestamp from A.  
   • For A-only or B-only events we include just their original fields and mark the Origin accordingly.  

3. Ordering  
   • We sorted strictly by the chosen primary timestamp (A’s timestamp if present, else B’s).  

This unified log preserves the complete picture of what happened to Order#1234—with A’s core timeline augmented by B’s richer metadata—while keeping unmatched or ambiguous events distinct.
