Based on the attributes provided, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the case (presumably a loan applicant) is a citizen or not. Discriminating against individuals based on their citizenship status could raise fairness concerns.

2. `case:gender`: This attribute directly relates to the gender of the loan applicant. Discrimination based on gender is generally considered unfair and illegal in many jurisdictions.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute suggests whether the loan applicant speaks German or not. While language proficiency may be relevant for communication purposes, discrimination based solely on language or ethnic background could raise fairness concerns.

The remaining attributes, such as `activity`, `concept:name`, `resource`, `start_timestamp`, `time`, and `time:timestamp`, do not appear to be directly related to sensitive characteristics of the individuals involved in the process. However, it is essential to note that even seemingly non-sensitive attributes may inadvertently encode or correlate with sensitive information, leading to potential discrimination. A thorough analysis of the data and the decision-making process would be necessary to identify and mitigate any potential sources of unfairness.

It is crucial to consider fairness in decision-making processes, especially in domains like lending, where biases and discrimination can have significant consequences for individuals and communities. Identifying and addressing potential sources of unfairness is essential for promoting equitable treatment and ensuring that decisions are made based on relevant and non-discriminatory factors.
