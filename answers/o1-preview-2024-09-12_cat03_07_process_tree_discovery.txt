Based on the given event log and the observations from the provided cases, the discovered process can be represented by the following process tree:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    'Validate Form (VF)',
    'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
    X (
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        -> (
            * (
                tau,
                'Request Missing Info (RMI)'
            ),
            'Validate Form (VF)',
            'Approval Decision (AD)'
        )
    ),
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sequence (`->`):**
   - The process starts with the sequence of:
     - **Receive Application (RA)**
     - **Validate Form (VF)**
     - **Assess Eligibility (AE)**

2. **Exclusive Choice (`X`):**
   - After **Assess Eligibility (AE)**, there is a choice:
     - **Direct Approval Path:**
       - **Approval Decision (AD)**
     - **Loop for Missing Information:**
       - A nested sequence (`->`) that handles cases where missing information is requested.

3. **Loop (`*`):**
   - The loop handles the repetition of **Request Missing Info (RMI)**.
   - The loop is defined as `* (tau, 'Request Missing Info (RMI)')`, which means:
     - Starts with a silent step (`tau`), allowing immediate exit from the loop for cases without missing information requests.
     - If there is missing information, it executes **Request Missing Info (RMI)**.
     - The loop can repeat **RMI** multiple times, as observed in Case 3.
     - After exiting the loop, the process continues.

4. **Continuation of the Loop Path:**
   - After the loop, the process includes:
     - **Validate Form (VF)** (re-validation after receiving missing information)
     - **Approval Decision (AD)**

5. **Final Sequence:**
   - The process concludes with:
     - **Send Confirmation (SC)**
     - **Archive Case (AC)**

**Behavior Captured:**

- **Case 1:**
  - Went through the loop once:
    - Executed **Request Missing Info (RMI)** once.
    - Re-validated the form (**Validate Form (VF)**).
- **Case 2:**
  - Did not enter the loop:
    - Proceeded directly to **Approval Decision (AD)** after **Assess Eligibility (AE)**.
- **Case 3:**
  - Went through the loop twice:
    - Executed **Request Missing Info (RMI)** twice.
    - Re-validated the form (**Validate Form (VF)**) after the repeated requests.

**Balancing Fitness, Precision, and Simplicity:**

- **Fitness:** The model allows for the exact sequences observed in the event log, ensuring that all cases are covered.
- **Precision:** It doesn't allow for behaviors not observed in the log, such as skipping mandatory steps or executing activities in an incorrect order.
- **Simplicity:** The model avoids unnecessary complexity by grouping the repeated **RMI** activities within a loop and using standard process tree operators to represent the choices and repetitions succinctly.

**Final Notes:**

- The silent step (`tau`) in the loop allows the process to continue without executing **Request Missing Info (RMI)** if it's not needed (as in Case 2).
- The use of the exclusive choice (`X`) operator correctly models the decision point after **Assess Eligibility (AE)**, capturing both possible paths in the process.
