### Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

Based on the provided event log data, several anomalies and undesirable behaviors can be identified:

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity (event_id 9) occurs before the "Perform Credit Check" (event_id 11). This is unusual because typically, a credit check should be performed before confirming shipment.
   - **Case 1003:** The "Ship Goods" activity (event_id 17) occurs before the "Confirm Shipment" (event_id 19). This is out of sequence and suggests a potential process violation.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Validate Stock" activity (event_id 12) occurs after "Confirm Shipment" (event_id 9), which is unusual.
   - **Case 1003:** The "Validate Stock" activity is missing entirely.
   - **Case 1004:** The "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock" activities are missing.

3. **Early or Late Confirmations:**
   - **Case 1002:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity has an additional info note "attempted_early=Y", indicating an early confirmation.
   - **Case 1003:** The "Confirm Shipment" activity has an additional info note "late_confirmation=Y", indicating a late confirmation.

4. **Payment Before Shipment:**
   - **Case 1004:** The "Receive Payment" activity (event_id 22) occurs before the "Issue Invoice" (event_id 23) and "Ship Goods" (event_id 25). This is unusual as typically, payment should follow the shipment and invoicing.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   - **Possible Causes:** System errors, manual intervention, or process deviations due to urgent customer needs.
   - **Hypothesis:** There might be a need for stricter process enforcement or system checks to ensure activities follow the correct sequence.

2. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Possible Causes:** Oversight, system glitches, or deliberate skipping of steps.
   - **Hypothesis:** There might be a need for better training or system alerts to ensure all necessary steps are completed.

3. **Early or Late Confirmations:**
   - **Possible Causes:** Urgent customer requests, system delays, or human error.
   - **Hypothesis:** There might be a need for more flexible but controlled processes to handle exceptions without compromising the overall workflow.

4. **Payment Before Shipment:**
   - **Possible Causes:** Customer prepayment, system misconfiguration, or manual overrides.
   - **Hypothesis:** There might be a need for a review of payment and shipping processes to ensure they align with standard practices.

### Proposed SQL Queries for Further Investigation

1. **Identify Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (1002, 1003)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

2. **Check for Missing Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM order_event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 7;
   ```

3. **Identify Early or Late Confirmations:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
   AND (additional_info LIKE '%early%' OR additional_info LIKE '%late%');
   ```

4. **Check for Payment Before Shipment:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment'
   AND case_id IN (
       SELECT case_id
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods'
       AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Receive Payment' AND case_id = order_event_log.case_id)
   );
   ```

5. **Detailed Activity Sequence for Specific Cases:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

6. **Join with `orders` and `resources` Tables for Context:**
   ```sql
   SELECT o.case_id, o.customer_id, o.order_type, o.order_value, r.role, r.department, e.activity, e.timestamp, e.resource, e.additional_info
   FROM order_event_log e
   JOIN orders o ON e.case_id = o.case_id
   JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE e.case_id IN (1002, 1003, 1004)
   ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
   ```

These queries will help in further investigating the hypotheses and understanding the root causes of the identified anomalies.
