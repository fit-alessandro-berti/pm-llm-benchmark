We are given an event log from a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process. We need to identify anomalous sequences that deviate from the standard P2P process flow. The standard P2P process typically follows these steps in order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**: A request for goods/services is created.
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**: The requisition is approved by appropriate authority.
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**: Once approved, a purchase order is issued to the vendor.
4. **Receive Goods**: The goods are delivered and received.
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**: The vendor sends an invoice.
6. **Match Invoice to PO**: The invoice is matched with the PO and receipt to verify correctness.
7. **Release Payment**: Payment is released to the vendor.
8. **Close Case**: The process is closed.

Deviations from this order might indicate anomalies. Let's examine each case:

**Case 1001**: Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Receive Goods -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> Release Payment -> Close Case. This seems normal and follows the standard order.

**Case 1002**: Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Release Payment -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO -> Close Case.

Anomalies:
- Issue Purchase Order occurs before Approve Purchase Requisition. Typically, a PO should only be issued after the requisition is approved. Issuing a PO without approval is a control issue.
- Release Payment occurs before Approve Purchase Requisition, and also before Receive Goods and Match Invoice to PO. Payment should be released only after invoice matching (three-way match: PO, receipt, invoice) to ensure that payment is for goods actually received and at the correct price. Here, payment is released before receiving goods and before matching. This could lead to paying for undelivered or incorrect goods.
- Approve Purchase Requisition appears after payment release, which is out of order and defeats the purpose of approval.
- Receive Goods occurs after payment release, meaning payment was made before receiving goods.
- Match Invoice to PO occurs after payment release, so payment was made without matching, increasing risk of overpayment or fraud.

**Case 1003**: Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Issue Purchase Order -> Release Payment -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO -> Close Case.

Anomalies:
- Release Payment occurs before Vendor Invoice Received, before Receive Goods, and before Match Invoice to PO. Payment should be released after invoice matching. Here, payment is released very early (right after issuing PO). This is problematic because payment is made without an invoice and without receiving goods. Possibly indicates advance payment, but typically not standard without proper controls.
- Vendor Invoice Received after payment release? Usually invoice comes before payment.
- Receive Goods after payment release? Goods not received yet.
- Match Invoice to PO after payment release? Matching should occur before payment to validate.

**Case 1004**: Sequence: Create Purchase Requisition -> Approve Purchase Requisition -> Receive Goods -> Issue Purchase Order -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> Release Payment -> Close Case.

Anomalies:
- Receive Goods occurs before Issue Purchase Order. Typically, goods should be received after a purchase order is issued to the vendor. Receiving goods before issuing a PO could mean that goods were ordered informally without a PO, which violates procurement controls. It could lead to unauthorized purchases and difficulties in matching invoices.

Other cases: Case 1001 is normal.

So, anomalous cases: 1002, 1003, and 1004.

We need to explain why each anomaly is problematic.

Let's summarize:

**Case 1002**:
1. PO issued without approval.
2. Payment released before approval, receipt of goods, and invoice matching.
3. Approval after payment (meaningless).

**Case 1003**:
1. Payment released before invoice received, before goods received, and before matching. This is a major control failure; payment should only be made after verifying that goods/services were received and invoice matches PO.

**Case 1004**:
1. Goods received before PO issued. This suggests that the company received goods without having a formal purchase order in place. This could lead to unauthorized expenditures and difficulties in reconciling invoices.

Overall, these anomalies indicate weaknesses in internal controls, which could lead to fraud, overpayment, payment for undelivered goods, or unapproved purchases.

We'll write the answer accordingly.

After analyzing the event log, I have identified several anomalous sequences in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process that deviate from standard best practices. Below is a case-by-case breakdown of the anomalies and explanations of why they are problematic.

### Case 1001
- **Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case.
- **Assessment**: This case follows the expected P2P flow and shows no anomalies.

### Case 1002
- **Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Vendor Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve Purchase Requisition  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case.
- **Anomalies and Issues**:
  1. **Issue Purchase Order before Approve Purchase Requisition**: A purchase order (PO) should only be issued after the requisition is approved. Issuing a PO without approval bypasses spending controls and could lead to unauthorized purchases.
  2. **Release Payment before Approval, Receipt of Goods, and Invoice Matching**: Payment is released before the requisition is approved, goods are received, and the invoice is matched to the PO and receipt. This violates the standard three-way matching control designed to prevent overpayment, fraud, or payment for undelivered goods.
  3. **Approval after Payment**: Approving the requisition after payment renders the approval meaningless, as the commitment has already been made and paid.
  4. **Receive Goods after Payment**: Goods are received after payment, increasing the risk that the company pays for goods that are never delivered or are unsatisfactory.
  5. **Match Invoice to PO after Payment**: Invoice matching should occur before payment to verify quantities, prices, and terms. Doing it afterward eliminates an important check.

### Case 1003
- **Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Issue Purchase Order  Release Payment  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case.
- **Anomalies and Issues**:
  1. **Release Payment before Invoice Received, Goods Received, and Matching**: Payment is released immediately after issuing the PO, long before the invoice is received, goods are delivered, or any matching is performed. This suggests an advance payment without proper justification or controls, exposing the company to financial risk if the vendor fails to deliver or the invoice does not match the PO.
  2. **Invoice Received after Payment**: Typically, an invoice should be received and validated before payment. Receiving it afterward makes it impossible to verify the payment accuracy beforehand.
  3. **Goods Received after Payment**: Payment before receipt means the company has no guarantee of receiving the goods as ordered.
  4. **Matching after Payment**: Matching is done post-payment, so discrepancies cannot be corrected before funds are disbursed.

### Case 1004
- **Sequence**: Create Purchase Requisition  Approve Purchase Requisition  Receive Goods  Issue Purchase Order  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case.
- **Anomalies and Issues**:
  1. **Receive Goods before Issue Purchase Order**: Goods are received before a PO is issued. This indicates that goods were ordered and delivered without a formal purchase order, which violates procurement policies. Without a PO, there is no authorized agreement on price, quantity, or terms, making it difficult to match invoices and leading to potential disputes or unauthorized spending.

### Summary of Control Weaknesses
The anomalies in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 highlight significant departures from standard P2P controls, including:
- **Lack of proper authorization** (PO issued without approval).
- **Payment without verification** (missing three-way match).
- **Payment before receipt of goods or invoices** (advance payment without safeguards).
- **Receipt of goods without a PO** (informal procurement).

These deviations increase the risk of fraud, overpayment, payment for undelivered goods, and unrecorded liabilities, ultimately undermining financial controls and operational efficiency.
