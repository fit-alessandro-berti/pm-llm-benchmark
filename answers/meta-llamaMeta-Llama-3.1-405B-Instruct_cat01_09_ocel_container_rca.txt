Analyzing the provided directly follows graph for the object-centric event log, some performance issues and their potential root causes can be identified:

1. **Bottlenecks**:
	* **Load Truck** (Handling Unit): This activity has a high frequency of events (10553) and a relatively high duration (7820.93). This could indicate a bottleneck in the process, possibly due to inefficient loading procedures or understaffing.
	* **Weigh** (Container): This activity has a high frequency of events (1989) and a relatively high duration (2559.54). This might be a bottleneck in the process, potentially caused by inadequate weighing capacity or inefficient weighing procedures.
	* **Place in Stock** (Container): This activity has a high frequency of events (1814) and an extremely high duration (743380.51). This is likely a significant bottleneck in the process, possibly due to inadequate storage capacity, inefficient stock placement procedures, or stock management issues.
2. **Loops and Repeats**:
	* **Load Truck** (Truck) and **Load Truck** (Container) are part of a loop, indicating repeated loading operations. This could be due to inefficient loading procedures, inadequate truck capacity, or scheduling issues.
	* **Bring to Loading Bay** and **Load to Vehicle** (Forklift) are also part of a loop, indicating repeated movements between the loading bay and vehicle. This might be caused by inadequate loading bay management, inefficient forklift operations, or scheduling issues.
3. **Long Waiting Times**:
	* **Create Transport Document** to **Book Vehicles** (Transport Document): The duration between these activities is relatively high (22207.07), which could indicate long waiting times for vehicle booking after creating the transport document. This might be due to limited vehicle availability or inefficient booking procedures.
	* **Order Empty Containers** to **Pick Up Empty Container** (Container): The duration between these activities is extremely high (368943.92), indicating long waiting times for empty container pickup. This could be caused by inadequate container availability, inefficient ordering procedures, or supplier issues.
4. **Inefficient Scheduling**:
	* **Book Vehicles** (Vehicle) and **Reschedule Container** (Vehicle) have relatively high frequencies of events, indicating possible issues with vehicle scheduling and container rescheduling. This might be caused by inefficient scheduling procedures, inadequate container availability, or changes in customer orders.

By addressing these performance issues and root causes, the process can be
