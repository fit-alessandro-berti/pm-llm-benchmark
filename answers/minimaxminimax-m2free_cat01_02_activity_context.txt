We are given an event log with activities that appear multiple times within the same case but with different contextual meanings.
 The goal is to rename these activities to disambiguate them based on their context and position in the process.

 Steps:
 1. Identify recurring activities: "Verify Documents", "Call Customer", and "Adjust Account" (though note: "Adjust Account" is in two cases, but in C001 it doesn't appear, and in C003 it appears only once? Actually, let's check.)

 Recurring activities per case:
   - C001: 
        Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents (again), Approve Request
        So "Verify Documents" appears twice, and "Call Customer" once.

   - C002:
        Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Call Customer (again), Approve Request
        So "Call Customer" and "Adjust Account" appear, but note "Adjust Account" only once? Actually, in C002, "Adjust Account" is only once? 
        However, looking again: C002 has two "Call Customer" and one "Adjust Account".

   - C003:
        Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Verify Documents (again), Approve Request
        So "Verify Documents", "Call Customer", and "Adjust Account" (each once? but note: "Call Customer" and "Verify Documents" are each twice? Actually, in C003, "Call Customer" and "Verify Documents" are each once? 
        Wait, in C003: 
          Event 1: Initiate Request
          Event 2: Verify Documents
          Event 3: Call Customer
          Event 4: Adjust Account
          Event 5: Verify Documents (again)
          Event 6: Approve Request
        So "Verify Documents" appears twice, and the others once.

 Therefore, the recurring activities across all cases (with multiple occurrences in a case) are:
   - "Verify Documents": appears in C001 (twice), C002 (once), C003 (twice)
   - "Call Customer": appears in C001 (once), C002 (twice), C003 (once)

 However, note that in C003, "Call Customer" is only once? Actually, in the log for C003, it appears once. But in C002 it appears twice.

 But the problem says: "the same activity names appear multiple times within a single case". So we focus on cases where an activity appears more than once.

 Cases with recurring activities:
   - C001: "Verify Documents" (twice)
   - C002: "Call Customer" (twice)
   - C003: "Verify Documents" (twice)

 So we must disambiguate the two instances of "Verify Documents" in C001 and C003, and the two "Call Customer" in C002.

 Let's analyze the context for each occurrence:

 Case C001:
   First "Verify Documents": 
        Timestamp: 2024-05-01 09:20:00
        Context: "Agent checks identity documents."
        This is the initial verification.

   Second "Verify Documents":
        Timestamp: 2024-05-01 10:30:00
        Context: "Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided."
        This is after the customer uploaded an ID scan (via "Submit Additional"). So it's a re-verification.

 Case C003:
   First "Verify Documents":
        Timestamp: 2024-05-03 11:25:00
        Context: "Physical verification of ID."
        This is the initial verification.

   Second "Verify Documents":
        Timestamp: 2024-05-03 12:20:00
        Context: "Re-verify docs after account adjustment."
        This is after an account adjustment. So it's a re-verification.

 Case C002 for "Call Customer":
   First "Call Customer":
        Timestamp: 2024-05-02 09:00:00
        Context: "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."

   Second "Call Customer":
        Timestamp: 2024-05-02 09:50:00
        Context: "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made."

   Also note: in C002, we have "Adjust Account" only once. But in C003, we have "Adjust Account" and then a "Verify Documents" after.

 Proposed renaming:

 For "Verify Documents":
   We can name the first occurrence as "Verify Documents (Initial)" and the second as "Verify Documents (Re-verification)".

 However, note that in C002, "Verify Documents" appears only once and it's the initial one. So we can keep it as "Verify Documents (Initial)" for the first occurrence in any case and for the second in a case we use "Re-verification".

 But what about cases that don't have a second verification? Then we don't need to change the single occurrence? Actually, we are only changing the ones that are repeated. However, to be consistent, we might rename every occurrence? But the problem says: rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case. So we leave the single occurrence ones as they are? But that might cause confusion because the same activity name would mean different things in different cases? 

 Alternatively, we can rename the repeated ones by appending a sequence number or by the phase. But the problem asks to reflect their contextual meaning.

 Since the context is different (initial vs re-verification), we can change:

   - For the first occurrence in a case: "Verify Documents (Initial)"
   - For the second occurrence: "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"

 Similarly, for "Call Customer" in C002:

   - First occurrence: "Call Customer (Initial)" (to clarify discrepancy)
   - Second occurrence: "Call Customer (Follow-up)"

 But note: in other cases, "Call Customer" might appear only once and it's the first occurrence? So we would rename that one to "Call Customer (Initial)"? 

 However, the problem says: rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case. So we are only required to change the ones that are repeated? But that leaves the same activity name in other cases meaning the first call? 

 We must decide: either we rename every occurrence of an activity that is subject to being repeated (even if in a particular case it is only one) to be consistent? Or only the repeated ones? 

 The problem does not specify. However, to avoid confusion, we might want to standardize:

   - For any case that has multiple verifications, we rename the first to "Initial" and the second to "Re-verification". For cases that have only one, we leave it as "Verify Documents (Initial)"? But that would change the activity name for the single occurrence? 

   - Similarly for calls: if a case has multiple calls, we break them down as initial and follow-up? But if a case has one call, we leave it as "Call Customer (Initial)"? 

 Alternatively, we can do:

   - Only rename the repeated occurrences and leave the single ones as they are? But then the same activity name would mean different things: in a case with two verifications, the first one is renamed to "Verify Documents (Initial)" and the second to "Verify Documents (Re-verification)", but in a case with one verification, it remains "Verify Documents". That would be inconsistent.

 Another idea: rename every occurrence of these activities to include a phase? But that might be too much? 

 However, the problem says: "rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences". So we must consider that the same activity name (like "Verify Documents") has different meanings in different contexts (initial vs re-verification). Therefore, we must disambiguate every occurrence of an activity that is subject to being repeated? 

 But note: the activity "Verify Documents" in a case that has only one occurrence is the initial one. So we can safely rename every occurrence to:

   - If it's the first verification in the case: "Verify Documents (Initial)"
   - If it's the second verification: "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"

 Similarly, for calls:

   - First call: "Call Customer (Initial)"
   - Second call: "Call Customer (Follow-up)"

 But note: what if there are more than two? The problem doesn't have that, but we might generalize:

   - We can use "Call Customer (Initial)" for the first, "Call Customer (Follow-up 1)" for the second, "Call Customer (Follow-up 2)" for the third? But the problem has at most two.

 However, in the log, we have:

   C001: only one call -> so we rename it to "Call Customer (Initial)"? But the problem says to rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case. Since in C001 the call appears only once, we don't have to rename? 

 But that would leave:

   - C001: 
        Initiate Request, Verify Documents (Initial), Call Customer (Initial), ... -> but wait, we didn't change the call because it only appears once? 

   However, note that in C002, the same activity (Call Customer) appears twice and we are renaming it. So we have:

        C001: Call Customer -> remains as is? 
        C002: Call Customer (Initial), Call Customer (Follow-up)

   But then the same activity name in C001 and C002 would be the same? But in C001, the call is the first (and only) call? 

   We want the names to be consistent: every call should be labeled appropriately. So if in C002 the first call is "Call Customer (Initial)", then the call in C001 (which is the first and only call) should also be "Call Customer (Initial)".

   But the problem says: "rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case". So we are only allowed to rename the ones that are repeated? 

   However, if we don't rename the single occurrence, then we have:

        C001: 
            ... Call Customer ... 
        C002:
            ... Call Customer (Initial) ... Call Customer (Follow-up) ...

   This is inconsistent.

   Therefore, I think we should rename every occurrence of the activities that are subject to being repeated, even if in a particular case they are only one. Why? Because the context of the activity (its meaning) is defined by the phase, not just the count. The initial call is always initial, regardless of whether there is a follow-up.

   Similarly, the re-verification always happens after an adjustment or upload? 

   So we will rename:

      For every "Verify Documents" in any case:
          If it's the first occurrence in that case -> "Verify Documents (Initial)"
          If it's the second -> "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"

      For every "Call Customer" in any case:
          First occurrence: "Call Customer (Initial)"
          Second occurrence: "Call Customer (Follow-up)"

   And for "Adjust Account": it appears only once per case? So we leave it? But note: in C003, it appears once and we don't have multiple. So we leave it as is.

   However, what if in the future a case has multiple "Adjust Account"? Then we would have to rename? But the problem doesn't have that. So we leave as is.

   Also note: the activity "Adjust Account" in C002 and C003: it's the first occurrence in those cases? So we don't change.

   But what if we have a case that has two "Adjust Account"? Then we would have to break them down? But we don't. So we leave it.

   Now, what about the activity "Submit Additional"? It appears only in C001. So we leave it.

   Also, "Initiate Request" and "Approve Request" are unique per case? So we leave.

 Plan:

   We will go through every event and rename:

      "Verify Documents" (if it's the first in the case) -> "Verify Documents (Initial)"
      "Verify Documents" (if it's the second) -> "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"

      "Call Customer" (if it's the first in the case) -> "Call Customer (Initial)"
      "Call Customer" (if it's the second) -> "Call Customer (Follow-up)"

   We need to know the sequence per case. We can use the timestamp to determine order.

   Steps per case:

      Case C001:

        Order of events (by timestamp):
          1. Initiate Request -> remains
          2. Verify Documents (first) -> becomes "Verify Documents (Initial)"
          3. Call Customer (only one) -> becomes "Call Customer (Initial)"
          4. Submit Additional -> remains
          5. Verify Documents (second) -> becomes "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"
          6. Approve Request -> remains

      Case C002:

        Order:
          1. Initiate Request -> remains
          2. Verify Documents (only one) -> becomes "Verify Documents (Initial)" [because it's the first]
          3. Call Customer (first) -> becomes "Call Customer (Initial)"
          4. Adjust Account -> remains
          5. Call Customer (second) -> becomes "Call Customer (Follow-up)"
          6. Approve Request -> remains

      Case C003:

        Order:
          1. Initiate Request -> remains
          2. Verify Documents (first) -> becomes "Verify Documents (Initial)"
          3. Call Customer (only one) -> becomes "Call Customer (Initial)"
          4. Adjust Account -> remains
          5. Verify Documents (second) -> becomes "Verify Documents (Re-verification)"
          6. Approve Request -> remains

   However, note: in C002, the "Verify Documents" is the first and only one. We are changing it to "Verify Documents (Initial)".

   Similarly, in C003, the first "Verify Documents" becomes "Initial", and the second becomes "Re-verification".

   And for calls in C002, the first becomes "Initial" and the second becomes "Follow-up".

   Also, note that in C001, the call is the only one -> becomes "Call Customer (Initial)".

   And in C003, the call is the only one -> becomes "Call Customer (Initial)".

 But wait: in C002, the first call is at 09:00 and the second at 09:50. We change the first to "Initial" and the second to "Follow-up".

 However, what if in a case we have three calls? Then we would have to assign the first as "Initial", the second as "Follow-up", and the third as "Follow-up (2)"? But the problem doesn't have that.

 Since the problem only has up to two, we can do:

      First call: "Call Customer (Initial)"
      Second call: "Call Customer (Follow-up)"

   If we have a third, we might use "Call Customer (Follow-up 2)"? But we don't.

 Implementation:

   We will create a new log with the renamed activities.

   We must also update the "Activity" column.

 Revised Log:

   Case C001:
     1. Initiate Request -> same
     2. Verify Documents (Initial) 
     3. Call Customer (Initial)
     4. Submit Additional -> same
     5. Verify Documents (Re-verification)
     6. Approve Request -> same

   Case C002:
     1. Initiate Request -> same
     2. Verify Documents (Initial)
     3. Call Customer (Initial)
     4. Adjust Account -> same
     5. Call Customer (Follow-up)
     6. Approve Request -> same

   Case C003:
     1. Initiate Request -> same
     2. Verify Documents (Initial)
     3. Call Customer (Initial)
     4. Adjust Account -> same
     5. Verify Documents (Re-verification)
     6. Approve Request -> same

 But note: the activity "Adjust Account" remains the same? Yes, because it doesn't appear multiple times in any case.

 However, we must note: in C002, the "Verify Documents" is only one. We changed it to "Initial". But that is the first and only. So it is indeed initial.

   Similarly, the call in C001 and C003: we changed to "Initial".

   This way, we have:

      All "Verify Documents" that are first in a case are "Initial", and if there's a second, it's "Re-verification".
      All "Call Customer" that are first are "Initial", and if there's a second, it's "Follow-up".

   This disambiguates the activities by their phase.

 Justification:

   The naming choices are based on the context provided in the "Additional Context" column and the position in the sequence:

   - For "Verify Documents": 
        The first occurrence is always an initial verification of documents, while the second occurrence is a re-verification that happens after the customer has provided additional documents or after an account adjustment. Therefore, the names "Initial" and "Re-verification" clearly reflect these phases.

   - For "Call Customer":
        The first call is an initial outreach (either to request documents or to clarify a discrepancy). The second call is a follow-up (either to confirm that the adjustments have been made or to request the return of the customer). Therefore, the names "Initial" and "Follow-up" capture the purpose.

   The other activities (Initiate Request, Submit Additional, Adjust Account, Approve Request) are unique per case or do not recur in the same case, so they remain unchanged.

   This renaming helps in clearly distinguishing between the different stages of the same activity in the process flow.

 Now, we write the revised event log:

   We'll replace the activity names accordingly.

   Note: We must update the activity names in the table.

   Revised Table:

 This revised log clearly shows the phases of the recurring activities.

### Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

To disambiguate recurring activities, I analyzed their context and position in each case. The same activity (e.g., "Verify Documents") carries different meanings depending on when it occurs (e.g., initial check vs. re-verification after new input). Below is the revised log with renamed activities, followed by justifications.

#### Revised Event Log:
```  
| Case ID | Activity                     | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

### Justification for Naming Changes:

1. **"Verify Documents"  "Verify Documents (Initial)" / "Verify Documents (Re-verification)":**
   - **Context Clue**: The first occurrence in all cases involves checking identity/physical documents for the first time ("initial" phase). The second occurrence always follows a trigger (e.g., "Submit Additional" in C001 or "Adjust Account" in C003), indicating a "re-verification" after new input. This disambiguates between fresh checks vs. validation after adjustments.

2. **"Call Customer"  "Call Customer (Initial)" / "Call Customer (Follow-up)":**
   - **Context Clue**: In C002, the first call is for outreach ("clarify account discrepancy"), while the second is a proactive follow-up ("confirm adjustments"). In C001/C003, there’s only one call, but it’s always an "initial" outreach. The naming reflects whether it’s the first contact or a subsequent action.

3. **Other Activities Unchanged:**
   - "Initiate Request," "Submit Additional," "Adjust Account," and "Approve Request" appear only once per case or lack recurring contextual ambiguity, so no renaming was needed.

### Key Insights:
- **Positional Meaning**: "Verify Documents" in the 1st instance is always *initial* (baseline check), while the 2nd is *re-verification* (validation post-update).  
- **Purpose-Driven Naming**: "Call Customer" uses "Initial" for proactive outreach (e.g., requesting docs/clarifications) and "Follow-up" for confirmation/returns.  
- **Consistency**: Renaming follows a consistent pattern across all cases (e.g., "Initial" for first checks, "Re-verification" for subsequent checks), simplifying process understanding.  

This approach ensures activity names reflect their operational context, reducing ambiguity in the workflow.
