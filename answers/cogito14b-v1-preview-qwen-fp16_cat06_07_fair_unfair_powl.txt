Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process described for GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model should include a potential unfairness point, and the second one should eliminate that bias.

Starting with the Process Description, there are four main stages: Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check, Preliminary Skill Assessment, Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (with possible bias), and Managerial Review & Final Decision. 

For Model 1 with Potential Unfairness:
- The process starts with receiving applications.
- There's a loop for data completeness checks.
- After skill assessment, there's an XOR choice: either standard cultural fit or community affiliation check, which gives preferential treatment.
- Then managerial review and final decision.

For Model 2 Without Unfairness:
- Similar structure but no XOR branch. All applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation regardless of affiliations.

I need to use the POWL constructs like StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL (XOR and LOOP), and Transitions with appropriate labels. Let's map each stage into these components.

Model 1 will have an XOR node after the skill assessment where one path is CommunityAffiliationCheck and another is CulturalFitCheck. The CommunityAffiliationCheck would give a slight uplift, making it unfair.

Model 2 eliminates the XOR, so all applicants go through CulturalFitCheck without any special paths based on affiliations.

Here are the two POWL models:

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

# Define basic transitions
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                                    children=[Transition("RequestMoreInfo"),
                                             Transition("CompleteData")])
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")
CulturalFitStandard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

# Define XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation
XorCulturalPath = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR,
                              children=[CulturalFitStandard, CommunityAffiliation])

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create main partial order model
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    DataCompletenessCheck,
    SkillAssessment,
    XorCulturalPath,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision])

# Add ordering constraints
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorCulturalPath)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(XorCulturalPath, ManagerialReview)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Add loop constraint for data completeness
DataCompletenessCheck.set_loop_node(DataCompletenessCheck.children[0], DataCompletenessCheck.children[1])
```

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition

# Define basic transitions (same as above)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP,
                                    children=[Transition("RequestMoreInfo"),
                                             Transition("CompleteData")])
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="PreliminarySkillAssessment")
CulturalFitStandard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

# Only one path for cultural fit evaluation
SinglePath = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[CulturalFitStandard])

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create main partial order model
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    DataCompletenessCheck,
    SkillAssessment,
    SinglePath,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision])

# Add ordering constraints
fair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)
fair_model.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)
fair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitStandard)  # No XOR branch here
fair_model.order.add_edge(CulturalFitStandard, ManagerialReview)
fair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Add loop constraint for data completeness
DataCompletenessCheck.set_loop_node(DataCompletenessCheck.children[0], DataCompletenessCheck.children[1])
```

The key difference between these models is the handling of cultural fit evaluation:
- Model 1 includes an XOR choice where applicants can either take a standard cultural fit check or have their scores adjusted based on community affiliation.
- Model 2 eliminates this preference by making all applicants go through the same cultural fit process, ensuring no bias from affiliations.
