Certainly! Here is a list of 20 relevant questions along with proposed confidence scores for each question. The confidence score is based on the relevance and the likelihood that the question will generate useful insights about the process.

1. **What is the average number of steps involved in the process variants?**
   - Confidence Score: 9/10

2. **Which approval step is most frequently encountered in the process variants?**
   - Confidence Score: 8/10

3. **What is the average performance (cost) of a process variant that involves budget owner approval?**
   - Confidence Score: 9/10

4. **How often does the process involve rejection by administration followed by resubmission?**
   - Confidence Score: 8/10

5. **What is the most common sequence of steps from submission to final payment handling?**
   - Confidence Score: 9/10

6. **How does the performance cost differ between processes involving direct supervisor approval and those involving budget owner approval?**
   - Confidence Score: 8/10

7. **What is the frequency of processes that are saved but not submitted?**
   - Confidence Score: 7/10

8. **Which actor (employee, administration, supervisor, budget owner) is involved the most in the process?**
   - Confidence Score: 8/10

9. **What is the average number of rejections before final payment handling in the process variants?**
   - Confidence Score: 8/10

10. **How does the performance cost vary between straightforward approval processes and those with rejections?**
    - Confidence Score: 9/10

11. **What is the median number of steps in the process variants that lead to payment handling?**
    - Confidence Score: 8/10

12. **Which process variant has the highest performance cost on average?**
    - Confidence Score: 9/10

13. **How frequently are declarations rejected by pre-approvers compared to other approvers?**
    - Confidence Score: 7/10

14. **What proportion of processes involve more than one rejection before final payment?**
    - Confidence Score: 8/10

15. **What is the performance cost associated with processes involving multiple rejections and resubmissions?**
    - Confidence Score: 9/10

16. **How does the inclusion of a missing step affect the performance cost in the process variants?**
    - Confidence Score: 8/10

17. **Which process variant has the lowest frequency but the highest performance cost?**
    - Confidence Score: 8/10

18. **What is the average time to payment handling in processes involving budget owner approval?**
    - Confidence Score: 8/10

19. **How does the frequency of saving declarations impact the overall process performance?**
    - Confidence Score: 7/10

20. **What are the most common reasons for process rejections, and how do they affect the performance cost?**
    - Confidence Score: 9/10

These questions are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process variants, their frequencies, and their associated performance costs, which can help in process optimization and cost management.
