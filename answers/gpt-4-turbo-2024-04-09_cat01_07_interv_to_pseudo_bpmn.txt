### BPMN-Like Textual Process Model of Invoice Approval Process

**Participants:**
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

**Process Flow:**

1. **Receive Invoice**:
   - **Trigger:** Invoice received typically via email.
   - **Task:** Verify if invoice has a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - **Artifacts:** Invoice email.

2. **Verify Purchase Order**:
   - **Gateway (Decision Point):** If no PO number is present:
     - **Task:** Return invoice to supplier, requesting more details. (End of process for this path)
     - **Exception:** Occurs when PO number is missing which halts the process temporarily.
   - If PO number is present:
     - **Task:** Log invoice in accounting system.

3. **Invoice Validation by Purchasing**:
   - **Task:** Forward logged invoice to Purchasing Department.
   - **Roles:** Purchasing Officer (Dan) verifies details against PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges).
   - **Gateway (Decision Point):**
     - If discrepancies (mismatches or extra charges) are identified:
       - **Task:** Communicate with supplier to resolve or hold invoice.
       - **Roles:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) involved if needed.

4. **Confirmation of Goods/Services Received**:
   - **Task:** Purchasing confirms receipt of goods/services.
   - **Output:** Confirmation email sent back to Accounts Payable.
   - **Variations:** Sometimes extra communication needed if PO number missing initially as stated by Dan. 

5. **Matching Invoice Against PO**:
   - **Task:** Match invoice line items against PO in system.
   - **Gateway (Decision Point):**
     - If match successful:
       - **Task:** Proceed to Manager for approval.
     - If any discrepancy:
       - **Task:** Clarify discrepancy with Purchasing.
         - **Exception:** Escalation to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) if unresolved.

6. **Manager’s Approval**:
   - **Trigger:** System sends automatic email for manager's sign-off.
   - **Roles:** Department Manager (Carlos) reviews invoice against PO details.
   - **Gateway (Decision Point):**
     - If approval:
       - **Task:** Proceed to payment scheduling.
     - If discrepancy or suspicion:
       - **Task:** Hold invoice, request further investigation. Re-evaluated after investigation.

7. **Payment Scheduling**:
   - **Task:** Schedule invoice for payment.
   - **Output:** Payment included in next payment cycle, completing the approval process.

**Notes and Exceptions:**
- Role of Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) is pivotal in handling exceptions where discrepancies cannot be resolved by the primary process.
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) plays a crucial role in quick resolution with suppliers for discrepancies related to PO numbers or pricing.
- The process involves several feedback loops for discrepancy resolution, particularly involving the Purchasing Officer and Accounts Payable Clerk.

This model provides a structured view of the standard invoice approval process as described by various stakeholders, highlighting sequence flows, decision points, and roles effectively.
