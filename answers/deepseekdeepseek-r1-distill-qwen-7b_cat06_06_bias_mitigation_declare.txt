Alright, so I need to help add some new constraints to the given Python model to limit bias in the loan application process. The model is specified using the DECLARE constraint language, and I have to follow the structure provided.

First, I should understand the current model. The initial declare_model includes various constraints like existence, absence, exactly_one, init, and several binary constraints such as responded_existence, coexistence, response, precedence, succession, and others. These constraints ensure certain activities must happen, don't happen, or follow specific sequences.

The goal is to add constraints that mitigate bias based on sensitive attributes like ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, and ApplicantRace. For example, preventing biased outcomes after sensitive events or ensuring certain steps are taken before sensitive decisions.

Let me think about potential bias scenarios:

1. **Unwanted Rejection After Sensitive Check**: If a sensitive attribute (like being a Minority) leads to a rejection without a proper check in between. So, we need a constraint that ensures between a sensitive check and a rejection, there's a manual review.

2. **Preventing Immediate Decision After Sensitive Event**: If an activity that discloses sensitive info (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) is immediately followed by a decision (e.g., Reject), that's biased. So, adding a constraint that this direct succession is not allowed.

3. **Coexistence of Manual Review with Sensitive Decisions**: If a decision (e.g., Approve or Reject) is made for sensitive applicants, ensure a ManualReview always follows. Or maybe that ManualReview coexists with sensitive decision steps.

Let me structure the new constraints step by step:

1. **Response Constraint**: Prevent a decision step after a sensitive attribute check without a manual review. So, for any decision step (like Approve, Reject), they cannot immediately follow a sensitive check. So, adding a "response" constraint where the target is the decision step and the source is the sensitive check, with support and confidence.

2. **Succession Constraint**: Ensure that a decision step (Approve, Reject) cannot immediately follow a sensitive attribute check. So, similar to response, but perhaps more specific.

3. **Coexistence Constraint**: Ensure that for any decision involving sensitive attributes, a ManualReview coexists. So, if a decision step is for a sensitive applicant (e.g., Approve_Minority), then ManualReview must coexist.

4. **Non-Succession Constraint**: Prevent a decision step from following a sensitive attribute check. So, no direct edge from sensitive check to decision.

Now, translating these into the DECLARE syntax.

First, the response and succession constraints. For example, adding a "response" constraint where "CheckApplicantRace" is the source, and the target is any decision step (Approve, Reject). But looking at the existing model, the response constraint is present but empty. So, we can add our own.

Similarly, adding a "succession" constraint that "CheckApplicantRace" cannot directly precede any decision step. Wait, but in the model, the existing "succession" is about non-chronological ordering. So, maybe we need to add a new constraint type, like "noimmediateprecedence" or similar, but since the given constraints don't have that, perhaps we can use the existing "precedence" or create a new one.

But the problem says we have to add constraints using the existing keys or new ones? Since the instructions say to add new constraints, we can create new entries. So, perhaps adding a "noimmediateprecedence" or "directprecedence" constraint. Alternatively, since the existing "precedence" is empty, maybe it's not used yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the response and non-succession can be added using the existing "response" and "precedence" constraints. Let me see.

Wait, the existing "response" constraint in the model is:

"response": {
    "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

So, it's enforcing that StartApplication must be followed by RequestAdditionalInfo. But we need to enforce that any decision (Approve, Reject) cannot follow a sensitive check without a manual review in between.

So, perhaps adding a new "response" constraint where the source is any sensitive check activity and the target is the decision step.

But the current "response" is specific. So, maybe we can create a new constraint, say "no_immediate_response", which enforces that any decision step cannot immediately follow a sensitive check.

Similarly, for the coexistence constraint, ensuring that if a decision step is for a sensitive applicant, a ManualReview must coexist.

But wait, how do we represent that in the model? For coexistence, in the model, it's represented by an "exactly_one" or "coexistence" constraint. So, adding a new constraint where the activity is the decision step, and the constraint enforces that ManualReview must coexist.

Alternatively, for each decision step involving sensitive attributes, add a coexistence constraint that ManualReview must be present.

But this might become too granular. Perhaps it's better to have a general constraint that any decision step must have ManualReview coexisting if it's sensitive.

So, to implement:

1. **Response Constraint**: Any decision step cannot immediately follow a sensitive check. So, adding a new constraint, say "noimmediateprecedence", mapping all sensitive check activities to all decision steps.

But since the model doesn't have such a constraint, we need to add it. So, the new constraint would be:

"noimmediateprecedence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "CheckApplicantAge": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    # and similarly for other sensitive checks
    "CheckApplicantGender": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    }
}

Wait, but the problem is that the model doesn't have the specific sensitive check activities. So, perhaps in the model, these are abstract, and we can represent the constraint as any activity that is considered a sensitive check (like "CheckApplicantRace") cannot precede a decision step.

But in the given model, I don't see these sensitive check activities defined. So, perhaps I need to create them in the model, but the problem says to modify the existing model. So, perhaps I have to assume that the sensitive check activities are already present.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the constraint as a general constraint that for any activity, if it's a sensitive check, then the decision step cannot follow it immediately.

But in the model, we can't have activity names as variables; we have to define specific constraints.

So, perhaps the way to go is to add a new constraint type, say "noimmediateprecedence", which is a binary constraint mapping sensitive check activities to decision steps.

So, adding:

"noimmediateprecedence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "CheckApplicantAge": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "CheckApplicantGender": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    }
}

This enforces that if any of these sensitive checks occur, the next immediate activity cannot be a decision step.

Secondly, for the coexistence constraint, ensuring that if a decision step is sensitive, ManualReview must coexist.

So, adding a new "coexistence" constraint where the activity is the decision step, and it must coexist with ManualReview.

But wait, the coexistence constraint is already present in the model as "coexistence": { "StartApplication": { "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0} } }, which enforces that StartApplication and FinalDecision coexist.

So, to add a new constraint that any decision step must coexist with ManualReview if it's for a sensitive applicant, we need to create a new "coexistence" constraint.

So, for each decision step (Approve, Reject), add:

"coexistence": {
    "Approve": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "Reject": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    }
}

But wait, the coexistence constraint typically applies to a pair of activities. So, if we define it as a new constraint, for each decision step, it must coexist with ManualReview.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to define it as an "exactly_one" constraint, but since the user specified to add new constraints using the existing keys, I think "coexistence" is appropriate.

So, the new constraints I need to add are:

1. "noimmediateprecedence": Mapping sensitive check activities to decision steps, enforcing no immediate succession.

2. "coexistence": Mapping decision steps to ManualReview, enforcing coexistence.

Additionally, I might need a "preventsDirectSuccession" constraint, but since the model uses "precedence" for non-chronological ordering, maybe "noimmediateprecedence" can serve that purpose.

Wait, the existing "precedence" constraint is empty. So, maybe I can use a new "noimmediateprecedence" constraint.

So, putting it all together, the updated declare_model would have:

- The existing "noimmediateprecedence" added.

- The existing "coexistence" added with mappings for sensitive decision steps to ManualReview.

Now, writing the code, I need to add these as dictionaries.

First, for "noimmediateprecedence":

{
    "CheckApplicantRace": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "CheckApplicantAge": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "CheckApplicantGender": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    }
}

But since the model may not have these sensitive check activities defined, maybe I need to ensure they are included in the model. However, the problem says to modify the given model, so I can assume that these activities are part of the model.

Next, for the "coexistence" constraint, adding:

{
    "Approve": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "Reject": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    }
}

Putting it all together, the updated declare_model would have these new constraints added.

Finally, a brief rationale:

1. **noimmediateprecedence**: Ensures that after performing a sensitive check (like checking applicant's race, age, or gender), the next activity cannot be a decision step (Approve/Reject) without a ManualReview in between. This prevents any biased decision immediately following a sensitive check.

2. **coexistence**: Ensures that any decision step (Approve/Reject) that is sensitive (e.g., for a specific demographic) must coexist with a ManualReview activity. This ensures that there is a review step before making the final decision for sensitive applicants, reducing potential bias.

By adding these constraints, the model enforces fairness by ensuring that sensitive checks are followed by appropriate manual reviews and that decision steps for sensitive applicants have necessary checks in place.

So, the final declare_model with the new constraints is as follows.

To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we added new constraints to ensure fairness based on sensitive attributes. These constraints prevent biased decisions immediately following sensitive checks and ensure necessary manual reviews for sensitive decisions.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {},
    "noimmediateprecedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantAge": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "CheckApplicantGender": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "Approve": {
            "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "Reject": {
            "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "preventsDirectSuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **noimmediateprecedence**: This constraint ensures that after performing a sensitive check (e.g., checking age, gender, or race), the next activity cannot be a decision step (Approve/Reject) without a ManualReview in between. This prevents biased decisions immediately following sensitive checks.

2. **coexistence**: This constraint ensures that any decision step involving sensitive attributes (e.g., Approve or Reject for specific demographics) must coexist with a ManualReview activity. This ensures fairness by requiring a review before making decisions for sensitive applicants.

These constraints help reduce bias by enforcing necessary checks and reviews, ensuring that decisions are not made without appropriate safeguards for sensitive attributes.
