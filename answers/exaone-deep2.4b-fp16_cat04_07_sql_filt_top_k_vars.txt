Okay, let's tackle this DuckDB problem step by step. The goal is to find the top K variants based on their frequency and then return all events from cases that are part of those top variants. Hmm, first, I need to understand each part of the problem.

First, the process variant is the ordered sequence of activities for each case_id, sorted by timestamp. So for each case_id, I need to get all its activities in the correct order. Then, group these sequences to find unique variants. Then count how many cases each variant has, sort them by frequency, take the top K. Finally, exclude any cases not in the top K variants and return their events.

Starting with the first part: getting the ordered activities per case. Since the events are in a table, for each case_id, I need to order the activities by their timestamp. But how to do that in DuckDB? Maybe using a window function partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. The ordered_activities column would be the activity names ordered by their timestamp within each case.

Wait, but the problem says "construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id". So perhaps the first part is a query that outputs each case's ordered activities as a list. But maybe the actual steps involve several subqueries or CTEs.

Let me think. The first step is to get the ordered activities per case. Let's use a window function. For example:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT case_id, activity
FROM ordered_activities
WHERE seq = 1;

This would give the ordered list for each case. But maybe the problem wants this as part of the process. However, the first task is to construct such a query. So perhaps the first part is just that, but maybe the problem expects using ordered_activities as a CTE and then proceeding.

Next step is to group these ordered sequences into unique variants. Each variant is the ordered list of activities for a case. So the variant can be represented as a list of activities in order. To group them, we need to serialize this list into a string or some hashable format so that we can group by that.

In SQL, perhaps using JSON or a string concatenation. For example, for each case's ordered activities, create a JSON array of the activities in order, then group by that JSON.

Alternatively, using a string like concatenated activities with some delimiter. But need to ensure that the delimiter isn't part of the activity names. Maybe using JSON is safer.

So, let's proceed with the CTE approach. Let's first create the ordered_activities CTE as above. Then, for each case_id, the ordered activities are the ones with seq=1. Then, to get the variant sequences, perhaps:

WITH ordered_activities AS (...),
variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAY(activity) AS variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    WHERE seq = 1
)
Then, group by variant_sequence to count the number of cases per variant.

Wait, but the variant_sequence is a JSON array of the activities in order. So grouping by that array should group the same sequences together. Then, the count would be the number of cases per variant.

Once we have the variants and their counts, we can order them by count descending, take top K variants. Then, find all cases that belong to these top K variants. Then, from those cases, select all their events.

Putting it all together:

First, the steps in SQL:

1. Get ordered activities per case (the first part of the problem's task 1).

2. Generate variant sequences (each case's ordered activities as a JSON array).

3. Group variants and count cases per variant.

4. Order variants by count descending, take top K.

5. Find all cases that are in the top K variants.

6. Join back to the original event_log to get all events from those cases.

But the problem requires that the final result includes all events from cases that are part of the top K variants. So the final step is to select all events where their case_id is in the set of cases from the top K variants.

Now, let's structure the SQL query step by step.

First, the ordered_activities CTE:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp_cast) AS sequence_num
    FROM event_log
),
variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAY(activity) AS variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    WHERE sequence_num = 1
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
    FROM variant_sequences
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE case_count >= (SELECT k FROM generate_series(-1,0) WHERE rand() BETWEEN 0 AND 1) -- Wait, but K is a parameter here. Hmm, the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So the user will need to pass K as a parameter. So in the final query, perhaps K is a variable. But in DuckDB, you can't use a variable in the same way as other SQL databases. Wait, but the problem says "your query" so perhaps the K is a parameter that's substituted into the query. For example, in the final part, the user would replace K with the desired value. Alternatively, the problem might expect the query to accept K as a variable, but DuckDB allows parameters via the .param() function. But the problem might just want the query to be written with K as a placeholder, which the user can then adjust. Since the problem says "your query", perhaps the K is part of the query, but the exact way depends on how the problem expects it. Let me proceed assuming that K is a variable that will be substituted in the final query.

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants by their frequency". So the query should output the top K variants. So in the sorted_variants CTE, after ordering by case_count descending, we take the first K rows where case_count is >= some value. Wait, but if there are ties, how to handle? The problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So if two variants have the same count as the K-th variant, perhaps they are included. But the problem might not require handling ties, so perhaps just take the first K rows after ordering.

So, in the sorted_variants CTE:

sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE case_count >= (SELECT k FROM generate_series(-1,0) WHERE rand() BETWEEN 0 AND 1) -- No, this is not correct. Instead, to get the top K, we can use a window function with partition and order, then limit to K rows where the rank is <= K. Alternatively, use a CTE with a limit.

Alternatively, use a window function with partition and order by case_count desc, then assign rank, and then filter where rank <= K. But how to get K here? Since K is a parameter, perhaps in the final query, we can use a variable. But DuckDB allows parameters via the .param() function. Let's see.

Alternatively, the problem may expect the query to use a placeholder for K, which the user would replace with the actual value. For example, in the final part of the query, the user would set K=5 and substitute it. Since the problem says "your query", perhaps the K is part of the query, but the exact syntax depends on how DuckDB handles parameters. Let's proceed by writing the query with K as a variable, and the user can adjust it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the query to use a variable named K. Let's proceed under that assumption.

So, in the sorted_variants CTE:

sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count
    FROM sorted_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Wait, but the ROW_NUMBER() would automatically assign ranks starting at 1. So if K is 3, then rows with rank <=3 are selected. But how to get K into this? Since the problem says "top K variants", perhaps the user is to replace K with the desired value. So in the final query, the user would set K=5, for example.

Alternatively, the problem may not require handling ties, so the exact K is given. Let's proceed with the query structure.

Once we have the top K variants, we need to find all case_ids that are part of these variants. So, from the variant_sequences CTE, select case_ids where variant_sequence is in the top_k_variants' variant_sequence.

Then, the final step is to select all events from those case_ids.

Putting it all together:

The final query would be something like:

WITH ordered_activities AS (...),
variant_sequences AS (...),
variant_counts AS (...),
sorted_variants AS (...),
top_k_variants AS (...),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT es.case_id
    FROM variant_sequences es
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tv
        ON es.variant_sequence = tv.variant_sequence
),
result_events AS (
    SELECT ev.*
    FROM event_log ev
    INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc
        ON ev.case_id = fc.case_id
)
SELECT * FROM result_events;

But need to make sure all steps are covered.

Wait, let's go step by step.

First, the ordered_activities CTE:

ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp_cast) AS sequence_num
    FROM event_log
)

This gives for each case the activities ordered by timestamp.

Then variant_sequences selects the first row (sequence_num=1) for each case, converting the activities into a JSON array.

variant_counts groups by that JSON array to count cases per variant.

sorted_variants orders the variants by count descending, assigning row numbers.

top_k_variants selects the top K variants (based on row number <= K).

Then, filtered_cases gets all case_ids that are in any of the top K variants.

Then, the result_events selects all events from those case_ids.

But in the problem statement, step 4 says to return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. Wait, "belong only to" might mean that the events are part of cases that are in the top K variants. So any event in a case that is part of the top K variants is included, regardless of whether the event itself is part of a variant. So the final step is to select all events from cases in the filtered_cases.

Now, putting all together into a single query with all CTEs.

But the problem requires that the final query returns all events from cases that are part of the top K variants. So the final SELECT is on the original event_log, filtered by case_id in filtered_cases.

Now, let's code this step by step.

First, the ordered_activities CTE:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp_cast) AS sequence_num
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT * FROM ordered_activities; -- Not needed, but part of the process.

Then variant_sequences:

variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAY(activity) AS variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    WHERE sequence_num = 1
)

variant_counts:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
    FROM variant_sequences
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
)

sorted_variants:

sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
)

top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence
    FROM sorted_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
)

filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM variant_sequences
    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
)

result_events AS (
    SELECT ev.*
    FROM event_log ev
    INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON ev.case_id = fc.case_id
)

SELECT * FROM result_events;

Wait, but in the variant_sequences, each case has exactly one variant_sequence (since we took sequence_num=1). So when we join variant_sequences to top_k_variants, each case in the top K variants will have their variant_sequence in the top_k_variants, so the IN clause will match. So the filtered_cases will get all case_ids that have their variant in the top K variants.

Then, the result_events selects all events from those cases.

But the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants". The "only to" might mean that the events are part of cases in the top K, so the INNER JOIN is correct.

Now, the problem mentions that the first step is to construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id. The ordered_activities CTE does that, but perhaps the first part of the problem requires a query that outputs the ordered sequences. However, the problem's first part is part of the steps to solve the entire problem, so the final query must include all steps.

Wait, the problem says "your task" includes four steps, and the final answer is the query that does all four steps. So the entire solution must be a single SQL query that does all four steps. So the query must include all the CTEs and steps as above.

Now, the problem mentions that the final query should return all events from cases in the top K variants. So the code above does that.

But what about the ordering of the output? The problem doesn't specify any ordering, so we can leave it as is.

Now, testing for possible issues:

- The JSON array for the variant sequences: using JSON_ARRAY(activity) should create an array of the activity strings in order. Since the activities are ordered by sequence_num=1, this should capture the correct order.

- The grouping by variant_sequence (the JSON array) should correctly group the same sequences. However, in some SQL dialects, JSON arrays are compared by their contents, so this should work in DuckDB.

- The ROW_NUMBER() in sorted_variants orders by case_count descending, so the top K are those with the highest counts.

- The filtered_cases uses IN to select all case_ids whose variant is in the top K variants. Since each case has exactly one variant_sequence, this should work.

Now, the final step is to return all events from those cases. The result_events CTE does that via INNER JOIN.

Now, the problem requires that the final query returns all events from cases that are part of the top K variants. So this should be correct.

Now, the problem mentions that the first part of the task is to construct a query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id. The ordered_activities CTE does that. However, the problem's first step is part of the overall solution, so the entire query must include that. The ordered_activities CTE is part of the query, so that's covered.

Now, the problem says "ensure that you correctly extract the ordered sequence of activities per case". The ordered_activities CTE's first part does that via the sequence_num and the ordered_activities' activities ordered by timestamp.

Now, the problem requires that the final query returns all events from cases in the top K variants. The code above does that.

Now, possible edge cases: what if two different cases have the same sequence of activities (same variant_sequence)? They would be grouped into the same variant, and counted together. That's correct.

Another edge case: if K is 0, but the problem probably assumes K is a positive integer provided by the user.

Now, the problem mentions "the top K variants by their frequency". So the count is the number of cases per variant, so the variant with the highest count is first.

Now, the code uses K as a variable. In DuckDB, to parameterize this, you can use the .param() function. For example:

.param(K, 5)

But in the query, you would need to set the parameter before executing. However, the problem says "your query", so perhaps the K is part of the query as a placeholder, and the user is to replace it. Alternatively, the problem may expect the query to use a variable named K. Since DuckDB allows variables via the .param() function, perhaps the correct way is to include K as a parameter.

But in the problem statement's example, the user is to write the query, so perhaps the code should include K as a variable. Let me adjust the query to use K as a variable.

Wait, in DuckDB, you can use variables via the .param() function. For example:

.param(K, 5)

But when writing the query, you can't use K directly unless it's defined. Alternatively, the query can be written with K as a placeholder, and the user would replace it with the desired value. Since the problem says "your query", perhaps the K is part of the query's parameters. However, the problem may not require handling that part, as the exact value of K is given. Alternatively, the problem may expect the query to use K as a variable, which the user can set.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the query to use a variable named K, and the user can adjust it. Since the problem says "your query", I'll proceed with the code as written, using K as a variable parameter.

Wait, but in the code above, the top_k_variants CTE uses K as a parameter. So in DuckDB, you can define a variable K and set it before running the query. For example:

.param(K, 5)

But in the query itself, you can't use K unless it's defined. So perhaps the correct way is to use a placeholder, like K is a parameter passed into the query. Since the problem doesn't specify how K is provided, perhaps the query should be written with K as a variable, and the user can replace it with the desired value. So the code as written is correct, assuming that K is a variable that will be set to the desired top K value before executing the query.

Therefore, the final query would look like this:

WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp_cast) AS sequence_num
    FROM event_log
),
variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAY(activity) AS variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    WHERE sequence_num = 1
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
    FROM variant_sequences
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence
    FROM sorted_variants
    WHERE rank <= K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM variant_sequences
    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
),
result_events AS (
    SELECT ev.*
    FROM event_log ev
    INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON ev.case_id = fc.case_id
)
SELECT * FROM result_events;

But wait, in the variant_sequences CTE, each case_id has exactly one variant_sequence (since we take sequence_num=1). So when we join to top_k_variants, each case in the top K variants will have their variant_sequence in the top_k_variants, so the IN clause will work. The DISTINCT in filtered_cases is redundant here because each case has only one variant_sequence, so no duplicates. So that line can be removed.

filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM variant_sequences
    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
)

Yes.

Now, the problem requires that the final query returns all events from cases in the top K variants. The result_events CTE does that via INNER JOIN.

Now, the problem's first step requires constructing a query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id. The ordered_activities CTE does that, but the problem's first step is part of the overall solution. The ordered_activities CTE is part of the query, so that's covered.

Another thing to check: the problem says "the ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp". The ordered_activities CTE's sequence_num is based on the ordered by timestamp_cast, which is the original timestamp. So that's correct.

Now, the problem's second step is to group by their complete activity sequence to identify unique variants. The variant_sequences CTE captures each case's ordered activities as a JSON array, which is the variant sequence. Grouping by that array gives the unique variants.

The third step is to count cases per variant, which is done in variant_counts.

The fourth step is to filter to top K variants and return their events, which is done in the final steps.

Therefore, this query should satisfy all the problem's requirements.
</thought>

Here's the DuckDB SQL query to solve the problem:

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp_cast,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp_cast) AS sequence_num
    FROM event_log
),
variant_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        JSON_ARRAY(activity) AS variant_sequence
    FROM ordered_activities
    WHERE sequence_num = 1
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS case_count
    FROM variant_sequences
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
sorted_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_sequence
    FROM sorted_variants
    WHERE rank <= K  -- K is the desired top count parameter
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM variant_sequences
    WHERE variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM top_k_variants)
),
result_events AS (
    SELECT ev.*
    FROM event_log ev
    INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc ON ev.case_id = fc.case_id
)
SELECT * FROM result_events;
```

### Explanation:
1. **ordered_activities**: Uses a window function to order events by timestamp within each case and assign a sequence number.
2. **variant_sequences**: Converts the first activity sequence (sorted by timestamp) of each case into a JSON array to represent the full variant.
3. **variant_counts**: Groups variants and counts how many cases belong to each unique sequence.
4. **sorted_variants**: Orders variants by frequency (descending) and assigns ranks.
5. **top_k_variants**: Selects the top K variants based on the rank parameter.
6. **filtered_cases**: Identifies all cases that belong to the top K variants.
7. **result_events**: Retrieves all events from the original log that belong to cases in the top K variants.

### Usage Notes:
- Replace `K` with the desired number of top variants (e.g., `K=5`).
- Ensure the input table `event_log` has columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.
- The JSON array representation of activities ensures accurate variant comparison and grouping.
