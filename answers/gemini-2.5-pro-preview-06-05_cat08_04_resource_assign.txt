### **Executive Summary for TechSolve Solutions**

TechSolve Solutions is facing critical operational challenges, including SLA breaches and inefficient resource utilization, which stem from suboptimal resource assignment practices. The existing event log data is a powerful asset that can be leveraged through process mining to move from a reactive, manual assignment model to a proactive, data-driven one. This proposal outlines a five-stage methodology: first, we will analyze current resource behaviors and patterns to establish a baseline. Second, we will pinpoint and quantify the specific bottlenecks and their impact. Third, we will perform a root cause analysis to understand *why* these inefficiencies exist. Fourth, we will develop intelligent, data-backed assignment strategies. Finally, we will outline a plan to simulate, implement, and continuously monitor these new strategies to ensure sustained improvement and a higher return on your most valuable asset: your skilled support agents.

### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

The first step is to transform the raw event log data into a clear picture of how work is currently being done. This provides the factual basis for all subsequent analysis and recommendations.

#### **Performance and Behavior of Agents and Tiers**

Using the event log, we will extract key performance indicators (KPIs) for individual resources and tiers:

*   **Workload Distribution:** We will count the number of activities and unique cases handled by each agent, team, and tier (L1, L2, L3) over time. This will immediately validate or refute the suspicion of uneven workload distribution.
*   **Activity Processing Time:** By calculating the duration between `START` and `COMPLETE` events for activities like "Work L1" or "Work L2," we can measure the average time agents take to handle tasks. We can slice this by ticket priority and category to see who is fastest with what type of work.
*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** For L1, we will identify all cases that were created and resolved by a single L1 agent without any escalation or reassignment. The percentage of such cases is the true FCR rate, a critical measure of L1 effectiveness.
*   **Ticket Handling Profile:** We will create a profile for each agent showing the frequency with which they handle different `Ticket Category` and `Required Skill` types. This reveals their *de facto* specializations.

#### **Revealing Actual Assignment Patterns**

Process mining tools will allow us to visualize the real process flow, moving beyond the intended "round-robin" logic.

*   **Process Discovery and Visualization:** We will generate a detailed process map from the event log. This map will visually expose the high frequency of `Reassign` and `Escalate` activities as "spaghetti" loops and complex paths, clearly showing deviations from the ideal, linear process.
*   **Social Network Analysis (Handovers):** We will model resources (agents) as nodes in a network and ticket handovers as edges connecting them. The thickness of an edge represents the frequency of handovers. This will instantly highlight:
    *   **Ping-Pong Reassignments:** Strong, bi-directional links between two L2 agents indicate they are frequently reassigning tickets back and forth.
    *   **Ineffective Escalations:** A high volume of escalations from L1 to a specific L2 agent who then reassigns the ticket elsewhere suggests the L1 team is misjudging the required skill.
    *   **Bottleneck Resources:** Agents who are central hubs in the network are likely bottlenecks or key players in the process.
*   **Role Discovery:** This advanced technique clusters agents based on their actual behavior (the types of activities they perform). We might discover that some L1 agents behave more like L2 specialists for certain ticket types, or that highly skilled L3 agents are performing L1-level activities. This compares the *designed roles* (L1, L2) with the *discovered roles* (how they actually work).

#### **Analyzing Skill Utilization**

We will conduct a gap analysis between skills possessed and skills required.

*   **Skill Mismatch Matrix:** We will create a matrix correlating an agent's documented `Agent Skills` with the `Required Skill` of the tickets they resolve. This will quantify mismatches. For example, we might find that agents with the 'Networking-Firewall' skill are spending 40% of their time on 'Software-App' tickets, indicating underutilization of their core expertise and potentially taking work from the correct team.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

With the "as-is" process understood, we can pinpoint and quantify specific problems.

*   **Skill-Based Bottlenecks:** We will measure the waiting time between an `Assign` activity and the corresponding `Work Start` activity. By filtering for a specific `Required Skill` (e.g., 'Security-IAM'), we can identify skills for which there is a long queue. **Quantification:** "Tickets requiring the 'Security-IAM' skill wait an average of 4.5 hours for an agent to become available, compared to a 30-minute average for 'App-CRM'."
*   **Cost of Reassignments:** We will calculate the average time added to a ticket's lifecycle for each `Reassign` event. **Quantification:** "Each L2-to-L2 reassignment adds an average of 3.2 hours to the ticket resolution time."
*   **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignment:** By analyzing variants, we can compare tickets resolved by the first assigned agent versus those requiring reassignment. **Quantification:** "Tickets reassigned at the L2 level are 70% more likely to breach their SLA than those handled by the first assigned L2 agent."
*   **Identification of Overloaded/Underperforming Teams:** The workload and processing time analysis will identify teams or agents who are clear outliers. For example, the L2 Network team may have a consistently high queue and long processing times, indicating they are understaffed or their tickets are more complex than anticipated.
*   **Correlation with SLA Breaches:** We will use process filtering to isolate all cases that breached their SLA. By analyzing the process maps and statistics for *only these cases*, we can identify common patterns. **Quantification:** "85% of breached P2 tickets involved at least one reassignment, and 60% were waiting for an agent with 'Database-SQL' skills."

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

This stage focuses on understanding the "why" behind the identified issues.

*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    1.  **Flawed Assignment Logic:** The round-robin system inherently ignores agent skills and current workload, causing predictable mismatches and bottlenecks.
    2.  **Poor Initial Triage:** Inaccurate initial `Ticket Category` or `Required Skill` identification (whether by a dispatcher or L1 agent) is a primary driver for reassignments.
    3.  **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:** Agent skill data in the system may be outdated or incomplete, leading the assignment system (even a manual one) to make poor choices.
    4.  **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Dispatchers and agents may not have access to real-time agent availability and queue lengths, making it impossible to load-balance effectively.
    5.  **Insufficient L1 Empowerment:** If L1 agents lack the training, documentation (knowledge base), or permissions to resolve a wider range of issues, they will naturally escalate more frequently.

*   **Data-Driven Root Cause Identification:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** We will compare the end-to-end process of "happy path" cases (e.g., resolved within SLA, no reassignments) with "unhappy path" cases (SLA breach, multiple reassignments). By comparing the starting attributes (`Ticket Category`, `Priority`, initial channel), we can identify which ticket types are most prone to inefficient handling. For instance, we may find that tickets created via email with the category "Hardware" are almost always misrouted initially.
    *   **Decision Mining:** At key decision points like "Escalate L2" or "Reassign," we can analyze the data attributes that influenced the decision. This can reveal flawed rules, such as "L1 agents always escalate 'Network' tickets, even simple ones that could be resolved with basic training." This helps pinpoint specific process or training gaps.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Based on the analysis, we propose the following concrete strategies to overhaul the resource assignment logic.

#### **Strategy 1: Implement Skill-Based & Proficiency-Aware Routing**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Mismatches between ticket requirements and agent skills; underutilization of specialists.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** Uses the `Skill Mismatch Matrix` and `Ticket Handling Profile` to understand which skills are needed for which tickets. It directly counters the ineffective round-robin logic.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   An accurate, maintained `Required Skill` field for each ticket.
    *   A comprehensive and up-to-date skills matrix for all agents, ideally including a proficiency level (e.g., 1-Beginner, 5-Expert).
*   **Expected Benefits:** Drastically reduced reassignments, higher first-touch resolution rates for the assigned agent, improved job satisfaction for specialists, and faster resolution times.

#### **Strategy 2: Develop Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and delays caused by assigning tickets to already overloaded agents.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** Built upon the `Workload Distribution` and `Queue Time` analysis, which identifies overloaded agents and teams.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Real-time agent status (Available, On a Ticket, In a Meeting, Offline).
    *   A real-time count of tickets currently in each agent's personal queue.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Balanced workload across the team, reduced agent burnout, minimized queue times, and improved overall throughput. This strategy would be layered on top of skill-based routing. The system would first find all available agents with the right skill, then assign the ticket to the one with the lowest current workload.

#### **Strategy 3: Introduce Predictive Ticket Assignment and Escalation**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial assignment and unnecessary L1 handling for tickets that will inevitably be escalated.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** Uses the insights from `Variant Analysis` and `Decision Mining` to build a predictive model. The model learns the characteristics of tickets that are historically escalated or reassigned.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Historical data of ticket attributes (category, priority, keywords from the description).
    *   The eventual `Required Skill` and `Resolving Tier` for each historical ticket.
*   **Process:** A machine learning model can be trained to predict the `Required Skill` and likely `Resolving Tier` (L1, L2, L3) at the moment of ticket creation.
    *   **Intelligent Routing:** A ticket predicted with 95% confidence to require an 'L2-Database-SQL' skill can bypass L1 entirely and be routed directly to the appropriate L2 queue.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Significantly reduced end-to-end resolution time for complex issues, frees up L1 capacity to focus on solvable tickets, leading to a better FCR rate and improved customer satisfaction.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

A phased rollout is critical to manage change and measure success.

#### **Business Process Simulation**
Before making any live changes, we will use the discovered process model and resource data (schedules, costs, processing times) to build a dynamic simulation model. Within this model, we can run "what-if" scenarios:
*   **Scenario A (Baseline):** The current "as-is" process with round-robin logic.
*   **Scenario B:** Implementing Strategy 1 (Skill-Based Routing).
*   **Scenario C:** Implementing Strategy 1 + 2 (Skill and Workload-Aware).
The simulation will provide projected outcomes for KPIs like average resolution time, SLA compliance rate, and resource utilization for each scenario, allowing us to choose the most impactful strategy and build a strong business case for the change.

#### **Implementation and Continuous Monitoring**
Post-implementation, we will set up a series of process mining dashboards to monitor the new system's effectiveness in real-time. Key metrics to track include:
*   **SLA Compliance Rate:** Monitored overall and broken down by priority and category.
*   **Reassignment Rate:** This KPI should show a significant and sustained decrease.
*   **Average Resolution Time:** Tracked to ensure it is decreasing, especially for P2/P3 tickets.
*   **First-Call Resolution Rate (L1):** This should improve as L1 focuses on their core competencies.
*   **Resource Utilization & Workload Balance:** A heat map showing agent workload should appear more evenly distributed.
*   **Live Process Map:** Continuously monitoring the process map to ensure the "ping-pong" and "spaghetti" patterns do not reappear.

By following this structured, data-driven methodology, TechSolve can move beyond guesswork and fundamentally re-engineer its resource assignment process to be more efficient, intelligent, and aligned with its business goals.
