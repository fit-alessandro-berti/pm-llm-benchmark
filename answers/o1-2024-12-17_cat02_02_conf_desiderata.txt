Below is a structured evaluation of each case, discussing normative (strict) rules and desiderata (non-strict) recommendations, followed by possible interpretations of the observed behaviors.

### 1. Normative Violations

**Case 1:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
- **Check Against Normative Rules:**  
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment? **Yes**  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision? **Yes**  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision? **Yes**  
  - For approved decision, Finalize Documentation before Close Case? **Yes**  
  - No contradictory actions? **None observed**  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative violations.** Case 1 strictly follows the required sequence.

**Case 2:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received → Risk Assessment (before Credit Check) → Credit Check → Loan Decision (Rejected) → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
- **Check Against Normative Rules:**  
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment? **No**, Risk Assessment was done at 08:20 and Credit Check at 09:00. This violates the sequence.  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision? The order is moot since the Credit Check was delayed; however, had it been done in the correct order, it would be fine. The key violation is the Risk Assessment occurring too soon.  
  - Loan Decision after Risk Assessment is correct in order, but the initial order was already broken.  
  - For a rejected decision, Finalize Documentation should **not** occur. They finalized documentation at 10:00 after a rejection at 09:30. This is a direct violation.  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **Normative violations present:**  
  1. Performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
  2. Finalizing Documentation after a rejection.

**Case 3:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00) → Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case.
- **Check Against Normative Rules:**  
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment? **Yes**  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision? **Yes**  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision? **Yes**  
  - Approved decision followed by Finalize Documentation before Close Case? **Yes**  
- **Conclusion:**  
  **No normative violations.** The sequence is correct, though timing is not ideal.

### 2. Desiderata Violations (Non-Strict)

**Case 1:**  
- **Recommended but not strict conditions:**
  - Perform Credit Check shortly after Application Received (e.g., within 24 hours): Done within 30 minutes. **No issue**  
  - Inform Applicant promptly after Decision (e.g., within 48 hours): Informed within 2 hours. **No issue**  
  - Optional Follow-up Call before closing: Not performed (no such activity logged). This is a missed recommendation but **not a serious violation**.

**Case 2:**  
- Given the severe normative violations, the desiderata are less relevant. If we still consider them:
  - Timing recommendations (Credit Check within 24 hours): Credit Check was done at 09:00 the same day, so no timing issue per se.  
  - Inform Applicant promptly: Applicant was never explicitly “Informed” in a separate step post-decision, although a rejection decision was made. Instead, they jumped to Finalize Documentation.  
  - Follow-up Call: Not performed.  
- In any case, the main problem here is normative, which overshadows any non-strict recommendation violations.

**Case 3:**  
- **Desiderata checks:**
  - Timely Credit Check: Occurred about two days after the Application Received. This exceeds the recommended 24-hour window, but is **not a strict violation**.  
  - Inform Applicant promptly: Occurred roughly 4 days after the Loan Decision. This exceeds the recommended 48-hour window, but again, **not strictly prohibited**.  
  - Follow-up Call recommended but not performed. This again is only a suggestion, not a requirement.

### 3. Possible Justifications and Interpretations

**Case 1:**  
- This case adheres to all normative rules and meets all recommended timings. The lack of a Follow-up Call might be due to internal policies or a decision that it was not necessary. Since it’s merely a recommendation, the organization might have deemed it unnecessary for this particular case.

**Case 2:**  
- The early Risk Assessment before the Credit Check could have been a human error or a system misstep. Perhaps the assessor mistakenly proceeded with risk evaluation without the credit check results.  
- Finalizing Documentation after rejection could indicate a misunderstanding of the process rules or an automated system error that triggered documentation finalization regardless of decision outcome.  
- From a managerial perspective, this might indicate the need for retraining or stricter enforcement of the process guidelines.

**Case 3:**  
- The delayed Credit Check and late Inform Applicant steps may be explained by workload issues, staffing shortages, or waiting on external data (e.g., from a credit bureau).  
- The absence of a Follow-up Call might be due to time constraints or a judgment call that it was not necessary. Given that these are recommendations, operational priorities or resource constraints might justify the delays.

### Summary

- **Normative Violations:**  
  - **Case 2:** Fails the strict sequence rule and performs a forbidden action (finalizing documentation after rejection).

- **Desiderata (Recommended) Violations:**  
  - **Case 1:** Skipped the Follow-up Call (minor)  
  - **Case 3:** Delayed Credit Check, late Inform Applicant, and no Follow-up Call. None of these timing or optional activity issues are serious, but they are suboptimal.

By identifying where mandatory rules are broken and where recommendations are not followed, we highlight opportunities for process enforcement (Case 2) and performance improvement (Case 3), while acknowledging that non-adherence to recommendations does not constitute a formal rule violation.
