Below is a simple aggregation of the observed lowlevel events into higherlevel process steps, along with naming and rationale. The pattern is consistent across cases, so the same grouping rules apply to all CaseIDs.

### Proposed HighLevel Activities and Grouping Rules

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Included lowlevel events:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Rationale:** These actions are contiguous in time, performed to identify and prepare a single raw part for processing. They involve material handling, identification, positioning, and preconditioning before any assembly or joining operation.

2. **Welding/Assembly**
   - **Included lowlevel events:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
   - **Rationale:** These steps are the core joining/assembly operations. The tool pickup precedes the welds; all are executed by the welding operator in sequence.

3. **InProcess Weld Quality Check**
   - **Included lowlevel events:**
     - Measure weld integrity
   - **Rationale:** A dedicated quality measurement immediately follows welding to verify the joint before further processing.

4. **Surface Protection & Drying**
   - **Included lowlevel events:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Rationale:** These steps apply and cure a surface treatment. They are temporally adjacent and both relate to finishing/protection.

5. **Final Inspection**
   - **Included lowlevel events:**
     - Visual check
   - **Rationale:** A final human inspection occurs after all processing and finishing to certify the part.

### Structured Representation (Example Mapping per Case)

For each `CaseID`, group the events into the above highlevel activities:

```json
{
  "CaseID": "A1",
  "HighLevelActivities": [
    {
      "Name": "Material Preparation",
      "Events": [
        "Retrieve raw metal sheet",
        "Scan barcode",
        "Place metal sheet on table",
        "Align metal sheet",
        "Preheat metal sheet"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Welding/Assembly",
      "Events": [
        "Pick up welding tool",
        "Weld corner A",
        "Weld corner B"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "In-Process Weld Quality Check",
      "Events": [
        "Measure weld integrity"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Surface Protection & Drying",
      "Events": [
        "Apply protective coating",
        "Dry coating"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Name": "Final Inspection",
      "Events": [
        "Visual check"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The same grouping applies to `CaseID = "B2"` (and other cases following the same pattern), as the sequence and timing of lowlevel events are consistent.
