## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration
To create a cohesive event log suitable for process mining, the following steps are necessary:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   * Remove any duplicate or erroneous records.
   * Standardize time formats and ensure all timestamps are in the same time zone.
   * Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., interpolate or exclude).

2. **Data Integration:**
   * **GPS Data:** Map GPS coordinates to specific vehicles, drivers, and delivery stops. Ensure timestamps align with other event data.
   * **Scanner Data:** Synchronize scanner timestamps with GPS and dispatch data to create a unified timeline of events.
   * **Dispatch System:** Match planned routes and assignments with actual delivery data.
   * **Maintenance Logs:** Incorporate maintenance events into the timeline, linking them to specific vehicles and drivers.

3. **Event Log Creation:**
   * Aggregate data into a structured event log where each event includes:
     * Timestamp
     * Event Type (e.g., Depart Depot, Arrive Customer)
     * Case ID (e.g., Vehicle-Day)
     * Activity/Status
     * Vehicle ID
     * Driver ID
     * Package ID (if applicable)
     * Location (Lat/Lon)
     * Speed (if applicable)
     * Notes

**Challenges:**
* Ensuring data consistency across different sources.
* Handling discrepancies in timestamps and event sequences.
* Managing large volumes of data efficiently.

### Process Discovery Algorithms
Use process discovery algorithms such as Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, or Fuzzy Miner to visualize the actual end-to-end delivery process. These algorithms can generate process models that depict the sequence of activities from depot departure to return, including deliveries, travel, delays, and deviations.

### Conformance Checking
* **Comparison Against Planned Routes:**
  * Use conformance checking techniques to compare the discovered process models with the planned routes from the dispatch system.
  * Look for deviations such as:
    * Sequence deviations (e.g., deliveries made out of planned order).
    * Unplanned stops (e.g., unscheduled maintenance).
    * Significant timing differences (e.g., actual travel times vs. planned times).

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries made within the promised time window.
* **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Calculated by averaging the time intervals between 'Arrive Customer' and 'Depart Customer'.
* **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Compare the total travel time to the total service time.
* **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Derived from GPS data and fuel records.
* **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time each vehicle is actively engaged in delivery vs. idle.
* **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Identified through GPS data showing low speeds in non-service areas.
* **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Percentage of deliveries that failed on the first attempt.

### Bottleneck Identification
* **Event Log Analysis:**
  * Use process mining techniques to identify bottlenecks by analyzing event frequencies and durations.
  * Look for patterns in specific routes, times of day, drivers, vehicle types, and traffic hotspots.
* **Bottleneck Quantification:**
  * Quantify the impact by calculating the time lost or additional costs incurred due to bottlenecks.
  * Use techniques like Fuzzy Miner to visualize and pinpoint bottlenecks.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Potential Root Causes
* **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes may not account for real-time traffic conditions.
* **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Leading to delays and inefficient routing.
* **Traffic Congestion Patterns:** Regular traffic jams affecting delivery times.
* **High Variability in Service Time:** Differences in customer interaction times.
* **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Frequent maintenance needs during shifts.
* **Driver Behavior:** Variations in driving habits and skills.
* **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Requiring re-delivery, adding extra costs and time.

### Validation Through Process Mining
* **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers.
* **Traffic Data Correlation:** Analyze the correlation between traffic data and delivery delays.
* **Dwell Time Analysis:** Examine dwell times at customer locations to understand service time variability.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments
* **Targeted Inefficiency:** Suboptimal route planning.
* **Root Cause:** Static routes not adapting to real-time conditions.
* **Proposal:** Implement dynamic routing adjustments based on real-time traffic data and process insights.
* **Expected Impact:** Improved on-time delivery rate and reduced travel time.

### Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories
* **Targeted Inefficiency:** High variability in service time and frequent failed deliveries.
* **Root Cause:** Inefficient territory assignment leading to longer service times.
* **Proposal:** Optimize delivery territories based on historical performance data.
* **Expected Impact:** Reduced average time per delivery stop and lower rate of failed deliveries.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Schedules
* **Targeted Inefficiency:** Frequent vehicle breakdowns and unscheduled maintenance.
* **Root Cause:** Poor maintenance scheduling.
* **Proposal:** Develop predictive maintenance schedules based on vehicle usage patterns.
* **Expected Impact:** Reduced unscheduled stops and improved vehicle utilization rate.

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### Accounting for Operational Constraints
* **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure routes are planned within legal working hour limits.
* **Vehicle Capacities:** Optimize load distribution to avoid overloading.
* **Customer Time Windows:** Adjust routes to respect customer-requested delivery times.

### Continuous Monitoring Plan
* **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  * Track key metrics such as on-time delivery rate, average time per delivery stop, and vehicle utilization rate.
  * Monitor process views like bottleneck locations, traffic delay patterns, and driver performance.
* **Early Detection of Issues:**
  * Use real-time data feeds to detect emerging issues quickly.
  * Implement alerts for significant deviations from expected performance.

By following this structured approach, Speedy Parcels can leverage process mining to gain actionable insights, identify root causes of inefficiencies, and implement data-driven optimization strategies to improve delivery punctuality and reduce operational costs.
