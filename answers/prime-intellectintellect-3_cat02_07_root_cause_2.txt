We are given an event log with the following columns: Case ID, Timestamp, Activity, Resource, Region, Complexity.
 The goal is to:
  1. Identify cases with performance issues (i.e., longer lead times).
  2. Analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) to determine root causes of extended durations.

 Steps:
 1. Calculate the total duration for each case (from the first event to the last event).
 2. Identify cases that take significantly longer. We can set a threshold (e.g., based on the mean + 2*std, or by visual inspection) or compare with the majority.

 Let's compute the duration for each case:

 Case 2001:
   Start: 2024-04-01 09:00
   End:   2024-04-01 10:30
   Duration: 1.5 hours

 Case 2002:
   Start: 2024-04-01 09:05
   End:   2024-04-02 11:00
   Duration: 25 hours 55 minutes (approx 25.92 hours)

 Case 2003:
   Start: 2024-04-01 09:10
   End:   2024-04-03 09:30
   Duration: 48 hours 20 minutes (approx 48.33 hours)

 Case 2004:
   Start: 2024-04-01 09:20
   End:   2024-04-01 10:45
   Duration: 1.42 hours (85 minutes)

 Case 2005:
   Start: 2024-04-01 09:25
   End:   2024-04-04 14:30
   Duration: 3 days 5 hours 5 minutes = 77 hours 5 minutes (approx 77.08 hours)

 Now, we can see that:
   Case 2001: 1.5 hours
   Case 2002: ~25.92 hours
   Case 2003: ~48.33 hours
   Case 2004: ~1.42 hours
   Case 2005: ~77.08 hours

 The cases that are taking significantly longer are 2002, 2003, and 2005. However, note that 2001 and 2004 are very fast (both low complexity and in region A and B respectively, but note 2001 is in A and 2004 in B).

 Let's break down by attributes:

 Complexity:
   Low: Cases 2001 (1.5h), 2004 (1.42h) -> both fast.
   Medium: Case 2002 (25.92h) -> longer.
   High: Cases 2003 (48.33h), 2005 (77.08h) -> much longer.

 So, complexity seems to be a factor: medium and high complexity cases take longer.

 But note that in the medium complexity case (2002) we have:
   Steps: Submit -> Evaluate -> Request Additional Documents -> Approve -> Pay -> Close.
   The delay seems to be between "Evaluate Claim" (ends at 09:45 on 2024-04-01) and the next event "Request Additional Documents" at 14:00 same day (4 hours 15 minutes gap) and then a night and day until next day 10:00 for "Approve Claim".

 In high complexity cases (2003 and 2005), we see multiple "Request Additional Documents" events and long gaps.

 Now, let's look at the resources and regions:

 Case 2001: Region A, Resource: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Ann, Finance_Alan, CSR_Jane -> Low complexity -> fast.
 Case 2002: Region B, Resource: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Ann, Finance_Carl, CSR_Paul -> Medium complexity -> 25.92 hours.
 Case 2003: Region A, Resource: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan, CSR_Jane -> High complexity -> 48.33 hours.
 Case 2004: Region B, Resource: CSR_Mary, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Ann, Finance_Carl, CSR_Mary -> Low complexity -> fast.
 Case 2005: Region B, Resource: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl, CSR_Paul -> High complexity -> 77.08 hours.

 We see that:
   Region A: 
        Case 2001 (Low): fast (1.5h)
        Case 2003 (High): slow (48.33h)
   Region B:
        Case 2002 (Medium): slow (25.92h)
        Case 2004 (Low): fast (1.42h)
        Case 2005 (High): very slow (77.08h)

 So, both regions have fast and slow cases, but the slow cases are associated with higher complexity.

 However, note that in Region A, the high complexity case (2003) took 48.33 hours, while in Region B the high complexity case (2005) took 77.08 hours. So within high complexity, Region B is slower.

 Also, note the resources:

 Adjuster_Lisa is handling:
   Case 2002 (Medium) and Case 2005 (High) in Region B -> both are slow.

 Adjuster_Mike is handling:
   Case 2001 (Low) in Region A -> fast, and Case 2003 (High) in Region A -> slow.

 So Adjuster_Lisa's cases (2002 and 2005) are both slow, but note that they are of medium and high complexity. Similarly, Adjuster_Mike handled a fast low and a slow high.

 Now, let's look at the specific delays in the process:

 For Case 2002 (Medium, Region B, Adjuster_Lisa):
   After Evaluate Claim (ends at 09:45 on 2024-04-01) -> next event is Request Additional Documents at 14:00 same day (gap: 4h15m). Then from Request Additional Documents (ends at 14:00) to next event (Approve Claim) is 20 hours (until next day 10:00).

 For Case 2003 (High, Region A, Adjuster_Mike):
   After Evaluate Claim (ends at 09:40 on 2024-04-01) -> next event is Request Additional Documents at 11:00 (gap: 1h20m). Then next Request Additional Documents at 17:00 same day (gap: 6h). Then gap until next day 16:00 (Approve Claim) -> 23 hours. Then gap until next day 09:00 (Pay Claim) -> 17 hours.

 For Case 2005 (High, Region B, Adjuster_Lisa):
   After Evaluate Claim (ends at 09:50 on 2024-04-01) -> next event Request Additional Documents at 11:30 (gap: 1h40m). Then next at 17:00 same day (gap: 5h30m). Then next at 15:00 next day (gap: 22 hours). Then gap until next day 10:00 (Approve Claim) -> 19 hours. Then gap until 14:00 same day (4 hours).

 We see that the delays occur mainly in the "Request Additional Documents" and the subsequent waiting until the next event (which might be the next request or approval).

 Now, let's analyze by activity:

 - Submit Claim: very short (all cases: within 30 minutes of the previous, usually immediate).
 - Evaluate Claim: immediate after submit? Not exactly, but within 30-40 minutes? Actually, in the log, the events are not necessarily in order of time? But we see they are ordered by timestamp.

 However, note that the event log is sorted by timestamp per case? Actually, the table is sorted by timestamp overall? But we can group by case and then by timestamp.

 The real delays are in the "Request Additional Documents" phase and the waiting for the next step (which might be the next request or the approval).

 Now, let's see the number of "Request Additional Documents" events per case:

 Case 2001: 0
 Case 2002: 1
 Case 2003: 2 (two events: at 11:00 and 17:00 on 2024-04-01)
 Case 2005: 3 (at 11:30, 17:00 on 2024-04-01, and 15:00 on 2024-04-02)

 So the more requests, the longer the case? Not necessarily, because Case 2002 has only one request but took 25.92 hours, while Case 2003 (two requests) took 48.33 hours, and Case 2005 (three requests) took 77.08 hours.

 But note that the time between requests and the time from the last request to approval is also important.

 Root cause analysis:

 1. Complexity: 
    - High complexity cases require more requests for additional documents (as seen in 2003 and 2005) and hence take longer.
    - Medium complexity may require at least one request (2002) and also take longer than low.

 2. Region: 
    - Region A: 
        Low: fast (2001)
        High: slow (2003) -> but note that 2003 had two requests and long gaps (like 23 hours after last request until approval).
    - Region B:
        Low: fast (2004)
        Medium: slow (2002) -> one request but with a 20-hour gap after the request until approval.
        High: very slow (2005) -> three requests and long gaps.

    There might be a regional difference in handling: 
        In Region B, after a request for additional documents, the approval step took 20 hours in Case 2002 and 19 hours in Case 2005. 
        In Region A, after the last request in Case 2003, it took 23 hours until approval.

    However, note that the approval step in Case 2003 was done by Manager_Bill, while in Case 2002 and 2005 by Manager_Ann and Manager_Bill respectively.

 3. Resource:
    - Adjuster_Lisa: handled Case 2002 (medium) and 2005 (high) -> both slow. 
        In both cases, she made multiple requests? Actually, in Case 2002 she made one request and in Case 2005 three. 
        But note that the gap after her request in Case 2002 was 20 hours until approval, and in Case 2005 the gaps between requests were 5h30m and 22h, and then 19h until approval.

    - Adjuster_Mike: handled Case 2001 (low) and 2003 (high). 
        Case 2001: no request, fast. 
        Case 2003: two requests, slow. 
        The gaps in Case 2003: after first request (11:00) to next request (17:00) was 6 hours, then 23 hours until approval.

    So Adjuster_Lisa's cases had longer gaps after the request until the next event? 

    But note that the next event after a request might not be the next request but the approval. In Case 2002, after the request, the next event is approval (20 hours later). In Case 2005, after the last request, the next event is approval (19 hours later). 

    Why the long wait? It could be that the adjuster is waiting for the customer to respond? Or the adjuster is overloaded? 

    Also, note that in Case 2003 (Adjuster_Mike) after the last request, it took 23 hours until approval. 

    So the delay after the request might be common to both adjusters? 

    However, in Case 2001 (low) and 2004 (low) there was no request and they were fast.

    Another resource: Manager_Ann approved Case 2001 (low) and 2002 (medium) and 2004 (low). 
        Case 2001: after Evaluate Claim, she approved immediately (at 10:00, 30 minutes after Evaluate Claim ended? Actually, Evaluate Claim ended at 09:30 and approval at 10:00 -> 30 minutes). 
        Case 2002: after the request (which ended at 14:00) she approved at 10:00 next day -> 20 hours.
        Case 2004: after Evaluate Claim (ended at 09:35) she approved at 10:00 -> 25 minutes.

    So Manager_Ann took 20 hours to approve in Case 2002? That is a long time. Why? 

    Similarly, Manager_Bill approved Case 2003 and 2005. 
        Case 2003: after last request (ended at 17:00 on 2024-04-01) he approved at 16:00 next day -> 23 hours.
        Case 2005: after last request (ended at 15:00 on 2024-04-03) he approved at 10:00 next day? Actually, the next day is 2024-04-04 at 10:00 -> 19 hours.

    So both managers took about 19-23 hours to approve after the last request? 

    This suggests that the approval step is causing a delay of about a day? 

    But note that in low complexity cases, there is no request and the approval is quick (within 30 minutes to 1 hour after evaluation). 

    Therefore, the root cause might be:

      - The process for medium and high complexity cases requires additional steps (requests) and then the approval step is taking a long time (about a day) after the last request.

    Why is the approval taking so long? 
        It could be that the managers are not available immediately? Or they have a backlog? 

    Also, note the resource for approval: 
        Manager_Ann: 
            Low: fast (Case 2001: 30 minutes after evaluation; Case 2004: 25 minutes after evaluation)
            Medium: slow (20 hours after request)
        Manager_Bill:
            High: slow (23 hours and 19 hours after last request)

    So when there is a request, the approval takes long? 

    But note that in the low complexity cases, there was no request. So the approval was done immediately after evaluation.

    Therefore, the issue might be that the approval step is only triggered after the request and the subsequent submission of documents? And that might take time? 

    However, in the event log, we don't see an event for receiving the documents. We only see the request and then the approval. 

    So the delay might be because the adjuster is waiting for the customer to send the documents? Then the adjuster submits the request multiple times? Actually, the event is "Request Additional Documents", meaning the insurer is sending the request. Then the customer sends the documents? But we don't have an event for receiving. 

    The next event after a request is either another request (if the documents are not sufficient) or approval. 

    In Case 2003: 
        First request at 11:00 -> then at 17:00 another request? Why? Maybe the customer didn't send the documents? Or sent incomplete? 

    Similarly, Case 2005: three requests.

    So the number of requests might be an indicator of the customer's responsiveness or the quality of the initial evaluation? 

    But note that the evaluation is done by the adjuster. If the adjuster does a thorough job, they might identify multiple issues? Or if they rush, they might miss and then have to request again? 

    However, we see that Adjuster_Lisa (Case 2002 and 2005) and Adjuster_Mike (Case 2003) both made multiple requests? 

    Now, let's look at the time between the request and the next event:

      Case 2002: 
          Request at 14:00 -> next event (approval) at 10:00 next day: 20 hours. 
          This gap might be the time for the customer to respond? 

      Case 2003:
          First request at 11:00 -> next request at 17:00: 6 hours. Why so soon? Maybe the adjuster realized they need more? Or the customer responded quickly but with incomplete info? 
          Then second request at 17:00 -> next event (approval) at 16:00 next day: 23 hours.

      Case 2005:
          First request at 11:30 -> next at 17:00: 5h30m.
          Then at 17:00 -> next at 15:00 next day: 22 hours.
          Then at 15:00 -> next at 10:00 next day: 19 hours.

    So the gaps between requests are short (5-6 hours) when consecutive requests occur on the same day, but the gap from the last request to approval is long (19-23 hours).

    This suggests that the adjuster is following up quickly if they don't get a response? But the long gap at the end might be waiting for the customer to send the documents? 

    However, note that in Case 2002, there was only one request and then a 20-hour gap until approval. 

    So the root causes:

      - High complexity claims require more requests and hence more time.
      - The approval step after the last request is taking about a day, which might be due to:
          a) The manager being busy and not approving immediately?
          b) The process requiring a manager approval only at certain times (e.g., once a day batch)?
          c) The system not allowing the manager to approve until all documents are received? But we don't have an event for document receipt.

    Also, note the region:

        Region A: 
            Case 2003 (high): 48.33 hours total -> 2 days.
        Region B: 
            Case 2002 (medium): 25.92 hours -> about 1 day.
            Case 2005 (high): 77.08 hours -> about 3.2 days.

        Why is Region B slower for high complexity? 
            Case 2005 had 3 requests and 3 days total, while Case 2003 had 2 requests and 2 days.

        But note the gaps: 
            Case 2003: 
                From last request (17:00 on day1) to approval (16:00 on day2): 23 hours -> about 1 day.
            Case 2005:
                From last request (15:00 on day3) to approval (10:00 on day4): 19 hours -> about 0.8 days.

        The total time is extended because of the multiple requests and the gaps between requests? 

        In Case 2005, the gaps between requests were 5h30m and 22h (overnight) and then 19h until approval. 

        The 22-hour gap (from 17:00 day1 to 15:00 day2) is about a day? 

        So the total time is the sum of the gaps? 

    Therefore, the root causes:

      Attribute: Complexity
        - High complexity claims require multiple requests (as the initial evaluation might not capture everything) and hence take longer.

      Attribute: Region
        - Region B seems to have a higher number of requests per case? 
            Case 2002 (medium): 1 request -> 25.92 hours
            Case 2005 (high): 3 requests -> 77.08 hours
        - But Region A (Case 2003: high) had 2 requests -> 48.33 hours.

        So Region B had one high complexity case with 3 requests and one medium with 1, while Region A had one high with 2.

        Also, note that the approval step in Region B for Case 2005 was by Manager_Bill and took 19 hours after last request? Same as in Region A (23 hours). 

        But why the difference in total time? Because of the number of requests and the gaps between them.

      Attribute: Resource
        - Adjuster_Lisa: 
            Case 2002: 1 request -> 25.92 hours
            Case 2005: 3 requests -> 77.08 hours
        - Adjuster_Mike:
            Case 2003: 2 requests -> 48.33 hours

        So the number of requests is the main driver? 

        But why does Adjuster_Lisa have more requests? 
            In Case 2005 (high complexity) she made 3 requests? 
            In Case 2002 (medium) she made 1 request? 

        And Adjuster_Mike in Case 2003 (high) made 2 requests? 

        This might be due to the adjuster's style? Or the complexity? 

        However, note that the same adjuster (Lisa) handled both a medium and a high complexity case. The high complexity case had more requests? That is expected? 

        But why 3 in one and 2 in the other? 

        Also, note that the same adjuster (Lisa) handled Case 2002 and 2005 in Region B, and Adjuster_Mike handled Case 2003 in Region A.

        So we cannot separate the effect of adjuster and region? 

    Proposed root causes:

      1. Complexity level is a major factor: high complexity claims take longer because they require more requests for additional documents and more time for approval (after the last request). 
      2. The number of requests per case is directly proportional to the total duration? Not exactly, but more requests generally lead to longer duration because of the gaps. 
      3. The approval step after the last request is consistently taking about 19-23 hours, which might be due to a batch process or manager availability? 

    Why does Region B have a case (2005) that took 77 hours? 
        - It had 3 requests and the gaps between requests were long (especially the 22-hour gap between the second and third request). 

    Why the long gaps between requests? 
        - It might be that the adjuster is waiting for the customer to respond? 
        - Or the adjuster is overloaded and cannot handle the requests immediately? 

    Looking at the resources:

        Adjuster_Lisa: 
            Case 2002: 
                Events: Evaluate Claim (09:45-? but we don't have end time, only start? Actually, we have timestamps for each event but not the duration of the activity? We assume the timestamp is the start? Or the end? 

        The log only has one timestamp per event. We assume it is the time the event was recorded (i.e., the time the activity started or completed?). 

        The problem says: "each row records an event (activity) in a given case, along with the timestamp of the event"

        Without knowing if it's start or complete, we assume it is the time the event occurred (and we use the order to compute gaps). 

        But note: the activity might take time? We don't have the duration of the activity? Only the timestamp. 

        So the gaps we computed are the waiting time between the start of one activity and the start of the next? 

        Actually, the event log might record the start time of the activity? Then the gap is the time between the start of activity A and the start of activity B? 

        But the process flow: 
            Submit Claim -> Evaluate Claim: the Evaluate Claim starts after the Submit Claim? 

        In the log, we see:

          Case 2001: 
            Submit Claim: 09:00
            Evaluate Claim: 09:30 -> gap 30 minutes.

        So the gap is the waiting time? 

        However, the activity "Evaluate Claim" might have taken 30 minutes? Then the next activity started at 10:00? 

        But we don't have the end time. 

        So we have to assume that the timestamp is the time the activity was completed? Or the time it was started? 

        The problem does not specify. 

        In process mining, event logs often record the timestamp of the event (which can be start or complete). But without more information, we use the timestamps as given and compute the time between consecutive events in the same case.

        Therefore, the gap we computed is the time between the start of one activity and the start of the next? Or the time between the completion of one and the start of the next? 

        We don't know. 

        However, note that in a typical event log, if we have the start and complete times, we would have two events per activity? But here we have one event per activity per case? 

        Actually, the table has one row per event (activity) per case. So each activity is represented by one event. 

        Therefore, we must assume that the timestamp is the time the activity was started? Or completed? 

        The problem says: "the timestamp of the event". 

        Let's look at the activities:

          Submit Claim: the customer submits -> we assume that event is the start? 
          Evaluate Claim: the adjuster starts evaluating? 
          ...

        But without more context, we can only use the timestamps to compute the time between consecutive events. 

        However, note that the activity "Request Additional Documents" might be a task that takes little time (sending a request) but then the system waits for the customer to respond? 

        So the gap between the request and the next event (which might be another request or approval) is mostly waiting time? 

        Similarly, the approval might be a quick task but the manager might be busy? 

        So we interpret the gaps as waiting times? 

    Given the above, the root causes:

      - High complexity claims require more requests (multiple) and hence more waiting time for customer responses? 
      - The approval step after the last request is taking a long time (about a day) because of manager unavailability or a batch process? 
      - Adjuster_Lisa might be overburdened? Because she handled two slow cases? But note Case 2002 (medium) and 2005 (high) were both slow? 
      - Region B: the high complexity case (2005) took the longest? 

    But note that the same adjuster (Lisa) is in Region B and handled both 2002 and 2005. 

    So the root cause might be:

      - Adjuster_Lisa is handling more complex cases? But note 2002 was medium and 2005 high? 
      - Or Adjuster_Lisa is less efficient? 

    However, we have only one case per adjuster per complexity? 

    We need more data? 

    But with the given data, we can only say:

      The cases with performance issues: 2002, 2003, 2005.

      Root causes:

        1. Complexity: medium and high complexity cases take longer than low. 
        2. Number of requests: the more requests, the longer the case? (Case 2005: 3 requests -> 77 hours, Case 2003: 2 requests -> 48 hours, Case 2002: 1 request -> 26 hours, low: 0 -> 1.5 hours)
        3. The approval step after the last request is taking about 19-23 hours, which might be due to a fixed batch approval time? Or manager availability? 
        4. Adjuster_Lisa's cases took longer? But note that her cases were medium and high? 

        However, if we compare:

          Case 2003 (high, Adjuster_Mike, Region A): 48 hours (2 requests)
          Case 2005 (high, Adjuster_Lisa, Region B): 77 hours (3 requests)

        So the same complexity but different adjusters and regions? 

        Why did Adjuster_Lisa make one more request? 

        It could be that the claim was more complex? But both are high. 

        Or Adjuster_Lisa is more thorough? 

        Or Adjuster_Lisa is less experienced and hence misses some documents initially? 

        But we don't have data on experience. 

    Suggestions:

      - To reduce the number of requests, improve the initial evaluation? 
      - To reduce the waiting time for approval, implement a more flexible approval process? (e.g., allow managers to approve anytime, or set up a more frequent batch? But 19-23 hours is almost a day, so maybe they only approve once per day? Then we can't change that? Unless we add more managers or allow decentralized approval? )
      - To reduce the waiting time between requests, improve the customer communication? (e.g., send reminders, or set expectations on response time? )
      - Investigate Adjuster_Lisa's performance? Why does she make more requests? Is she less experienced? Then provide training? 

    However, note that Adjuster_Mike also made two requests in a high complexity case? 

    So the number of requests might be inherent to the complexity? 

    But why did Adjuster_Lisa make three in one high complexity case? 

    Without more data, we can only speculate.

    Summary of findings:

      Cases with performance issues: 2002, 2003, 2005.

      Root causes:

        - Complexity: medium and high complexity cases take longer. 
        - The number of requests: each request adds waiting time (both for the customer to respond and for the next action). 
        - The approval step after the last request takes about a day (19-23 hours). 
        - Region B had a high complexity case (2005) that took the longest (77 hours) due to three requests and long gaps between them. 
        - Adjuster_Lisa handled two cases (2002 and 2005) that were slow, but note they were medium and high complexity. 

    Proposed explanations:

      Why do high complexity claims take longer?
        - They require more in-depth evaluation, which may lead to multiple requests for additional documents. 
        - The customer may take longer to respond to requests for high complexity claims (because they are more involved). 
        - The approval for high complexity claims might require a more senior manager? But in the log, both Manager_Ann and Manager_Bill approved both low and high? 

      Why does the approval step take about a day?
        - The managers might be processing approvals in batches (e.g., once per day). 

      Why did Adjuster_Lisa's cases take longer?
        - She handled a medium and a high complexity case? But note that the high complexity case had more requests? 

      Why did Region B's high complexity case take longer than Region A's?
        - The case in Region B had more requests (3 vs 2) and longer gaps? 

    Suggestions for mitigation:

      1. To reduce the number of requests per case:
          - Provide better guidelines to adjusters for high complexity cases to request all necessary documents at once? 
          - Or implement a checklist for high complexity cases to ensure all required documents are requested initially.

      2. To reduce the waiting time for approval:
          - If the approval is batched, consider increasing the frequency? Or allow real-time approval? 
          - If the delay is due to manager unavailability, consider hiring more managers or redistributing the workload? 

      3. To reduce the gaps between requests:
          - Send automated reminders to the customer if documents are not received within a certain time? 
          - Set a service level agreement (SLA) for customer response time? 

      4. For Adjuster_Lisa (if she is the only one in Region B for these cases?):
          - Check her workload? If she is overloaded, redistribute some cases to other adjusters? 
          - Provide training to improve her efficiency in handling complex cases? 

      5. For Region B:
          - Analyze why the high complexity case had three requests? Was it due to the nature of the claim? Or the adjuster? 
          - Compare with Region A: why did Region A's high complexity case only have two requests? 

    Note: The above analysis is based on a very small dataset (only 5 cases). In reality, we would need more data to draw statistically significant conclusions.

    However, for the purpose of this task, we have identified the slow cases and potential root causes.

    Let's write the answer accordingly.

### Analysis of Insurance Claims Processing Performance

#### **1. Cases with Performance Issues**
Based on the total duration from claim submission to closure, the following cases exhibit significantly longer processing times compared to others:
- **Case 2002**: 25 hours 55 minutes (Medium complexity, Region B).  
  *Breakdown*: Delay between "Request Additional Documents" (ends 14:00) and "Approve Claim" (next day 10:00) took **20 hours**.
- **Case 2003**: 48 hours 20 minutes (High complexity, Region A).  
  *Breakdown*: Multiple "Request Additional Documents" events (3 total) with long gaps (e.g., 23-hour wait after last request until approval).
- **Case 2005**: 77 hours 5 minutes (High complexity, Region B).  
  *Breakdown*: 3 "Request Additional Documents" events with extended gaps (e.g., 22-hour wait between second and third request).

**Comparison with Fast Cases**:  
- Low-complexity cases (2001, 2004) completed in **1.5–1.7 hours** with no additional document requests.  
- **Threshold**: Cases exceeding **24 hours** are flagged as underperforming (2002, 2003, 2005).

---

#### **2. Root Cause Analysis**
##### **A. Complexity Level**
- **High/Medium Complexity = Longer Durations**:  
  - All slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) had **1 "Request Additional Documents"** event.  
  - High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) required **multiple requests** (2–3), extending wait times.  
  - *Why?* Complex claims need deeper validation, leading to iterative document requests and delays in approval.  
  - *Data*:  
    - Case 2005 (High): 3 requests  77-hour duration.  
    - Case 2003 (High): 2 requests  48-hour duration.  
    - Case 2002 (Medium): 1 request  26-hour duration.  

##### **B. Geographic Region**
- **Region B Slower for High Complexity**:  
  - Region A high-complexity case (2003): 48 hours.  
  - Region B high-complexity case (2005): **77 hours** (60% longer).  
  - *Why?* Region B adjuster (Lisa) handled both medium and high-complexity cases, suggesting **workload imbalance** or **regional process inefficiencies** (e.g., slower document collection).  

##### **C. Assigned Resource**
- **Adjuster_Lisa’s Cases Take Longer**:  
  - Handled Case 2002 (Medium) and 2005 (High), both with extended delays.  
  - *Why?* Adjuster_Lisa’s cases had **longer gaps between requests** (e.g., 22-hour wait in Case 2005) and **more requests** (3 in Case 2005 vs. 2 in Case 2003 handled by Adjuster_Mike).  
  - *Possible causes*: Overload, less experience with complex claims, or inefficient follow-up.  

##### **D. Approval Step Delays**
- **Consistent 19–23-Hour Approval Delay Post-Request**:  
  - All cases with requests (2002, 2003, 2005) waited **~20 hours** after the last document request before approval.  
  - *Why?* Managers (Ann, Bill) may process approvals in **daily batches** or face **backlogs**, causing delays.

#### **3. Proposed Explanations & Mitigations**
| **Attribute**       | **Root Cause**                                                                 | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**      | High/medium complexity necessitates multiple document requests, extending cycles. | - **Standardized checklists** for complex claims to request all documents upfront.<br>- **Automated reminders** to customers for document submission. |
| **Region**          | Region B struggles with high-complexity claims (e.g., Case 2005 took 77 hours).| - **Balance workloads** between regions.<br>- **Regional training** on handling complex claims efficiently. |
| **Resource**        | Adjuster_Lisa’s cases had longer gaps and more requests.                       | - **Monitor workloads**; redistribute cases if overloaded.<br>- **Targeted training** for adjusters on complex claims. |
| **Approval Delay**  | Managers take ~20 hours to approve after final request.                        | - **Implement real-time approval workflows** (e.g., mobile approvals).<br>- **Add approval capacity** (e.g., delegate to senior adjusters). |

### **Summary**
- **Underperforming Cases**: 2002, 2003, 2005 (all medium/high complexity).  
- **Key Drivers**:  
  - **Complexity** directly correlates with document requests and delays.  
  - **Adjuster_Lisa** and **Region B** show inefficiencies in handling complex claims.  
  - **Manager approval** bottlenecks cause consistent 20-hour delays.  
- **Recommendations**:  
  1. Optimize document requests via checklists and automation.  
  2. Rebalance workloads and provide training for adjusters/managers.  
  3. Streamline approval steps to reduce batch processing delays.  

This analysis highlights that improving initial evaluation accuracy, automating follow-ups, and optimizing resource allocation can significantly reduce case durations.
