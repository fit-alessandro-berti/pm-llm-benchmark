Explanation of the transformation logic
1. Case identification  
   • Each case represents a concrete user “work object”: a file or an e-mail thread.  
   • Case IDs were built as “<TYPE>_<ObjectName>” to stay unique yet human-readable:  
     – DOC_Document1, DOC_QuarterlyReport  Word files  
     – XLSX_Budget2024             Excel workbook  
     – PDF_ReportDraft             PDF being reviewed  
     – EMAIL_AnnualMeeting         the e-mail that was opened, replied to and sent.  
   • Events are assigned to the case whose window/file/topic is referenced in the
     From/To/Window field of the raw line.  
   • SWITCH events are attributed to the target object (the item that becomes active).

2. Activity naming  
   • Low-level Windows actions were mapped to concise, analyst-friendly verbs:  
     – FOCUS / first appearance             “Open …”  
     – Subsequent FOCUS or SWITCH           “Switch to …”  
     – TYPING in Word/Excel                “Edit content / Edit spreadsheet”  
     – TYPING in the browser reply field    “Compose e-mail”  
     – SAVE                                 “Save file”  
     – CLICK actions in mail client         “Open e-mail”, “Reply e-mail”, “Send e-mail”  
     – SCROLL / HIGHLIGHT in Acrobat        “Read document”, “Highlight content”  

3. Event attributes  
   • The log delivers three mandatory attributes required by most process-mining tools:  
     – Case ID  
     – Activity Name  
     – Timestamp  
   • Additional attributes (application name, window title, etc.) can be added easily
     but were omitted here for clarity.

4. Narrative  
   The resulting event log now tells five parallel stories:  
   – Editing “Document1.docx”, including an interruption to update it again later.  
   – Handling one e-mail about the Annual Meeting from opening to sending the reply.  
   – Reviewing the draft report PDF.  
   – Updating the 2024 budget spreadsheet.  
   – Working on the quarterly report document.  

   Because activities are standardised and cases are well-scoped, the log can be imported
   directly into tools such as Disco, ProM or Celonis for discovery and conformance
   analysis.
