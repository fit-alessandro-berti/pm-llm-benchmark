Here is a DuckDB SQL query designed to meet the benchmark requirements:

```sql
SELECT
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
    -- You can include any other columns from the event_log table here.
    -- For instance, if there's a 'user_id' or 'event_data' column:
    -- el.user_id, el.event_data
FROM (
    SELECT
        el.*, -- Selects all original columns from the event_log table
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS num_events_in_case
    FROM event_log el
) AS EventsWithCount
WHERE EventsWithCount.num_events_in_case <= 6;
```

---

**Explanation for Benchmark:**

This query utilizes a window function, `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`, which is an efficient and idiomatic way to solve this common data processing problem in SQL.

1.  **Inner Query (`EventsWithCount`):**
    *   `FROM event_log el`: It starts by referencing the `event_log` table.
    *   `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`: This is the core window function. It calculates the total number of rows (events) for each distinct `case_id`. Crucially, this count is applied to *every row* associated with a particular `case_id`, effectively adding a `num_events_in_case` column to the result set of the inner query without collapsing the original rows.
    *   `el.*`: This selects all original columns from the `event_log` table, ensuring that all event details are carried forward.

2.  **Outer Query:**
    *   `FROM (...) AS EventsWithCount`: It then operates on the result of the inner query, which now contains all original event data plus the `num_events_in_case` count for each event.
    *   `WHERE EventsWithCount.num_events_in_case <= 6`: This clause filters the rows, keeping only those events that belong to cases where the total event count is six or fewer.
    *   `SELECT el.case_id, el.activity, el.timestamp ...`: Finally, it selects the required columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and any others specified) for the filtered events.

This approach avoids explicit `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses followed by a `JOIN` back to the original table, which can often be more performant in analytical databases like DuckDB as it can be executed with fewer table scans.
