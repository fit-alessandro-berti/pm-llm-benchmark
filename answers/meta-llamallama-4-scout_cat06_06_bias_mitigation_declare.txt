### Updated DECLARE Model with Bias Mitigation Constraints

To address potential biases in the loan application review process, we will introduce new constraints into the existing model. These constraints aim to ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making, especially concerning sensitive attributes like `ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`, and `ApplicantAge`.

```python
updated_declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}}
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### New Constraints for Bias Mitigation

#### Coexistence Constraints

To ensure fairness, we introduce a coexistence constraint between decision steps and sensitive attribute checks, requiring a `ManualReview` in such cases.

```python
"coexistence": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantAge": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
}
```

#### Response Constraints

To prevent biased decisions, we ensure that certain decision steps cannot occur without a `BiasMitigationCheck`.

```python
"response": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
}
```

#### Succession Constraints

Prevent sensitive attribute checks from directly preceding a biased decision.

```python
"succession": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantAge": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
}
```

#### Non-Succession Constraints

Ensure that certain sequences of activities do not occur, preventing immediate biased outcomes.

```python
"nonsuccession": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantGender": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    "CheckApplicantAge": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
}
```

### Rationale

The added constraints aim to mitigate bias by ensuring that:

1. **Sensitive Attribute Checks**: Activities like `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, and `CheckApplicantAge` always coexist with `ManualReview` to ensure that sensitive information is handled consistently.
2. **Response and Succession Constraints**: Certain decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) can only occur after a `BiasMitigationCheck` has been performed, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.
3. **Non-Succession Constraints**: Prevent direct successions that could lead to biased decisions, such as immediately rejecting an application after a sensitive attribute check without proper review.

        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},

    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}},
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation

The updated model introduces several new constraints:

- **Coexistence**: Ensures that sensitive attribute checks (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`) always occur with a `ManualReview` to verify fairness.
- **Response Constraints**: Certain activities like `BiasMitigationCheck` are required to precede decision steps that could be influenced by sensitive attributes.
- **Succession Constraints**: Prevents decisions like `Approve` or `Reject` from being made immediately after certain sensitive attribute checks without a proper mitigation step.

By introducing these constraints, the model becomes more robust against biased decision-making processes, ensuring that loan applications are reviewed fairly and consistently.
