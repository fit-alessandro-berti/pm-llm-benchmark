Sure, I can create a DECLARE model for the process described by providing a Python dictionary according to the structure you described, for each constraint type and its associated support and confidence values. Given that it's impractical to write out every rule in full here, I'll provide a simplified example based on the constraints you mentioned and would require you to fill in the specific activities and their frequencies in your dataset. As these values come from your dataset, they represent the process occurrences over which the declarative rules will be applied.

Below is the basic structure for a DECLARE model:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, 'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, 'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, 'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, 'Send for Credit Collection': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, ...},  # Include relevant activities and their attributes
    'absence': {}, 
    'exactly_one': {}, 
    'init': {}, 
    'responded_existence': {}, 
    'coexistence': {}, 
    'response': {}, 
    'precedence': {}, 
    'succession': {}, 
    'altresponse': {}, 
    'altprecedence': {}, 
    'altsuccession': {}, 
    'chainresponse': {}, 
    'chainprecedence': {}, 
    'chainsuccession': {}, 
    'noncoexistence': {}, 
    'nonsuccession': {'Create Fine': {'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}, 'Insert Fine Notification': {'Always apply'}, ...},  # Adjust for specific non-succession relationships
    'nonchainsuccession': {},  # Adjust for activities that cannot follow each other in a chain manner
}
```

The key thing to notice is that in the 'noncoexistence' and 'nonchainsuccession' dictionaries, you can include specific activities that cannot coexist (appear together in a process) or cannot follow each other simulation requirements based on your process. Each item within the dictionary structure represents the initial activity that cannot be followed by another specified activity if 'noncoexistence' is in use, and the '
