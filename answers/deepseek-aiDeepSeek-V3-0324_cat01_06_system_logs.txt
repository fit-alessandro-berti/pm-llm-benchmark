### Explanation of Transformation Logic

#### **Case Identification**
- Cases are grouped by the **document/application context** being actively worked on. The `Window` attribute (e.g., filename or email subject) is used as the **Case ID** to represent distinct units of work:
  - `Document1.docx`: A Word document being edited.
  - `Email_AnnualMeeting`: An email thread about "Annual Meeting."
  - `Report_Draft.pdf`: A PDF being reviewed.
  - `Budget_2024.xlsx`: An Excel spreadsheet being updated.
  - `Quarterly_Report.docx`: Another Word document.

#### **Activity Naming**
- Raw actions are mapped to higher-level, standardized activities:
  - `FOCUS` → `Open Document/Spreadsheet/Email` (initial focus on a window).
  - `TYPING` → `Edit Content` (for Word/Excel) or `Compose Email Reply` (for emails).
  - `SAVE` → `Save Document/Spreadsheet`.
  - `CLICK` with "Reply" → `Reply to Email`.
  - `SCROLL` → `Read Email` (in Gmail) or `Review PDF` (in Adobe).
  - `HIGHLIGHT` → `Highlight Text` (in PDFs).
  - `CLOSE` → `Close Document`.

#### **Temporal and Contextual Grouping**
- Events are grouped into cases based on **continuity of interaction** with a specific file/email. For example:
  - The user switches from `Document1.docx` to an email and later returns to `Document1.docx`. This is treated as the same case (`Document1.docx`) because the user resumes work on it.
  - The `Quarterly_Report.docx` is treated as a separate case because it is a distinct document.

#### **Additional Notes**
- The `SWITCH` events are not explicitly included in the event log but are used to infer transitions between cases.
- The `Keys` attribute is retained for context but could be omitted for privacy in real-world logs.
- The log captures a **multi-tasking workflow** where the user juggles multiple tasks (documents, emails, spreadsheets).

This event log is now suitable for process mining analysis, enabling discovery of patterns like:
- Frequency of document edits vs. saves.
- Time spent on email replies vs. document editing.
- Interruptions (e.g., switching from a document to email).
- End-to-end lifecycle of a case (e.g., open → edit → save → close).
