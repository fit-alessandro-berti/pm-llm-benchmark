**Case Analysis:**

**Case 1:**
- This case follows the normal sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
- It is in compliance with the normative process as described.

**Case 2:**
- This case also adheres to the expected flow: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order.
- No violations are found.

**Case 3:**
- Violation: The process attempts to "Ship order" before "Cancel order." According to the normative description, once an order is canceled, no further shipment should occur.
- The correct sequence would be: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.

**Case 4:**
- This case also maintains a correct sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order.
- No violations are identified.

**Case 5:**
- Violation: The process authorizes payment before checking inventory, which should occur after receiving the order according to the normative description.
- The correct sequence should be: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.

**Conclusion:**

The cases that violate the normative process are Case 3 and Case 5.

**Case 3 Violation Explanation:**

- The event log suggests shipping the order before canceling it, which contradicts the condition in the normative description. According to the description, once an order is canceled, no further shipment should occur. Thus, the sequence should be altered to reflect that after cancellation, only the "Close order" activity should follow.

**Case 5 Violation Explanation:**

- The event log shows authorization of payment before checking inventory, which the normative description states must happen after receiving the order and confirming inventory availability. Therefore, the correct sequence for this case should begin with "Receive order," followed by "Check inventory," then "Authorize payment," and so on, as per the described process flow.
