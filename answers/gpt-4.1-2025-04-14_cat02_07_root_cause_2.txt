### **Step 1: Calculate Case Durations**

First, we compute the total duration (from first to last timestamp in each case):

#### **Case 2001 (A, Low):**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:00
- End:   2024-04-01 10:30
- **Duration:** 1 hour 30 mins

#### **Case 2002 (B, Medium):**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:05
- End:   2024-04-02 11:00
- **Duration:** ~1 day, 1 hour, 55 mins

#### **Case 2003 (A, High):**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:10
- End:   2024-04-03 09:30
- **Duration:** ~2 days, 20 mins

#### **Case 2004 (B, Low):**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:20
- End:   2024-04-01 10:45
- **Duration:** 1 hour 25 mins

#### **Case 2005 (B, High):**
- Start: 2024-04-01 09:25
- End:   2024-04-04 14:30
- **Duration:** ~3 days, 5 hours, 5 mins

### **Step 2: Identify Long-Duration Cases**

The long cases are:
- **Case 2002** (1 day+; Medium complexity)
- **Case 2003** (2 days+; High complexity)
- **Case 2005** (3 days+; High complexity)

Short cases (~1.5 hours) are 2001 and 2004 (both Low complexity).

### **Step 3: Attribute Analysis (Correlation with Long Duration)**

#### **A. Complexity:**
- **Low:** Fast resolution (both A and B regions)
- **Medium:** Takes over a day (Case 2002; B region)
- **High:** Multiday durations (Cases 2003 and 2005; A and B regions respectively)

**Pattern:** Higher complexity leads to longer durations.

#### **B. Additional Document Requests:**
- **Low Complexity:** No requests for additional docs, process is linear.
- **Medium Complexity (Case 2002):** **1 request** for additional docs, adds a delay (most of the time is between "Request Additional Documents" at 2024-04-01 14:00 and "Approve Claim" at 2024-04-02 10:00).
- **High Complexity:**
    - **Case 2003:** **2 requests** (both by Adjuster_Mike), with long gaps between request and approval.
    - **Case 2005:** **3 requests** (all by Adjuster_Lisa), with very long gaps, especially between last document request and approval.

**Pattern:** More requests for additional documentation  longer total duration.

#### **C. Region:**
- Both short (~1.5 hours) and long (>1 day) cases appear in both regions.
    - **A:** Case 2001 (short, low), Case 2003 (long, high)
    - **B:** Case 2002 (long, medium), Case 2004 (short, low), Case 2005 (long, high)

So, **Region** alone is not a direct cause; rather, **Complexity** is more influential.

#### **D. Resource:**
- **Document Requests in High-Complexity cases:**
    - In region **A**, Adjuster_Mike performs all document requests.
    - In region **B**, Adjuster_Lisa does all requests.
    - Both adjusters have long cycle times for these steps.
- **Managers:** Both Ann and Bill approve claims, but time from request to approval is long, possibly due to awaiting documents.

No clear evidence that a particular resource is the direct bottleneck (both adjusters produce delays when dealing with high-complexity cases). There’s possibly a general process issue for high/medium complexity, rather than individual performance.

### **Step 4: Explanations for Performance Issues**

#### **Root Causes Identified:**

1. **High Complexity = Longer Durations**
    - High complexity claims often require multiple rounds of additional documentation, creating bottlenecks and delays.
    - Time between document requests and subsequent steps is extended (possibly due to customer or internal delays).

2. **Multiple Requests for Additional Documents**
    - The number of "Request Additional Documents" events directly correlates with longer durations.
    - Each new request indicates either missed information in the previous step or new findings, leading to iterative delays.

3. **Medium Complexity (Case 2002) Also has Delay**
    - Even a single request for documents in medium complexity results in a 1-day+ cycle, mostly due to waiting for documents and processing.

4. **Region/Resource**
    - No region or resource is solely responsible for delays. Both regions experience long and short durations depending on case complexity and document needs.
    - There might be a general process gap for handling complex cases, not a localized or person-specific problem.

### **Step 5: Suggestions for Mitigation**

**1. Process Improvement for Complex Cases:**
   - **Root Cause:** Multiple rounds of document requests cause iterative delays.
   - **Solution:** Implement initial, comprehensive checklists for required documentation based on complexity. First document request should aim to capture all needed information, reducing the need for repeated requests.

**2. Reduce Waiting for Documentation:**
   - **Root Cause:** Waiting for claimants to provide additional documents causes long idle times.
   - **Solution:**
     - Set clear deadlines for clients to return documents, with automated reminders/escalations.
     - Consider self-service document upload portals with automated completeness checks.

**3. Escalation or Parallelization:**
   - For high-complexity cases, escalate to senior adjusters or assemble ad-hoc review teams earlier to anticipate documentation needs.
   - Some steps could be parallelized (e.g., begin background checks while waiting for documents).

**4. Monitor and Analyze Iterative Requests:**
   - Track and audit cases requiring more than one document request; analyze why information needs were not anticipated earlier.

**5. Cross-region Consistency:**
   - While no region is dominant in delays, ensure all regions use the same best practices for complex cases.

### **Summary Table**

| Case   | Complexity | Doc Requests | Duration     | Root Cause(s) of Delay     |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| 2001   | Low        | 0            | 1.5h         | N/A (Fast)                |
| 2002   | Medium     | 1            | 1d 2h        | Document request (waiting)|
| 2003   | High       | 2            | 2d 0.5h      | Multiple doc requests     |
| 2004   | Low        | 0            | 1.5h         | N/A (Fast)                |
| 2005   | High       | 3            | 3d 5h        | Multiple doc requests     |

## **Final Key Points**

1. **Long durations are strongly linked to High (and some Medium) Complexity and the number of ‘Request Additional Documents’ events.**
2. **Root causes** are iterative/inefficient document requests and prolonged wait times for documents (not specific people or regions).
3. **Mitigations:** Better initial assessment, comprehensive documentation requests up front, stricter follow-up processes, and process monitoring for iterative requests.
