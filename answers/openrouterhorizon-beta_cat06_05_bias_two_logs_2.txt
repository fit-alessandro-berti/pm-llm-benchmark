The Group B log exhibits bias.

How it manifests:
- Unequal treatment: Candidates affiliated with the LocalBusinessLeadersClub receive a +5 “Association Boost” to CulturalFit, while Group A candidates (who have no association listed) receive no such adjustment. This is not tied to job-relevant performance but to membership in a specific club.
- Outcome impact: The boost shifts marginal candidates over likely decision thresholds. For example, U001 and U003 each have CulturalFit in the high 50s/low 60s that become 63–65 after the boost and both are hired. Comparable candidates without the boost (e.g., P002 with CulturalFit 60, Skill 78, Personality 75) are not hired.
- Consistency: When no association is present in Group B (U002), outcomes align with Group A patterns (not hired with CulturalFit 60), underscoring that the association boost drives favorable decisions.

Fairness and equity implications:
- Disparate treatment: The process explicitly advantages a subset based on club membership, which is unrelated to core qualifications and may correlate with socio-economic status, networking access, or local residency—creating structural barriers for those outside the network.
- Reduced meritocracy: Non-job-related factors alter final outcomes despite similar Skill and Personality scores.
- Risk of indirect discrimination: Even if the club is not a protected attribute, affiliation could be unevenly accessible across protected groups, potentially creating disparate impact.
- Transparency and accountability concerns: Hidden or informal boosts undermine candidate trust and auditability.

Better practices:
- Remove non-job-related score adjustments (like association boosts).
- If considering associations, predefine and validate job-relevant signals (e.g., verified leadership roles) and apply uniformly to all candidates.
- Use consistent, job-related scoring rubrics with documented thresholds.
- Monitor outcomes for disparate impact across protected groups and audit intermediate scores (e.g., CulturalFit) for predictive validity and bias.
