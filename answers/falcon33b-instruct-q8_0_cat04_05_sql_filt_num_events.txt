To solve this problem in DuckDB, you can use the `COUNT()` function combined with a subquery to count the number of rows per `case_id`, then filter out those cases with more than six events. Here is how you can write the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS subquery
    WHERE event_count <= 6
)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The innermost query calculates the number of events for each `case_id`:
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   ```
   This subquery groups the events by `case_id` and counts how many events are there in each group.

2. The outer query filters out `case_ids` that have more than six events:
   ```sql
   WHERE event_count <= 6
   ```
   This condition selects only those `case_ids` where the count of events is 6 or fewer.

3. Finally, the outer query retrieves all fields (`e.*`) for the `case_id`s that meet the filter criteria:
   ```sql
   SELECT e.*
   FROM event_log e
   WHERE e.case_id IN (...)
   ```
   This ensures only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.

This query will return a list of all events where the corresponding case contains 6 or fewer events, effectively filtering out any cases with more than six events.
