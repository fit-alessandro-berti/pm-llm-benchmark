Based on the provided tables and the requirements, I will create an event log that integrates the data to represent the process flow of orders. Here's the step-by-step approach and the resulting event log:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify Cases**: The `order_id` will serve as the `Case ID` for each process instance.

2. **Derive Activities**: 
   - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table.
   - "Items Picked" from the `Order Lines` table, one event per item.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table, one event per delivery.
   - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table, one event per invoice.
   - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table, one event per payment.

3. **Map Timestamps**: Use the respective timestamp fields from each table for each event.

4. **Combine Data**: Link events using the `order_id` and any relevant secondary keys (e.g., `invoice_id` for payments).

5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: Use resource IDs and additional attributes from the tables to add more context to each event.

### Assumptions:
- The `Resources Table` will be used to map IDs to names and roles for clarity.
- For events with multiple records (like multiple items picked or multiple deliveries), each will be treated as a separate event to maintain granularity.
- If an order has multiple deliveries or invoices, they will be recorded as separate events, as they represent distinct activities in the process.

### Event Log:

Below is the final event log in Markdown format:

This event log captures each event associated with the orders, ensuring chronological correctness and including relevant resources and attributes. Note that the `Resource/Actor` for payment events is listed as "N/A" because the `Payments` table does not specify a resource responsible for the payment.
