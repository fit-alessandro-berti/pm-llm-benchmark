### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

#### **Process Name:**  
Invoice Approval and Payment Process

---

#### **Roles/Participants:**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** *(Exception Handler)*  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** *(Support Role for Exceptions)*  
- **System** *(Automated triggers, notifications, and workflow management)*

---

#### **Start Event:**  
**Invoice Received**  
- *Trigger:* Invoice arrives via email or other delivery method.

---

### **Main Process Flow**

1. **Task:** Check for Valid PO Number  
   - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - *Input:* Invoice  
   - *Output:*  
     - If **No PO**, go to **Send Back to Supplier**  
     - If **Has PO**, proceed to **Log Invoice in System**

2. **Task:** Log Invoice in Accounting System

3. **Task:** Request Receipt Confirmation from Purchasing  
   - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - *System Action:* Email sent to Purchasing Officer  
   - *Output:* Awaiting confirmation

4. **Task:** Confirm Goods/Services Received  
   - *Performed by:* Purchasing Officer  
   - *Input:* Invoice and PO  
   - *Output:*  
     - If **Mismatch or Missing Info**, go to **Resolve Discrepancy**  
     - If **Confirmed**, proceed to **Match Invoice to PO**

5. **Task:** Match Invoice to PO in System  
   - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - *Input:* Invoice, PO, and receipt confirmation

6. **Task:** Request Manager Approval  
   - *System Action:* Automated email notification to Department Manager  
   - *Input:* Matched invoice and PO  
   - *Output:* Awaiting approval

7. **Task:** Review and Approve Invoice  
   - *Performed by:* Department Manager  
   - *Input:* Invoice, PO, and receipt confirmation  
   - *Output:*  
     - If **Approved**, proceed to **Schedule for Payment**  
     - If **Rejected or Held**, go to **Investigate Further**

8. **Task:** Schedule Invoice for Payment  
   - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - *Input:* Approved invoice

### **Exception Handling Paths**

#### **Exception 1: No PO Provided**  
- **Task:** Send Back to Supplier  
  - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
  - *Action:* Request PO or corrected invoice  
  - *Outcome:* Return to Step 1 upon receipt of revised invoice

#### **Exception 2: Mismatch in Invoice Details (Quantities, Pricing, etc.)**  
- **Task:** Resolve Discrepancy  
  - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
  - *Collaboration:* Purchasing Officer  
  - *Support Role:* Supplier Relationship Manager (if needed)  
  - *Output:*  
    - If **Resolved**, return to **Match Invoice to PO**  
    - If **Unresolved**, escalate to **Accounts Payable Supervisor**

#### **Exception 3: Escalation to Supervisor**  
- **Task:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor  
  - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
  - *Supervisor Actions:*  
    - Contact supplier  
    - Coordinate with departments  
    - Handle informal or non-PO invoices (e.g., create retrospective PO)  
  - *Output:*  
    - If **Resolved**, return to **Confirm Goods/Services Received**  
    - If **Rejected**, end process

#### **Exception 4: Manager Rejection or Hold**  
- **Task:** Investigate Further  
  - *Performed by:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
  - *Collaboration:* Department Manager  
  - *Output:*  
    - If **Resolved**, return to **Request Manager Approval**  
    - If **Rejected**, end process or return to supplier

### **Supporting Artifacts/Data Objects**

- **Invoice** *(Input at start, used throughout)*  
- **Purchase Order (PO)** *(Used in matching and confirmation steps)*  
- **Receipt Confirmation** *(Provided by Purchasing)*  
- **Approval Notification** *(Generated by system)*  
- **Payment Schedule Entry** *(Final output)*

---

### **End Events**

- **Invoice Scheduled for Payment** *(Normal End)*  
- **Invoice Rejected** *(Exception End)*  
- **Invoice Returned to Supplier** *(Exception End)*

---

### **Notes on Variations and Ambiguities**

- **Timing of Escalation:** While Rita is involved in exception handling, the exact point of escalation varies. In some cases, Mary escalates directly after failed matching; in others, after Purchasing flags an issue.  
- **Karen’s Role:** She is not part of the main flow but is looped in during supplier-related discrepancies.  
- **System Automation:** The system handles notifications and routing but does not make decisions. Human judgment is required at key points.  
- **Manual Re-entry:** If a revised invoice is received, it re-enters the process at the beginning.

This textual model can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram using standard symbols:  
- Circles for Start/End Events  
- Rectangles for Tasks  
- Diamonds for Gateways (decision points)  
- Lanes for Roles  
- Arrows for Sequence Flows  
- Data Object icons for artifacts  
- Swimlanes for cross-functional collaboration
