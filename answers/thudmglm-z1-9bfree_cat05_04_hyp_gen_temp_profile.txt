### Anomalies

1. **R  P**:  
   - **Suspiciously low STDEV (1 hour)** for a 25-hour average interval.  
   - **Hypothesis**: Automated approval scheduling bypasses manual review, or claims are auto-categorized without adjuster involvement. Verify with SQL:  
     ```sql
     WITH time Between_R_P AS (
       SELECT 
         claim_id, 
         timestamp AS receive_time, 
         (SELECT timestamp FROM claim_events 
          WHERE claim_id = c.claim_id AND activity = 'P' 
          ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 1) AS approve_time
       FROM claim_events c
       WHERE activity = 'R'
     )
     SELECT claim_id, 
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)), 
            CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) BETWEEN 86399 AND 90600 THEN 'Anomaly' ELSE NULL END
     FROM time Between_R_P
     WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 90000;
     ```

2. **P  N**:  
   - **Unusually long average (7 days)** with **high STDEV (2 days)**.  
   - **Hypothesis**: Manual notification holds due to missing customer validation checks. Verify with SQL:  
     ```sql
     WITH time_P/";
     WITH time_P/");
     WITH time_P/");
     WITH time=" N/";
     WITH time=" N.fromCharCode(0")};".
     WITH time=" N););
     WITH time=" N"];
     WITH time=" N]));

### Hypotheses

1. **RP inconsistency:** This might indicate an automatic approval path that intentionally skips review (e.g., a Hamiltonian path) where the claimer ) multiplicationürnberg
