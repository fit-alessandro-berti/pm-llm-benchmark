A treasure trove of Excel datasets!

This output appears to be a summary of employee declarations, where each row represents an individual's request for payment or reimbursement. Here's a breakdown of the process that likely generated this output:

1. **Initial Submission**: An employee submits their declaration by creating a table in Excel with the required columns (e.g., Date, Amount, Purpose).
2. **Rejections and Rejections**:
	* The declaration is first evaluated by an admin/manager (referred to as "ADMINISTRATION" or "PRE_APPROVER"), which either approves or rejects it.
	* Rejected declarations are then re-evaluated, and this process repeats until a decision is reached.
3. **Approval and Approval Rejections**:
	* The appraisor's approval decision is documented (e.g., "FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR").
	* In the case of an appraisor rejecting the declaration again, the re-evaluation continues, and this process may repeat multiple times.
4. **Missing Value**: A specific column ("MISSING") appears to indicate a situation where the appraisor's approval decision was not reached after multiple iterations (e.g., "Declared as Rejected by SUPERVISOR").
5. **Final Decision**:
	* After all rejections have been resolved, the final decision is recorded, indicating that the declaration has been approved or rejected.

Some common features observed in this data include:

* The use of conditional formatting to track changes over time (e.g., from "REJECTED" to "REJECTED by SUPERVISOR").
* The incorporation of metrics such as "frequency" ("14") and "performance" values (e.g., 1005677.500).
* The inclusion of specific column names, indicating that the data may have undergone various transformations or aggregations.

I hope this helps you understand the process underlying each declaration submission!
