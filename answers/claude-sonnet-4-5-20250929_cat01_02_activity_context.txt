# Process Event Log Analysis and Activity Renaming

## 1. Analysis of Recurring Activities

After examining the event log, I've identified the following activities that appear multiple times within cases with different contextual meanings:

### **Verify Documents** (appears 2x in C001, 2x in C003)
- **First occurrence**: Initial document verification attempt
- **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after receiving additional documents or making account adjustments

### **Call Customer** (appears 2x in C002, appears in C001 and C003)
- **C001**: Outbound call requesting missing documents
- **C002 (first)**: Outbound call to clarify discrepancy
- **C002 (second)**: Follow-up call to confirm changes
- **C003**: Call to request customer return to branch

The purpose varies between requesting information, clarifying issues, and confirming actions.

## 4. Justification for Naming Choices

### **"Initial Document Verification"** vs. **"Re-verify Documents After Update"**

**Contextual clues:**
- **Position in workflow**: The first verification always occurs immediately after request initiation
- **Preceding events**: Re-verification always follows either "Submit Additional" (C001) or "Adjust Account" (C003)
- **Purpose differentiation**: Initial = first-time check; Re-verify = quality control after remediation

**Naming rationale**: The prefix "Initial" clearly marks the first attempt, while "Re-verify...After Update" explicitly indicates this is a second pass triggered by new information or corrections.

---

### **"Call Customer - Request Documents"**

**Contextual clues:**
- Occurs when "Verification incomplete" (C001)
- Directly precedes customer submission of additional materials
- Indicates a **pull** action (requesting information from customer)

**Naming rationale**: The suffix clarifies the call's purpose is to solicit missing documents, distinguishing it from other call types.

---

### **"Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy"**

**Contextual clues:**
- Additional context explicitly mentions "clarify account discrepancy"
- Precedes an "Adjust Account" activity
- Represents a **diagnostic** conversation

**Naming rationale**: "Clarify Discrepancy" captures the investigative nature of this interaction, distinguishing it from confirmatory or requesting calls.

---

### **"Call Customer - Confirm Changes"**

**Contextual clues:**
- Occurs **after** "Adjust Account" activity
- Context states "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made"
- Represents a **push** action (informing customer of completed changes)

**Naming rationale**: "Confirm Changes" indicates this is a post-action verification call, creating clear distinction from the earlier clarification call in the same case.

---

### **"Call Customer - Request Return"**

**Contextual clues:**
- Unique to branch context (C003)
- Context indicates "Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return"
- Represents a **logistical coordination** action specific to in-person service

**Naming rationale**: "Request Return" captures the physical/logistical nature of this call, which is distinct from document or information-related calls.

---

## Summary

The renamed activities now clearly reflect:
1. **Sequential position** (Initial vs. Re-verify)
2. **Intentionality** (Request, Clarify, Confirm)
3. **Triggering conditions** (After Update, following discrepancies)
4. **Operational context** (Return for branch visits)

This disambiguation enables more accurate process mining, better identification of rework loops, and clearer understanding of customer interaction patterns across different channels (web portal vs. branch).
