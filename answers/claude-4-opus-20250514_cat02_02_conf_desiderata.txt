## Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance

### 1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Violations)

**Case 2: Multiple Critical Violations**
- **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
  - At 08:20, Risk Assessment was performed without a prior Credit Check
  - This violates the strict ordering rule: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment
  - The Credit Check was performed later at 09:00, which is out of sequence
  
- **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
  - The loan was rejected at 09:30
  - Documentation was finalized at 10:00
  - This violates the rule that documentation should NOT be finalized for rejected loans

**Case 1: Compliant**
- Follows the complete normative sequence correctly
- Approved loan  Documentation finalized before closure
- No violations detected

**Case 3: Compliant with Normative Rules**
- Follows the correct sequence of activities
- Approved loan  Documentation finalized before closure
- No strict rule violations (only desiderata issues)

### 2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Practices)

**Case 1: Fully Compliant**
- Credit Check completed within 30 minutes (well within 24 hours)
- Applicant informed within 2 hours of decision (well within 48 hours)
- No Follow-up Call recorded (minor desiderata gap)

**Case 2: Desiderata Compliance**
- Despite normative violations, timing requirements were met:
  - Credit Check within 20 minutes of application
  - Applicant not explicitly informed (only loan decision recorded)
- No Follow-up Call recorded

**Case 3: Multiple Desiderata Violations**
- **Late Credit Check**: Performed on 2024-01-14 (2 days after application on 2024-01-12)
  - Exceeds the recommended 24-hour window
- **Delayed Applicant Notification**: Informed on 2024-01-16 at 15:00
  - This is 51 hours after the loan decision, exceeding the 48-hour recommendation
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: No follow-up call recorded

### 3. Interpretations and Recommendations

**For Case 2 (Critical Issues):**
- The reversed order of Risk Assessment and Credit Check suggests a serious process control failure
- Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan indicates either:
  - System error or manual override
  - Misunderstanding of process requirements
  - Possible data entry error
- **Recommendation**: Implement system controls to prevent out-of-sequence activities and block documentation finalization for rejected loans

**For Case 3 (Minor Issues):**
- The 2-day delay for Credit Check might indicate:
  - Weekend/holiday interruption
  - Resource constraints
  - Backlog in the credit department
- While not critical, these delays could impact customer satisfaction
- **Recommendation**: Monitor and optimize resource allocation to meet desiderata timings

**General Observations:**
- None of the cases show explicit "Inform Applicant" activity for rejected loans (Case 2), which might be a recording issue
- Follow-up calls are consistently missing across all cases, suggesting this desideratum might need reinforcement or better tracking

### Summary
- **Case 1**: Fully compliant with normative rules, meets desiderata except for follow-up call
- **Case 2**: Severe normative violations requiring immediate attention
- **Case 3**: Normatively compliant but shows performance issues with timing desiderata
