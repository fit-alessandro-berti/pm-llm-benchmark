 Based on the process variants and their execution times provided, I will assume the domain is related to healthcare or medical treatment. The main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group are:

1. Frequency of process variants: Some process variants are more common in one group compared to the other. For example, in the 'unprotected' group, the frequency of Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge is significantly higher (1418 for ER and 1466 for FD) compared to the 'protected' group (78 for ER and 73 for FD).

2. Execution time: Some process variants have considerable differences in execution time between the two groups. For example, the process variant Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment has a performance (execution time) of 219982.000 for the 'protected' group, but for the 'unprotected' group, the execution time is shorter, with a performance of 159993.059.

3. 'Protected' group has more process variants: The 'protected' group has several unique process variants that do not appear in the 'unprotected' group, such as Register at ER/FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Discharge, Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment, and Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge. This may indicate that the 'protected' group undergoes more diverse processes during their treatment.

4. More instances of 'Treatment unsuccessful': The 'unprotected' group has more instances of process variants involving Treatment unsuccessful, as seen in Register at ER/FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge (frequency = 225 for ER and 190 for FD), indicating that the 'unprotected' group may face more treatment difficulties.
