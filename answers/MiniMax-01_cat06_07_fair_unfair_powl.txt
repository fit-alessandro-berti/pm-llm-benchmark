### **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model represents the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, including the XOR branching that introduces potential unfairness through the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**. The model demonstrates how applicants with specific community affiliations may receive preferential treatment, leading to subtle biases in the hiring process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Transitions for each step in the hiring process
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR branching after SkillAssessment
# One branch goes to CulturalFitCheck, the other to CommunityAffiliationCheck
XOR_Branch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order for the main workflow
MainWorkflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    DataLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    XOR_Branch,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XOR_Branch)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(XOR_Branch, ManagerialReview)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Define the loop exit condition (implicit in the model)
# In reality, the loop exits when data is complete

# The complete POWL model with potential unfairness
POWL_Model_Unfairness = MainWorkflow
```

**Explanation of the POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

1. **ReceiveApplication:** The process starts with the applicant submitting their resume and filling out the questionnaire.
2. **DataLoop:** A loop that ensures the completeness of the application data. If data is missing, the system requests more information (**RequestMoreInfo**). This loop continues until all necessary data is provided.
3. **SkillAssessment:** Once the data is complete, the applicant undergoes a skill-based assessment.
4. **XOR_Branch:** After the skill assessment, the process splits into two paths:
   - **CulturalFitCheck:** Standard cultural fit evaluation for all applicants.
   - **CommunityAffiliationCheck:** Applicants who are flagged for local community affiliations or specific memberships receive a subtle advantage in this evaluation.
5. **ManagerialReview:** A hiring manager reviews the results, including any adjustments from the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**.
6. **FinalDecision:** The manager makes the final decision to hire or reject the applicant.

The XOR branching after the skill assessment is the point where potential unfairness is introduced. Applicants with certain affiliations may receive preferential treatment, leading to an unfair advantage.

### **POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model removes the potential source of bias by eliminating the **CommunityAffiliationCheck** and ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Transitions for each step in the hiring process
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order for the main workflow
MainWorkflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    DataLoop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
MainWorkflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Define the loop exit condition (implicit in the model)
# In reality, the loop exits when data is complete

# The complete POWL model without unfairness
POWL_Model_No_Unfairness = MainWorkflow
```

**Explanation of the POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

1. **ReceiveApplication:** The process begins with the applicant submitting their resume and questionnaire.
2. **DataLoop:** Similar to the previous model, this loop ensures all application data is complete. If data is missing, the system requests more information (**RequestMoreInfo**) until the data is complete.
3. **SkillAssessment:** Once the data is complete, the applicant undergoes a skill-based assessment.
4. **CulturalFitCheck:** All applicants proceed to the same cultural fit evaluation, eliminating the XOR branching that introduced bias.
5. **ManagerialReview:** The hiring manager reviews the applicant's qualifications and cultural fit assessment.
6. **FinalDecision:** The manager makes the final decision to hire or reject the applicant.

By removing the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, this model ensures a fair and unbiased evaluation process for all applicants, as all candidates are assessed using the same criteria.

### **Summary of Differences**

- **POWL_Model_Unfairness:**
  - Includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment.
  - One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation.
  - The other branch includes a **CommunityAffiliationCheck** that may give preferential treatment to applicants with specific affiliations.

- **POWL_Model_No_Unfairness:**
  - Eliminates the XOR branching.
  - All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation (**CulturalFitCheck**).
  - Removes the potential source of bias by removing the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**.

These models illustrate how the presence or absence of certain steps in the hiring process can impact fairness and equality in candidate evaluation.
