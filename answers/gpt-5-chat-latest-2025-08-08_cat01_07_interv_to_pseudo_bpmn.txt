Got it  — I’ll consolidate the different interview perspectives into a structured textual BPMN-style process model so someone could later draw an accurate BPMN diagram.

## **BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**Participants / Pools & Lanes:**
- **Pool:** Organization Invoice Processing
  - **Lane 1:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
  - **Lane 2:** Purchasing Department / Officer (Dan)
  - **Lane 3:** Department Manager (Carlos or other relevant manager)
  - **Lane 4:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
  - **Lane 5:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)
  - **External Entity:** Supplier

---

### **Process Flow (Textual Representation)**

**Start Event:**  
**Invoice Received** (via email from Supplier)

---

**1. Task (AP Clerk):**  
**Check if Invoice Contains a Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number**  
- **Gateway (Exclusive):** PO number present?  
  - **No:**  **Task (AP Clerk):** Return invoice to Supplier requesting PO details  
    - Supplier sends updated invoice  return to *Start Event* (loop back to PO check)  
  - **Yes:** proceed to Step 2

---

**2. Task (AP Clerk):** **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  

**3. Task (AP Clerk):** **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation**

---

**4. Task (Purchasing Officer):** **Verify Goods/Services Received and Compare Invoice to Purchase Order**  
- Check: Quantities, prices, delivery charges match the PO.  

**Gateway (Exclusive): Discrepancy Found?**  
  - **No (everything matches):**  **Task (Purchasing Officer):** Send confirmation to Accounts Payable Clerk  
  - **Yes:**  
    - **Sub-Process: Resolve Discrepancy**  
      - **Option 1:** Purchasing contacts Supplier directly for correction (invoice revised  back to Step 1 or Step 4 depending on nature)  
      - **Option 2:** Request AP Clerk to hold invoice; may involve **Supplier Relationship Manager**  
        - **Task (Supplier Relationship Manager):** Contact Supplier, verify contract terms, request corrections or missing PO.  
      - **Option 3:** If unresolved or complex, **AP Clerk  escalate to AP Supervisor**  
        - **Task (AP Supervisor):** Coordinate between Supplier, Purchasing, and Department Heads; possibly create retrospective PO; decide on rejection.  
        - Once resolved, return to match/confirmation step (*Step 4*).  

---

**5. Task (AP Clerk/System):** **Match Invoice in System Against PO Once Purchasing Confirms**  

**Gateway: Matching Successful?**  
  - **Yes:**  proceed to Step 6  
  - **No:**  Follow discrepancy handling as above (Purchasing/Supplier/AP Supervisor as needed).  

---

**6. Event (System Trigger):** **Send Invoice to Department Manager for Approval**  

**7. Task (Department Manager):** **Review and Approve/Reject Invoice**  
- Check: Compliance with budget, quantities, pricing, special notes.  

**Gateway: Invoice Approved?**  
  - **Yes:**  proceed to Step 8  
  - **No:**  
    - **Task (Manager):** Reject back to AP Clerk for investigation (may involve Purchasing, Supplier Relationship Manager, or AP Supervisor).  
    - Resolution loop occurs; once fixed, re-enter approval step (*Step 7*).

---

**8. Task (AP Clerk):** **Schedule Approved Invoice for Payment Run**  

**End Event:** **Invoice Scheduled for Payment**

---

### **Artifacts / Data Objects**
- **Incoming Invoice (email)** – from supplier
- **Purchase Order (PO)** – from procurement system
- **Confirmation Email from Purchasing**
- **System Invoice Entry Log**
- **Corrected Invoice (if discrepancies resolved)**
- **Retrospective PO (in some exceptions)**
- **Approval Notification (from Department Manager)**

---

### **Exceptions / Variations**
- Invoices without PO  returned to Supplier or escalated to AP Supervisor for potential retrospective PO.
- Discrepancies (price, quantity, missing items)  handled by Purchasing and/or Supplier Relationship Manager; unresolved issues escalated to AP Supervisor.
- Department Manager may reject invoice for budget or content concerns  returns to resolution loop.
- Certain service invoices (contracted informally) may require special handling to create a PO after-the-fact.
- If Supplier fails to respond, invoice may be rejected and closed without payment.

---

### **High-Level Sequence Summary**
1. Receive invoice  Check PO number  If missing, return to Supplier  else log invoice.
2. Forward to Purchasing  Verify goods received & match details to PO.
3. If discrepancy  resolve via Supplier/Purchasing/AP Supervisor.
4. Once matched, system sends to Manager for approval.
5. Manager approves  AP schedules for payment  End.

If you like, I can **transform this into a full Mermaid.js BPMN-style diagram** so you get a visual flow.  
Do you want me to do that next?
