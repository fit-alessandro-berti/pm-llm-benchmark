Here are 20 relevant questions about the process with a proposed confidence score for each:

1. **What is the average time it takes for a request to go from SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
To answer this, we need to calculate the time difference for each path and then find the average.

2. **Which path has the highest performance, and what is the average time it takes to complete this path?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
We can answer this by comparing the performance and frequency of each path.

3. **What is the most common reason for a declaration to be rejected?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
We can analyze the rejection paths to identify the most common reason.

4. **How many times does the budget owner reject a declaration after it has been approved by administration?** (Confidence score: 6/10)
We can count the frequency of this specific path.

5. **What is the average time it takes for a request to be approved by multiple approvers?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
We can calculate the time difference for paths with multiple approvers.

6. **Which approver has the highest rejection rate?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
We can analyze the rejection paths to identify the approver with the highest rejection rate.

7. **How many times does a declaration need to be resubmitted before it is approved?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
We can count the frequency of paths with multiple submissions.

8. **What is the most common path for a declaration to be approved after being rejected?** (Confidence score: 7/10)
We can analyze the paths to identify the most common sequence of events.

9. **How long does it take for a request to go from SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to Payment Handled?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
We can calculate the time difference for this specific path.

10. **Which path has the highest frequency, and what is the average time it takes to complete this path?** (Confidence score: 9/10)
We can answer this by comparing the frequency and performance of each path.

11. **What is the average number of approvers required to approve a declaration?** (Confidence score: 8/10)
We can analyze the paths to identify the average number of
