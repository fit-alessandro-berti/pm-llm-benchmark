Here's a breakdown of the event log, identifying violations of normative rules and deviations from desiderata:

**1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Rules):**

*   **Case 2:** Violates multiple normative rules:
    *   **Sequence Violation (Critical):**  `Risk Assessment` was performed *before* `Credit Check`.  The normative process mandates that a `Credit Check` *must* precede `Risk Assessment`. This is the primary and most significant violation.
    *   **Conditional Sequence Violation (Critical):** `Finalize Documentation` was performed after a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`.  Finalizing documentation is only allowed if the loan is approved.  This action directly contradicts the process rules.
    * The case was closed, however, there was no 'Inform Applicant' activity, violating another normative rule.

    **Interpretation:** Case 2 represents a significant failure to adhere to the defined process.  The out-of-order activities and inappropriate documentation finalization suggest either a system error, a serious misunderstanding of the process by the person handling the case, or intentional disregard for the rules.

**2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended but Not Strict):**

*   **Case 3:** Violates several desiderata:
    *   **Timing of Credit Check:** The `Credit Check` occurred more than 24 hours after the `Application Received` (2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00). This exceeds the preferred 24-hour window.
    *   **Timing of Informing Applicant:**  The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the `Loan Decision` (2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00). This exceeds the preferred 48-hour window.
    *  **Absence of follow-up:** There is no activity of "Follow-up Call".

    **Interpretation:** Case 3, while normatively compliant, represents a less-than-ideal execution. The delays in credit checking and informing the applicant, and the lack of a follow-up, could lead to customer dissatisfaction or increased risk.  Possible justifications include:
        *   **High Volume:** A backlog of applications might explain the delay in the credit check.
        *   **Weekend/Holiday:** The delays might be due to the activities falling on a weekend or holiday, causing processing delays.
        *   **Staff Shortage:**  Limited staff availability could contribute to both delays.
        *   **Follow-up Omission:** The follow-up call might have been deemed unnecessary due to other forms of communication or a high level of confidence in the applicant's understanding.  Or, it could have simply been overlooked.

* **Case 1:** There are no violations. The case perfectly aligned with both normative and desiderata.

**3. Summary and Suggestions:**

*   **Case 2 requires immediate attention.**  The normative violations are serious and need to be investigated.  Retraining or system adjustments may be necessary to prevent future occurrences. The process instance should be analyzed to verify if other instances of the process present the same problems.
*   **Case 3 highlights areas for improvement.** While not critical, the delays and missing follow-up call should be addressed.  Process monitoring and optimization could help identify bottlenecks and ensure adherence to the desiderata, improving customer experience and potentially reducing risk.
*   **Adding more granularity to logging:** if a case is delayed because of a weekend, or a holiday, that should be reflected in the logging system, so it won't be marked as a desideratum violation.

By clearly distinguishing between normative rules and desiderata, we can effectively pinpoint serious process violations while also identifying opportunities for process optimization. This framework allows for a balanced approach to process compliance and improvement.
