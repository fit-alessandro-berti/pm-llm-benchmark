- What it is: A time-based event-flow view showing how cases move between three activities: Send Fine (top), Insert Fine Notification (middle line), and Send for Credit Collection (bottom).

- Axes:
  - X-axis: calendar time from 2000-01-25 to 2013-04-24.
  - Y-axis: the three discrete activities listed above.

- Encodings:
  - Each thin line is one case transitioning in time from one activity to the next.
  - Grey lines (upper band) connect Insert Fine Notification to Send Fine.
  - Pink/red lines (lower band) connect Insert Fine Notification to Send for Credit Collection; darker red highlights a subset.

- What it shows:
  - The grey lines are almost perfectly vertical, indicating Send Fine typically happens immediately after Insert Fine Notification (little or no delay) across the entire period.
  - The pink lines slope downwards with long lengths and form fan-shaped “triangles,” indicating much longer and more variable delays from notification to sending a case to credit collection. Many notifications from earlier dates converge to a later credit-collection date.
  - Events occur throughout the 2000–2013 timeline, with credit-collection actions appearing in bursts where many earlier notifications feed into the same later dates.

- Takeaway: Notification to fine sending is near-instant; escalation to credit collection is delayed and batched, with wide variation in waiting times.
