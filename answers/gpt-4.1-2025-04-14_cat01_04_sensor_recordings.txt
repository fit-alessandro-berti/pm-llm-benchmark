### **2. Activity Identification & Grouping**

#### **A. Initial Events (Events 1–3, 13–15)**
- All parameters at or near baseline, tool at home, no material flow or vibration.
- **Label:** **Idle / Standby**
- **Rationale:** Machine inactive—either waiting or resetting.

#### **B. Events 4–6**
- Sudden rise in temperature and vibration, high material flow, tool moves forward, energy spikes.
- **Label:** **Cutting Metal**
- **Rationale:** Cutting typically involves high vibration (blade/tool), rapid temperature rise due to friction, and significant material movement.

#### **C. Events 7–8**
- Lower but steady vibration, temp decreases/stabilizes, moderate material flow, tool further out.
- **Label:** **Assembling Parts**
- **Rationale:** Assembly often follows cutting. Less intense than cutting: lower temp/vibration, still some material and motion as parts are fixed together.

#### **D. Event 9**
- Sharp spike in temperature and vibration, zero material flow, tool static, highest energy use.
- **Label:** **Welding**
- **Rationale:** Welding causes a heat/vibration spike as the tool fuses material, but material flow stops (no ‘new’ parts fed in). High energy required.

#### **E. Event 10**
- Rapid cool-down, system quiets, tool still extended.
- **Label:** **Cooling / Transition / Inspection Preparation**
- **Rationale:** Quick cool down and minimal vibration typically happens as the process transitions or cools before the next step.

#### **F. Events 11–12**
- Mild, steady operating conditions, very low vibration/flow, tool increments slightly.
- **Label:** **Quality Inspection or Adjustment**
- **Rationale:** Low-intensity activity, small adjustments—likely checking or minor tweaking. Slight material flow could indicate sensors/tests or making corrective tweaks.

### **3. Final Process Map**

Here’s how the mappings look:

| Events       | Inferred Activity              | Rationale                                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–3, 13–15   | Idle / Standby                | Baseline readings, no activity, tool at home                                              |
| 4–6          | Cutting Metal                  | High temp/vibration, material flow, tool advancement, rapid rise in energy                |
| 7–8          | Assembling Parts               | Reduced temp/vibration, moderate movement, some material flow, further tool extension     |
| 9            | Welding                       | Extreme temp/vibration/energy, zero material flow, tool stationary                        |
| 10           | Cooling / Transition           | Fast temp drop, low vibration, tool in place, reduced energy                              |
| 11–12        | Quality Inspection/Adjustment  | Low, steady readings, minimal motion/flow, possible inspection/adjustment                 |

### **4. Deductions and Explanations**

- **Cutting Metal (Events 4–6):** Identified by a sharp increase in temperature, vibration, and material flow, as well as sustained tool movement and energy use. These readings are classic for a mechanical cutting operation.
- **Assembling Parts (Events 7–8):** After cutting, activity becomes less intense: a decrease in temp and vibration, but continued modest flow and tool movement, with energy still above idle.
- **Welding (Event 9):** Characterized by a massive, short spike in temperature and vibration, with no material flow. This correlates well with electric arc or spot welding, which is a brief, energy-intensive, stationary process.
- **Quality Inspection/Adjustment (Events 11–12):** After intense activity, the readings are low and steady, with minor tool movement. This fits manual or automated sensor checks or light re-positioning—consistent with performing or prepping for quality checks.
- **Idle / Standby (Events 1–3, 13–15):** Bookending the process, the machine is inactive with all parameters at baseline, indicating the start/end or resets between jobs.
- **Cooling (Event 10):** Not an explicit production step, but a necessary transitional/cooling phase between welding and next steps. Could also be the setup for inspection.

### **Conclusion**

Using process mining techniques, we interpret the raw sensor data to reveal the likely high-level activities in the manufacturing process. Each activity is identified by unique patterns in temperature, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy use.
