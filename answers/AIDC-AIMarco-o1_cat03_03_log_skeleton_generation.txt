Alright, I need to construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process in a large-scale distribution center. Let's break down the requirements and identify the relationships between the activities.

First, let's list out the activities involved in the process:

1. **Receive Order (RO)**
2. **Check Availability (CA)**
3. **Reserve Items (RI)**
4. **Pick Items (PI)**
5. **Quality Check (QC)**
6. **Pack Order (PO)**
7. **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**
8. **Dispatch (D)**
9. **Invoice Customer (IC)**
10. **Record Payment (RP)**

Now, let's consider the declarative constraints provided:

1. **Equivalence:** If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one.
2. **Always Before:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously.
3. **Always After:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events.
4. **Never Together:** The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after.

Given these constraints, I'll need to map out how each activity relates to the others.

**1. Equivalence:**
This constraint implies that two activities must occur the same number of times. In the order fulfillment process, it's logical that certain activities are paired or occur in direct succession. For example, **Receive Order (RO)** and **Check Availability (CA)** are closely related; receiving an order likely requires checking its availability. So, these two could be equivalent in terms of occurrence.

**2. Always Before:**
This means that if one activity occurs, the other must have occurred before it. For instance, **Check Availability (CA)** should occur before **Reserve Items (RI)** because you need to verify item availability before reserving them.

**3. Always After:**
If one activity occurs, the other must occur in one of the following events. For example, after **Reserve Items (RI)**, **Pick Items (PI)** should occur next.

**4. Never Together:**
Two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case. This is important to ensure that certain activities are mutually exclusive, such as **Invoice Customer (IC)** and **Record Payment (RP)**. They might be handled separately and shouldn't happen simultaneously.

**5. Activity Occurrences:**
Each activity has bounds on how many times it can occur. For example, **Receive Order (RO)** might occur exactly once per order, while **Pack Order (PO)** could occur multiple times if there are multiple orders.

**6. Directly-Follows Constraints:**
If one activity occurs, the next must follow immediately. For example, after **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**, **Dispatch (D)** should follow.

Now, let's map these relationships into sets of tuples for each constraint:

- **Equivalence:**
  - ('RO', 'CA') – Receive Order and Check Availability occur the same number of times.

- **Always Before:**
  - ('CA', 'RI')
  - ('RI', 'PI')
  - ('PI', 'QC')
  - ('QC', 'PO')
  - ('PO', 'GSL')
  - ('GSL', 'D')
  - ('D', 'IC')
  - ('IC', 'RP')

- **Always After:**
  - ('RO', 'CA')
  - ('CA', 'RI')
  - ('RI', 'PI')
  - ('PI', 'QC')
  - ('QC', 'PO')
  - ('PO', 'GSL')
  - ('GSL', 'D')
  - ('D', 'IC')
  - ('IC', 'RP')

- **Never Together:**
  - ('IC', 'RP') – Invoicing and recording payment are separate activities and shouldn't occur simultaneously.

- **Activity Occurrences:**
  - 'RO': {1}
  - 'CA': {1}
  - 'RI': {1}
  - 'PI': {1}
  - 'QC': {1}
  - 'PO': {1}
  - 'GSL': {1}
  - 'D': {1}
  - 'IC': {1}
  - 'RP': {1}

- **Directly-Follows Constraints:**
  - ('RO', 'CA')
  - ('CA', 'RI')
  - ('RI', 'PI')
  - ('PI', 'QC')
  - ('QC', 'PO')
  - ('PO', 'GSL')
  - ('GSL', 'D')
  - ('D', 'IC')
  - ('IC', 'RP')

Now, I'll construct the Python dictionary with these sets:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'CA')},
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),

        'RO': {1},

        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
