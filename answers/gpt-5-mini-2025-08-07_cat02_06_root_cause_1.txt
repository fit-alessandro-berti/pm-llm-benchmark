Summary (quick): Cases 102, 104 and especially 105 have much longer cycle times than the rest. The common drivers are escalations and long waits between activities (particularly long waits after "Investigate Issue" and after escalation).

1) Which cases are significantly longer
- Case 101: 08:00  10:15  total  2 h 15 m (fast)
- Case 103: 08:10  09:30  total  1 h 20 m (fast)
- Case 102: 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15  total  25 h 10 m (slow)
- Case 104: 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30  total  24 h 10 m (slow)
- Case 105: 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30  total  49 h 05 m (very slow)

2) Potential root causes (observed patterns)
- Escalations correlate with long delays:
  - Case 102: escalated to Level2 (11:30), then long time until final resolution (Resolve at 09:00 next day). 
  - Case 105: escalated at 10:00 on Mar 1 but Level2 investigation didn’t start until 14:00 on Mar 2 (28 hours later) — major handoff delay.
- Long waiting times between key activities:
  - Investigate  Resolve delay of 19 hours appears in multiple slow cases (102, 104, 105). This suggests work is often paused overnight or awaits a nextday action.
  - Assign  Investigate delays also present (e.g., Case 104: assigned 09:30, investigate 13:00  3.5 h wait).
- Possible staffing / scheduling / process causes implied by the timestamps:
  - Level2 team availability or backlog (long wait to respond to escalations).
  - Work being deferred to next business day or a scheduled change window (consistent ~overnight gaps).
  - Ineffective triage or insufficient Level1 empowerment leading to unnecessary escalations and rework.
  - Lack of SLAs/alerts on handoffs so tickets sit idle in queues.

3) How these factors increase cycle time and recommended mitigations
How they increase cycle time
- Handoffs to Level2 create queue waits; if Level2 capacity is limited or on different shifts, escalated tickets sit idle until the team can pick them up.
- Delays between Investigate and Resolve (often overnight) add ~19 hours per ticket when work is deferred to the next day — magnifies impact on cycle time.
- Long assigninvestigate waits and poor triage increase total active waiting time and risk subsequent escalation/rework, further extending resolution time.

Recommendations (practical)
- Define and enforce escalation SLAs: e.g., Level2 must acknowledge escalations within X hours and start investigation within Y hours. Monitor adherence.
- Improve Level2 coverage or create an oncall rotation for urgent escalations to avoid >24h waits.
- Empower Level1 agents: expand knowledge base, runbooks, or training so more tickets are resolved at Level1 and fewer are escalated.
- Shorten handoff latency: implement automated alerts/notifications and queue prioritization for escalated tickets so they are picked up faster.
- Shift/process changes to avoid systematic overnight stalls: enable asynchronous progress (document interim findings) or schedule changes more frequently if waiting for change windows is the cause.
- Add key metrics and monitoring: track average times for AssignInvestigate, InvestigateResolve, EscalateInvestigate, and % of tickets escalated. Use these to target improvements.
- Rootcause follow up for long cases: investigate a sample of escalated tickets (like case 105) to see if the delay was caused by missing info, external vendor dependency, or staffing — then address that specific bottleneck.

If you want, I can:
- produce a small table of the exact waiting intervals between each activity for the slow tickets (102, 104, 105), or
- draft an SLA template and a short rollout plan to reduce handoff delays. Which would be most useful?
