Trace that the model would accept but should be invalid in the domain:

- Trace: Receive_Order -> Check_Inventory -> Ship_Order -> Authorize_Payment -> Package_Items -> Close_Order

Why this is problematic from a domain perspective:

- In a proper Order-to-Cash process, there is an implied ordering constraint: payment should be authorized before shipping, and items should be packaged before they are shipped. The model, however, uses a PARALLEL node for the successful path, meaning Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, and Ship_Order are treated as concurrent tasks with no enforced ordering among them.
- In the trace above, Ship_Order occurs before Authorize_Payment (and before the typical packaging/shipping sequencing). The model would still consider this trace valid because all three parallel activities are “completed” (in some order) before exiting the parallel subtree and moving on to Close_Order.
- Domain-wise, shipping goods before payment is authorized is a violation of the business constraint that payment must be secured prior to shipment. Similarly, packaging before shipping is a typical prerequisite that is not enforced in this underfitted model.
- In short, the trace exploits the model’s lack of intra-subtree ordering guarantees (due to the PARALLEL node) and the disconnect between inventory/payment constraints and the chosen XOR branch, yielding a sequence that should not be allowed in the real process.
