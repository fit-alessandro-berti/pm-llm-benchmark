Here's a sample temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:
```
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): (7200, 1800),  # 2 hours average, 30 minutes std dev
    ('Send Purchase Order', ' Receive Goods'): (43200, 10800),  # 12 hours average, 3 hours std dev
    ('Receive Goods', ' Inspect Goods'): (3600, 900),  # 1 hour average, 15 minutes std dev
    ('Inspect Goods', 'Create Invoice'): (14400, 3600),  # 4 hours average, 1 hour std dev
    ('Create Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): (28800, 7200),  # 8 hours average, 2 hours std dev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): (86400, 21600),  # 1 day average, 6 hours std dev
    ('Send Purchase Order', 'Create Invoice'): (57600, 14400),  # 16 hours average, 4 hours std dev
    ('Inspect Goods', 'Pay Invoice'): (43200, 10800),  # 12 hours average, 3 hours std dev
    ('Receive Goods', 'Pay Invoice'): (64800, 16200)  # 18 hours average, 4.5 hours std dev
}
```
This temporal profile captures the average and standard deviation of the times between various activities in the Purchase-to-Pay process. Note that the times are represented in seconds.

Here's a brief explanation of each couple of activities:

* `Create Purchase Order` and `Send Purchase Order`: The time it takes to send the purchase order after creation.
* `Send Purchase Order` and `Receive Goods`: The time it takes to receive the goods after sending the purchase order.
* `Receive Goods` and `Inspect Goods`: The time it takes to inspect the goods after receiving them.
* `Inspect Goods` and `Create Invoice`: The time it takes to create an invoice after inspecting the goods.
* `Create Invoice` and `Pay Invoice`: The time it takes to pay the invoice after creating it.
* `Create Purchase Order` and `Receive Goods`: The total time it takes to receive the goods after creating the purchase order.
* `Send Purchase Order` and `Create Invoice`: The total time it takes to create an invoice after sending the purchase
