Below is a fully-linked, case-centric event log that can be loaded directly into any process-mining tool.  
Ordering of rows is: (1) by case ID, (2) by timestamp ascending inside each case.

Assumptions & modelling choices  
1. Case identifier = `order_id` (as requested).  
2. One “Item Picked” event per order-line keeps detailed warehouse performance visible; item meta–data taken from the Products table.  
3. For payments, the true human resource is usually unknown, so *Customer (payment method)* is used as the actor; payment method and reference are stored in the “Details” field.  
4. Resource names were resolved via the Resources table; their role is shown after an en-dash the first time each appears.  
5. Orders 1004 and 1005 currently have no delivery / invoicing / payment (1004) or still open activities (1005) beyond what is listed; if more data appears later, extra events can simply be appended.
