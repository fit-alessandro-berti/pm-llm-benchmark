This complex process description translates into a hierarchical structure using the defined process tree operators: Sequence ($\rightarrow$), XOR ($\text{X}$), Parallel ($+$), and Loop ($*$).

We will construct the tree from the innermost required structures outwards.

### Symbolic Process Tree Construction

Let $A, RG, IA, \dots, MRF$ represent the leaf process trees (activities).

#### 1. Initial Steps (Sequence)

The patient arrives, registers, gets assessed, and then undergoes triage interview followed by classification.

$$
S_{start} = \rightarrow \left( \rightarrow \left( \rightarrow \left( \rightarrow(A, RG), IA \right), \rightarrow(TI, TC) \right) \right)
$$

#### 2. Initial Diagnostic Choice (XOR)

Based on triage, an exclusive choice between Comprehensive ECG (CE) or Full Blood Panel (FBP).

$$
D_{initial} = X(CE, FBP)
$$

#### 3. The Stabilization Loop (Step 4)

This section defines the core iteration mechanism required until normal results (FBA) are achieved. We model this using the loop operator $*$ where $A_{Loop}$ is the sequence of specialist review and treatment, and $B_{Loop}$ is the re-diagnostic test which determines if the loop repeats (FCE/Abnormal) or exits (FBA/Normal).

**Treatment Choice:**
$$
T_{Treat} = X(TM, SPT)
$$
**Loop Body Pre-Test (A):** Specialist Consultation followed by treatment choice.
$$
A_{Loop} = \rightarrow(SC, T_{Treat})
$$
**Loop Exit/Repeat Condition (B):** Re-Diagnostic Test choice.
$$
B_{Loop} = X(FCE, FBA)
$$
**The Loop Structure ($L_{loop}$):**
$$
L_{loop} = * (A_{Loop}, B_{Loop})
$$

#### 4. Connecting Initialization to Stabilization

The process flows sequentially through the initial phases, the initial test, and then into the stabilization loop structure (assuming the flow continues until stabilization is achieved via FBA within $L_{loop}$).

$$
P_{pre\_loop} = \rightarrow(S_{start}, D_{initial})
$$
$$
P_{stabilized} = \rightarrow(P_{pre\_loop}, L_{loop})
$$

#### 5. Post-Stabilization Activities (Steps 5 & 6)

Advanced Imaging (AI) and Nutritional Counseling (NC) occur in true concurrency ($+$), followed by a sequence of Appointment Scheduling (FAS) and Discharge Instructions (DDI).

**Step 5 Concurrency:**
$$
P_{5\_par} = +(AI, NC)
$$
**Step 6 Sequence:**
$$
S_6 = \rightarrow(FAS, DDI)
$$
**Combined Post-Stabilization Flow:**
$$
P_{S56} = \rightarrow(P_{5\_par}, S_6)
$$
$$
P_{flow\_before\_final} = \rightarrow(P_{stabilized}, P_{S56})
$$

#### 6. Final Clearances (Step 7)

Billing (BL), Insurance Claims Processing (ICP), and Medical Records Finalization (MRF) run in true concurrency. We nest the parallel operator since only binary operators are defined.

$$
P_{final\_par} = +(BL, +(ICP, MRF))
$$

#### 7. Root Process Tree

The entire process is the sequence leading up to the final clearances, followed by the final parallel block.

$$
\text{ROOT} = \rightarrow(P_{flow\_before\_final}, P_{final\_par})
$$

### Final Process Tree Structure (Symbolic Representation)

The final process tree structure, $ROOT$, is defined as follows:

$$
\text{ROOT} = \rightarrow \left(
    \rightarrow \left(
        \rightarrow \left(
            \rightarrow \left(
                \rightarrow \left( \rightarrow \left( \rightarrow(A, RG), IA \right), \rightarrow(TI, TC) \right),
                X(CE, FBP)
            \right),
            * \left(
                \rightarrow(SC, X(TM, SPT)),
                X(FCE, FBA)
            \right)
        \right),
        \rightarrow \left(
            +(AI, NC),
            \rightarrow(FAS, DDI)
        \right)
    \right),
    +(BL, +(ICP, MRF))
\right)
$$
