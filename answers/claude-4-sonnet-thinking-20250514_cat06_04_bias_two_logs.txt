Looking at these two event logs, I can identify clear evidence of **systematic bias favoring Group B (local residents) over Group A (non-local residents)**.

## Key Bias Indicators

### 1. **Differential Access to Score Enhancements**
- **Group A (Protected)**: No score adjustments available - all cases show "ScoreAdjustment: 0"
- **Group B (Unprotected)**: Access to "+10 Community Boost" for members of local organizations like "Highland Civic Darts Club"

### 2. **Effective Approval Thresholds**
When comparing equivalent base scores:

**Group A Pattern:**
- Score 720  Approved
- Score 710  Rejected  
- Score 740  Approved

**Group B Pattern:**
- Score 720 (+10 boost) = 730  Approved
- Score 710 (no boost)  Rejected
- Score 695 (+10 boost) = 705  Approved 

### 3. **The Smoking Gun: Case U003**
The most telling evidence is Case U003, where an applicant with a base score of **695** gets approved after receiving a community boost, achieving a final score of 705. In Group A, this same final score of 705 would likely be rejected (since 710 was rejected in Case P002).

## How the Bias Manifests

1. **Systematic Advantage**: Local residents (LocalResident = TRUE) have access to score enhancement mechanisms completely unavailable to non-local residents

2. **Community Group Gatekeeping**: The community boost system creates a two-tiered system where membership in local organizations provides tangible approval advantages

3. **Effective Score Discrimination**: Non-local residents need higher base scores to achieve the same approval rates as local residents with community connections

## Conclusion

**Group B's log exhibits bias** through preferential treatment of local residents. Despite being labeled the "Unprotected Group," they actually receive systematic advantages through the community boost system, while Group A (the "Protected Group") faces higher effective barriers to approval. This creates discriminatory outcomes based on residency status and community connections rather than pure creditworthiness.
