Okay, I need to construct an accepting Petri net for this insurance claim management process. Let me first understand the scenario and the steps involved.

The process has 8 main steps: Claim Registration (CR), Document Verification (DV), Fraud Check (FC), Claim Assessment (CA), Approval (AP), Payment (P), Notification (N), Closure (CL). But there are also possible re-submissions (RDS) after DV and in-depth investigations (II) after FC, which can happen multiple times.

The key points are:
- After DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS is done (loop back to DV? Or maybe after RDS, it goes back to DV again? Wait, the scenario says "re-submission of documents step occurs before the process continues". So RDS is a step that happens after DV fails, then the process continues from DV again? Hmm, maybe after RDS, the process goes back to DV. Similarly, after FC raises doubts, II is done, then maybe FC again? Or II leads to FC being re-run?

Wait, the problem states: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)." So after FC, if there's a doubt, do II, then maybe FC again? Or does II lead to another FC? Hmm, the scenario says "before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)", so after II, the process continues to FC again? Or does II replace FC? Wait, the description says "this can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA". So the FC step may be followed by II (if doubts), then after II, maybe FC is re-run (if there's still doubt), and so on. So there's a loop between FC and II.

Similarly, after DV, if incomplete, RDS is done, then the process continues (so back to DV? Or after RDS, it goes to DV again? The problem says "re-submission of documents step occurs before the process continues". So after RDS, the process continues from DV again. So RDS is a step that, when triggered, leads back to DV.

Let me outline the process flow step by step.

The process starts with a new claim arriving. So the initial state is CR (Claim Registration) done? Wait, the first step is Claim Registration (CR). Wait, the problem says: "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place". So the initial step is CR. Wait, but in the scenario, the steps listed start from CR as step 1. So the process starts with CR.

Wait, the problem states: "The initial marking should place a token in a start place, representing a new claim arriving." So the start place is before CR? Or CR is the first step. Hmm.

Wait, in the example code given in the prompt, the initial marking has a token in a source place, and the final marking has a token in sink. The example has a simple net with source -> transition -> sink.

In this problem, the process starts with a new claim arriving. Let's model the states as places. Each step (CR, DV, etc.) is a place? Or a transition? Wait, in Petri nets, places represent states (with tokens), transitions represent events (actions). So typically, the process is modeled as: a place for each state (with tokens), and transitions for actions that move tokens.

Wait, but in the example, the Petri net has a source place (initial), a transition (execute_activity), and a sink place (final). So the initial marking has a token in source, then the transition fires, moving tokens to sink.

So in this scenario, each activity (CR, DV, etc.) is a transition. The places represent the states between transitions.

For example, the process starts with a token in a start place (representing the claim has arrived). Then, the CR transition fires, moving the token to a place (maybe representing after CR). Wait, but in the example, the transition is "execute_activity", which takes the token from source to sink.

Hmm, perhaps the standard way is that each transition corresponds to an activity, and the places are the states between activities.

Let me think. Let's model it as:

- Start place (initial) with a token.
- Then, the first transition is CR (Claim Registration), which fires when CR is done. After CR, the token moves to a place representing after CR.
- Then, DV (Document Verification) transition, etc.

But the problem says the initial marking should place a token in a start place. So the start place is like the source in the example.

Wait, in the example code: the initial marking has a token in source (the place), then the transition executes, moving tokens to sink.

So in this problem, we need a start place (with token in im), then transitions for each activity, leading to places that represent the states after the activity.

Wait, but the scenario lists the steps as activities. So perhaps each activity is a transition. The places are the states (e.g., after CR, after DV, etc.)

Let me try to outline the sequence.

The process starts with a token in a start place (let's call it 'start'). Then, the CR transition fires, which moves the token to a place 'cr_done'. Then, DV transition fires, moving to 'dv_done', etc.

But the problem states that after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS is done (re-submission), so after DV, there's a possibility to loop back to DV. Similarly, after FC, if doubts, II is done, then loop back to FC.

So the Petri net should have loops where, after some transitions, there's a possibility to go back.

Let me list all the places and transitions.

First, list all the possible places (states):

1. Start place (initial)
2. After CR (Claim Registration)
3. After DV (Document Verification)
4. After FC (Fraud Check)
5. After CA (Claim Assessment)
6. After AP (Approval)
7. After P (Payment)
8. After N (Notification)
9. After CL (Closure)
10. RDS (Re-Document Submission) — but this is a step that happens after DV fails, so maybe RDS is a transition that loops back to DV.
11. II (In-depth Investigation) — a transition that loops back to FC.

Wait, but in the scenario, RDS is a step that occurs after DV. So when DV is done (i.e., after DV transition fires), if documents are incomplete, then the RDS transition is fired, which would move the token back to DV place.

Similarly, after FC transition fires, if there's a doubt, II transition is fired, moving the token back to FC place.

So the structure would be:

- Start -> CR transition -> CR_done place
- CR_done -> DV transition -> DV_done place
- DV_done -> if RDS is needed, then RDS transition -> DV_done again (loop)
- Otherwise, DV_done -> FC transition -> FC_done place
- FC_done -> if II is needed, II transition -> FC_done again (loop)
- Otherwise, FC_done -> CA transition -> CA_done place
- ... and so on.

Wait, but in Petri nets, transitions fire when all their input places have tokens. So the loops need to have the correct structure.

Let me try to model this step by step.

First, the initial marking has a token in the start place.

The process steps:

1. CR: transition that takes the token from start to a place (e.g., cr_place)
2. DV: transition that takes token from cr_place to dv_place
3. If DV fails (documents incomplete), then RDS transition takes token from dv_place to dv_place (loop back)
4. After RDS, the process continues to DV (so after RDS, the token is back in dv_place, then DV can fire again)
5. If DV succeeds, then proceed to FC
6. FC: transition from fc_place to fc_place (if no doubt), but if doubt, II transition fires, moving back to fc_place
7. After II, FC is re-run (so loop)
8. After FC succeeds (no doubt), proceed to CA
9. CA: transition to ca_place
10. AP: transition to ap_place
11. P: transition to p_place
12. N: transition to n_place
13. CL: transition to cl_place (final)

Wait, but the final marking should be the closure. So the final place is 'cl_place', and the final marking has a token there.

In the example code, the sink place is removed, but in this case, we need to have a final place.

Let me outline the places and transitions:

Places (with names):

- start: initial place (token in im)
- cr: after CR
- dv: after DV
- fc: after FC
- ca: after CA
- ap: after AP
- p: after P
- n: after N
- cl: after CL (final)

Transitions:

- cr_trans: CR
- dv_trans: DV
- rds_trans: RDS (re-submission)
- fc_trans: FC
- ii_trans: II (in-depth investigation)
- ca_trans: CA
- ap_trans: AP
- p_trans: P
- n_trans: N
- cl_trans: CL

Wait, but the transitions for RDS and II need to loop back.

For example:

After dv_trans fires (from cr to dv), if RDS is needed, then rds_trans fires (from dv to dv), so the token loops back.

Similarly, after fc_trans fires (from fc to fc? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed". So the FC step may fail (doubts), leading to II. Then, after II, maybe FC is re-run.

So the structure would be:

- The FC transition (fc_trans) has a condition (maybe a guard) that if there's doubt, then II transition (ii_trans) fires. But Petri nets don't have guards (unless using colored nets, but the problem says to use the standard pm4py's PetriNet, which is uncolored). So we have to model the possibility of loops via the structure.

In standard Petri nets, to have a loop, you need a transition that connects back to a previous place.

For example, for the RDS loop:

- After DV (dv_place), if RDS is needed, there's a transition (rds_trans) that goes back to dv_place. So when the token is in dv_place, rds_trans can fire (if there's a token there), moving it back to dv_place.

Similarly for II: after FC (fc_place), if II is needed, ii_trans fires, moving token back to fc_place.

Wait, but in the scenario, after RDS, the process continues. So after RDS, the token is back in dv_place, and then DV can fire again (if the documents are now complete).

Similarly, after II, the token is back in fc_place, and FC can fire again.

So the structure for RDS:

dv_place has incoming arc from dv_trans.

dv_place has outgoing arc to rds_trans.

rds_trans has outgoing arc to dv_place.

Similarly, for II:

fc_place has outgoing arc to ii_trans.

ii_trans has outgoing arc to fc_place.

Wait, but in Petri nets, transitions fire when their input places have tokens. So for rds_trans to fire, the input place (dv_place) must have a token. When rds_trans fires, it moves the token to its output place (dv_place again). So each time rds_trans fires, the token stays in dv_place.

But in reality, the RDS step is a re-submission, so after RDS is done, the documents are resubmitted and verified again. So maybe after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So the RDS transition would take the token from dv_place to dv_place (loop), which is correct.

Wait, but the problem states that RDS happens after DV. So when DV is done (the token is in dv_place), if documents are incomplete, then RDS is triggered. So the RDS transition is a transition that, when fired, moves the token back to dv_place (so that DV can be fired again).

Similarly for II: after FC (token in fc_place), if doubt, II is triggered, moving token back to fc_place, so FC can be fired again.

So the Petri net structure would have:

- A place for each step (cr, dv, fc, etc.)
- For each step (except the last), there's a transition that leads to the next place, but for dv and fc, there's a loop transition that leads back to themselves.

Let's try to build this.

First, create the start place.

Initial marking (im) has a token in start.

Then:

- Transition cr_trans (Claim Registration) connects start to cr_place.

- Transition dv_trans (Document Verification) connects cr_place to dv_place.

- Transition rds_trans (Re-Document Submission) connects dv_place to dv_place (loop).

- Transition fc_trans (Fraud Check) connects dv_place to fc_place.

Wait, no. Wait, the order is: after DV is done (dv_place), if RDS is needed, then rds_trans is fired, moving back to dv_place.

But in the process flow, after DV, you check if documents are complete. If not, RDS happens (re-submission), so the process loops back to DV. So the RDS transition would be a transition that, when fired, takes the token from dv_place to dv_place.

So the sequence is:

Start -> cr_trans -> cr_place -> dv_trans -> dv_place.

At dv_place, if the documents are incomplete, fire rds_trans (loop back to dv_place).

After RDS, the token is back in dv_place. Then, dv_trans can fire again (if documents are now complete), leading to fc_place.

Similarly, after fc_place (after FC), if there's doubt, fire ii_trans (loop back to fc_place).

So the structure for fc and ii:

- fc_trans leads from dv_place to fc_place.

- ii_trans leads from fc_place to fc_place.

Wait, no. Wait, the process steps: after DV (dv_place), proceed to FC. So after dv_trans fires, token is in dv_place. Then, the next step is FC. So perhaps the transition for FC (fc_trans) connects dv_place to fc_place.

But in the scenario, the FC step is after DV. So the order is: dv_place -> fc_trans -> fc_place.

Wait, let's outline the sequence step by step.

1. Start place (token present).
2. CR transition fires: token moves to cr_place.
3. DV transition fires: token moves to dv_place.
4. If documents incomplete (RDS needed), RDS transition fires: token moves back to dv_place.
5. After RDS, DV transition fires again (if documents are now complete) to move to dv_place (but wait, no: after RDS, the documents are resubmitted, so then DV is done again. So after RDS, the token is back in dv_place (the state after DV), so then DV transition can fire again? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the RDS step is a separate place. For example, after DV, you have a place for RDS, but the problem says "re-submission of documents step occurs before the process continues". So after RDS, the process continues from DV again. So RDS is a step that loops back to DV.

In Petri net terms, the transition for RDS would have an input place (dv_place) and output place (dv_place), so that firing RDS moves the token from dv_place to dv_place.

Similarly, for II: after FC, if doubt, fire II transition, which moves token from fc_place to fc_place.

Let's proceed to code this.

First, create the Petri net.

We'll need to add the following places:

- start (initial)
- cr (after CR)
- dv (after DV)
- fc (after FC)
- ca (after CA)
- ap (after AP)
- p (after P)
- n (after N)
- cl (after CL)

Transitions:

- cr_trans (CR)
- dv_trans (DV)
- rds_trans (RDS)
- fc_trans (FC)
- ii_trans (II)
- ca_trans (CA)
- ap_trans (AP)
- p_trans (P)
- n_trans (N)
- cl_trans (CL)

Wait, but the problem says that after FC, II can happen multiple times. So the structure should allow for multiple loops.

Let's think about the arcs.

The initial marking has a token in start.

1. cr_trans: from start to cr.
2. dv_trans: from cr to dv.
3. rds_trans: from dv to dv (loop).
4. fc_trans: from dv to fc.
5. ii_trans: from fc to fc (loop).
6. ca_trans: from fc to ca.
7. ap_trans: from ca to ap.
8. p_trans: from ap to p.
9. n_trans: from p to n.
10. cl_trans: from n to cl.

But wait, after dv_trans, the token is in dv. Then, if RDS is needed, rds_trans fires, moving token back to dv. So dv is the place where RDS loops.

Similarly, after fc_trans, token is in fc. If II is needed, ii_trans fires, moving back to fc.

But the problem states that after II, the process continues to FC (so maybe after II, the next step is FC again). So the structure is correct.

Wait, but the sequence after RDS is to re-submit documents, then the process continues. So after RDS, the token is back in dv (the state after DV), so then dv_trans can fire again (if the documents are now complete), leading to fc.

Similarly for II: after II, the token is back in fc, so fc_trans can fire again.

So the transitions:

- rds_trans has input dv and output dv.
- ii_trans has input fc and output fc.

Now, the final marking should have a token in cl (closure).

Let's code this step by step.

First, create the Petri net.

We'll start by adding places:

- start = PetriNet.Place(name='start')
- cr = PetriNet.Place(name='cr')
- dv = PetriNet.Place(name='dv')
- fc = PetriNet.Place(name='fc')
- ca = PetriNet.Place(name='ca')
- ap = PetriNet.Place(name='ap')
- p = PetriNet.Place(name='p')
- n = PetriNet.Place(name='n')
- cl = PetriNet.Place(name='cl')

Then transitions:

- cr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='cr', label='CR')
- dv_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='dv', label='DV')
- rds_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='rds', label='RDS')
- fc_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='fc', label='FC')
- ii_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ii', label='II')
- ca_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ca', label='CA')
- ap_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ap', label='AP')
- p_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='p', label='P')
- n_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='n', label='N')
- cl_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='cl', label='CL')

Now, add arcs.

First, the start place is connected to cr_trans.

Add arc from start to cr_trans.

Then, cr_trans to cr.

Wait, in Petri nets, transitions have inputs (places) and outputs (places). So the arc from a place to a transition is an input, and from a transition to a place is an output.

In the example code given:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, execute_activity, net)

So this adds an arc from source (place) to execute_activity (transition).

So the structure is:

- Place -> Transition (input to transition)
- Transition -> Place (output from transition)

So for the initial step:

- Start place (start) has an arc to cr_trans (input).
- cr_trans has an arc to cr place (output).

Similarly, cr place has an arc to dv_trans (input), etc.

Let's build the arcs.

1. Start to cr_trans:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, cr_trans, net)

2. cr_trans to cr:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_trans, cr, net)

3. cr to dv_trans:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, dv_trans, net)

4. dv_trans to dv:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_trans, dv, net)

5. dv to rds_trans:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, rds_trans, net)

6. rds_trans to dv (loop):
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_trans, dv, net)

7. dv to fc_trans:
   petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, fc_trans, net)

Wait, no. Wait, after dv_trans fires, the token is in dv. Then, the process checks for RDS. So the RDS transition (rds_trans) has input dv, and output dv. So when rds_trans fires, it takes a token from dv and puts it back into dv.

Then, after RDS is done, the process continues to DV (so dv_trans can fire again).

So the next step after dv is: either fire dv_trans again (if RDS is done, or if not, move to fc_trans).

Wait, no. The problem states that RDS is a step that happens if documents are incomplete after DV. So after DV (dv_trans fires), the token is in dv. At this point, the system checks if documents are complete. If not, RDS is triggered (rds_trans fires), moving token back to dv. Then, the system re-runs DV (dv_trans fires again). So the dv_trans is the transition that moves from dv to the next place (but in this case, the next place is dv itself for the loop? Hmm, no.

Wait, this is a bit tricky. Let's think of it as:

- The dv_trans transition represents the Document Verification step. When it fires, it consumes a token from the place 'dv' (wait, no—places are the states where tokens are).

Wait, in the standard Petri net model, each transition has input places (where tokens must be present to fire) and output places (where tokens are added after firing).

So for example, the transition dv_trans has input places: cr (if the previous step is cr), and output place: dv.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

In the example code:

net = PetriNet(name="example")

source = PetriNet.Place(name="source")
sink = PetriNet.Place(name="sink")
execute_activity = PetriNet.Transition(name="execute_activity", label="Execute Activity")

net.places.add(source)
net.places.add(sink)
net.transitions.add(execute_activity)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, execute_activity, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(execute_activity, sink, net)

So the arc from source (place) to execute_activity (transition) means that the transition has source as an input place. The arc from execute_activity to sink means that the transition has sink as an output place.

So when the transition fires, it consumes a token from the input place(s) and produces tokens in the output place(s).

In this simple net, the initial marking has a token in source. When the transition fires, the token is removed from source and added to sink.

So for our scenario:

- The start place (start) is an input place for the first transition (cr_trans).

- The cr_trans transition has output place cr.

- cr place is input for dv_trans.

- dv_trans has output place dv.

- dv place is input for rds_trans and also for fc_trans.

Wait, but in the scenario, after DV (dv_trans fires), the token is in dv. Then, if RDS is needed, the rds_trans fires (which takes the token from dv and puts it back into dv). So rds_trans has input dv and output dv.

Similarly, fc_trans has input dv and output fc.

Wait, no. The order is:

1. Start -> cr_trans -> cr.

2. cr -> dv_trans -> dv.

3. At dv place: if RDS needed, fire rds_trans (dv -> dv), else fire fc_trans (dv -> fc).

So the dv place has two outgoing transitions: rds_trans and fc_trans. But in a Petri net, a place can have multiple outgoing arcs to transitions.

So for the dv place, we need to add two arcs:

- From dv to rds_trans.

- From dv to fc_trans.

Wait, but in the example code, each transition has one input and one output. But in this case, a place can have multiple transitions as inputs.

Yes, in Petri nets, a place can have multiple incoming arcs (from transitions) and multiple outgoing arcs (to transitions).

So for dv place:

- It is the output place of dv_trans.

- It has two outgoing arcs: to rds_trans and to fc_trans.

But the scenario says that after DV (dv_trans fires), you can either do RDS or proceed to FC. So the dv place is the state where you decide whether to do RDS or FC.

But how to model that? In a standard Petri net, you can't have a choice unless there's a choice transition. However, the problem states that the Petri net should have loops (e.g., between DV and RDS if documents need re-submission). So for the RDS loop, the structure is that from dv place, you can fire rds_trans, which loops back to dv.

Similarly, for FC: after dv, you can fire fc_trans to go to fc.

So the structure would be:

- dv place has incoming arc from dv_trans.

- dv place has outgoing arcs to rds_trans and fc_trans.

- rds_trans has outgoing arc to dv place.

- fc_trans has outgoing arc to fc place.

Yes.

So let's code this.

First, add all the places and transitions.

Let's start coding.

We need to import the necessary modules.

The code should look like this:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Process")

# Add places
start = PetriNet.Place(name='start')
cr = PetriNet.Place(name='cr')
dv = PetriNet.Place(name='dv')
fc = PetriNet.Place(name='fc')
ca = PetriNet.Place(name='ca')
ap = PetriNet.Place(name='ap')
p = PetriNet.Place(name='p')
n = PetriNet.Place(name='n')
cl = PetriNet.Place(name='cl')

net.places.add(start)
net.places.add(cr)
net.places.add(dv)
net.places.add(fc)
net.places.add(ca)
net.places.add(ap)
net.places.add(p)
net.places.add(n)
net.places.add(cl)

# Add transitions
cr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='cr', label='CR')
dv_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='dv', label='DV')
rds_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='rds', label='RDS')
fc_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='fc', label='FC')
ii_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ii', label='II')
ca_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ca', label='CA')
ap_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='ap', label='AP')
p_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='p', label='P')
n_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='n', label='N')
cl_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name='cl', label='CL')

net.transitions.add(cr_trans)
net.transitions.add(dv_trans)
net.transitions.add(rds_trans)
net.transitions.add(fc_trans)
net.transitions.add(ii_trans)
net.transitions.add(ca_trans)
net.transitions.add(ap_trans)
net.transitions.add(p_trans)
net.transitions.add(n_trans)
net.transitions.add(cl_trans)

# Add arcs

# Start to cr_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start, cr_trans, net)

# cr_trans to cr
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_trans, cr, net)

# cr to dv_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, dv_trans, net)

# dv_trans to dv
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv_trans, dv, net)

# dv to rds_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, rds_trans, net)

# rds_trans to dv (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_trans, dv, net)

# dv to fc_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, fc_trans, net)

# fc_trans to fc
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_trans, fc, net)

# fc to ii_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, ii_trans, net)

# ii_trans to fc (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_trans, fc, net)

# fc to ca_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, ca_trans, net)

# ca_trans to ca
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca_trans, ca, net)

# ca to ap_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, ap_trans, net)

# ap_trans to ap
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_trans, ap, net)

# ap to p_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, p_trans, net)

# p_trans to p
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_trans, p, net)

# p to n_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, n_trans, net)

# n_trans to n
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n_trans, n, net)

# n to cl_trans
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, cl_trans, net)

# cl_trans to cl
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl_trans, cl, net)

# Now, create the initial marking (im) and final marking (fm)

im = Marking()
im[start] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[cl] = 1

Wait, but the problem says to "remove the sink place" in the example code. In this case, we have a final place 'cl', so we don't need to remove it.

Wait, in the example code, they remove the sink place after creating the final marking. But in our case, the final place is cl, so we don't remove it.

So the initial marking has a token in start.

The final marking has a token in cl.

But does this Petri net model the process correctly?

Let's check the loops.

For RDS: when the token is in dv, firing rds_trans moves it back to dv. So it's a loop.

For II: when token is in fc, firing ii_trans moves it back to fc.

This should allow for multiple loops.

However, in the scenario, after RDS, the process continues (so after RDS, the token is back in dv, and then dv_trans can fire again to move to dv? Wait, no.

Wait, in the current setup, the dv place is the output of dv_trans. So after dv_trans fires, the token is in dv.

Then, from dv, you can fire rds_trans (loop back to dv) or fc_trans (to fc).

If you fire rds_trans, the token stays in dv. Then, you can fire dv_trans again? Wait, no.

Wait, the dv_trans transition is the one that consumes the token from cr to produce a token in dv.

Wait, no. Let me think.

In the current model:

- The transition dv_trans has input place cr and output place dv.

Wait, no. The arcs:

- cr to dv_trans: this is an input arc for dv_trans.

- dv_trans to dv: output arc for dv_trans.

So when dv_trans fires, it consumes a token from cr (input place) and adds a token to dv (output place).

So the sequence is:

Start -> cr_trans -> cr (token in cr).

cr -> dv_trans -> dv (token in dv).

At dv, you can fire rds_trans (which consumes a token from dv and adds to dv) or fc_trans (consumes token from dv and adds to fc).

So the rds_trans loop is correct.

Similarly, after fc_trans fires (from dv to fc), then the token is in fc.

From fc, you can fire ii_trans (loop back to fc) or ca_trans (to ca).

This seems correct.

But in the scenario, after the in-depth investigation (II), you have to re-run the fraud check (FC), so the loop is between fc and ii.

Yes.

Now, the code as written should work.

Wait, in the code above, for the transition fc_trans: it's added as an input to dv? No.

Wait, no. The arcs:

The arc from dv to fc_trans (petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, fc_trans, net)) means that fc_trans has dv as an input place.

Then, the arc from fc_trans to fc (petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_trans, fc, net)) means that fc is the output place of fc_trans.

Yes.

Similarly for rds_trans: input dv, output dv.

So this should model the loops correctly.

Let me check the transitions:

- rds_trans is a transition that, when fired, moves a token from dv to dv.

- ii_trans is a transition that moves a token from fc to fc.

So the loops are correctly modeled.

Now, the initial marking has a token in start.

The final marking has a token in cl.

This should work.

But wait, the problem states that after the process reaches the final marking (cl), the process is closed. So the final marking is cl with a token.

In the example code, the final marking is a dictionary with the sink place.

So this should be correct.

Let me check if all the places and transitions are correctly added.

Wait, in the code, after creating the Petri net, the arcs are added.

Yes.

One thing to note: in the problem statement, after the Payment (P), Notification (N), and Closure (CL) happen. So the sequence is P -> N -> CL.

In the code, after p (Payment place), the arc goes to n_trans (Notification transition), which leads to n (Notification place), then to cl_trans (Closure transition), leading to cl.

Yes.

Another check: the RDS transition is labeled 'RDS' and the II transition is labeled 'II'.

The problem says "Re-Document Submission (RDS)" and "In-depth Investigation (II)".

So the labels are correct.

Now, the code.

Wait, in the example code, they remove the sink place after creating the final marking. But in this case, we don't have a sink place to remove. The final place is cl, so we don't remove anything.

So the code as written should be correct.

Wait, but in the scenario, the process ends after CL. So the final marking has a token in cl.

Yes.

Let me write the code.

I think this should work.

Wait, but in the code, the transition names and place names are all lowercase and with underscores.

But the problem says to use the activity names (e.g., CR, DV, etc.), which in the labels are uppercase.

In the code, the transitions have labels like 'CR', 'DV', etc.

Yes.

Let me write the code step by step.

First, the imports.

Then creating the net.

Adding places.

Adding transitions.

Adding arcs.

Creating im and fm.

Wait, but in the example code, they did:

im = Marking()
im[source] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[sink] = 1

So in this case, im has start with 1, fm has cl with 1.

Yes.

So the code should be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Process")

# Add places
start = PetriNet.Place(name='start')

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, cl_trans, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl_trans, cl, net)

im = Marking()
im[start] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[cl] = 1

Wait, but the problem states that the final marking should represent a closed claim. So this code should work.

But one thing to check: in the scenario, after the approval (AP), the payment (P) happens. So the AP transition leads to the payment place.

Yes, the code has ap -> p_trans -> p.

So the sequence is correct.

Another check: the RDS loop is between dv and itself. So when the token is in dv, firing rds_trans loops back.

Yes.

The II loop is between fc and itself.

Yes.

This should correctly model the scenario.

I think this code is correct.

Let me write it as the final answer.
</think>

To construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process described, we model the sequence of activities with possible loops for re-submissions and in-depth investigations. The Petri net includes places representing states and transitions labeled with the corresponding activities. The initial marking starts with a token in the `start` place, and the final marking ends with a token in the `cl` (closure) place.

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Process")

# Add places

cl = PetriNet.Place(name='cl')

net.places.add(start)

# Define initial and final markings

### Explanation:
1. **Places**: Represent states in the process (e.g., `start`, `cr` for Claim Registration, `dv` for Document Verification, etc.).
2. **Transitions**: Represent activities (e.g., `cr_trans` for "Claim Registration", `dv_trans` for "Document Verification", `rds_trans` for "Re-Document Submission", etc.).
3. **Arcs**: Define the flow between places and transitions. 
   - **RDS Loop**: The `rds_trans` transition loops back to the `dv` place, enabling re-submission of documents.
   - **II Loop**: The `ii_trans` transition loops back to the `fc` place, enabling multiple in-depth investigations.
4. **Initial Marking (`im`)**: A token is placed in the `start` place, representing a new claim arriving.
5. **Final Marking (`fm`)**: A token is placed in the `cl` place, representing a closed claim.

This Petri net correctly models the described process with loops for re-submissions and in-depth investigations, ensuring the process reaches the final state (`cl`) only after all steps (including possible loops) are completed.
