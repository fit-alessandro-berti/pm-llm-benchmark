Let's analyze the event log for each case and identify anomalies based on standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process flows:

**Standard (Ideal) P2P Process Flow:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition   
2. Approve Purchase Requisition   
3. Issue Purchase Order   
4. Receive Goods   
5. Vendor Invoice Received   
6. Match Invoice to PO   
7. Release Payment   
8. Close Case

**Now let's review each case against this ideal.**

## **Case 1001**
**Sequence (in order):**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  
**Assessment:**  
- **No anomalous behavior.**  
- Sequence matches the standard process.

## **Case 1002**
**Sequence (in order):**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Issue Purchase Order (**before** requisition is approved)  
3. Vendor Invoice Received  
4. Release Payment (**before goods are received or invoice is matched to PO**)  
5. Approve Purchase Requisition (**after PO and payment released!**)  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**

### 1. **Purchase Order Issued Before Approval**
- **What happened:** “Issue Purchase Order” occurs at 08:40, before “Approve Purchase Requisition” at 08:00 the next day.
- **Why it’s problematic:** Issuing a PO **before approval** bypasses control mechanisms designed to ensure that purchases are authorized, leading to the risk of unapproved or fraudulent purchasing.

### 2. **Payment Released Before Receiving Goods & Matching Invoice**
- **What happened:**  
   - “Release Payment” at 07:15 on 2024-02-03, before both “Receive Goods” (2024-02-04) and “Match Invoice to PO” (2024-02-05).
   - The payment is also released before the requisition is even approved (08:00 on 2024-02-03)!
- **Why it’s problematic:**  
   - Standard controls dictate that payment should be released **only after** receiving goods/services **and** matching the invoice to the PO (the so-called "3-way match").  
   - Early payment increases the risk of paying for goods not received, fraud, duplicate payments, and makes recovery difficult.

### 3. **Approval After PO Issued and Payment Released**
- **What happened:** "Approve Purchase Requisition" occurs after the PO is issued *and* after payment is released.
- **Why it’s problematic:** This nullifies the entire purpose of approval controls; expenditures are committed (and paid) without formal authorization.

## **Case 1003**
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Release Payment (**before goods received & invoice received**)  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**

### 1. **Payment Released Before Goods Received, Invoice, or Matching**
- **What happened:**  
   - “Release Payment” (2024-02-08) occurs **before** “Vendor Invoice Received” (2024-02-09), “Receive Goods” (2024-02-10), and “Match Invoice to PO” (2024-02-11).
- **Why it’s problematic:**  
   - As in Case 1002, this violates basic internal controls. Payments should only be issued after the 3-way match (goods receipt, PO, invoice) is completed.
   - Risk of paying for undelivered or incorrect goods, or fraudulent invoices.

## **Case 1004**
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Receive Goods (**before** PO is issued)  
4. Issue Purchase Order  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case

**Anomalies:**

### 1. **Receiving Goods Before Purchase Order is Issued**
- **What happened:**  
   - “Receive Goods” (2024-02-06 09:00) **before** “Issue Purchase Order” (2024-02-06 09:15).
- **Why it’s problematic:**  
   - Goods should not be received before a purchase order has been issued to the vendor; the PO is the legal document authorizing shipment and delivery.
   - This suggests the process was not followed, raising the risk of unauthorized or erroneous deliveries.
   - May impact financial/accounting records and reduces procurement oversight.

|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1002    | PO issued before approval; payment released before goods receipt and invoice match; late approval  | Bypasses critical controls; risk of unapproved, erroneous, or fraudulent expenditure and payments         |
| 1003    | Payment released before goods received/invoice received/invoice match                             | Increases risk of payment errors and fraud; violates 3-way match principle                                |
| 1004    | Goods received before PO issued                                                                  | Indicates unauthorized/unplanned receiving; undermines process integrity                                  |

## **Overall Explanation**

**Why these anomalies are problematic:**
- **Bypassing Approval:** Undermines authorization controls; allows purchases without required oversight.
- **Premature Payment:** Increases risk of financial loss (e.g., paying for goods never received), fraud, and regulatory/compliance violations.
- **Out-of-order Receiving:** Disrupts record-keeping, accruals, and exposes company to potential disputes with vendors over deliveries.

**Best Practice:**
All steps should occur in correct order, enforcing controls: **RequisitionApprovalPOGoods/Services ReceiptInvoice Receipt3-Way MatchPaymentClose.** Deviations increase risk and can be serious audit findings.

**In summary:**  
**Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 each contain significant deviations from standard P2P process flow, indicating possible control failures or process violations.**
