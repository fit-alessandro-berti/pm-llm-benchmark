Okay, let me start by carefully reading the user's query. They want me to check which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described.

First, I need to understand the normative process thoroughly. The key points are: every case starts with "Receive order," followed by "Check inventory." After that, there are two possible paths: if inventory is sufficient, the flow should be Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. If insufficient, it should be Cancel order  Close order directly after checking inventory. Important constraints: Authorize payment only after Check inventory and before packaging, Package items only after authorization and before shipping, Ship order only after packaging and never after cancellation, Close order always last.

Now, I'll go through each case step by step, comparing the actual sequence to the expected one.

Starting with Case 1: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. That's exactly the sufficient inventory path. No issues here.

Case 2: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait, Package items happens before Authorize payment. According to the description, Authorize payment must come before packaging because payment authorization makes sense only after knowing inventory is sufficient. So here, Package items precedes Authorize payment, which violates the rule. That's a clear deviation.

Case 3: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. After Cancel order, there's a Ship order activity. The description says that once canceled, continuing with fulfillment activities like shipping is illogical. So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Also, Cancel order should lead directly to Close order without any further steps, but here Ship order happens after Cancel. That's another violation.

Case 4: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. This follows the insufficient inventory path exactly. No issues.

Case 5: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. Missing the Package items step before Ship order. The normative process says Ship order should only occur after packaging. So shipping without packaging is a violation here.

So summarizing the violations:
- Case 2: Package before Authorize payment.
- Case 3: Ship order after Cancel order.
- Case 5: Ship order without prior Package items.

I need to explain each violation referencing the textual description. For Case 2, the description states that Authorize payment should occur after Check inventory and before packaging. Case 2 reverses that order. For Case 3, after cancellation, shipping shouldn't happen. Case 5 misses the packaging step entirely before shipping.

Also, considering ambiguities mentioned in the prompt, like whether authorization can happen before certain conditions. But the description is clear about the required order, so I'll stick to that. No need to overcomplicate since the constraints are explicitly stated.

Based on the normative process description, the following cases violate the intended process flow:

### **Violating Cases:**
1. **Case 2**
2. **Case 3**
3. **Case 5**

### **Detailed Violation Explanations:**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Observed Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  **Package items**  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violation:** The activity **"Package items"** occurs **before** **"Authorize payment"**.
- **Normative Rule Violated:** The description states that "Authorize payment" must occur **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items," since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is confirmed and before items are prepared for shipment. Packaging before authorization reverses the required logical order.

#### **Case 3:**
- **Observed Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order.
- **Violations:**
  1. **"Ship order"** occurs **after** **"Cancel order"**.
  2. The presence of **"Ship order"** after cancellation is illogical, as canceled orders should not proceed to fulfillment.
- **Normative Rule Violated:** The description explicitly states that after cancellation, "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)." Shipping after cancellation directly contradicts this.

#### **Case 5:**
- **Observed Sequence:** Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order.
- **Violation:** The activity **"Package items"** is **missing** before "Ship order."
- **Normative Rule Violated:** The description states that "Package items" must occur **after** authorization and **before** shipping, since items must be prepared before shipment. Shipping without prior packaging violates this mandatory step.

---

### **Non-Violating Cases:**
- **Case 1** follows the sufficient-inventory path correctly: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.
- **Case 4** follows the insufficient-inventory path correctly: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.

---

### **Ambiguity Resolution Notes:**
- The normative description leaves no room for "Authorize payment" to occur after packaging or for "Ship order" to occur without packaging. These are explicit sequential constraints.
- The possibility of "extraordinary circumstances" (e.g., pre-authorization before final inventory confirmation) is mentioned but not supported by the description’s core principles. The text emphasizes that payment authorization should occur **only after** inventory check and **before** packaging, so **Case 2**’s reversal is unambiguous.
- Cancellation is presented as a terminal branch before any fulfillment activities; thus, **Case 3**’s post-cancellation shipping is clearly invalid.

**Conclusion:** Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process due to incorrect ordering of mandatory activities or inclusion of fulfillment steps after cancellation.
