## 1.  What a “normative” HiretoRetire (HtR) workflow looks like  

A textbook HtR process (the **canonical** version) can be expressed as a strict linear chain, possibly with a few harmless parallel branches:

```
Post_Job_Ad    Screen_Candidates    Conduct_Interviews
                                     
                  Make_Hiring_Decision    Onboard_Employee
                                                          
                                                Add_to_Payroll    Close_Case
```

* **PostScreen** – the vacancy must be advertised before anyone is examined.  
* **ScreenInterview** – only candidates that survive the screen are invited to interview.  
* **InterviewDecision** – the hiring decision is taken after the interview(s).  
* **DecisionOnboard** – the chosen candidate is then onboarded.  
* **OnboardPayroll** – onboarding (contract signing, provisioning, etc.) must be completed before the employee is entered into payroll.  
* **PayrollClose** – the case is finally closed.

In practice a few activities can be executed in parallel (e.g., backgroundcheck screening can start while interview scheduling is underway) but **the logical precedence shown above must never be violated**.

## 2.  Modelbymodel anomaly analysis  

### Model1  

| Edge in the model | Expected normative edge | What is missing / added | Severity |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| `Post  Screen`   |  (correct)            | –                      | – |
| `Screen  Decide` | **Screen  Interview  Decide** (decision must wait for interview) | Direct edge from Screen to Decision, bypassing Interview | **High** – the decision can be taken before any interview has taken place. |
| `Screen  Interview` | **Screen  Interview** (screen precedes interview) |  (correct) | – |
| `Decide  Onboard`|  (correct)            | –                      | – |
| `Onboard  Payroll`|  (correct)            | –                      | – |
| `Payroll  Close` |  (correct)            | –                      | – |
| **Missing edge** `Interview  Decide` | Must exist (or be implied by a transitive order) | Not present  Interview may be executed **after** the decision or in parallel | **High** (same as above) |
| **Missing edge** `Interview  Onboard` | Implied by `Interview  Decide  Onboard` | Not required because the chain already forces Onboard after Decision | – |

**Resulting behaviour**  

* The model permits a trace such as `Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview`.  
* It also permits `Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, …` (the “good” trace).  

**Interpretation** – The only *critical* violation is that the **hiring decision can be made before any interview**. This is a **processlogic error** (the decision is based on information that may not exist). All other activities retain their natural order, and the model does **not** allow skipping any essential step.

### Model2  

| Edge in the model | Expected normative edge | What is missing / added | Severity |
|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| `Post  Screen`   |  (correct)            | –                      | – |
| `Post  Interview`| **Screen  Interview** (screen precedes interview) | Direct edge from Post to Interview, bypassing Screen | **Medium** – interview may start before any candidate has been screened. |
| `Interview  Decide`|  (correct)          | –                      | – |
| `Decide  Loop(Onboard,skip)` | **Decide  Onboard** (single onboarding) | Loop operator with a silent transition (`skip`) allows **reexecuting** onboarding arbitrarily many times (or skipping it completely) | **MediumHigh** – the loop does not reflect any realworld repeatable activity in HtR; onboarding should be a oneoff step. |
| `Loop(Onboard)  XOR(Payroll,skip)` | **Onboard  Payroll** (must happen) | XOR with a silent transition makes **payroll optional** (the trace can go directly to `Close` after the loop) | **High** – adding an employee to payroll is a mandatory legal/administrative step; skipping it breaks the core purpose of the process. |
| `XOR(Payroll,skip)  Close` |  (correct) | – | – |
| **Missing edge** `Screen  Interview` | Should exist (or be implied) | Not present  screening and interview are parallel | **Medium** – the usual “screentheninterview” ordering is lost, but it does not create a logical impossibility (interview could be scheduled while screening runs). |

**Resulting behaviour**  

* Traces such as `Post, Interview, Decide, Loop(Onboard), XOR(Payroll), Close` are allowed – **payroll may be omitted**.  
* The loop may generate an infinite number of `Onboard` executions, or even **skip onboarding entirely** (if the silent transition is taken immediately).  
* Screening can be completely unrelated to interview ordering, allowing interview before any screening.

**Interpretation** – The model introduces **two severe logical flaws** (optional payroll and optional/looped onboarding) and a **mediumseverity ordering flaw** (interview before screening). These flaws compromise the *integrity* of the HtR process more than the single decisionbeforeinterview flaw in Model1.

## 3.  Which model is “more normative”?  

| Criterion | Model1 | Model2 |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **All mandatory activities present?** | Yes – every activity appears and must be executed (no silentskip). | No – `Payroll` can be skipped via the XORskip branch. |
| **Any activity can be skipped?** | No – the strict partial order forces every node to be visited. | Yes – both `Onboard` (via the loop’s silent branch) and `Payroll` can be omitted. |
| **Loops that do not reflect realworld repeatability?** | None (the PO is acyclic). | Loop on `Onboard` + silent transition – unrealistic. |
| **Ordering violations** | Decision may precede interview (highseverity) but **all other mandatory steps keep their natural order**. | Interview may precede screening (medium) **and** decision is correctly placed; however, the optional payroll and optional onboarding are far more damaging. |
| **Overall impact on process correctness** | Only one logical inconsistency (decision before interview). | Multiple inconsistencies (optional payroll, optional onboarding, parallel screening/interview). |

**Conclusion:**  
**Model1 is the one that aligns more closely with a normative HiretoRetire process.**  

*It respects the essential linear chain for the majority of activities* (PostScreenOnboardPayrollClose) and does **not allow any mandatory step to be omitted**. The only deviation is the possibility of making a hiring decision before the interview, which, while undesirable, does not break the *completion* of the process – the decision can still be revisited later, and the trace can still contain an interview after the decision.

*Model2, on the other hand, permits the process to finish without ever adding the new employee to payroll or even onboarding the employee, both of which are fundamental legal/operational requirements. The loop construct also adds an artificial repeatability that has no counterpart in the realworld HtR scenario. Consequently, Model2 introduces **more severe and numerous anomalies**, making it less normative than Model1.

### TL;DR  

* **Model1** – only a **decisionbeforeinterview** anomaly (high severity, but all mandatory steps are still forced).  
* **Model2** – **optional payroll**, **optional/looped onboarding**, and **interviewbeforescreening** (multiple high and mediumseverity anomalies).  

Therefore, **Model1 is the more “normative” representation of the HiretoRetire process**.
