**Solution:**

To model the order fulfillment process in a large-scale distribution center using the Log Skeleton process model, we need to define the declarative constraints that capture the relationships and frequencies of the activities involved. The activities are:

- Receive Order (RO)
- Check Availability (CA)
- Reserve Items (RI)
- Pick Items (PI)
- Quality Check (QC)
- Pack Order (PO)
- Generate Shipping Label (GSL)
- Dispatch (D)
- Invoice Customer (IC)
- Record Payment (RP)

We will define the following constraints:

1. **Equivalence:** Activities that must occur the same number of times.
2. **Always Before:** Activities that must occur before others if they happen.
3. **Always After:** Activities that must occur after others if they happen.
4. **Never Together:** Activities that cannot occur in the same case.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** The number of times each activity can occur in a case.
6. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Activities that must immediately follow one another.

### Explanation

1. **Equivalence:** Ensures that certain activities occur the same number of times, maintaining a consistent flow.
2. **Always Before/After:** Defines the sequence in which activities must occur, ensuring that prerequisite steps are completed before subsequent ones.
3. **Never Together:** Prevents certain activities from occurring in the same case, avoiding logical inconsistencies.
4. **Activity Occurrences:** Specifies that each activity must occur exactly once per case, ensuring completeness and correctness.
5. **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Ensures that activities occur in an immediate sequence without interruptions, maintaining a smooth process flow.

This Log Skeleton provides a comprehensive model of the order fulfillment process, capturing both the structural and temporal constraints necessary for correct execution.
