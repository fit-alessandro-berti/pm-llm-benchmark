This benchmark requires a multi-step process involving identifying sequential patterns, calculating time differences, filtering the case IDs based on both conditions, and finally using an anti-join or `NOT IN` clause to return the desired subset of the original table.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query to achieve the goal:

```sql
-- Step 1 & 2: Identify the Case IDs that meet BOTH criteria
WITH SequentialCases AS (
    SELECT
        t1.case_id,
        t1.timestamp AS ts_approve,
        t2.timestamp AS ts_create,
        t3.timestamp AS ts_confirm
    FROM
        event_log AS t1
    -- Join to find the 'Create Order' event directly following 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    JOIN
        event_log AS t2 ON t1.case_id = t2.case_id
                        AND t2.activity = 'Create Order'
                        AND t1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    -- Join to find the 'Confirm Order' event directly following 'Create Order'
    JOIN
        event_log AS t3 ON t2.case_id = t3.case_id
                        AND t3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE
        -- Condition 1a: t2 follows t1
        t2.timestamp > t1.timestamp
        -- Condition 1b: t3 follows t2
        AND t3.timestamp > t2.timestamp
        -- Condition 1c: Check for direct succession (no other event between t1 and t2)
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM event_log AS intermediate
            WHERE intermediate.case_id = t1.case_id
              AND intermediate.timestamp > t1.timestamp
              AND intermediate.timestamp < t2.timestamp
        )
        -- Condition 1d: Check for direct succession (no other event between t2 and t3)
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM event_log AS intermediate
            WHERE intermediate.case_id = t2.case_id
              AND intermediate.timestamp > t2.timestamp
              AND intermediate.timestamp < t3.timestamp
        )
),
FilteredCaseIDs AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        SequentialCases
    WHERE
        -- Condition 2: Time elapsed between 'Create Order' (t2) and 'Confirm Order' (t3) is > 5 days
        (ts_confirm - ts_create) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)

-- Step 3: Exclude events belonging to the identified cases
SELECT
    *
FROM
    event_log
WHERE
    case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM FilteredCaseIDs)
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```
