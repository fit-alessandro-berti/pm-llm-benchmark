Below is the **comprehensive event log** in Markdown table format. Each row is a single process event for a specific `order_id` (case), with activities derived from the provided business tables. Events are listed in *chronological* order within each case; where multiple related events occur for a case (e.g., item lines, deliveries, invoices, and payments) each gets its own event row. Relevant resource names are provided where identifiers map to the Resources table; unmapped resources (e.g., customer, system) are named as appropriate.

**Assumptions & Notes:**

- **Order Created**: The sales person is the resource (“Sales Person”) for the initial “Order Created” event.
- **Item(s) Picked**: Creates one event per line item picked, using the picker, referenced by name and role.
- **Order Dispatched** and **Order Arrived**: One event for each delivery shipment, with carrier as actor.
- **Invoice Issued**: One event per invoice created, with billing clerk as actor.
- **Payment Received**: One event per payment, with “System (Payment)” as resource for lack of person identifier. Payment method/reference included.
- **Cases with no actions**: If an order has no follow-up actions (e.g., order 1004, which has no deliveries/invoices/payments), only the initial "Order Created" and any picks are included.
- Where a resource_id is not found or role ambiguous, a placeholder is used (e.g., "System (Payment)").
- All available attributes included (customer_id/type, item, delivery note, invoice amount, payment method/reference, etc.) in “Other Attributes”.
- Order lines referencing items use product names & categories from the Products table.
- Columns with significant information are included; columns with no data for that event are left blank.

## **Summary of Assumptions:**
- Each activity is derived based on table logic (see mapping above).
- Where multiple "picks," "deliveries," "invoices," or "payments" per order exist, each is a separate event.
- Unmatched resources (e.g., payment system) are labeled accordingly.
- `Other Attributes` incorporates detailed data per event, combining info where appropriate.
- **Order 1004** has no delivery, invoice or payments; only order and item picking events are present.
