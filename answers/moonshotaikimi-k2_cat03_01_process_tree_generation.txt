I'll construct the process tree by breaking down the complex description into its subparts and nesting them appropriately.

```
-> (
    A,
    -> (
        RG,
        -> (
            IA,
            -> (
                + (TI, TC),
                X (
                    CE,
                    FBP
                ),
                * (
                    -> (
                        SC,
                        X (
                            TM,
                            SPT
                        ),
                        -> (
                            tau,
                            X (
                                FCE,
                                FBA
                            )
                        )
                    ),
                    tau
                ),
                + (AI, NC),
                -> (
                    FAS,
                    DDI
                ),
                + (
                    BL,
                    ICP,
                    MRF
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

The structure follows these principles:

1. **Sequential flow ()**: Used throughout to enforce the overall patient journey progression from arrival through final release
2. **Concurrency (+)**: Applied in three places:
   - TI and TC must both occur but can be done in any order
   - AI and NC occur after treatment completion in parallel
   - BL, ICP, and MRF run simultaneously for final clearance
3. **Exclusive choice (X)**: 
   - Between CE and FBP for initial diagnosis
   - Between TM and SPT for specialist-prescribed treatment
   - Between FCE and FBA for each re-diagnostic test iteration
4. **Loop (*)**: 
   - The entire diagnosis-treatment-retest process repeats as needed
   - Silent step (tau) allows exiting the loop when results normalize
   - The re-diagnostic test is sequenced after the treatment within the loop
