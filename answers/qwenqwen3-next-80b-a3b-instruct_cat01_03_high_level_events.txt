### **High-Level Process Steps Aggregation for Manufacturing Workflow**

Based on the provided event log sample, I have analyzed the temporal sequence, resource usage, and logical flow of activities across two cases (A1 and B2). The events exhibit consistent patterns, indicating a repeatable, standardized manufacturing process. Below is the structured aggregation of low-level events into meaningful high-level process steps, with justifications and named stages.

### **Proposed High-Level Activities**

| High-Level Activity Name       | Included Low-Level Events                                                                                                                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Material Preparation**    | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet                             | These events represent the initial setup and conditioning of the raw material before any transformation. All occur in rapid succession at the start of the process, involve preparation of the workpiece, and are completed before any assembly or welding begins. The scan ensures traceability; placement and alignment ensure correct positioning; preheating is a necessary thermal precondition for welding. |
| **2. Assembly (Welding)**      | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B                                                                                                | These events form a coherent sub-process of joining components. The tool pickup is a prerequisite to the welding actions, which are sequential and purpose-driven (corner A  corner B). Both events are performed by the same operator using the same tool type, indicating a single assembly task. |
| **3. Post-Weld Quality Check** | - Measure weld integrity                                                                                                                                  | This is a dedicated, automated quality verification step immediately following welding. It uses a dedicated sensor (Quality Sensor #1) and provides a quantitative metric (IntegrityScore). It is isolated in time from other activities and serves a singular QA purpose. |
| **4. Surface Treatment**       | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating                                                                                                               | These two events are a tightly coupled chemical/thermal finishing process. Coating application is followed immediately by drying under controlled temperature. Both are performed by dedicated units (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2), indicating a distinct phase focused on surface protection and durability. |
| **5. Final Visual Inspection** | - Visual check                                                                                                                                            | This is the final human-in-the-loop quality gate, performed after all mechanical and chemical processes are complete. It is a discrete, manual check with a binary outcome (“Passed”), signaling readiness for release. |

### **Rationale for Grouping Strategy**

1. **Temporal Proximity & Sequence:**  
   Events within each high-level step occur consecutively with minimal gaps (typically < 10–20 seconds), while transitions between steps show longer pauses (e.g., ~30–45 seconds between welding and coating). This indicates natural phase boundaries.

2. **Resource Consistency & Role Specialization:**  
   - **Operator A**: Material handling (retrieval, placement, scanning)  *Material Preparation*  
   - **Robot Arm #2**: Precision alignment  *Material Preparation* (supporting step)  
   - **Operator B**: Tool handling and welding  *Assembly (Welding)*  
   - **Quality Sensor #1**: Automated measurement  *Post-Weld Quality Check*  
   - **Coating & Heating Units**: Automated chemical/thermal process  *Surface Treatment*  
   - **Operator C**: Final human validation  *Final Visual Inspection*  
   Each resource type maps to a distinct functional domain, reinforcing logical grouping.

3. **Functional Coherence:**  
   Each high-level step performs a single, well-defined objective in the product lifecycle:  
   - *Preparation*: Get material ready  
   - *Assembly*: Join components  
   - *QA Check*: Validate critical joint  
   - *Surface Treatment*: Protect surface  
   - *Final Inspection*: Confirm overall quality  

4. **Scalability & Generalizability:**  
   The pattern is identical across both Case A1 and B2, confirming robustness. Even with minor timestamp variations (e.g., +3–5s delays), the sequence and grouping remain unchanged. This allows the model to be applied to the full log with high confidence.

5. **Exclusion of Redundant or Outlier Events:**  
   No events were found that don’t fit cleanly into these five categories. All low-level events are utilized and none are noise or exceptions in this sample.

### **Benefits of This Aggregation**

- **Simplifies Monitoring:** Operators and managers can now track progress at 5 clear stages instead of 10+ granular events.
- **Enables KPIs:** Cycle time, defect rates, and resource utilization can now be measured per high-level step.
- **Supports Automation & AI:** These steps are ideal inputs for process mining, predictive maintenance, or anomaly detection (e.g., “Post-Weld Quality Check failed” triggers rework).
- **Standardizes Training:** New operators can be trained on 5 clear phases rather than memorizing 10+ low-level tasks.

This structured aggregation transforms a granular, operational event log into a strategic, actionable manufacturing process model.
