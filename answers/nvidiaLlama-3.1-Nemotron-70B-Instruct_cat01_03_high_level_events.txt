**Proposed High-Level Activities with Justification**

### **1. Material Preparation**
- **Included Low-Level Events:**
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet
  - Scan barcode
  - Place metal sheet on table
  - Align metal sheet
  - Preheat metal sheet
- **Justification:** These events are sequentially dependent and focused on readying the raw material for the next phase of manufacturing. They all occur at the beginning of the process for each case, are performed by initial preparation resources (operators and initial machinery), and logically lead into the manipulation phase of the metal sheet.

### **2. Assembly (Welding)**
- **Included Low-Level Events:**
  - Pick up welding tool
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B
- **Justification:** These events are tightly coupled, focusing on the assembly of the product through welding. They immediately follow material preparation, are performed by a dedicated resource (Operator B with a specific tool), and represent a cohesive phase of product assembly.

### **3. Quality Assurance & Finishing**
- **Included Low-Level Events:**
  - Measure weld integrity
  - Apply protective coating
  - Dry coating
  - Visual check
- **Justification:** This group encompasses events ensuring the product's quality and applying a final protective layer. These steps are sequential, ensuring each case undergoes a standard evaluation and enhancement process before completion. Multiple resources (Quality Sensor, Coating and Heating Units, Operator C) are involved, indicating a varied but cohesive phase focused on product validation and finishing.
