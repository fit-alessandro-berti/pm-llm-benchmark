Certainly! Here's a detailed POWL model capturing the manufacturing and distribution process as observed in your event log.

# High-Level Structure and Concurrency

1. **Order Reception (OR)** first
2. **Material Sourcing (MS)** then
3. **Quality Screening (QS)**  
4. After QS, Assembly (`AS`) begins.  
   - **IQC** and **AS** are _interleaved and potentially repeated_ (Case 3 and 5).
   - Sometimes IQC is skipped (Case 4).
5. Once Assembly / IQC completes, product is **Tested (TST)**
6. If failed, product is **Re-Tested (RT)** followed by looping back to TST (Cases 1, 3, 5).
7. After successful testing, product is **Packaged (PK)**
8. **Labeling (LB)** occurs _optionally or in parallel with_ Distribution planning (DP)
9. **Distribution Planning (DP)**
10. **Dispatch (D)**

# Process Modeling Approach

- Explicitly model **loops** for:
  - The **Assembly + IQC** interleaving (rework and screening)  
  - The **Testing + Retesting** cycle

- Model **optional** labeling as an XOR with a silent transition

---

# Stepwise Construction

### 1) Atomic Transitions

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

OR = Transition("OR")
MS = Transition("MS")
QS = Transition("QS")
AS = Transition("AS")
IQC = Transition("IQC")
TST = Transition("TST")
RT = Transition("RT")
PK = Transition("PK")
LB = Transition("LB")
DP = Transition("DP")
D = Transition("D")
tau = SilentTransition()
```

---

### 2) Modeling Assembly and IQC Loop

You have observed multiple IQCs interleaved with re-assembly:

- **Loop semantics:**  
  *"Do AS, then either exit or IQC + AS again."*

```python
# Assembly-IQC loop
iqc_then_as = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[IQC, AS])
iqc_then_as.order.add_edge(IQC, AS)

assembly_iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        AS,             # initial Assembly
        iqc_then_as     # redo IQC and re-Assembly
    ]
)
```

---

### 3) Modeling the Testing-Retesting Loop

- After Assembly (loop), Testing occurs; if failed, RT triggers another round.
- Simplest canonical loop:

```python
# Testing - Retesting Loop
test_retest_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        TST,         # original Test
        OperatorPOWL(        # redo path
            operator=Operator.SEQ,   # sequentially RT then TST again
            children=[RT, TST]
        )
    ]
)
```

Since POWL primarily supports LOOP and XOR operators, and doesn’t natively define SEQ, but sequences can be emulated using partial order:

```python
rt_then_tst = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RT, TST])
rt_then_tst.order.add_edge(RT, TST)

test_retest_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        TST,
        rt_then_tst
    ]
)
```

---

### 4) Optional Labeling (LB)

- Sometimes LB happens, sometimes skipped.  
- XOR on LB and skip (silent node)

```python
labeling_optional = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, tau])
```

---

### 5) Packaging, DP, Dispatch, modeled sequentially with optional LB

Packaging must be done before DP and D.  
Labeling might be done optionally **before/around** DP.

We'll express:

- PK --> (LB or skip) and/or DP --> D

We'll create a partial order for these:

```python
packaging_concurrent = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[PK, labeling_optional, DP, D])
packaging_concurrent.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_optional)
packaging_concurrent.order.add_edge(PK, DP)
packaging_concurrent.order.add_edge(labeling_optional, DP)
packaging_concurrent.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

---

### 6) Connect All Process Segments Together

Define high-level partial order of phases:

- OR  MS  QS  assembly_iqc_loop  test_retest_loop  packaging_concurrent

Putting it all together:

```python
root_nodes = [OR, MS, QS, assembly_iqc_loop, test_retest_loop, packaging_concurrent]

global_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)
global_po.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
global_po.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
global_po.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_iqc_loop)
global_po.order.add_edge(assembly_iqc_loop, test_retest_loop)
global_po.order.add_edge(test_retest_loop, packaging_concurrent)
```

---

# **Final POWL Model**

**(Expressed in structural form)**

```python
# Transitions
OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC, TST, RT, PK, LB, DP, D, tau

# Loop: Assembly + IQC
assembly_iqc_loop = *(
    AS,
    PO=({IQC, AS}, order={IQC -> AS})
)

# Loop: Testing & Re-Testing
test_retest_loop = *(
    TST,
    PO=({RT, TST}, order={RT -> TST})
)

# Optional Labeling
labeling_optional = X(LB, tau)

# Post-production & Delivery
packaging_concurrent = PO=(
    nodes = {PK, labeling_optional, DP, D},
    order = {
        PK  labeling_optional,
        PK  DP,
        labeling_optional  DP,
        DP  D
    }
)

# Overall process
global_process = PO=(
    nodes = {OR, MS, QS, assembly_iqc_loop, test_retest_loop, packaging_concurrent},
    order = {
        OR  MS,
        MS  QS,
        QS  assembly_iqc_loop,
        assembly_iqc_loop  test_retest_loop,
        test_retest_loop  packaging_concurrent
    }
)
```

# **Descriptive Intuition:**

- Cases begin with Order Received, Sourcing, and Quality Screening sequentially.
- Then, **repeated assembly attempts with IQC checks until IQC is passed**.
- Then, **testing occurs**, possibly with **multiple retesting cycles if product fails**.
- Once passed, product is **packaged**.
- **Labeling may or may not be performed**; Distribution Planning depends on Labeling and Packaging completion.
- Finally, **Dispatch** occurs only after Distribution Planning.

---

# Notes

- This model respects the partial order where, e.g., labeling is optional, and retesting / IQC may iterate multiple times.
- The concurrency allows, for example, some overlap between optional LB/DP steps.
- Optionality and loops are expressed explicitly, making this model faithful and precise given the event log example.

# **End Result:**  

A detailed, structured POWL model capturing the complexity of your manufacturing process with interleaved assembly and QC loops, test-retest cycles, optional labeling, and sequential distribution steps, precisely based on your log.
