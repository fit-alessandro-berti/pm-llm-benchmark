In the absence of explicit activity tags we can treat every “jump” or “plateau” in the numerical signals as a potential boundary between two phases.  
Reading the log from top to bottom we obtain the following change points:

• 08:00:15 (Evt 4) – first strong change: temperature , vibration , flow starts  new phase.  
• 08:00:30 (Evt 7) – temperature , vibration , pressure   new phase.  
• 08:00:40 (Evt 9) – temperature and energy sudden peak, flow = 0  new phase.  
• 08:00:45 (Evt 10) – temperature collapses, vibration almost 0  new phase.  
• 08:00:50 (Evt 11) – small rise of flow and tool-position, otherwise calm  new phase.  
• 08:01:00 (Evt 13) – everything back to zero baseline  new phase.

Grouping events between two consecutive change points gives six clusters (plus the initial and final idle states).  
Below each cluster is assigned an activity label together with the sensor-based justification.


Activity 0 – Machine Idle / Stand-by  
• Events: 1-3 and 13-15  
• Pattern: All technical signals at, or very near, their minimum:  
  Temp  20 °C, Pressure  1 bar, Vib  0 Hz, Flow = 0, Position = 0 mm (or reset), Energy < 0.6 kWh.  
• Interpretation: The machine is powered but not processing material – a classic idle or waiting state that normally precedes and follows any production run.


Activity 1 – Cutting Metal  
• Events: 4-6  
• Key indicators  
  – Temperature rises quickly from 21  58 °C.  
  – Vibration shoots up to 30-38 Hz (rapid tool motion).  
  – Material flow is high and constant at 5 units/s (coolant and/or chip evacuation).  
  – Tool position progresses 0  10 mm (feed rate).  
  – Energy climbs to 3 kWh.  
• Why Cutting? Cutting/drilling operations typically feature the highest vibration among mechanical activities, noticeable heat generation, continuous coolant flow, and a steadily advancing tool.


Activity 2 – Assembling Parts  
• Events: 7-8  
• Key indicators  
  – Temperature drops and stabilises at 40 °C (far below the welding zone).  
  – Vibration falls to only 10 Hz (intermittent motion rather than continuous rotation).  
  – Pressure increases to 2 bar (hydraulic/pneumatic presses).  
  – Flow lowers to 2 units/s (occasional adhesive or fastener feed).  
  – Tool position reaches and holds 15 mm.  
• Why Assembling? Assembly presses or pick-and-place heads create moderate vibration but rely on force/pressure; temperature is only residual from the preceding cut.


Activity 3 – Welding  
• Event: 9  
• Key indicators  
  – Temperature spikes to 80 °C (peak in the entire log).  
  – Energy jumps to 5 kWh – the largest single reading (arc or spot-weld power draw).  
  – Vibration also peaks at 50 Hz (electrode agitation or transformers).  
  – Material flow drops to zero (no coolant or adhesive).  
  – All changes happen in just one 5-second snapshot, which is typical for a short, high-energy weld cycle.  
• Why Welding? Welding is characterised by very high instantaneous heat and power with little or no material feed.


Activity 4 – Quality Inspection  
• Event: 10  
• Key indicators  
  – Temperature falls to 30 °C (cool-down).  
  – Vibration almost disappears (1 Hz).  
  – Flow remains zero; pressure goes back to baseline.  
  – Energy is only 1 kWh, consistent with lights, camera, or laser scanners.  
• Why Inspection? Inspection stations generally consume modest energy, generate virtually no vibration, and take place right after manufacturing steps to verify the result.


Activity 5 – Packaging  
• Events: 11-12  
• Key indicators  
  – Vibration still low (5 Hz) – intermittent arm motion.  
  – Material flow restarts, but weak (1 unit/s) – cardboard, tape, or labels rather than coolant.  
  – Tool position extends to 20 mm then stays, suggesting a pick-and-place reach.  
  – Energy 1.5-1.6 kWh – motors moving boxes or sealing film.  
• Why Packaging? The machine is active again but gently; small continuous flow plus modest vibration point to handling rather than machining.
