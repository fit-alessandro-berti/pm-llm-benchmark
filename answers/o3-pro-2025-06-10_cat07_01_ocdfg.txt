The graphic is a multi-lane process-flow diagram that combines five related business object “families” into one end-to-end view.   

Object families (each represented by a unique color)  
• VendorInvoiceItem – green  
• ReturnOrderItem – red  
• PurchaseRequisitionItem – purple  
• SalesOrderItem – dark-blue  
• PurchaseOrderItem – light-blue  

General structure  
1. Across the very top, the five object types are shown in small, hatched rectangles together with their total record counts.  
2. Directly beneath each object type is an oval labelled “Start,” indicating where instances of that object family enter the process.  
3. From each Start, colored connectors (matching the object family’s color) drop down into a network of rectangular activity boxes.  
4. Each connector is annotated with an average throughput time in milliseconds (e.g., “400 ms,” “650 ms”).  
5. The rectangular boxes are activities; their captions contain two lines: the activity name and “Overall: n .x M,” which is the cumulative number of executions across all families.  
6. When an activity is performed by more than one object family, multiple colored dots appear in the top-left corner of the box, making the convergence of flows easy to see.  
7. Ovals labelled “End” mark the termination points for each branch.

Illustrative path examples  
• PurchaseRequisitionItem (purple) starts, moves to “Create Requisition,” then converges with three other flows in “Approve Requisition,” continues to “Check Stock” and “Send Order,” and eventually reaches its End.  
• SalesOrderItem (dark-blue) starts, triggers “Create Order,” then “Pack Goods,” “Ship Goods,” “Confirm Delivery,” and “Close Order,” ending on its own dedicated End.  
• ReturnOrderItem (red) begins, jumps to “Process Return,” then may move to “Approve Payment,” “Create Invoice,” and finally an End node shared with other families.

Volume and timing highlights  
• Highest-volume single activity: “Create Order” with 8.5 M executions.  
• Longest average hop visible: 800 ms from “Process Return” to “Approve Payment.”  
• Central convergence: “Approve Requisition,” which handles 5.7 M total cases and is fed by four of the five object families.

Interpretation  
The visualization essentially overlays a Purchase-to-Pay and Order-to-Cash life cycle (including returns and invoicing) into one picture, allowing analysts to see:  
• Where different order types share steps (e.g., common approval or payment checks).  
• Relative workload of each activity (through the “Overall” counters).  
• Typical waiting time between steps (the millisecond labels).  
• Divergence points where each object type resumes its own dedicated sub-process.

Such a map is usually produced by a process-mining tool and can help identify bottlenecks, redundant approvals, or high-latency transitions that are prime candidates for automation or re-engineering.
