**Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

---

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To enable effective process mining, heterogeneous data from GPS trackers, handheld scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs must be harmonized into a unified event log. Key steps include:

- **Case Definition**: Define a *case* as a **Vehicle-Day** (e.g., `V12-20241205`), capturing all activities of a vehicle on a given day. Alternatively, for package-level analysis, a *case* could be a **Package ID**, but Vehicle-Day is more suitable for operational process analysis.
- **Event Alignment**: Align timestamps across systems (e.g., scanner “Arrive Customer” should precede “Delivery Success”). Use GPS location data to validate scanner events (e.g., confirm vehicle was near customer coordinates at scan time).
- **Attribute Enrichment**: Enrich events with contextual data:
  - Attach **planned route sequence** and **time windows** from the dispatch system.
  - Add **traffic context** (e.g., historical or real-time congestion levels) using external APIs or inferred from speed < 10 km/h for >5 minutes.
  - Flag **unscheduled events** (e.g., maintenance stops, detours) by comparing actual GPS trajectory to planned route.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Temporal misalignment** between systems (e.g., scanner clock drift).
  - **Missing events** (e.g., driver forgets to scan “Depart Customer”).
  - **Noisy GPS data** (e.g., signal loss in tunnels causing location jumps).
  - **Semantic heterogeneity** (e.g., “Low Speed Detected” vs. “Traffic Delay”).

Solutions include interpolation, rule-based gap-filling (e.g., infer “Depart Customer” if next GPS point shows movement), and outlier filtering.

#### **Process Discovery**
Apply **heuristic mining** or **inductive mining** algorithms to generate a visual model of the *as-is* delivery process. The model will reveal:
- Common sequences: `Depart Depot  Arrive Customer  Delivery Success  Depart Customer  ...  Arrive Depot`.
- Variants: Routes with failed deliveries, unscheduled maintenance stops, or mid-route returns.
- Parallelism: Multiple deliveries occurring in overlapping time windows (indicating route clustering).

The resulting **directly-follows graph** or **Petri net** will highlight frequent paths and deviations, such as unexpected loops (e.g., returning to depot mid-day) or skipped stops.

#### **Conformance Checking**
Compare the discovered process model against the *planned* route from the dispatch system using **token-based replay** or **alignment-based conformance checking**:
- **Sequence Deviations**: Deliveries performed out of planned order.
- **Unplanned Stops**: GPS-detected halts not corresponding to any planned stop or scanner event.
- **Timing Deviations**: Actual arrival at a stop >15 minutes later than planned without justification (e.g., traffic).
- **Missing Activities**: Planned stops with no “Arrive Customer” or delivery event (potential skipped deliveries).

Conformance metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) will quantify how closely operations follow plans, and **deviation cost** can be calculated in time or fuel units.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Derive KPIs directly from the event log:

| KPI | Calculation | Relevance |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries where “Arrive Customer”  customer time window end | Punctuality |
| **Avg. Time per Stop** | (Depart Customer – Arrive Customer) averaged across stops | Service efficiency |
| **Travel vs. Service Ratio** | Total driving time / total service time | Operational balance |
| **Fuel per Package** | Estimated from distance (GPS) × vehicle fuel rate / # of deliveries | Cost efficiency |
| **Vehicle Utilization** | (Time moving + service time) / total shift duration | Asset efficiency |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | # “Delivery Failed” / total delivery attempts | Re-delivery cost |
| **Traffic Delay Duration** | Sum of time spent at speed < 10 km/h outside stops | Route inefficiency |

Fuel consumption can be estimated using speed profiles, idle time, and vehicle specs.

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Dotted Chart Analysis**: Visualize all events over time to spot clusters of delays (e.g., many vehicles idle between 11:00–13:00 in a specific zone).
- **Performance Spectrum**: Map travel segments (from GPS) to identify slow corridors (e.g., segment between Stop 12–13 consistently takes 25+ mins vs. planned 12).
- **Variant Comparison**: Compare high-performing (e.g., >95% on-time) vs. low-performing routes to isolate inefficiencies.
- **Dwell Time Analysis**: Use scanner timestamps to compute service time per stop; flag outliers (e.g., >10 mins) for investigation (parking difficulty? customer issues?).
- **Resource-Centric Views**: Analyze by driver or vehicle to detect skill or mechanical issues.

Quantify bottleneck impact: e.g., “Unscheduled stops add 45 mins/day on average, reducing daily capacity by 4 deliveries.”

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Process mining enables hypothesis testing for root causes:

- **Suboptimal Route Planning**: If discovered variants show consistent reordering of stops that reduce total time, the static planner is inefficient. Use **variant analysis** to identify superior sequences.
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimates**: Compare planned vs. actual inter-stop durations. Systematic underestimation in certain areas suggests outdated traffic models.
- **Traffic Congestion**: Correlate low-speed GPS events with time-of-day and location. If delays cluster in specific zones during rush hours, static routes fail to adapt.
- **High Service Time Variability**: Analyze service time distribution. High variance may stem from poor access (apartment buildings), lack of parking, or inconsistent driver practices.
- **Vehicle Breakdowns**: Link “Unscheduled Stop” + maintenance logs. If breakdowns occur after high idle time or specific routes, preventive maintenance is needed.
- **Driver Behavior**: Compare KPIs by driver. Consistently high idle time or out-of-sequence deliveries may indicate training gaps.
- **Failed Deliveries**: Analyze time of day and customer type. High failure rates in business districts at 10:00 AM suggest misaligned time windows.

**Validating Root Causes**:
- Use **decision tree mining** (e.g., in ProM or Celonis) to predict delays based on features like time of day, traffic, driver ID.
- Apply **statistical process control** to detect abnormal service times or travel segments.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Optimization with Real-Time Feedback**
- **Targets**: Late deliveries, excessive travel time, fuel waste.
- **Root Cause**: Static routing ignoring real-time traffic and historical congestion patterns.
- **Process Mining Support**: Performance spectrum and traffic delay analysis identify high-impact corridors. Variant analysis reveals efficient detours used by top drivers.
- **Implementation**: Integrate real-time traffic APIs with the dispatch system. Use historical process models to pre-compute alternative routes for high-risk segments.
- **Expected Impact**: 10–15% reduction in travel time; 8–12% improvement in on-time delivery; 5–10% fuel savings.

#### **Strategy 2: Intelligent Time Window Management & Failed Delivery Reduction**
- **Targets**: High re-delivery costs, customer dissatisfaction.
- **Root Cause**: Inflexible or inaccurate delivery windows; lack of customer communication.
- **Process Mining Support**: Failed delivery events correlated with time of day (e.g., 90% of failures between 9–11 AM in residential areas). Analyze successful vs. failed attempts by customer type.
- **Implementation**:
  - Offer customers dynamic time slots based on historical success rates (e.g., “We deliver successfully to your street between 2–4 PM”).
  - Trigger SMS alerts 30 mins before arrival to reduce “not home” cases.
- **Expected Impact**: 20–30% reduction in failed deliveries; lower re-delivery costs; improved customer satisfaction.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance & Driver Coaching**
- **Targets**: Unscheduled breakdowns, inconsistent service times.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance; variable driver efficiency.
- **Process Mining Support**:
  - Correlate vehicle idle time, speed anomalies, and maintenance logs to predict failures.
  - Identify drivers with outlier service times or excessive idle time via resource performance views.
- **Implementation**:
  - Build a predictive model using vehicle usage patterns (e.g., frequent hard braking + high idle = engine stress).
  - Launch targeted coaching: share best-practice route variants and service time benchmarks with underperforming drivers.
- **Expected Impact**: 25% fewer unscheduled stops; 5–8% increase in daily delivery capacity; extended vehicle lifespan.

### **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Constraints**
All strategies must respect:
- **Driver Hours**: Ensure dynamic routes don’t violate legal driving limits (e.g., EU 9-hour rule). Use process mining to verify compliance (e.g., shift duration  10 hrs).
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Optimization algorithms must respect package volume/weight limits. Validate via dispatch log integration.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Dynamic rerouting must preserve window adherence. Use conformance checking to enforce this post-optimization.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
Deploy a **process mining dashboard** with real-time and historical views:
- **Operational Health Metrics**: On-time rate, failed delivery %, avg. stops/day, fuel/km.
- **Conformance Monitor**: % of routes deviating from plan; reasons for deviation (traffic, driver choice, breakdown).
- **Bottleneck Alerts**: Auto-detect new congestion hotspots or rising service times.
- **Driver Performance Scorecards**: Track individual KPIs with peer benchmarks.
- **Maintenance Risk Indicator**: Flag vehicles with anomalous usage patterns.

Update models monthly using fresh data to adapt to seasonal changes (e.g., holiday volume spikes). Conduct quarterly **variant drift analysis** to detect emerging inefficiencies.
