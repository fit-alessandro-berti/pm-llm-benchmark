This chart is essentially a “mini-timeline” of a threestep enforcement process, rendered as a spaghetti-diagram of individual cases moving through three stages:

  •  X–axis: actual calendar timestamps (here covering roughly January 2000 through April 2013).  
  •  Three horizontal lines (or “lanes”), from top to bottom:  
     –  Send Fine  
     –  Insert Fine Notification  
     –  Send for Credit Collection  

Each thin polyline represents one fine going through the process.  You read a line left to right:

  1.  It starts up on the “Send Fine” axis at the moment the fine was issued (these are the dense grey clusters you see at regular points in time—those are batchruns of new fines).  
  2.  That same line then slopes downward to where it crosses the “Insert Fine Notification” axis, at the time the reminder or notification was mailed.  Again, you see a “fan” of grey lines converging on each notification batch — the spread of slopes shows the variation in how long people took (or the system took) to get that second notice out.  
  3.  Finally some of those notification lines continue further down to hit the “Send for Credit Collection” axis.  Those bottom legs are drawn in red to highlight only the cases that actually escalated all the way to a collections agency.  

A few key things you can read off:

  –  The vertical clusters at each axis show that the city (or system) issues fines, then notifications, then collections in discrete batches rather than a perfectly continuous flow.  
  –  The triangular “fans” between each pair of axes encode the distribution of delays (shortest and longest waits) between steps.  
  –  Although nearly every fine spawns a notification (lots of grey lines from the top lane to the middle), only a small fraction of those ever turn into red lines at the bottom lane—i.e. most people pay or resolve the fine before it reaches credit collection.

In short, this is a time-aligned process-flow visualization showing how individual fines move through issue  reminder  collection, with grey lines for the overall population and red lines highlighting the subset that end up in credit collection.
