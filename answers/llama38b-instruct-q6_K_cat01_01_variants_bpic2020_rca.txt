Based on the provided data, I have analyzed the process variants and identified potential root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Longer approval paths**: Variants with multiple rejections and approvals (e.g., DECLARATION_SUBMITTED_by_EMPLOYEE -> ... -> DECLARATION_APPROVED_by_ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_SUPERVISOR -> ... -> PAYMENT_HANDLED) have lower frequencies and higher performances compared to variants with fewer rejections and approvals. This suggests that longer approval paths may be a contributing factor to performance issues.
2. **Multiple rejections by SUPERVISOR**: Variants with multiple rejections by SUPERVISOR (e.g., DECLARATION_SUBMITTED_by_EMPLOYEE -> ... -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_SUPERVISOR -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_EMPLOYEE) have lower frequencies and higher performances compared to variants without these rejections. This implies that SUPERVISOR's rejection is a significant bottleneck in the process.
3. **ADMINISTRATION's role in delays**: Variants involving ADMINISTRATION (e.g., DECLARATION_APPROVED_by_ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_SUPERVISOR) have lower frequencies and higher performances compared to variants without these steps. This suggests that ADMINISTRATION's involvement may be contributing to delays or performance issues.
4. **BUDGET OWNER's role in rejections**: Variants involving BUDGET_OWNER (e.g., DECLARATION_APPROVED_by_ADMINISTRATION -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_BUDGET_OWNER) have lower frequencies and higher performances compared to variants without these steps. This implies that BUDGET_OWNER's rejection may be a significant contributor to performance issues.
5. **Employee involvement in rejections**: Variants involving EMPLOYEE rejections (e.g., DECLARATION_SUBMITTED_by_EMPLOYEE -> ... -> DECLARATION_REJECTED_by_EMPLOYEE) have lower frequencies and higher performances compared to variants without these steps. This suggests that EMPLOYEE's involvement may be contributing to delays or performance issues.
6. **MISSING node**: The variant involving a MISSING node (DECLARATION_APPROVED_by_PRE_APPROVER -> DECLARATION_FINAL_APPROVED_by_SUPERVISOR -> ... -> PAYMENT_HANDLED) has a high frequency and low performance, indicating that this step may be causing problems.

To address the performance issues, consider optimizing the process by:

* Reducing the number of rejections and approvals
* Streamlining the approval path by minimizing the involvement of SUPERVISOR and BUDGET_OWNER
* Improving EMPLOYEE's decision-making or reducing their involvement in rejections
* Addressing the issue with the MISSING node

Please note that these insights are based on a statistical analysis of the provided data and may not represent the entire process. Further analysis, including additional data and process mapping, would be necessary to fully understand the root causes of performance issues.
