Here’s one way to do it in DuckDB using CTEs and the built-in LISTAGG function.  You just have to plug in your desired K (e.g. 10):

```sql
-- Replace 10 with your desired number of top variants
WITH
  -- 1) For each case, build its ordered activity sequence
  case_variants AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      LISTAGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  ),

  -- 2) Count how many cases share each sequence, then pick the top K by frequency
  top_variants AS (
    SELECT
      activity_sequence,
      COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT 10    --  your K here
  ),

  -- 3) Find all case_ids whose sequence is one of the top K
  selected_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    JOIN top_variants tv
      ON cv.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence
  )

-- 4) Finally, return all events from only those selected cases
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN selected_cases sc
  ON el.case_id = sc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

Explanation of each piece:

1. **case_variants**:  
   - Groups events by `case_id` and orders them by `timestamp`.  
   - `LISTAGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)` stitches the activities into a single string like `"A->B->C"`.

2. **top_variants**:  
   - Counts how many cases have exactly the same `activity_sequence`.  
   - Orders by that count descending and takes only the top K.

3. **selected_cases**:  
   - Joins back to pick only the `case_id`s whose sequences are in the top K list.

4. **Final SELECT**:  
   - Grabs all rows from the original `event_log` for those `case_id`s, excluding every other case.  
   - Orders by `case_id, timestamp` so you still see each trace in its event order.

If you prefer the Postgres-style `string_agg`, you can swap out the LISTAGG line for:

```sql
    string_agg(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
```

…otherwise the logic is identical.
