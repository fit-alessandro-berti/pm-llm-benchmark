```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
)
SELECT 
    e.case_id, 
    e.activity, 
    e.timestamp
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    case_event_counts cec ON e.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE 
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

This SQL query first calculates the number of events for each `case_id` in the `event_log` table using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `case_event_counts`. It then joins this CTE back to the original `event_log` table on `case_id` and filters out any rows where the `case_id` has more than six events, returning only those cases with six or fewer events.
