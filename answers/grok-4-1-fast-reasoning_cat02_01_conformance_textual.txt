### Violating Cases and Explanations

After analyzing the event log against the normative process description, **Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the intended process flow**. Cases 1 and 4 fully conform to the described norms (Case 1 follows the sufficient-inventory sequence perfectly; Case 4 follows the cancellation sequence exactly). Below, I detail the violations for each deviating case, referencing specific constraints from the description and interpreting implied conditions (e.g., strict sequencing based on logical dependencies like inventory confirmation before payment/fulfillment, and no fulfillment after cancellation).

#### Case 2 Violations
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  **Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order.

- **Package items occurs before Authorize payment**: The description explicitly states that "Package items" should only occur *after authorization* and before shipping, as "items must be prepared before they can be shipped" but only *after* payment is authorized (which itself requires prior inventory confirmation). Here, packaging happens immediately after inventory check, skipping or preceding payment authorization. This violates the normal progression: "after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared."
  
- **Authorize payment occurs after Package items**: Payment authorization "should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging," as it "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and precedes fulfillment steps. Reversing this order deviates from the "expected flow" (Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close), creating an illogical sequence where items are packaged without confirmed payment validity.

These are clear sequencing violations; no ambiguity allows packaging or shipping without prior authorization in the sufficient-inventory path (implied by the process).

#### Case 3 Violations
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order.

- **Ship order occurs after Cancel order**: The description is unequivocal: "Ship order" should only occur "after packaging" in the fulfillment path and "*never after a cancellation*." Shipping post-cancellation is "illogical" and violates the branch logic, as cancellation ends fulfillment (leading directly to Close order). This is a direct contravention of the key constraints.

- **Authorize payment followed by Cancel order**: While not explicitly forbidden, this deviates from the branching logic. After Check inventory, if insufficient stock, the process "*must* branch... directly proceed to 'Cancel order'" without fulfillment steps like authorization (which is part of the sufficient-inventory path: "Authorize Payment... ensuring... payment method is valid and approved" before packaging/shipping). Authorizing payment implies proceeding down the fulfillment path, making subsequent cancellation illogical and a deviation. The description notes such actions (e.g., authorizing before full confirmation) as potential violations.

- **Missing Package items before Ship order**: Even ignoring cancellation, shipping without prior packaging violates "Package items" occurring "after authorization and before shipping."

These compound errors mix cancellation and fulfillment paths inappropriately, with no interpretive leeway for post-cancellation shipping.

#### Case 5 Violations
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order. (*Package items entirely absent*).

- **Ship order occurs without prior Package items**: The description mandates "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'," with packaging strictly "after authorization and before shipping." Skipping packaging entirely violates this dependency, as items cannot logically be shipped unprepared. This deviates from the "normal progression" sequence (Authorize  Package  Ship).

- **Close order follows directly after Ship order without packaging confirmation**: While Close order is correctly final, the preceding gap undermines the full expected flow for sufficient inventory.

No ambiguity permits skipping packaging; the description frames it as essential for fulfillment.

### Summary
- **Compliant cases**: 1 (full sufficient-inventory flow), 4 (full cancellation flow).
- **Violating cases**: 2 (reversed Package/Authorize order), 3 (post-cancellation Ship; mixed paths), 5 (skipped Package before Ship).
All violations stem from sequencing constraints and path exclusivity, as outlined. The description's emphasis on logical preconditions (e.g., check before authorize/package, no fulfillment post-cancel) guides this interpretation without needing extraordinary circumstances.
