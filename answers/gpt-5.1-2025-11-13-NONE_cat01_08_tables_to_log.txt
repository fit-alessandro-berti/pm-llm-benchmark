Below is an integrated event log in Markdown.  

**Conventions and assumptions (for transparency):**  
- **Case ID** = `order_id`.  
- One row = one event.  
- Activities defined as:
  - `Order Created` (from Orders).  
  - `Item Picked` per order line (from Order Lines).  
  - `Delivery Dispatched` and `Delivery Arrived` per delivery record (from Delivery).  
  - `Invoice Issued` per invoice (from Invoice).  
  - `Payment Received` per payment (from Payments).  
- **Resource** is resolved via the Resources table where possible; otherwise we keep the original ID:
  - `Order Created`  sales person.  
  - `Item Picked`  picker (warehouse staff).  
  - `Delivery Dispatched` / `Delivery Arrived`  carrier.  
  - `Invoice Issued`  billing clerk.  
  - `Payment Received`  no named person given; resource left blank.  
- Events are ordered chronologically per order; where timestamps are equal (none here), order in table would define sequence.
- Additional attributes from source tables are included where meaningful (customer info, priority, item, quantities, invoice_id, payment_id, etc.).
