Here's your DuckDB SQL solution to identify and filter events based on the top K process variants:

```sql
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_order
    FROM
        event_log
),

ActivitySequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY activity_order) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        OrderedEvents
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

VariantsCount AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM
        ActivitySequences
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),

TopVariants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        VariantsCount
    ORDER BY
        case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),

CasesInTopVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        ActivitySequences
    WHERE
        activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM TopVariants)
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    CasesInTopVariants cv
ON
    e.case_id = cv.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

In this query:

1. **OrderedEvents CTE**: We use `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign an order to activities within each `case_id` based on their `timestamp`.
2. **ActivitySequences CTE**: We concatenate the ordered activities into a single string per `case_id`, representing each process variant.
3. **VariantsCount CTE**: We count the number of cases for each unique process variant.
4. **TopVariants CTE**: We identify the top K most frequent process variants based on their case counts.
5. **CasesInTopVariants CTE**: We filter cases to include only those whose activity sequence matches one of the top K variants.
6. **Final SELECT**: We get all events from the original event log for the cases that belong to the top K variants, sorted by `case_id` and `timestamp`.

### Note:
- **K**: needs to be replaced with the integer value representing the number of top variants you want to consider.
