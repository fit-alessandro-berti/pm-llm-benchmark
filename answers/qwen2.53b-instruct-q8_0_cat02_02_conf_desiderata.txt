### Analysis of Case Violations

#### **Case 1**
- **Normative Process Behavior:**
  - Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case (Correct)
- **Desiderata Compliance:**  
  Follow-up Call before closing the case is not mentioned in this event log.

#### **Case 2**
- **Normative Process Behavior Violations:**
  - No prior Credit Check for Risk Assessment (violation of “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment”).
- **Desideratum Violations:**
  - Credit Check delayed (over 24 hours, just a desideratum violation).
  - Inform Applicant after closing the case (desideratum, should be within recommended 48-hour window).

#### **Case 3**
- **Normative Process Behavior Violations:**
  - Credit Check done more than 24 hours after Application Received (just a desideratum violation).
  - Inform Applicant delayed (recommended to be informed within the next day of loan decision, just a desideratum violation).
- **Desideratum Compliance:**  
  Follow-up Call before closing the case is not mentioned in this event log.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Case 2
**Credit Check Delay:**
The Credit Check was completed at 09:30 on January 11th, and Risk Assessment started at 10:00. This delay violates the normative rule that a Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment (the process should be initiated within 24 hours). However, as this is not strictly an illegal step in the sequence but follows desideratum rules for timing:

- It's understood that while the credit check was delayed by over 24 hours, it still fit within the timeframe allowed.
- The delay of informing the applicant and finalizing documentation before closing are also minor violations, fitting into the "desideratum" category.

**Inform Applicant Late:**
Informing the applicant at 10:30 on January 11th is late compared to a recommended timing (within 48 hours after loan decision). This delay could be attributed to typical operational delays or communication issues in a real-world setting, which are not strictly prohibited but are better avoided.

#### Case 3
**Credit Check Delay:**
The Credit Check was done on January 14th at 10:00, more than 24 hours after Application Received. This is clearly violating the normative rule and recommended desideratum (follow up within a day).

**Inform Applicant Late:**
While there's no exact timestamp mentioned for this event in your log entry, it was done on January 17th at 9:00. Again, this is late compared to the desideratum of informing applicants within 48 hours.

### Suggestions

#### For Case 2
**Revised Timeline Suggestions:**
- Ensure that Credit Check starts immediately after Application Received.
- Promptly inform the applicant and finalize documentation as soon as possible once loan decision is made.

#### For Case 3
**Revised Timeline Suggestions:**
- Ensure a more timely completion of all activities within their respective timeframes (especially Credit Check done promptly).
- Ensure prompt communication with the applicant to align all parties.

These suggestions aim to optimize operational efficiency and compliance with both normative process behavior and desiderata recommendations.
