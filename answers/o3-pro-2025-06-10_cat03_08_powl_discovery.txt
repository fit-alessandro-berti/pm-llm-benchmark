Below is a compact POWL model that covers every execution variant that can be observed in the five cases of the log.

Python-like specification (no execution needed, only to describe the structure):

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1 – simple transitions ------------------------------------------------------
OR  = Transition(label="OR")      # Order Received
MS  = Transition(label="MS")      # Material Sourcing
QS  = Transition(label="QS")      # Quality Screening
PK  = Transition(label="PK")      # Packaging
DP  = Transition(label="DP")      # Distribution Planning
D   = Transition(label="D")       # Dispatch
LB  = Transition(label="LB")      # Labeling (optional)
skip = SilentTransition()         #  – “do nothing” for the optional labeling

# 2 – loops -------------------------------------------------------------------
# (a) Assembly / In-line Quality Check loop
AS  = Transition(label="AS")      # Assembly
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")     # In-line Quality Check
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(
        operator=Operator.LOOP,   # * ( AS, IQC )
        children=[AS, IQC])

# (b) Testing / Re-Testing loop
TST = Transition(label="TST")     # Testing
RT  = Transition(label="RT")      # Re-Testing
loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(
        operator=Operator.LOOP,   # * ( TST, RT )
        children=[TST, RT])

# 3 – optional labeling -------------------------------------------------------
xor_LB = OperatorPOWL(
        operator=Operator.XOR,    # X ( LB,  )
        children=[LB, skip])

# 4 – partial order describing the overall flow ------------------------------
root = StrictPartialOrder(
        nodes=[OR, MS, QS, loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT,
               PK, xor_LB, DP, D])

# sequential edges (absence of an edge  potential concurrency;
# here we purposely create a linear flow)
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)
root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_LB)       # after packaging, either label or skip
root.order.add_edge(xor_LB, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

Interpretation of the model

1. OR  MS  QS must occur in that order.
2. * ( AS, IQC )  
   • At least one Assembly (AS) is executed.  
   • After each AS the process can either exit the loop or execute an IQC and return to AS, allowing patterns like  
     AS –(exit) or AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS …  
   • This captures every AS / IQC repetition seen in cases 1, 2, 3, 5 and the IQC-less path of case 4.
3. * ( TST, RT )  
   • At least one Testing (TST) is executed.  
   • After each TST the process can either exit or perform an RT and go back to TST, covering all observed re-testing cycles (0, 1, 2, … times).
4. Packaging (PK) always follows the testing loop.
5. X ( LB,  )  
   • Either the product is labeled (LB) or the silent transition  is taken, modelling the optional nature of labeling (present in cases 1, 3, 4, 5; absent in case 2).
6. DP  D complete the flow.
7. No additional ordering edges are defined, so activities not connected by the explicit sequence are—according to the POWL semantics—potentially concurrent. In this model the control-flow is intentionally linear; concurrency could be added later simply by omitting edges.

This POWL structure succinctly reproduces every trace found in the log while keeping the model minimal and readable.
