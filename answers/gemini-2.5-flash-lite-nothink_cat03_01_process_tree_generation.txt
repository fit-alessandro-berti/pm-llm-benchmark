# The loop structure: * ( A, B ) where A is the loop body and B is the exit condition.
# In our case, the loop body is sequence_after_triage_xor -> loop_body_seq
# The condition for exiting the loop is when RDT results are normal, which is not explicitly
# an activity but a state change after RDT. The `*` operator in PM4PY implicitly handles
# the repetition until the inner part of the loop body leads to an exit.
# The structure for the loop is:
# * ( A, B )
# Here, A is the sequence that happens if the loop continues, and B is the sequence that happens if the loop exits.
# The description implies the loop body is executed, and then the condition is checked.
# If abnormal, repeat the loop body. If normal, exit.
# The standard PM4PY loop definition is: * ( A, B ). A is executed, then either exit or B followed by A again.
# This matches our description: if abnormal, loop_body (SC, X(TM,SPT), RDT) is executed, then RDT results are checked.
# If RDT results are still abnormal, we go back to SC. If normal, we exit the loop.
# So, the loop structure is:
# LOOP ( SEQUENCE ( SC, X(TM, SPT), RDT ),  EXIT_CONDITION_OR_NEXT_STEP )
# The problem statement says: "This loop repeats: after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation and subsequent exclusive treatments. This can happen multiple times until the results are deemed normal."
# This implies the entire loop_body_seq is the repeating part.
# The * operator typically takes two arguments: the part to execute repeatedly, and the part to execute after the loop.
# However, the definition provided: "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".
# This implies A is the body, and after A, you can exit or execute B and then A again.
# Let's re-interpret the loop based on the given definition of the '*' operator.
# * ( A, B ): A is executed. Then either exit, OR B is executed, then A again.
# This means:
# The loop body is the sequence of activities that happen *before* checking for exit.
# The condition for exiting is after RDT. If normal, exit. If abnormal, repeat.
# So, the structure is `* ( loop_content, something_after_loop )`.
# The loop_content is what is executed repeatedly.
# Let's consider the process *after* the initial diagnostics.
# We have `sequence_after_triage_xor`.
# Now we enter the loop.
# The description for the loop is: "if the results are abnormal, a loop commences: The patient must be reviewed by a Specialist Consultation (SC), which could be a cardiologist, hematologist, or another specialist depending on the findings. After consultation, an exclusive treatment choice is made: Administer a Targeted Medication (TM), or Provide a Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT) session. Following the treatment, the patient must undergo a Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT) step. The RDT itself is an exclusive choice similar to the initial test: Either a Follow-up ECG (FCE), or a Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA). This loop repeats: after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation and subsequent exclusive treatments. This can happen multiple times until the results are deemed normal."

# This describes a loop where the sequence SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA) is the repeating part.
# The loop exit condition is implicitly after X(FCE, FBA) if the results are normal.
# So, the structure of the loop is:
# LOOP over ( SEQUENCE (SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA)) )
# This means the loop content is `loop_body_seq`.
# The loop operator * expects the part that is executed and then potentially repeated.
# The explicit "exit" condition is not a separate node in the standard PM4PY * operator.
# The loop is modeled as: LOOP (BODY)
# The BODY itself contains the choice to continue or exit. However, the provided operators don't explicitly model a conditional exit from a loop.
# Given the definition: "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".
# This means:
# A is the part that gets executed.
# If you exit, the loop ends.
# If you don't exit, then B is executed, then A again.
# This interpretation is a bit ambiguous for modeling "repeat until condition".

# A common way to model "repeat N times until condition" is * ( A, tau ).
# Here, A is the sequence SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> RDT.
# The condition for exit is implicit: after RDT, if normal, the loop naturally ends.
# If abnormal, the `*` operator implicitly makes the execution go back to the start of A.
# So, the loop will be `*(loop_body_seq)`.

# Let's assume the '*' operator in PM4PY, when used as `*(A)`, means A is executed repeatedly.
# The exit condition is typically handled by the structure of A itself.
# If A results in a state where the loop should end, it just ends.
# So, let's model the loop as: `*(loop_body_seq)`
# The process tree before the loop is `sequence_after_triage_xor`.
# The loop starts after `sequence_after_triage_xor`.
# So, we have `SEQUENCE ( sequence_after_triage_xor, LOOP(loop_body_seq) )`

# However, the definition "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".
# This suggests A is the part executed, and then there's a choice.
# If the choice is to exit, the loop ends.
# If the choice is NOT to exit, then B is executed, then A again.
# This implies that B is the part that facilitates the re-execution.

# Let's reconsider the problem statement's loop description:
# "The patient must be reviewed by a Specialist Consultation (SC)..."
# "...an exclusive treatment choice is made: TM, or SPT."
# "...patient must undergo a Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT)... FCE, or FBA."
# "This loop repeats: after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation and subsequent exclusive treatments. This can happen multiple times until the results are deemed normal."

# This strongly suggests that the sequence SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA) is the core of the loop.
# The exit condition is when the results of X(FCE, FBA) are normal.
# The PM4PY `*` operator is typically used as `*(A)` to mean A is repeated, or `*(A, B)` where A is the body, and B is something that happens after the body before repeating A.

# Given the definition `*(A, B)`: "A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".
# This implies A is the first part, then a decision point.
# If we want to repeat, we do B then A again.
# The description of the loop:
# - SC (A1)
# - X(TM, SPT) (A2)
# - RDT (X(FCE, FBA)) (A3)
# If abnormal, return to SC.
# This implies the entire sequence `SEQUENCE(SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))` is the part that repeats.
# Let's model this as `*( loop_body_seq )` for now, assuming `*(A)` means A repeats indefinitely until some implicit condition is met.
# The exit condition is not explicitly given as a separate process.

# If we strictly follow the definition `*( A, B )`:
# A = `loop_body_seq` (SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))
# What is B? The definition says "then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again".
# This suggests B is a transition back.
# A more direct mapping of "repeat until normal" would be an iterative structure.

# Let's assume the `*` operator, in the context of "repeat until normal", means the first argument is the body that repeats.
# The exit is implicit when the condition is met.
# So the loop is: `*(loop_body_seq)`

# Let's combine the parts:
# Initial sequence: `sequence_after_triage_xor` (up to initial diagnostics)
# Loop part: `loop_body_seq` (SC -> X(TM,SPT) -> RDT)
# We need to connect them. The loop starts after the initial diagnostics.
# The structure is `SEQUENCE ( sequence_after_triage_xor, LOOP(loop_body_seq) )`

# Let's refine the loop structure. The definition of '*' is key here.
# "* ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again"
# This means:
# If we consider the part that comes *after* the loop, it's not explicitly defined.
# The loop itself is: SC -> X(TM,SPT) -> X(FCE,FBA).
# If abnormal, we go back to SC. If normal, we exit.
# Let's assume `*(A)` implies A is the repeating block, and exit is handled by the implicit flow.

# If we strictly interpret `*(A, B)`:
# A = `loop_body_seq` (SC, X(TM,SPT), X(FCE,FBA))
# The "exit the loop" part is implicitly handled.
# The "or you execute B and then A again" part means B is something that leads back to A.
# This definition is slightly different from typical loop constructs.

# A common PM4PY interpretation of loop 'repeat until condition' is `*(A)`.
# Let's use that assumption for now.

# Combined process up to the loop:
process_before_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
process_before_loop.children.append(sequence_after_triage_xor)

loop_node = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP) # This is equivalent to *

# This structure represents the entire process.
# Let's double check the loop interpretation.
# The definition of `* (A, B)` implies A is executed, then an exit choice.
# If not exiting, then B is executed, then A again.
# This is closer to a `do-while` loop structure if B is a silent step (tau) and the implicit "exit" is when a condition is met.

# Let's try to re-model the loop if the `*(A, B)` definition is strictly applied where B is an intermediate step.
# Given the description: "after the re-diagnostic test, if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns to the Specialist Consultation"
# This implies that `loop_body_seq` is what is *repeated*.
# The structure is:
# `SEQUENCE ( initial_part, LOOP(loop_body_seq), final_part )`
# The `LOOP(A)` construct in pm4py is often understood as `* (A)`.
# Let's assume `*` operator is a direct representation of the loop.
