Got it, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to remember the normative process description and the key constraints. Let's list out the main rules from the text:

1. The process always starts with "Receive order".
2. After receiving, you **must** check inventory before any payment authorization or fulfillment.
3. If inventory is sufficient: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close.
4. If inventory is insufficient: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
5. Key dependencies: 
   - Authorize Payment  only after Check Inventory, before Packaging.
   - Package Items  only after Authorize Payment (and before Ship).
   - Ship Order  only after Package Items (and never after Cancel).
   - Close Order  final in all scenarios.
6. No deviations: e.g., Authorize before Check, Package before Authorize, Ship after Cancel, etc.

First, let's go through each case one by one and check against these rules.

**Case 1:**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. That's the sufficient inventory flow. All steps in order, no violations. So Case 1 is good.

**Case 2:**
Activities: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait, the normative says you can't Package before Authorizing Payment. The text says: "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging". So Packaging (Package items) must come after Authorize payment. In Case 2, they check inventory, then package, then authorize. That's a violation because Package comes before Authorize. Also, the sufficient inventory flow requires Authorize before Package, so this is a no-go.

**Case 3:**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. Wait, normative says if inventory is insufficient (which Check would reveal), you go to Cancel, then Close. But here, after Cancel, they Ship. The text says: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)". So Shipping after Cancel is a violation. Also, the sequence after Check in this case is Authorize (which is for sufficient inventory) but then Cancel (for insufficient). Wait, did they check inventory correctly? The activity after Check is Authorize, but we don't know the result of Check—wait, no, the event log just lists the activities, not the results. But the normative says: if inventory is sufficient, do Authorize; if insufficient, do Cancel. But in Case 3, after Check, they do Authorize and Cancel? Wait, no, the sequence is Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship. Wait, no, the event log for Case 3 is: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Wait, but the normative says that if inventory is insufficient, after Check you do Cancel, then Close. But here, after Check, they do Authorize (which is for sufficient inventory) then Cancel. That's a problem because Authorize is only supposed to happen if inventory is sufficient. But do we know from the event log whether the Check found sufficient or not? The event log just has the activities, not the results. But the normative process says that the process branches based on inventory check: if sufficient, Authorize; if not, Cancel. So in Case 3, after Check, they do both Authorize (which implies they thought inventory was sufficient) and Cancel (which implies they thought it wasn't). That's a contradiction, but more importantly, the sequence after Check is Authorize then Cancel, which is not the normative branching. Wait, no, let's go back to the normative: "if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'". So if inventory is insufficient, the next step after Check is Cancel, then Close. If sufficient, next step after Check is Authorize. So in Case 3, after Check, they do Authorize (which is for sufficient) but then Cancel (which is for insufficient). That's a violation because the branching is wrong. Also, after Cancel, they Ship—which is explicitly forbidden: "Once the order has been canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)". So Ship after Cancel is a violation. So Case 3 has two violations: branching wrong after Check (Authorize instead of Cancel if insufficient) and Ship after Cancel.

Wait, but do we have to assume that the Check result is known? The event log doesn't say, but the normative process says that the branching is based on the inventory check. So the process should either do Authorize (if sufficient) or Cancel (if insufficient) after Check. In Case 3, they do both—so that's a violation because the branching is incorrect. Also, Ship after Cancel is a violation. So Case 3 is bad.

**Case 4:**
Activities: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. Wait, normative says if inventory is insufficient, the sequence is Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. Is that correct? Wait, the normative says: "if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'. Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment... and thus the next reasonable step is to 'Close order'". So Case 4's sequence is Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. That's exactly the insufficient inventory flow. Are there any violations? Let's check the steps: Receive (first), Check (after Receive—correct), Cancel (after Check—correct for insufficient), Close (after Cancel—correct). All steps in order, no dependencies violated. So Case 4 is good.

**Case 5:**
Activities: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. That's the sufficient inventory flow. Wait, but wait—no, wait: the normative says that after Authorize, you Package before Ship. In Case 5, they do Authorize, then Ship. That's a violation because Package must come before Ship. The text says: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items'. Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'". So Ship must come after Package. In Case 5, they skip Package and go straight to Ship. That's a violation. Also, let's confirm: sufficient inventory flow is Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. Case 5 has Authorize  Ship, missing Package. So that's a violation.

Wait, let's recap each case:

**Case 1:** Good. Follows sufficient inventory flow: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. All steps in order, dependencies met.

**Case 2:** Bad. Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close. Violation: Package comes before Authorize (normative requires Authorize before Package).

**Case 3:** Bad. Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. Violations: 1) After Check, they do Authorize (for sufficient) and Cancel (for insufficient)—branching is incorrect (should choose one or the other based on inventory result, but event log doesn't show the result, but the sequence is wrong because they do both). 2) Ship after Cancel—normative says you can't do fulfillment activities (like Ship) after Cancel. So even if the Check result is unknown, Ship after Cancel is a clear violation per the text: "Once the order has been canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)".

**Case 4:** Good. Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. Follows insufficient inventory flow: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. All steps in order, no violations.

**Case 5:** Bad. Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. Violation: Ship comes before Package (normative requires Package before Ship).

Wait, let's double-check Case 3. The normative says that if inventory is sufficient, you Authorize, then Package, then Ship. If insufficient, you Cancel, then Close. So the branching is exclusive: either Authorize (if sufficient) or Cancel (if insufficient) after Check. In Case 3, they do both—so that's a violation because the branching is incorrect. Also, after Cancel, they do Ship—which is explicitly forbidden. So even if the Check result was insufficient, they shouldn't do Ship after Cancel. Or if it was sufficient, they shouldn't do Cancel after Authorize. Either way, it's wrong.

Another point: Close Order must be the final activity in all scenarios. All cases have Close at the end, so that's okay.

Let's confirm Case 5 again: Authorize Payment is followed by Ship Order. The normative says: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items'. Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'". So Package must come between Authorize and Ship. Case 5 skips Package, so Ship comes before Package—violation.

Case 2: Package comes before Authorize. Normative says Authorize must come before Packaging. So violation.

Case 3: Ship after Cancel. Normative says Cancel means no fulfillment activities. Violation.

Case 4: Good, follows insufficient inventory flow.

Case 1: Good, follows sufficient inventory flow.

So the violating cases are Case 2, Case 3, Case 5.

Wait, let's list each violation:

**Case 2 Violations:**
- Violation of the dependency between "Check inventory" and "Authorize payment": The normative process requires that "Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory" and before packaging. In Case 2, "Package items" is performed before "Authorize payment", which violates the rule that authorization must precede packaging.

**Case 3 Violations:**
1. **Incorrect Branching After "Check inventory":** The normative process states that the sequence branches based on inventory availability: if sufficient, proceed to "Authorize payment"; if insufficient, proceed to "Cancel order". In Case 3, both "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order" are performed after "Check inventory", which is a violation of the exclusive branching rule (the process must choose only one path after the check).
2. **Violation of "Ship order" after "Cancel order":** The normative process explicitly states that once an order is canceled, fulfillment activities (such as shipping) are illogical and should not be continued. In Case 3, "Ship order" is performed after "Cancel order", which directly violates this rule.

**Case 5 Violations:**
- **Violation of the dependency between "Authorize payment" and "Package items":** The normative process requires that "Package items" occurs after "Authorize payment" (since payment must be authorized before items are prepared for shipping). In Case 5, "Ship order" is performed immediately after "Authorize payment", skipping the necessary "Package items" step, which violates the rule that packaging must precede shipping.

Are there any other cases? Let's check Case 4 again: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. That's correct for insufficient inventory. No violations.

Case 1: Correct for sufficient inventory. No violations.

So the answer is: Cases 2, 3, 5 violate the normative process.

</think>

To solve this problem, we first map out the **key constraints** from the normative process description and then evaluate each case in the event log against these constraints.


### **Key Constraints from the Normative Process**
The normative process defines a strict sequence of activities with explicit dependencies, summarized below:
1. **Always start with "Receive order"**.  
2. **Inventory check must precede payment authorization/fulfillment**:  
   - If inventory is sufficient: `Receive  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`.  
   - If inventory is insufficient: `Receive  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`.  
3. **Dependency rules**:  
   - `Authorize payment` must occur **after** `Check inventory` and **before** `Package items` (payment authorization is meaningless without known sufficiency).  
   - `Package items` must occur **after** `Authorize payment` and **before** `Ship order` (items must be prepared before shipping).  
   - `Ship order` must occur **only after** `Package items` and **never after** `Cancel order` (fulfillment is illogical post-cancellation).  
   - `Close order` is the **final activity** in all scenarios.  


### **Evaluation of Each Case**
We analyze each case against the constraints above:

#### **Case 1**  
**Sequence**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`.  
**Analysis**: Follows the **sufficient inventory flow** exactly. All dependencies (e.g., `Authorize payment` before `Package items`, `Package items` before `Ship order`) are satisfied.  
**Violation**: None.  


#### **Case 2**  
**Sequence**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`.  
**Violations**:  
- **Dependency violation**: `Package items` occurs **before** `Authorize payment`, violating the rule that payment authorization must precede fulfillment.  


#### **Case 3**  
**Sequence**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order`.  
**Violations**:  
1. **Incorrect branching after "Check inventory"**: The normative process requires an exclusive choice between `Authorize payment` (sufficient inventory) and `Cancel order` (insufficient inventory). Case 3 includes both, violating the branching rule.  
2. **Ship after Cancel**: The normative process explicitly prohibits fulfillment activities (e.g., `Ship order`) after cancellation. Case 3 violates this by performing `Ship order` post-`Cancel`.  


#### **Case 4**  
**Sequence**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`.  
**Analysis**: Follows the **insufficient inventory flow** exactly. All steps are in order, and dependencies (e.g., `Cancel order` before `Close order`) are satisfied.  
**Violation**: None.  


#### **Case 5**  
**Sequence**: `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`.  
**Violations**:  
- **Dependency violation**: `Ship order` occurs **before** `Package items`, violating the rule that packaging must precede shipping (payment authorization alone is insufficient for fulfillment).  


### **Summary of Violating Cases**
The following cases violate the normative process constraints:  
- **Case 2**: `Package items` before `Authorize payment`.  
- **Case 3**: Incorrect branching after `Check inventory` (both `Authorize payment` and `Cancel order`) and `Ship order` after `Cancel order`.  
- **Case 5**: `Ship order` before `Package items`.  


**Answer:**  
The cases that violate the normative process are **Case 2**, **Case 3**, and **Case 5**.  

### Detailed Violations:  
- **Case 2**: Violates the dependency rule that `Authorize payment` must occur before `Package items` (since `Package items` is performed before `Authorize payment`).  
- **Case 3**:  
  1. **Incorrect branching after "Check inventory"**: The normative process requires choosing only one path (either `Authorize payment` for sufficient inventory or `Cancel order` for insufficient inventory). Case 3 includes both, violating this rule.  
  2. **Ship after Cancel**: The normative process explicitly prohibits fulfillment activities (e.g., `Ship order`) after cancellation. Case 3 violates this by performing `Ship order` post-`Cancel`.  
- **Case 5**: Violates the dependency rule that `Package items` must occur before `Ship order` (since `Ship order` is performed immediately after `Authorize payment`, skipping `Package items`).
