We are going to break down the problem:

 Step 1: Identify cases that have the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession: 
   'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'

 Step 2: Among these cases, check for the condition that the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

 Step 3: Exclude all events from the cases that meet both conditions.

 We can use window functions to identify the sequence and then compute the time difference.

 Approach:

 1. We can use a window function to assign a row number per case ordered by timestamp, and then also use lead to look at the next activities.

 2. Alternatively, we can use a pattern matching technique (like using `LAG` and `LEAD`) to find the sequence.

 However, note that the sequence must be in direct succession, meaning no other activity in between.

 Let's consider:

 For each case, we can order events by timestamp and then check for consecutive events.

 We can try to flag the sequence by:

   - For each row, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after is 'Confirm Order'.

 3. Then, for the cases that have such a sequence, we check the timestamp difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' (which are the second and third in the sequence) and see if it is more than 5 days.

 4. We then exclude all events from these cases.

 We can do this by:

   a) First, in a subquery, for each case, we'll look for the occurrence of the pattern and then compute the time difference for that pattern.

   b) Then, we'll mark the cases that have at least one occurrence of the pattern with the time condition.

   c) Finally, we'll select all events from the event_log that are not in the list of excluded cases.

 Alternatively, we can use a common table expression (CTE) to identify the cases to exclude.

 Let's write the query step by step.

 Step 1: Identify the cases with the sequence and the time condition.

 We can use a window function to get the next two activities and their timestamps for each event.

 We'll partition by case_id and order by timestamp.

 Then, for each event, we can check:

   activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   lead(activity, 1) = 'Create Order'
   lead(activity, 2) = 'Confirm Order'

 And then we can also get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' (which is lead(timestamp,1)) and the timestamp of the 'Confirm Order' (lead(timestamp,2)).

 Then, the condition on time is: 
   lead(timestamp,2) - lead(timestamp,1) > interval 5 days

 But note: we are looking for the sequence in direct succession, so we don't want any other event in between. This condition of using lead with 1 and 2 exactly checks that because if there's an event in between, then the lead2 would be the event after the next, which would break the sequence.

 However, note: the problem says "in direct succession", meaning no other event in between. So if we have:

   Event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   Event2: 'Create Order'
   Event3: 'Confirm Order'

 Then the lead1 for Event1 is Event2, and lead2 for Event1 is Event3.

 So we can check at the event 'Approve Purchase Requisition' whether the next two are as required.

 But note: what if the same activity appears multiple times in a case? We are only concerned with one sequence.

 We are going to mark the case if at least one such sequence exists and the time condition holds.

 We can do:

   WITH sequences AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            timestamp as approve_ts,
            lead(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as create_ts,
            lead(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_ts
        FROM event_log
        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   )
   SELECT case_id
   FROM sequences
   WHERE 
        lead(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
        AND lead(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Confirm Order'
        AND confirm_ts - create_ts > interval 5 days

 However, note: we cannot use lead on activity in the same window as we are using for timestamps? We can use multiple leads.

 Alternatively, we can do:

   WITH event_lead AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
   )
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_lead
   WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > interval 5 days

 This will give us the cases that have the sequence and the time condition.

 But note: what if the same case has multiple sequences? We only need to exclude the case if at least one sequence meets the condition.

 So we can use DISTINCT.

 Step 2: We then exclude all events from these cases.

 Final query:

   WITH excluded_cases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM (
            SELECT 
                case_id,
                activity,
                timestamp,
                LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
                LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
                LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
                LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
            FROM event_log
        ) 
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
            AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
            AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > interval 5 days
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

 However, note: the condition on the time difference is between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. In our query, we are using the next_timestamp (which is the timestamp of 'Create Order') and next_next_timestamp (which is the timestamp of 'Confirm Order').

 This should work.

 But let's consider: what if the case has the sequence but the time condition is not met? Then we don't exclude it.

 Also, note: we are using `DISTINCT` in the excluded_cases because the same case might have multiple sequences (but we only need to exclude the case once).

 However, note: the same case might have the sequence multiple times and one of them meets the condition, then we exclude the case. So we are excluding the entire case if at least one sequence meets the condition.

 This matches the requirement.

 Let's test with sample data:

   case_id | activity                      | timestamp
   --------+-------------------------------+-----------
   1       | Approve Purchase Requisition  | 2023-01-01
   1       | Create Order                  | 2023-01-02
   1       | Confirm Order                 | 2023-01-03  --> less than 5 days, so not excluded.

   case_id 2:
   2       | Approve Purchase Requisition  | 2023-01-01
   2       | Create Order                  | 2023-01-02
   2       | Confirm Order                 | 2023-01-10  --> more than 5 days, so exclude case 2.

   Then the result should have all events of case 1 and none of case 2.

 But note: what if a case has the sequence but also other events? We are only concerned with the sequence in direct succession. Our method using lead(1) and lead(2) ensures that we are looking at the next two events.

 However, note: the same case might have the sequence multiple times? Then we are checking every 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event and see if the next two are the required ones.

 This is correct.

 But note: the query might be heavy if the event log is large because we are computing lead for two steps for every row. But we are only then filtering on the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' events.

 We can also first filter the events that are one of the three activities? But note, we are looking for the sequence, so we need the order of all events.

 Alternatively, we can use a different approach by grouping by case_id and then using array functions? But DuckDB might not support array functions for this.

 Another approach: we can use a recursive CTE or pattern matching with MATCH_RECOGNIZE if DuckDB supports it? But let's stick to window functions for simplicity.

 Let's assume DuckDB supports the window functions and interval arithmetic.

 We are using `interval 5 days` for the time difference. DuckDB does support intervals.

 However, note: the timestamp column type must be a timestamp for the subtraction to work.

 If the timestamp is stored as string, we need to cast it.

 Let's assume it's a timestamp.

 If not, we can cast: `CAST(timestamp AS TIMESTAMP)`

 We'll write the query accordingly.

 Final query:

   WITH event_lead AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
   ),
   excluded_cases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM event_lead
        WHERE 
            activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
            AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
            AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
            AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > interval 5 days
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

 This should work.

 However, note: the lead functions might return NULL for the next activity or next_next activity if there are not enough events. So the condition will not match in that case.

 Let's run with the sample:

   For case 2:

        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> matches.
        next_activity = 'Create Order' -> matches.
        next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' -> matches.
        next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp = '2023-01-10' - '2023-01-02' = 8 days -> condition true.

   So case 2 is excluded.

   For case 1:

        The time difference is 1 day, so condition false -> not excluded.

 This meets the requirement.

 But note: what if the case has multiple sequences and one of them meets the condition? Then we exclude the entire case.

 Example:

   case 3:

        Event1: Approve Purchase Requisition -> next is Create Order, next_next is Confirm Order (time difference 6 days) -> exclude.
        Event2: Later, another sequence: Approve Purchase Requisition -> Create Order -> Confirm Order (time difference 1 day) -> but we already excluded the case.

 So we are excluding the case if at least one sequence meets the condition.

 This is correct.

 We are done.

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that solves the problem:

```sql
WITH sequence_cases AS (
    -- Identify cases with the required sequence
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) sequenced
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL 5 DAYS
)
-- Return all events except those from excluded cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Explanation of the solution:**

1. **Sequence Identification**: 
   - The inner query uses window functions (`LEAD`) to look ahead at the next two activities and their timestamps for each event within the same case.
   - It identifies the pattern where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

2. **Time Condition Check**:
   - For the identified sequences, it checks if the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days using `next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp > INTERVAL 5 DAYS`.

3. **Case Exclusion**:
   - The CTE `sequence_cases` collects all `case_id` values that meet both the sequence and timing conditions.
   - The final query selects all events from the original log except those belonging to the excluded cases.

4. **Ordering**:
   - Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the chronological sequence of events within each case.

This query efficiently handles the requirements by:
- Using window functions to detect sequences without self-joins
- Applying the timing condition directly on the sequence events
- Cleanly excluding the identified cases while preserving all other events
- Maintaining the original event log structure in the output
