The provided pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, which can be either standard or custom. Here's a detailed explanation of the process:

### Process Overview

1. **Start Event**
   - The process begins with the receipt of a customer request.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
   - This task involves capturing and recording the initial request details submitted by the customer.

3. **Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
   - An exclusive gateway that directs the process flow based on the type of request:
     - **Standard Request:** Proceeds to Task B1.
     - **Custom Request:** Proceeds to Task B2.

### Standard Request Path

4. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
   - This task involves validating the standard request against predefined criteria to ensure it meets company standards.

5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
   - A parallel gateway that initiates concurrent tasks.
   - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
     - Verifies the customer's creditworthiness.
   - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
     - Confirms product availability in inventory.
   - Both checks must complete before the process continues.

6. **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
   - A joining gateway that waits for both Task C1 and Task C2 to complete.

7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
   - Computes the feasible delivery date based on current inventory and customer details.

### Custom Request Path

8. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
   - Analyzes the custom request to determine if it can be accommodated.

9. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
   - Determines the feasibility of the custom request.
   - **If Yes:** Proceeds to Task E1.
   - **If No:** Proceeds to Task E2.

10. **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
    - Generates a quotation for the custom request.

11. **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
    - Notifies the customer that the custom request cannot be accommodated.
    - The process ends after this task.

### Convergence and Approval Path

12. **After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed**
    - Once either path completes (Task D for standard, Task E1 for custom), the process continues to a new decision point.

13. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
    - Determines if managerial approval is necessary.
    - **If Yes:** Proceeds to Task F.
    - **If No:** Directly generates the final invoice (Task G).

14. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
    - Requests and awaits approval from a manager.

15. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
    - Verifies if the approval is granted.
    - **If Yes:** Moves to Task G.
    - **If No:** Triggers re-evaluation (Task H).

16. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
    - Reassesses the request conditions.
    - Loops back to:
      - **Task E1** for custom requests.
      - **Task D** for standard requests, indicating a need to revisit calculations or validations.

17. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
    - Generates the invoice for the approved request.

### Final Steps

18. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
    - Sends a confirmation to the customer regarding the request status (processed, quoted, or rejected).

19. **End Event**
    - Marks the completion of the process for a given customer request.

### Summary

- **Standard Requests** are validated and checked in parallel for credit and inventory before calculating the delivery date.
- **Custom Requests** undergo a feasibility analysis, and if feasible, a quotation is prepared. If not feasible, the request is rejected.
- **Approval Steps** are triggered based on managerial discretion, with a loop-back mechanism for re-evaluation if approval is denied.
- The process ensures that all requests are handled efficiently, with appropriate checks, validations, and decision points to accommodate both standard and custom needs.
