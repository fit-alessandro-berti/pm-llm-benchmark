It appears that you have provided a detailed log of different steps involved in creating fines, sending them out for processing, appealing them to prefectures or judges, adding penalties and receiving results thereof among other related processes like payment collection.

From the given data points it looks like each step has multiple occurrences associated with it represented by frequency value while performance values are probably referring metrics or outcomes from these steps. For example, 'frequency' could indicate how often this process was repeated, implying the number of times a particular operation occurred within this dataset.

Let's create Log Skeleton model using the provided data:

```
- Create Fine (occurrences: 15)
   ```
This line indicates that overall creation of fines happened fifteen times based on given frequency.

```
- Send for processing:
    - Insert fine details
        ```
    This would show there were instances where fine details had been inserted for processing nineteen times across the dataset. 

```
- Appeal to Prefecture (with multiple sub-steps):
    `- Insert appeal details 
        `- Send to prefecture for review
            `- Receive result back     
                `- Add penalty if required  
                    `- Notify result to payer if necessary
```

Here we see that each action when taking an individual or group of actions from the main process happened repeatedly nineteen times overall. 

```
- Payment procedures:
    `- Make payment
        `- Pay fine amount 
            `- Collect via credit/debit
                `- Forfeit by default 
                    `- Default on creditor terms
```

For payments too multiple actions for each possible action (making payment, paying the fine amount etc.) and their outcomes (through cash methods or defaulting) have taken place nineteen times across the dataset.

The idea here is to summarize each critical event in steps that could be tracked together despite many individual occurrences under them in the original data:

```
1. Creation of Fine
   - Send for processing:
        |- Insert Fine Details
            `- Appeal to Prefecture:
                    `- Insert Appeal Details  
                        `- Send Appeal Request to Prefecture
                            `- Receive Appeal Decision
                                `- Add Penalty if applicable   
                                    `- Notify Payer regarding the outcome
```

This condensed version keeps each critical process in context but reduces redundancy seen often when detailing each action step-by-step in a log.

Remember this model simplification and assumes logical grouping for clarity sake. Real application may vary based on further analysis needed:

1. Creation of Fine: Log Skeleton Model
2. Processing Appeal to Prefecture Steps 
   `- Receive Appeal Result back to original process
     `- Add Penalty if applicable after receiving appeal result  
3. Payment Collection Process:
   `- Make Payment (summarized into one action for clarity)
       `- Pay fine amount through multiple channels or methods

Remember this is an abstracted view based on the provided data simplified for structure clarity sake aiming towards Log Skeleton Model format but in practice may vary widely depending on further analysis details required
