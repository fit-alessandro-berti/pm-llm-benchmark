### **Key Constraints Explained:**
1. **Existence**: Certain activities (e.g., `Idea Generation`, `Final Launch`) must occur.
2. **Init**: The process must start with `Idea Generation`.
3. **Response & Precedence**: Ensures logical sequencing (e.g., `Design Draft` must be followed by `Technical Feasibility Check`).
4. **Chain Constraints**: Enforces multi-step dependencies (e.g., `Design Draft  TFC  Cost Evaluation`).
5. **Coexistence**: Some activities must occur together (e.g., `Prototype Creation` and `Laboratory Testing`).

This model ensures that the product design process follows a structured workflow while allowing flexibility where needed. Adjustments can be made based on real-world process variations.
