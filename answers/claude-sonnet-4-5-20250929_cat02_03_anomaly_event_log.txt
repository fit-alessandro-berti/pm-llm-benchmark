# Procure-to-Pay Event Log Analysis: Anomaly Detection

## Standard P2P Process Flow (Expected Sequence)
1. Create Purchase Requisition
2. Approve Purchase Requisition
3. Issue Purchase Order
4. Receive Goods
5. Vendor Invoice Received
6. Match Invoice to PO (3-way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice)
7. Release Payment
8. Close Case

## Analysis by Case

### **Case 1001:  NORMAL**
This case follows the standard P2P process flow correctly with proper sequencing and controls in place.

---

### **Case 1002:  MULTIPLE CRITICAL ANOMALIES**

#### **Anomaly 1: Missing Approval Before PO Issuance**
- **Issue**: Purchase Order issued (08:40) **before** Purchase Requisition approval (08:00 next day)
- **Problem**: Violates segregation of duties and authorization controls. The organization is committing to a vendor without proper approval authority.
- **Risk**: Unauthorized spending, fraud, budget overruns

#### **Anomaly 2: Payment Released Before Goods Receipt**
- **Issue**: Payment released (Feb 3, 07:15) **before** goods received (Feb 4, 09:00)
- **Problem**: Paying for goods not yet received violates the fundamental control principle of the 3-way match
- **Risk**: Payment for undelivered goods, vendor fraud, financial loss

#### **Anomaly 3: Payment Released Before Invoice Matching**
- **Issue**: Payment released (Feb 3, 07:15) **before** Invoice matched to PO (Feb 5, 08:00)
- **Problem**: Payment without verification that invoice terms match PO and goods receipt
- **Risk**: Overpayment, incorrect pricing, duplicate payments

#### **Severity**: **CRITICAL** - This case shows systematic control failures suggesting either fraud, system malfunction, or severe process breakdown.

---

### **Case 1003:  CRITICAL ANOMALY**

#### **Anomaly: Payment Before Invoice Receipt and Goods Receipt**
- **Issue**: Payment released (Feb 8, 11:00) **before** invoice received (Feb 9) and goods received (Feb 10)
- **Problem**: Complete circumvention of the 3-way match control
- **Risk**: 
  - Paying without documentation
  - No basis for payment amount
  - Potential fraud or collusion with vendor
  - Cannot verify what was ordered vs. received

#### **Additional Issue: Invoice Matching After All Events**
- Invoice matching occurs (Feb 11) after payment, invoice receipt, and goods receipt
- This is a "reconciliation after the fact" rather than a control
- Defeats the purpose of invoice matching entirely

#### **Severity**: **CRITICAL** - Suggests advance payment without proper documentation, highly irregular and risky.

---

### **Case 1004:  SIGNIFICANT ANOMALY**

#### **Anomaly: Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued**
- **Issue**: Goods received (Feb 6, 09:00) **before** PO issued (Feb 6, 09:15)
- **Problem**: 
  - Receiving goods without a formal PO ("maverick buying")
  - No contractual agreement in place at time of delivery
  - Cannot verify against PO terms since PO doesn't exist yet
- **Risk**: 
  - No agreed pricing or terms
  - Liability issues if goods are defective
  - Budget tracking problems
  - Vendor relationship issues
  - Creates "emergency" retroactive PO culture

#### **Note**: While the rest of the sequence is correct after this point, the foundational control is violated.

#### **Severity**: **HIGH** - Common in emergency situations but represents poor procurement practice and control weakness.

## Summary of Anomalies

| Case ID | Anomaly Type | Severity | Key Issue |
|---------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 1001 | None | - | Compliant process |
| 1002 | Authorization, Payment, Matching | CRITICAL | Systematic control failure - payment before goods/approval |
| 1003 | Payment, 3-Way Match | CRITICAL | Payment before any supporting documentation |
| 1004 | Purchase Order | HIGH | Goods received before PO exists |

## Business Impact

These anomalies could indicate:
- **Fraud or collusion** (Cases 1002, 1003)
- **System bypasses** or manual overrides
- **Emergency procurement** handled improperly (Case 1004)
- **Internal control weaknesses** requiring immediate attention
- **Audit findings** that could result in financial restatements
- **Compliance violations** with SOX, internal policies, or regulatory requirements

**Recommendation**: Cases 1002 and 1003 require immediate investigation for potential fraudulent activity. Case 1004 suggests need for emergency procurement procedures training.
