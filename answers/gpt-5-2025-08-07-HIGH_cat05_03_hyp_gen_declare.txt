Anomalies in the DECLARE model
- C is mandatory while E cannot coexist with C. The combination of “existence(C)” and “noncoexistence(E,C)” makes evaluation impossible in any completed case. This undermines the intended flow where evaluation should occur before closing.
- The rule “responded_existence(E -> A)” is effectively dead/unreachable. Because E is forbidden with C (and C is required), E cannot appear, so the EA constraint is always vacuously satisfied. It also does not ensure the desired order (assignment before evaluation).
- The model allows a direct R  C path. There is no requirement that A, E, P, or N occur at all, enabling closure without assignment, evaluation, approval, or notification.
- Redundancy: “precedence(C,R)” is subsumed by “init(R)”. If every case must start with R, then any C already has R before it; the extra precedence adds no real restriction.
- Over-restrictive coverage: “existence(C)” with perfect support/confidence implicitly excludes open/in-progress claims. If the log contains ongoing cases, this rule is likely incorrect for the broader process.
- Missing key ordering constraints: no guarantee that A occurs before E, E before P, or P before N and C. Rework and out-of-order actions are not prevented.

Plausible hypotheses for why these anomalies exist
- Misinterpretation of business rules (e.g., intending “E before C” but mistakenly encoding a noncoexistence between E and C).
- Incremental policy changes (e.g., introducing fast-track closures) not reflected coherently across all constraints.
- Model learned from a filtered log of only completed cases, leading to an “existence(C)” rule that does not generalize, and poor support for E if evaluation events were under-recorded.
- Event coding or ingestion issues (evaluation recorded under another code, missing in parts of the log).
- Pressure to shorten cycle time, encouraging paths that skip evaluation, approval, or notification.
- Incorrect directionality in templates (using responded_existence EA instead of precedence AE or response AE).

SQL-based investigation strategies

1) Closed claims without evaluation
SQL:
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') = 0;

2) Evaluation and closing coexisting in the same claim (violates noncoexistence E–C)
SQL:
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0;

3) Evaluation without any assignment (violates EA if E occurs)
SQL:
SELECT ce.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') = 0;

4) Evaluation occurring before assignment (tests whether A precedes E in practice)
SQL:
WITH t AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS first_a,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS first_e
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM t
WHERE first_e IS NOT NULL
  AND (first_a IS NULL OR first_e < first_a);

5) First event not R (violates init R)
SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         activity,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp, event_id) AS rn
  FROM claim_events
)
SELECT claim_id, activity AS first_activity
FROM ranked
WHERE rn = 1 AND activity <> 'R';

6) C not preceded by R (violates precedence CR)
SQL:
WITH t AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R') AS first_r,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS first_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM t
WHERE first_c IS NOT NULL AND (first_r IS NULL OR first_r > first_c);

7) Claims missing a close event (tests existence C against the master list of claims)
SQL:
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce
  ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(ce.event_id) = 0;

8) Close without approval
SQL:
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') = 0;

9) Close without notification
SQL:
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') = 0;

10) Minimal path RC with no A/E/P/N (allowed by the model but likely undesired)
SQL:
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity IN ('A','E','P','N')) = 0;

11) Any event after the first close (post-closure activity)
SQL:
WITH fc AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS first_close_ts
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN fc ON fc.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.timestamp > fc.first_close_ts;

12) Evaluations done by unknown (non-adjuster) resources
SQL:
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.event_id, ce.resource
FROM claim_events ce
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE ce.activity = 'E' AND a.adjuster_id IS NULL;

13) Evaluations performed by someone who was not previously assigned on that claim
SQL:
WITH evals AS (
  SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS e_ts, resource AS e_resource
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'E'
),
assigns AS (
  SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS a_ts, resource AS a_resource
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'A'
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.e_ts, e.e_resource
FROM evals e
LEFT JOIN assigns a
  ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
 AND a.a_resource = e.e_resource
 AND a.a_ts <= e.e_ts
WHERE a.claim_id IS NULL;

14) Specialization mismatch for assigned/evaluating adjusters versus claim type (assumes home_insurance  home, auto_insurance  auto)
SQL:
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.resource, a.specialization, c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity IN ('A','E')
  AND (
    (c.claim_type = 'home_insurance' AND a.specialization <> 'home') OR
    (c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' AND a.specialization <> 'auto')
  );

15) Notification before approval (out-of-order check against typical business logic)
SQL:
WITH t AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS t_p,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS t_n
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM t
WHERE t_n IS NOT NULL AND (t_p IS NULL OR t_n < t_p);

How to use the results
- If query 2 returns rows, the noncoexistence E–C constraint does not reflect actual executions.
- If queries 8–10 return many rows, the model’s allowance for skipping A/E/P/N is being used in practice and likely needs tightening.
- If queries 3–4 and 13 return rows, the EA relationship is violated or incorrectly directed; consider enforcing A before E explicitly.
- If query 7 returns rows, the “existence(C)” constraint is too strong for all claims (includes in-progress cases).
