The figure you gave me is actually three coordinated views of the same underlying “proclet”–based model of how a clinical lab visit interacts with a lab-testing process.  Here’s what each panel is showing:

1. Panel (a): Two proclet classes, “Lab visit” on the left and “Lab test” on the right, drawn as little activity-flow diagrams (similar to BPMN) with vertical lifelines for the roles involved.  
   • Left side (“Lab visit” proclet):  
     – A doctor (or lab assistant) does Order entry and Take blood sample.  
     – The lab assistant then “Judges results” when they come back.  
     – If everything’s fine, they Send report and end; if not, they go back and “Do tests again,” Receive updated result, and repeat until they can send a final report.  

   • Right side (“Lab test” proclet):  
     – A chemical analyst receives a Perform test request, Make report, and then “Provide report” back.  
     – If the lab visit proclet asks for a retest, the chemical analyst will “Perform test again” and “Provide updated report.”  
     – Finally the lab test proclet “Finishes” and terminates.  

   • Between them you see three dashed boxes labeled “Order system,” “HIS,” etc., each annotated with multiplicities (1..1, 1..*).  Those are the explicit message channels over which the two proclets exchange information:  
     – The initial test order (Order system channel)  
     – The first result and any updates (HIS channel)  
     – Any re-test requests and further results  

2. Panel (b): A tiny UML-style class diagram showing that:  
   – A Lab visit proclet “requires” exactly one Lab test proclet (1..1)  
   – A Lab test proclet “requires” one or more Lab visit proclets (1..*)  

   In other words, each patient visit triggers exactly one testing subprocess, but a given test subprocess could serve multiple visits over its lifetime (for retests, updates, etc.).

3. Panel (c): A little log or “performative” table showing one concrete message instance being sent at 11:00.  
   – Channel: Order system  
   – Sender: Lab visit – John  
   – Receiver: Lab test – John  
   – Action (speech act): Create  
   – Content: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
   – Scope: Private  
   – Direction: OUT  

   This example shows how an actual message (a request to run a hemoglobin test) is recorded against the abstract channel defined between the two proclets.

Taken together, the three sub-figures show:  
• How the two processes are modeled independently (panel a),  
• How they relate structurally (panel b), and  
• How an individual inter-process message is logged (panel c).
