### Analysis of POWL Models Against Standard Hire-to-Retire Process

The **standard/normative Hire-to-Retire process** follows a largely sequential logic:  
**Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case**.  

Key expected properties:  
- Strict causal precedences (e.g., screening before interviews, interviews before decision).  
- All activities occur **exactly once** (no loops or skips).  
- No activity executes after logically unrelated later steps (e.g., no interviewing or screening after closing).  
- **Hiring assumption**: Post-decision steps (onboard, payroll) imply a positive hiring decision, with no skips.  
- No parallelism that allows absurd orders (e.g., deciding/hiring without prior interviews/screening).  

POWL semantics: Executions are linear extensions of the partial order (all top-level nodes executed exactly once per trace, respecting edges). Operator substructures expand traces accordingly.

#### Anomalies in **Model 1**
This is a pure **StrictPartialOrder** with all 7 activities as atomic nodes (no operators). Key precedences: `Post < Screen < {Interview, Decide} < Onboard < Payroll < Close` (with `Screen < Interview` and `Screen < Decide`).

**Identified anomalies (deviations from normative)**:
1. **Missing precedence Interview  Decide** (moderate severity):  
   - Interview and Decide are incomparable after Screen.  
   - Possible trace: `Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  Interview`.  
   - Violation: Hiring decision (and subsequent onboarding/payroll) *before* interviews. This skips a key gatekeeping step, undermining decision quality but still executes all activities.

2. **Interview executable after Close** (high severity):  
   - No constraints post-Screen on Interview (independent of Decide/Onboard chain).  
   - Absurd trace: `Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close  Interview`.  
   - Violation: Mid-process activity (interviews) after case closure. Fundamentally breaks process integrity—interviews should inform decisions, not trail termination.

**Overall impact**: Model allows ~50% valid traces (e.g., `Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  ...`) but permits illogical orders. All activities mandatory/once (good). Retains core chain (`Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close`) and `Screen  Interview` (aligns well with normative early steps).

#### Anomalies in **Model 2**
Top-level **StrictPartialOrder** on 7 nodes (Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, `loop_onboarding`, `xor_payroll`, Close). Internal operators:  
- `loop_onboarding = (Onboard, skip)`: Always 1 Onboard; visible traces: `Onboard` (1x), `Onboard Onboard` (2x), etc. (skip silent).  
- `xor_payroll = (Payroll, skip)`: Either `Payroll` or nothing (skip silent).  

Key precedences: `Post < Screen`, `Post < Interview < Decide < loop_onboarding < xor_payroll < Close`.

**Identified anomalies (deviations from normative)**:
1. **Screening unrelated to Interview/Decide** (high severity):  
   - Screen only after Post; incomparable to Interview/Decide chain.  
   - Possible traces: `Post  Interview  Decide  ...  Close  Screen` (screening *after* closure); `Post  Interview  Screen  Decide  ...` (interview without prior screening).  
   - Violation: Screening (essential early filter) can occur too late or be skipped logically. Breaks "screen before interview/decide" causality.

2. **Always-onboarding with loops** (high severity):  
   - Onboard mandatory (1x) after Decide, but repeatable.  
   - Traces allow multiple `Onboard_Employee` (e.g., hire same employee 3x?).  
   - Violation: Non-standard repetition; normative expects exactly once post-hire.

3. **Optional Payroll** (critical severity):  
   - XOR allows skipping Payroll entirely after Onboarding.  
   - Trace: `...  Onboard  (skip)  Close` (onboard but no payroll).  
   - Violation: Fundamentally breaks process integrity—onboarding commits to employment, but skipping payroll leaves employee unpaid. Contradicts "hire-to-retire" essence (retire implies prior payroll integration).

4. **Post  Interview without Screen** (moderate severity):  
   - Direct path enables interviews sans screening.  
   - Violation: Bypasses candidate filtering.

**Overall impact**: Fewer valid traces due to loose Screen positioning and operator-induced skips/loops. ~25-50% traces absurd (e.g., late Screen, no Payroll). Operators introduce non-normative control flow (optionality/repetition), allowing incomplete hiring.

### Which Model More Closely Aligns with Normative? **Model 1**
**Justification**:
- **Fewer and less severe anomalies**: Model 1 has *one missing precedence* (Interview  Decide), enabling some illogical orders (e.g., early Decide, late Interview). However, it preserves *more normative causalities* (`Post  Screen  Interview`, `Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close`) and mandates all activities exactly once—no skips/loops. This keeps it closer to sequential normative flow.
- **Model 2's anomalies undermine core integrity more deeply**:
  - Optional Payroll *post-Onboard* creates invalid states (hired but unpaid employee)—a process-breaker vs. Model 1's order-only issues.
  - Loops (multiple Onboard) add non-standard repetition, absent in normative.
  - Unconstrained Screen allows *earlier* activity after Close (like Model 1's Interview issue) *plus* bypassing (interview sans screen), doubling violations.
- **Correctness & Integrity**:
  | Aspect              | Model 1 Impact                  | Model 2 Impact                          |
  |---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
  | **Causal Fidelity** | High (most edges match; 1 missing) | Medium (misses Screen  Interview/Decide) |
  | **Completeness**    | Perfect (all 7x exactly once)   | Broken (Payroll skippable; Onboard 1, repeatable) |
  | **Logical Orders**  | Violated in some traces (late Interview) | Violated worse (late Screen + bypasses) |
  | **Process Essence** | Minor order flaws; hiring intact | Payroll skip breaks "retire" implication |

Model 1 deviates via *flexible ordering* (fixable with 1 edge: Interview  Decide). Model 2 deviates via *structural changes* (operators enabling incompleteness/repetition), making it farther from normative. Model 1 better preserves hiring logic's sequence and totality.
