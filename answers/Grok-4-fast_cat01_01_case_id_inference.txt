### Inferred Case Groupings

Based on the event attributes—particularly patient_age, patient_gender, department, activity sequence, and timestamp progression—I inferred three distinct cases (patient journeys). These are grouped by matching patient demographics across events and ensuring logical workflow order (e.g., registration before triage/consultation, tests before diagnosis, procedures before discharge). No events overlap patients, and timestamps increase monotonically within each case.

| Case ID | Patient Demographics | Events | Summary of Journey |
|---------|----------------------|--------|--------------------|
| Case 1 | Age: 45, Gender: M | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 | ER visit for leg injury: Registration → Triage (code 3) → X-ray (left leg) → Consultation (hairline fracture) → Discharge (outpatient follow-up). |
| Case 2 | Age: 62, Gender: F | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 | ER visit for infection: Registration → Triage (code 2) → Lab request (blood panel) → Lab completion (normal) → Consultation (minor infection) → Prescription (antibiotics) → Discharge (pharmacy follow-up). |
| Case 3 | Age: 28, Gender: M | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 | Scheduled surgery: Registration (Surgery dept.) → Consultation (knee surgery) → Preparation (anesthesia) → Surgery (arthroscopy) → Recovery (stable) → Discharge (physiotherapy).
