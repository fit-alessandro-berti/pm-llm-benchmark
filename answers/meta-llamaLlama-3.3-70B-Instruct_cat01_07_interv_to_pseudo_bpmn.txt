### BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

#### Activities/Tasks:
1. **Invoice Receipt**: Receive invoice via email.
2. **PO Validation**: Check if the invoice has a valid purchase order (PO) number.
3. **Invoice Logging**: Log the invoice into the accounting system.
4. **Purchasing Confirmation**: Confirm with the purchasing department that the goods or services were received.
5. **Invoice Matching**: Match the invoice line items against the PO in the system.
6. **Discrepancy Resolution**: Resolve any discrepancies found during the matching process.
7. **Manager Approval**: Obtain approval from the department manager.
8. **Payment Scheduling**: Schedule the invoice for payment.
9. **Exception Handling**: Handle exceptions, such as missing PO numbers, pricing discrepancies, or informal service contracts.

#### Sequence Flow:
1. The process starts with **Invoice Receipt**.
2. After receiving the invoice, proceed to **PO Validation**.
3. If the PO is valid, then **Invoice Logging** is performed, followed by **Purchasing Confirmation**.
4. After confirmation from purchasing, **Invoice Matching** is conducted.
5. If everything matches, the process moves to **Manager Approval**.
6. Upon approval, the invoice is **Scheduled for Payment**.
7. At any point where discrepancies are found (e.g., during **PO Validation**, **Purchasing Confirmation**, or **Invoice Matching**), **Discrepancy Resolution** is initiated, which may involve **Exception Handling**.

#### Gateways/Decision Points:
1. **PO Check**: If the invoice lacks a PO number, it is sent back to the supplier.
2. **Matching Check**: If the invoice does not match the PO, discrepancies are resolved through **Discrepancy Resolution**.
3. **Approval Check**: The manager may approve or reject the invoice based on review.

#### Roles/Participants:
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Responsible for initial processing, logging, and forwarding invoices.
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Verifies receipt of goods/services and checks invoice details against POs.
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Provides final approval for invoices.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles exceptions and resolves discrepancies.
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Assists in resolving issues related to supplier invoices.

#### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
1. **Invoice**: The document received from suppliers.
2. **Purchase Order (PO)**: Used for validation and matching.
3. **Confirmation Email**: Sent by the purchasing department to confirm receipt of goods/services.
4. **Approval Notification**: System-generated notification for manager approval.

#### Exceptions/Variations:
1. **Missing PO Number**: Invoices without a PO number are sent back to suppliers.
2. **Discrepancies**: Pricing or quantity discrepancies trigger **Discrepancy Resolution**.
3. **Informal Service Contracts**: May require retrospective PO creation or rejection of the invoice.
4. **Escalation**: Unresolvable discrepancies or issues are escalated to the supervisor for handling.

This model captures the core activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, and exceptions involved in the invoice approval process, as described by the various stakeholders. It provides a comprehensive view of how invoices are processed, from receipt to payment, including the handling of discrepancies and exceptions.
