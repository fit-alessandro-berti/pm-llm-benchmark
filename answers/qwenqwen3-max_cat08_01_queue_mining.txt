**Comprehensive Process Mining–Driven Approach to Reduce Patient Waiting Times in a Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic**

---

### **1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

**Defining Waiting Time:**  
In this context, *waiting time* (or *queue time*) is the duration between the **completion of one activity** and the **start of the next activity** in a patient’s care pathway. For example, if a patient completes *Registration* at 09:08:45 and begins *Nurse Assessment* at 09:15:20, their waiting time is 6 minutes and 35 seconds. This reflects idle time where the patient is ready for the next step but is delayed—typically due to resource unavailability, scheduling misalignment, or process inefficiencies.

**Calculating Waiting Times from Event Logs:**  
Given that the log includes both *START* and *COMPLETE* timestamps for each activity per case (visit), we can:
- Sort events per Case ID by timestamp.
- For each consecutive pair of activities (e.g., Activity A  Activity B), compute:  
  **Wait Time = START(B) – COMPLETE(A)**  
  If this value is negative or zero (e.g., overlapping activities), it indicates parallel processing or data anomalies and should be investigated or set to zero.

**Key Queue Metrics to Calculate:**
- **Average Waiting Time**: Mean wait across all cases for a given queue (e.g., post-registration wait).
- **Median Waiting Time**: More robust to outliers than the mean.
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Captures the experience of the “long-tail” patients—critical for satisfaction.
- **Maximum Waiting Time**: Identifies worst-case scenarios.
- **Queue Frequency**: % of cases that experience a wait > 0 for a given transition.
- **Excessive Wait Incidence**: % of cases with wait times exceeding a clinic-defined threshold (e.g., >15 minutes).
- **Patient-Segmented Metrics**: Stratify by *Patient Type* (New vs. Follow-up) and *Urgency* (Normal vs. Urgent) to detect disparities.

**Identifying Critical Queues:**  
Prioritization should be based on a **multi-criteria scoring system**:
1. **Impact**: High average or 90th percentile wait times.
2. **Volume**: High frequency (e.g., >80% of patients experience this wait).
3. **Sensitivity**: Affects high-priority groups (e.g., urgent patients or new patients whose first impression shapes satisfaction).
4. **Downstream Ripple Effect**: Delays here cascade (e.g., late start to doctor consultation delays diagnostics and check-out).

For instance, if the queue *after Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation* shows a 90th percentile wait of 45 minutes affecting 90% of new patients, it would rank higher than a short but infrequent wait before check-out.

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**

Beyond identifying *where* queues occur, process mining enables deep diagnosis of *why* they occur:

**Potential Root Causes:**
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Limited doctors in high-demand specialties (e.g., Cardiology), underutilized rooms, or insufficient nursing staff during peak hours.
- **Activity Dependencies**: Sequential workflows where diagnostics (e.g., ECG) cannot start until doctor consultation ends—even when equipment is idle.
- **High Variability in Service Times**: Doctor consultations vary widely (e.g., 10–40 minutes), causing downstream unpredictability.
- **Appointment Scheduling Gaps**: Fixed 30-minute slots may not align with actual service durations, leading to overbooking or idle time.
- **Arrival Clustering**: Patients scheduled at the top of the hour create registration bottlenecks.
- **Patient-Type Disparities**: New patients require longer registration and assessment, but are scheduled identically to follow-ups.

**Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Detection:**
- **Resource Analysis**: Use the *Resource* field to compute utilization rates (busy time / total time). Low utilization with long queues suggests poor scheduling or handoff delays; high utilization suggests true capacity constraints.
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Apply the *“WIP (Work-in-Progress) Curve”* or *“Queue Length Over Time”* to pinpoint stages where cases accumulate.
- **Variant Analysis**: Cluster frequent patient pathways (e.g., “New  Registration  Nurse  Cardiologist  ECG  Check-out”). Compare performance metrics across variants to isolate problematic flows.
- **Duration Analysis**: Analyze service time distributions per activity/resource. High variance in doctor consultation times may explain erratic downstream waits.
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual flows against an ideal reference model to detect deviations (e.g., unnecessary rework or skipped triage) that create delays.

For example, if *Dr. Smith* consistently has long post-consultation queues but high utilization, the issue is capacity. If *Dr. Lee* has similar queues but low utilization, the cause may be poor coordination with diagnostics.

### **3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Appointment Scheduling Based on Historical Service Times**  
- **Target Queue**: Wait between Registration/Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation.  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Mismatch between fixed appointment slots and actual consultation durations.  
- **Data Support**: Analyze historical *Doctor Consultation* durations by specialty and provider. Use this to assign variable slot lengths (e.g., 25 min for follow-ups, 40 min for new Cardiology patients).  
- **Expected Impact**: Reduces overbooking and idle gaps. Pilot simulations show 20–30% reduction in pre-consultation wait times and 15% increase in on-time starts.

**Strategy 2: Parallel Pre-Consultation Workflows for Diagnostics**  
- **Target Queue**: Wait between Doctor Consultation and Diagnostic Tests (e.g., ECG, Blood Draw).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Sequential dependency where diagnostics only start after consultation.  
- **Data Support**: Variant analysis shows that 60% of Cardiology patients require ECG. If ECG rooms are idle during morning hours (per resource utilization logs), pre-schedule diagnostics for likely-needed tests based on referral reason or patient history.  
- **Expected Impact**: Eliminates 10–20 minutes of post-consultation waiting. Requires minor EHR integration to flag “probable diagnostics” at scheduling.

**Strategy 3: Tiered Registration and Triage by Patient Type**  
- **Target Queue**: Initial wait for Registration and Nurse Assessment.  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: New and follow-up patients follow identical paths despite differing needs.  
- **Data Support**: New patients take 2× longer in registration and nurse assessment. Separate fast-track lanes for follow-ups (e.g., digital check-in kiosks + brief nurse review) and dedicated staff for new patients.  
- **Expected Impact**: Reduces average registration-to-nurse wait by 40% for follow-ups and improves new patient experience through dedicated support. No new hires needed—reallocate existing staff based on daily appointment mix.

### **4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

Each strategy involves trade-offs that must be managed:

- **Dynamic Scheduling**: May reduce provider flexibility and require EHR configuration. Risk of underutilization if predictions are inaccurate. Mitigation: Start with high-volume specialties and use rolling averages updated weekly.
- **Parallel Diagnostics**: Could lead to unnecessary tests if prediction is wrong. Mitigation: Limit to high-probability scenarios (>80% historical co-occurrence) and allow easy cancellation.
- **Tiered Triage**: Requires staff retraining and space reconfiguration. Risk of perceived inequity. Mitigation: Communicate benefits clearly; ensure urgent cases bypass queues regardless of type.

**Balancing Objectives:**  
- **Cost vs. Wait Time**: All proposed strategies use existing resources more efficiently—no major capital expenditure. Staff reallocation is low-cost.
- **Speed vs. Quality**: Parallel diagnostics and fast-track registration are designed to *enhance* quality by reducing fatigue and enabling focused care. Clinical protocols remain unchanged.
- **Equity**: Urgent patients should always be prioritized via real-time override in scheduling systems, validated through urgency-stratified KPIs.

The guiding principle: **optimize flow without compromising safety or thoroughness**. Use data to ensure changes benefit the majority without harming vulnerable subgroups.

### **5. Measuring Success**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **Average Total Visit Duration** (Registration start  Check-out complete).
2. **Average & 90th Percentile Waiting Time per Critical Queue** (e.g., post-nurse, pre-doctor).
3. **% of Patients with Total Wait Time > 30 Minutes**.
4. **On-Time Start Rate for Doctor Consultations**.
5. **Patient Satisfaction Scores** (linked to visit IDs if available).
6. **Resource Utilization Stability** (avoid creating new bottlenecks).

**Ongoing Monitoring via Process Mining:**
- Continue collecting event logs with the same schema.
- Implement **real-time dashboards** showing queue lengths and wait times by hour, provider, and patient type.
- Conduct **monthly conformance and bottleneck analyses** to detect emerging issues.
- Use **A/B testing**: Roll out changes in one department first (e.g., Cardiology) and compare KPIs against a control (e.g., Dermatology) before full deployment.
- Establish **feedback loops**: If a new bottleneck appears (e.g., at check-out due to faster upstream flow), trigger root cause analysis immediately.

By embedding process mining into operational governance, the clinic can shift from reactive complaint handling to proactive, data-driven flow management—sustaining improvements and continuously adapting to changing demand patterns.
