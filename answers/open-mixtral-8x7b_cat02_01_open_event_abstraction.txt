Event abstraction is a powerful concept that can be used to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. The main idea behind event abstraction is to group similar events or activities together and represent them as a single, higher-level event. This can help to simplify complex process models and make them easier to understand and analyze.

Here are some ways that event abstraction can be effectively utilized in the context of process modeling:

1. Identify and group similar events: The first step in event abstraction is to identify events or activities that are similar in nature and can be grouped together. For example, in a hospital setting, events such as "patient registration," "patient admission," and "patient check-in" could all be grouped together as a single event called "patient intake."
2. Define higher-level events: Once similar events have been identified, they can be abstracted into higher-level events that represent the group. These higher-level events should be named in a way that clearly conveys their meaning and purpose. For example, the higher-level event "patient intake" could be defined as the process of registering, admitting, and checking in a patient.
3. Use abstraction to simplify complex models: Event abstraction can be used to simplify complex process models by replacing detailed, low-level events with higher-level events. This can help to reduce the number of nodes and edges in the model, making it easier to understand and analyze.
4. Maintain traceability: When using event abstraction, it is important to maintain traceability between the high-level events and the low-level events that they represent. This can be done by creating links or relationships between the events, or by including metadata or annotations that describe the underlying events.
5. Consider the audience: Event abstraction should be used judiciously, taking into account the audience and the purpose of the process model. In some cases, it may be necessary to include detailed, low-level events in order to provide a complete and accurate representation of the process. However, in other cases, event abstraction may be appropriate in order to simplify the model and make it more accessible to a wider audience.

Overall, event abstraction is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. By identifying and grouping similar events, defining higher-level events, simplifying complex models, maintaining traceability, and considering the audience, process modelers can effectively utilize event abstraction to create clear, concise, and informative process models.
