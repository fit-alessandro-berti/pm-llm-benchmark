Here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions to deepen your understanding of the property onboarding process:

### **1. Documentation and Initial Review**
- How do you determine which documents are required for a property to be considered "complete" for onboarding? Are there regional variations in these requirements?
- What happens if a landlord is unable to provide certain documents (e.g., outdated inspection reports)? How do you handle delays in document submission?

### **2. Property Manager Assignment**
- What criteria are most important when assigning a property manager (e.g., workload, specialization, landlord preferences)? How do you balance these factors?
- If a property manager is unavailable or overloaded, how do you escalate or reassign the property?

### **3. Landlord-Property Manager Alignment**
- What are the most common points of misalignment between landlords and property managers during the introductory meeting? How do you resolve them?
- Are there standard policies (e.g., pet rules, maintenance responsibilities) that the company enforces, or are these fully customizable per landlord?

### **4. Property Inspection and Repairs**
- How do you prioritize inspection findings? For example, do you differentiate between minor cosmetic issues and major safety concerns?
- If a landlord refuses to address inspection issues, what steps do you take? Are there cases where you decline to onboard the property?

### **5. Marketing and Pricing**
- How do you determine the rental price range for a new property? Is this based on market data, landlord input, or internal pricing models?
- What happens if the property doesn’t attract tenants at the initial price? How do you adjust marketing or pricing strategies?

### **6. Tenant Screening and Selection**
- What are the key criteria for tenant approval (e.g., credit score, income level, references)? Are there any exceptions to these rules?
- How do you handle situations where multiple tenants apply for the same property? Do you use a first-come-first-served approach, or are there other decision factors?

### **7. Lease Finalization and Move-In**
- What are the most common custom lease clauses requested by landlords, and how do you evaluate their acceptability?
- How do you ensure compliance with fair housing laws during lease negotiations? Are there any automated checks in place?

### **8. Quality Checks and Audits**
- Who conducts the final compliance and financial reviews before a property is fully onboarded? What are the most frequent issues they catch?
- How do you track and resolve discrepancies found during audits (e.g., incorrect data in the system, missing documents)?

### **9. Communication and Workflow**
- How do you manage communication between landlords, property managers, and internal teams? Are there any bottlenecks in this process?
- What tools or systems do you use to track the onboarding progress, and how do you ensure accountability at each step?

### **10. Exceptions and Edge Cases**
- Can you describe a recent example where a property required special handling (e.g., unique insurance, custom lease terms)? How was it resolved?
- How do you handle properties that don’t fit your standard onboarding process (e.g., short-term rentals, commercial properties)?

These questions should help uncover nuances, decision-making logic, and potential pain points in the process while keeping the discussion focused on conceptual understanding rather than technical implementation.
