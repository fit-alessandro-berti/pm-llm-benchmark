This is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** diagram showing the workflow for dispatching goods from a computer hardware shop. The process is organized into three swimlanes representing different departments:

## Swimlanes (Departments)

### 1. **Logistics**
- Handles the **"Insure parcel"** task when insurance is required

### 2. **Secretary**
- **Checks if insurance is required** (using customer information and order details)
- **Writes package label** (always performed)
- **Clarifies shipment method**
- At the decision point "Special handling?":
  - **No**: Proceeds directly to warehouse
  - **Yes**: Gets 3 offers from logistic companies  Selects logistic company and places order

### 3. **Warehouse**
- **Packages goods** (with a 48-hour timer)
- If delay occurs: **Notifies customer about delay**
- **Fills out shipment paperwork**
- **Moves package to pickup area**
- Process ends with **"Shipment prepared"**

## Key Process Elements
- **Start event**: "Ship goods"
- **End event**: "Shipment prepared"
- **Parallel gateways** (+): Tasks running simultaneously
- **Exclusive gateways** (X): Decision points
