The picture is a BPMN 2.0 (process-flow) diagram that shows how a computer-hardware shop prepares a parcel for shipment.  
The drawing is organised as one pool that contains three horizontal lanes, so you can immediately see which organisational unit performs each activity:

1. Logistics (top lane)  
2. Dispatch of goods / Computer-hardware-shop secretary (middle lane)  
3. Warehouse (bottom lane)

High-level storyline

• The process begins when the secretary receives the trigger “Ship goods” (blank start event, left-hand side, middle lane).  
• Two work strands start in parallel:

  – Administrative work handled by the secretary (middle lane) and, if required, Logistics (top lane).  
  – Physical packing work in the Warehouse (bottom lane).

• When both strands are finished they are synchronised, the shipment paper work is completed, the parcel is moved to the pickup area, and the process ends with the “Shipment prepared” end event (right-hand side, bottom lane).

Step-by-step flow

1. Ship goods – start event in the secretary lane.  
2. Parallel gateway ( symbol).  
   • Top branch  administrative path (continues with “Clarify shipment method”).  
   • Bottom branch  warehouse path (goes straight to “Package goods”).

Administrative path (secretary, possibly logistics)
---------------------------------------------------
3. Clarify shipment method – the secretary checks the order details (data object attached).  
4. Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
   a) No special handling  
      – “Check if insurance is required” (accesses the Customer-information data store).  
      – Exclusive gateway “If insurance necessary”  
        • Yes  Logistics lane: “Insure parcel” then back to secretary lane.  
        • No   continue.  
   b) Yes, special handling  
      – “Get three offers from logistic companies”.  
      – “Select logistic company and place order”.  
      – Flow rejoins the main track.

5. “Write package label” (this happens in any case – note the little gateway marked “always” just before it).

Warehouse path
--------------  
6. “Package goods”.  
   • Boundary timer event (48 h) is attached. If the packing takes longer than 48 hours, the timer raises an exception that triggers “Notify customer about delay”. After the notification the flow joins the normal path again.

Synchronisation and completion
------------------------------  
7. Parallel gateway () waits until …  
   • the labelled package (administrative strand) AND  
   • the packed parcel (warehouse strand)  
   have both arrived.

8. “Fill out shipment paperwork” – secretary.  
9. “Move package to pickup area” – warehouse.  
10. End event “Shipment prepared”.

Notational elements you can see

• Start / end events (circles).  
• Parallel gateways (diamond with “+”).  
• Exclusive gateways (diamond with “×”).  
• Tasks / activities (rounded rectangles).  
• Boundary timer event (clock icon on the edge of “Package goods”).  
• Data object (“Order details”) and data store (“Customer information”) linked with dashed data-association arrows.  
• Sequence flows (solid arrows) and conditional sequence flows labelled “yes”, “no”, “always”, etc.

In short, the diagram visualises how clerical work (choosing shipping options, creating labels, insurance, paperwork) and physical work (packing the goods) are carried out concurrently, how exceptional delays are handled, and how the two streams are synchronised before the shipment is declared ready for pickup.
