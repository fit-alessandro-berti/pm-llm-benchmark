Reasoning for decisions:

1. Timestamp alignment: I used a 2-second tolerance for matching events. For matched events, I kept the earlier timestamp.

2. Event naming: I used Log A's event names as primary, but included Log B's names when different.

3. Attribute merging: For matched events, I combined attributes from both logs, prioritizing Log B's richer information.

4. Unmatched events: I included events that appeared in only one log (e.g., Quality Check from Log B, Item Delivered from Log A).

5. Chronological order: The final log is ordered by timestamp, using Log B's more precise timestamps when available.

This merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, combining the strengths of both logging systems while maintaining chronological accuracy and event details.
