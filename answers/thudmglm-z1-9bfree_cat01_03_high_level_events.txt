**Structured Grouping of Low-Level Events into High-Level Process Steps**

1. **Material Preparation**  
   - **Low-Level Events Included**:  
     `Retrieve raw metal sheet`, `Scan barcode`, `Place metal sheet on table`, `Align metal sheet`, `Preheat metal sheet`.  
   - **Rationale**:  
     - All steps focus on preparing the raw material for welding. Scanning the barcode ensures correct part identification, while alignment and preheating (by robot or unit) are critical for welding precision.  
     - Temporal proximity: Events occur sequentially at the start of each case (0:00:05–0:20).  
   - **High-Level Name**: "Material Preparation".  

2. **Welding and In-Process Quality Control**  
   - **Low-Level Events Included**:  
     `Pick up welding tool`, `Weld corner A`, `Weld corner B`, `Measure weld integrity`.  
   - **Rationale**:  
     - Welding and immediate integrity checks (by sensor) form a discrete phase, ensuring critical assembly integrity before post-processing.  
     - Shared workflow:Operator B performs the welding operations, and the quality sensor is activated post-weld for automated validation.  
     - Temporal grouping: Events occur at the same resource (Operator B) and sequentially (0:01:00–0:22).  
   - **High-Level Name**: "Welding and In-Process Quality Control".  

3. **Coating Application and Final Inspection**  
   - **Low-Level Events Included**:  
     `Apply protective coating`, `Dry coating`, `Visual check`.  
   - **Rationale**:  
     - Coating and drying are post-assembly steps to protect against environmental damage, beggingneighbors the visual check ensures finalized product quality.  
     - Distinct resources: Operator C and Coating Unit interact sequentially to complete protection.  
     - Temporal grouping: Events occur post-weld (0:01:30–0:02:00).  
   - **High-Level Name**: "Coating Application and Final Inspection".

**Key Patterns for Scoping**:  
- **Temporal Proximity**: Events clustered in Ihresneighborhoods of time (e.g., welding + integrity checks within 20 seconds).  
- **Resource Commonality**: Same operator/machine handling a repeated task (e.g., Operator B welding corners).  
- **Logical Flow**: Steps following a clear process chain (preparatory  assembly  finishing).  
- **Quality Touchpoints**: and operator checks embedded in critical phases (e.g., post-weld integrity, pre-last inspection).  

This approach ensures traceability between low-level actions and high-level process nodes, enabling visibility into stage-specific metrics (e.g., coating thickness, weld success rates) and deviations (e.g., failed integrity scores triggering rework).
