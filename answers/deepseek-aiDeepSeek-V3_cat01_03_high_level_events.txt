### Structured Representation of High-Level Activities

Based on the provided event log, I have grouped the low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps. Below is the structured representation of these high-level activities, along with the rationale for each grouping and the proposed names.

---

#### **1. Material Preparation**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events are temporally close and logically represent the initial setup and preparation of the raw material for further processing. They involve retrieving the material, verifying it (scanning barcode), positioning it (placing and aligning), and preparing it for the next stage (preheating).

**Proposed Name:**  
**Material Preparation**

---

#### **2. Assembly**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These events involve the actual assembly of the product, specifically welding the metal sheet. They are performed by the same resource (Operator B) and logically follow the material preparation phase. The sequence of picking up the tool and performing the welts indicates a coherent assembly step.

**Proposed Name:**  
**Assembly**

---

#### **3. Quality Inspection**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
These events are focused on verifying the quality of the assembled product. They involve both automated measurements (weld integrity) and manual checks (visual inspection). They occur after the assembly phase and ensure the product meets quality standards.

**Proposed Name:**  
**Quality Inspection**

---

#### **4. Coating Application**
**Low-Level Events Included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These events represent the application and curing of a protective coating on the product. They are performed by specialized units (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2) and logically follow the quality inspection phase. The sequence of applying and drying the coating indicates a distinct finishing step.

**Proposed Name:**  
**Coating Application**

### Benefits of This Aggregation
- **Simplified Workflow:** The high-level steps provide a clear, concise overview of the manufacturing process.  
- **Improved Analysis:** It becomes easier to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or quality issues at specific stages.  
- **Better Communication:** Stakeholders can quickly understand the process without delving into granular details.  

This structured approach transforms the low-level event log into a meaningful representation of the manufacturing workflow.
