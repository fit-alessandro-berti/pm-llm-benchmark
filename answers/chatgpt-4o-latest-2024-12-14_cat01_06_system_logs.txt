To transform the provided Windows activity system log into a process mining event log, I have structured the raw log data into meaningful cases, activities, and attributes. Here is the resulting event log followed by an explanation of the transformation logic.

### **Explanation of Logic**

#### **Case Identification**
1. **Case Boundaries:** Cases were defined based on document or window focus shifts, indicating a change in the user's task or activity focus. For example:
   - Activities related to `Document1.docx` were grouped under Case_2.
   - Activities involving `Email - Inbox` were grouped under Case_3.
   - Temporal gaps or explicit application/window switches (e.g., `SWITCH` actions) were used to define boundaries.

2. **Applications as Context:** Applications were used to identify logical tasks. For instance, editing `Budget_2024.xlsx` in Excel is a separate case (Case_5) from drafting a Word document.

#### **Activity Naming**
- Low-level actions like `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, and `SWITCH` were translated into higher-level activities reflecting user intent:
  - `FOCUS` + Document: "Open [Document Name]."
  - `TYPING`: Translated based on context into meaningful phrases like "Draft Intro Paragraph" or "Confirm Meeting Details."
  - `SAVE`: Standardized as "Save [Document Type]."
  - `SWITCH`: Interpreted as task transitions, such as "Switch to Email."

#### **Event Attributes**
- **Case ID:** Represents the logical group of events related to a specific work unit.
- **Activity Name:** Reflects meaningful user actions inferred from the raw events.
- **Timestamp:** Directly taken from the original log.
- **Application and Document/Window:** Preserved for context in analysis.

#### **Outcome**
The transformed log creates a coherent narrative, where each case represents a distinct work session or task. This format is now suitable for process mining tools, enabling analyses like flow discovery, conformance checking, and performance metrics.
