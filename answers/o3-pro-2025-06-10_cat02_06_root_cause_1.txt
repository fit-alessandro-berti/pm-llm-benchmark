1. Cases with Clearly Longer Cycle-times  
   • Average “fast track” resolution (Cases 101 & 103):  1.8 h from Receive to Close.  
   • Slow cases:  
     – Case 10225 h 10 m (14× the average)  
     – Case 10424 h 10 m (13×)  
     – Case 10549 h 05 m (28×)

2. What is driving the delay?  
   A. Escalations to Level-2  
      • Both 102 and 105 contain the activity “Escalate to Level-2 Agent”.  
      • In each, the first Level-2 activity (“Investigate Issue”) did not start until several hours, or an entire day, after the escalation was recorded.  
        – Case 102: 11:30  14:00(2 h 30 m) wait.  
        – Case 105: 10:00  next-day 14:00(28 h 00 m) wait – the single largest gap in the log.  
      • After Level-2 investigation, another long pause precedes resolution (19 h in both 102 & 105).  
       Bottleneck: Level-2 queue / resource availability.

   B. Long idle time before a first investigation (no escalation)  
      • Case 104 has no escalation, yet still lasts >24 h.  
        – Assign 09:30  Investigate 13:00(3 h 30 m)  
        – Investigate 13:00  Resolve next-day 08:00(19 h 00 m)  
      • Indicates Level-1 agents also park tickets (possibly end-of-shift, need customer reply, or priority mis-classification).

   C. Tickets received early in the morning are still open overnight  
      • All long cases hit an overnight boundary.  
      • Once a ticket is still open after 14:00 it appears to be carried to the next day (no evening or night work is logged).  
       Lack of late-shift coverage or policy to finish work same-day.

3. Why these factors prolong the cycle  
   • Each unworked period adds straight calendar time visible to the customer, even if actual touch time is low.  
   • Escalations introduce an extra queue; if the specialized team is small or works different hours, the queue grows rapidly.  
   • Delays before the very first investigation push the ticket past normal working hours, effectively adding a full day.

4. Recommendations / Insights  
   1. Escalation management  
      – Introduce an SLA for Level-2 acceptance (e.g., <1 h).  
      – Auto-alert Level-2 lead if no “Investigate Issue” is started within the SLA.  
      – Cross-train more Level-1 agents for common Level-2 issues; pre-classify at triage so that escalations happen immediately, not after a first investigation attempt.

   2. Work-day boundary mitigation  
      – Add an evening “sweep” shift (even part-time) responsible for finishing open investigations and drafting resolutions so tickets are not stuck overnight.  
      – Or set an internal cut-off time: any ticket not yet in “Investigate Issue” by 12:00 gets priority handling.

   3. Queue transparency & load balancing  
      – Dashboards showing current ticket age by status (Assign, Escalated, Investigate) let supervisors redistribute work before idle time grows.  
      – Implement “pull” rather than “push” assignment, letting idle agents take oldest tickets in the queue.

   4. Process trim  
      – If investigation frequently uncovers the need for escalation, allow triage to escalate directly, skipping Level-1 assignment.  
      – Capture a short cause code when closing; after a few weeks you will know which topics almost always require Level-2, and can route them immediately.

   5. Continuous monitoring  
      – Keep mining the event log weekly; plot distribution of idle times between every pair of activities.  
      – Focus improvement efforts where the 90th percentile is far above the median (today: AssignInvestigate and EscalateInvestigate).

By tightening the Level-2 hand-off, ensuring tickets enter investigation earlier in the day, and adding visibility into idle queues, the organisation should be able to bring the outlier cases down toward the 1-to-2-hour benchmark already achieved in Cases 101 and 103.
