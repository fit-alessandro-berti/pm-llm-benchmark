Here’s the inferred case grouping (three distinct patient journeys), based on consistent patient attributes (age, gender), department flow, and plausible clinical sequence:

Case A – ER patient, 45-year-old male (insurance=private)
- 1: 08:05:13 Register patient (ER)
- 4: 08:10:50 Initial triage (ER)
- 7: 08:15:42 X-ray imaging (Radiology) – typical post-triage imaging for ER case
- 12: 08:23:10 Doctor consultation (ER) – diagnosis=hairline_fracture
- 15: 08:30:05 Patient discharged (ER)

Case B – ER patient, 62-year-old female (insurance=public)
- 2: 08:07:02 Register patient (ER)
- 5: 08:12:29 Initial triage (ER)
- 8: 08:16:10 Lab test requested (ER)
- 10: 08:20:27 Lab test completed (Laboratory)
- 11: 08:22:54 Doctor consultation (ER) – diagnosis=minor_infection
- 14: 08:27:00 Prescription created (ER) – antibiotics
- 17: 08:35:29 Patient discharged (ER)

Case C – Surgery pathway, 28-year-old male (insurance=private)
- 3: 08:07:15 Register patient (Surgery)
- 6: 08:13:00 Doctor consultation (Surgery) – scheduled knee surgery
- 9: 08:16:45 Surgery preparation (Surgery)
- 13: 08:25:19 Surgery performed (Surgery) – arthroscopy
- 16: 08:31:37 Recovery room (Surgery)
- 18: 08:40:13 Patient discharged (Surgery)

Rationale:
- Each case maintains consistent patient_age and patient_gender across events.
- Departmental and clinical sequences are coherent: ER cases show registration  triage  diagnostics/labs  consultation  prescription/discharge; the Surgical case shows registration  consult  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge.
- Cross-department steps (Radiology for Case A, Laboratory for Case B) align with typical ER workflows.
- Timing within each case is chronological and plausible without overlaps that would imply multiple patients with identical demographics.
