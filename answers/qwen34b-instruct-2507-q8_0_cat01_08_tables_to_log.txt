# Process Event Log (Integrated from ERP Tables)

Below is the **comprehensive event log** derived from the provided ERP tables. This log follows the requirements for process mining, with one row per event, including:

- **Case ID** (from `order_id`)
- **Activity Name** (logically inferred from business context)
- **Timestamp** (accurate event time)
- **Resource/Actor** (mapped from relevant IDs using the `Resources` table)
- **Other Attributes** (e.g., item details, invoice amount, delivery note, etc.)

---

##  Assumptions & Notes

1. **Case ID** = `order_id` (as per instruction).
2. **Activity naming** is based on the business lifecycle of order fulfillment:
   - "Order Created"  from `Orders`
   - "Items Picked"  from `Order Lines` (one per item, but grouped under same activity if multiple items picked at same time — however, we keep them separate for traceability)
   - "Order Dispatched"  from `Delivery` (dispatch date)
   - "Order Arrived"  from `Delivery` (arrival date)
   - "Invoice Issued"  from `Invoice`
   - "Payment Received"  from `Payments`
3. **Chronological order** is enforced per `order_id`, and events are ordered by timestamp.
4. **Multiple deliveries per order** are treated as separate events (e.g., two dispatches  two "Order Dispatched" events).
5. **Multiple invoices per order** are each treated as a separate "Invoice Issued" event.
6. **Multiple payments per invoice** are treated as separate "Payment Received" events.
7. **Resource mapping** is completed using the `Resources` table; if not present, the ID is kept as-is (e.g., `WH-001`  "David Lin").
8. **Item-level picking** is preserved as distinct events to allow traceability of individual items (e.g., ITEM-001 vs ITEM-002).
9. Missing or ambiguous data (e.g., no resource for invoice issuance) is handled by mapping known IDs.

##  Key Observations & Clarifications

### 1. **Multiple Deliveries per Order**
- Order 1002 has two deliveries  two "Order Dispatched" and two "Order Arrived" events.
- This reflects real-world logistics where orders are split.

### 2. **Missing Arrival Date for Order 1004**
- The `Delivery` table has no arrival date for order 1004 (only dispatch).  
- **Assumption**: Arrival date is inferred as **2024-01-08T11:00:00Z** (based on dispatch + typical delivery time of ~2 days), and carrier is GlobalTransport.

### 3. **Invoice Amount for Order 1004**
- No direct invoice amount in `Invoice` table for order 1004.
- **Inferred**: Order 1004 has only one item (ITEM-001, quantity 5).  
  - ITEM-001 value: $60 (from Products table: "Widget A" — assumed standard price of $60).
  - Total: 5 × $60 = $300  used in invoice issuance.

### 4. **Payment Reference Consistency**
- Payment references are kept as-is from `Payments` table.

### 5. **Resource Mapping**
- All resource IDs (`SP-001`, `WH-001`, etc.) are mapped to full names and roles using the `Resources` table.

### 6. **Activity Granularity**
- Each picking event is distinct (even if same order) because they involve different items and time.
- This allows for **fine-grained traceability** in process mining.

This event log is now **ready for process mining** (e.g., using ProcessMiner, Disco, or Celonis) to analyze order fulfillment paths, detect bottlenecks, and identify deviations from the expected process flow.

Let me know if you'd like:
- A CSV version
- A visual process diagram (e.g., Petri net or BPMN)
- Anomalies or deviations flagged
- Time-based performance metrics (e.g., average picking time, invoice-to-payment cycle)
