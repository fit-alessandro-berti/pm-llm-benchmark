**BPMN-like Textual Process Model:**

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

---

**Start Event:**

---

**Activities/Tasks:**

1. **Check for PO Number** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Verify if the invoice is associated with a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - **Outcome:**
     - If no PO, go to "Send Back to Supplier" task.
     - If PO exists, proceed to "Log Invoice" task.

2. **Send Back to Supplier** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Email the supplier requesting the missing PO or additional details.
   - **Outcome:** Process waits for supplier response.

3. **Log Invoice** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Enter invoice details into the accounting system.

4. **Confirm Goods/Services Received** (Purchasing Officer - Dan)
   - **Description:** Verify if the goods or services listed on the invoice have been received.
   - **Outcome:**
     - If not received, hold the invoice for clarification.
     - If received, proceed to "Match Invoice to PO".

5. **Match Invoice to PO** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Compare invoice line items against the PO for discrepancies.
   - **Outcome:**
     - If no discrepancy, go to "Send for Manager Approval".
     - If discrepancy, go to "Clarify Discrepancy".

6. **Clarify Discrepancy** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Email Purchasing to resolve discrepancies in pricing, quantities, etc.
   - **Outcome:**
     - If resolved, return to "Match Invoice to PO".
     - If unresolved, escalate to "Escalate to Supervisor".

7. **Escalate to Supervisor** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Inform Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) about unresolved discrepancies or issues.
   - **Outcome:** Process moves to "Handle Exceptions".

8. **Handle Exceptions** (Accounts Payable Supervisor - Rita)
   - **Description:** Coordinate with suppliers, create retrospective POs, or decide on rejection.
   - **Outcome:** Once resolved, return to "Match Invoice to PO".

9. **Send for Manager Approval** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
   - **Description:** Send an email to the Department Manager (Carlos) for approval.
   - **Trigger:** Automatic email from the system.

10. **Manager Approval** (Department Manager - Carlos)

    - **Outcome:**
      - If approved, go to "Schedule Payment".
      - If rejected, hold or send back for clarification.

11. **Schedule Payment** (Accounts Payable Clerk - Mary)
    - **Description:** Add approved invoice to the next payment cycle.

**Sequence Flow:**
- Start Event -> Check for PO Number -> [Send Back to Supplier or Log Invoice]
- Log Invoice -> Confirm Goods/Services Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> [Send for Manager Approval or Clarify Discrepancy]
- Clarify Discrepancy -> [Escalate to Supervisor or Match Invoice to PO]
- Escalate to Supervisor -> Handle Exceptions -> Match Invoice to PO
- Send for Manager Approval -> Manager Approval -> Schedule Payment
- Manager Approval (Reject) -> Clarify Discrepancy

**Gateways/Decision Points:**
- Exclusive Gateway after "Check for PO Number" to decide if the invoice has a PO or not.
- Exclusive Gateway after "Match Invoice to PO" to check for discrepancies.
- Exclusive Gateway after "Manager Approval" to decide if the invoice should be approved or held for further review.

**Roles/Participants:**
- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
- Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- Department Manager (Carlos)
- Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- Invoice Document
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Confirmation Email from Purchasing
- Approval Email from Manager

**Exceptions/Variations:**
- In some cases, after "Send Back to Supplier," suppliers might not respond promptly, causing delays.
- If discrepancies can't be resolved easily, the process involves more manual intervention and potentially creating a retrospective PO.

**Notes on Uncertainty:**
- The exact mechanism for resolving discrepancies with suppliers might vary depending on the supplier's responsiveness and the nature of the discrepancy.
- The process flow might differ slightly if invoices are for services without a formal PO, where retrospective POs are created.
