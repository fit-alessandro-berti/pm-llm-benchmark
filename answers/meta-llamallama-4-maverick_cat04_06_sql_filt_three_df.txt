## Step 1: Understand the Problem and Requirements
The problem requires writing a DuckDB SQL query to filter events from an `event_log` table based on specific conditions related to the sequence and timing of activities within each case (`case_id`). The conditions are: (1) the case contains the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and (2) the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. We need to exclude cases that meet both conditions from the final result.

## Step 2: Identify Cases with the Specified Sequence
To identify cases with the specified sequence, we need to check for the presence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in that order, with no other events from the same case in between. This involves checking the activity names and their order within each case.

## Step 3: Check the Time Elapsed Between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
For cases identified with the specified sequence, we need to calculate the time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' and check if it is more than 5 days.

## Step 4: Exclude Cases That Meet Both Conditions
We will identify all `case_id`s that meet both the sequence and timing conditions, and then exclude events from these cases from the final result.

## Step 5: Construct the SQL Query
First, we need to identify the `case_id`s that have the specified sequence and timing. This involves using window functions to check the sequence and timing.

```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
         LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
         LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
         LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
  FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM ranked_events
  WHERE activity = 'Create Order' AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
timing_check AS (
  SELECT case_id, timestamp, next_timestamp
  FROM ranked_events
  WHERE activity = 'Create Order' AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT sc.case_id
  FROM sequence_check sc
  JOIN timing_check tc ON sc.case_id = tc.case_id
  WHERE tc.next_timestamp - tc.timestamp > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```

## Step 6: Validate the Query Logic
The query first ranks events within each case by timestamp and checks for the specified sequence. It then identifies cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, it excludes events from cases that meet both conditions.

The final answer is: 
```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
  SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
         LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
         LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
         LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
  FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM ranked_events
  WHERE activity = 'Create Order' AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
timing_check AS (
  SELECT case_id, timestamp, next_timestamp
  FROM ranked_events
  WHERE activity = 'Create Order' AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT sc.case_id
  FROM sequence_check sc
  JOIN timing_check tc ON sc.case_id = tc.case_id
  WHERE tc.next_timestamp - tc.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 day'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
```
