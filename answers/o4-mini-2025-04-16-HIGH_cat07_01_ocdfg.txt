This is a “processmap” style diagram that overlays five different item-centric workflows in one view.  Each workflow is color-coded and shows both the total volume of items and the average time taken between each step.

1.  Color-coded start bubbles (and the little dots on each activity) identify five object types and their volumes:  
    •  Green – VendorInvoiceItem (1.2 M)  
    •  Red   – ReturnOrderItem (0.8 M)  
    •  Purple– PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0 M)  
    •  Orange– SalesOrderItem (3.5 M)  
    •  Blue  – PurchaseOrderItem (5.0 M)  

2.  From each “Start” they flow into the appropriate first activity:  
    – PurchaseRequisitionItem  Create Requisition (300 ms)  Approve Requisition  
    – VendorInvoiceItem   Approve Requisition (600 ms)  
    – ReturnOrderItem     Approve Requisition (450 ms)  
    – SalesOrderItem      Create Order (400 ms)  
    – PurchaseOrderItem   Create Order (350 ms)  

3.  Key activities (black-bordered rectangles) show an “Overall” count of how many items ever pass through them, and little colored dots indicating which case types hit that node.  

4.  From “Approve Requisition” (5.7 M total) purple, green and red flows branch off:  
    •  Purple (requisitions)  Send Order (200 ms) or Check Stock (500 ms)  
    •  Green  (vendor invoices)  Create Invoice (650 ms)  
    •  Red    (returns)          Process Return (500 ms)  

5.  “Create Order” (8.5 M total) receives both orange (sales orders) and blue (purchase orders) items, then splits:  
    •  Orange  Pack Goods (300 ms)  Ship Goods (200 ms)  Confirm Delivery (220 ms)  Close Order (180 ms)  End (100 ms)  
    •  Blue    Send Order (320 ms)  End (150 ms)  

6.  The financial/settlement leg for purchase orders (blue) and vendor invoices (green) runs through:  
    •  Approve Payment (1.5 M total, blue)  
    •  Create Invoice (2.0 M total, blue+green)  End (220 ms)  

7.  Returns (red) after “Process Return” can either go into invoicing (green arrow, 10 ms) or straight into “Close Order” (red arrow, 300 ms), then to an End node.  

Every arrow is annotated with the average latency (in milliseconds) for that transition.  In sum, it’s a compact, integrated view of five parallel processes (procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, returns) showing volumes at each activity and timings between them.
