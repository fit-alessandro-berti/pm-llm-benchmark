The diagram is a consolidated “swimlane” style process flow that shows four different item types (each represented by its own colored dot and its own start node) moving through a series of shared and distinct steps.  Every arrow is annotated with the average latency in milliseconds, and every box shows the total volume of records (in millions) that pass through that step.  Here’s a walkthrough of what you’re looking at:

1.  Up top there are five “Start” ovals, each fed by a different source object:  
    •  VendorInvoiceItem (1.2 M objects, green)  
    •  ReturnOrderItem (0.8 M, red)  
    •  PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0 M, purple)  
    •  SalesOrderItem (3.5 M, blue)  
    •  PurchaseOrderItem (5.0 M, orange)

2.  The PurchaseRequisitionItem feed (purple) first goes into “Create Requisition” (3.0 M total), then they all converge on “Approve Requisition” (5.7 M total).  The colored dots next to that box tell you which feeds contributed to it (purple, green and blue).

3.  After “Approve Requisition,” the four streams fan out again into three different subprocesses:  
    a.  Send Order (5.2 M total, purple + blue flows)  
    b.  Check Stock (1.0 M total, purple only)  
    c.  Process Return (0.8 M total, green + red flows)

4.  The blue SalesOrderItem flow also splits off early into a separate chain:  
    •  “Create Order” (8.5 M total, blue + orange)  “Pack Goods” (2.0 M orange)  “Ship Goods” (1.8 M orange)  “Confirm Delivery” (1.7 M orange)  “Close Order” (1.7 M orange)  End.

5.  Meanwhile the blue stream that came through “Send Order” or “Check Stock” goes on to “Approve Payment” (1.5 M total) and then to “Create Invoice” (2.0 M total), at which point those items end.

6.  The green VendorInvoiceItem and red ReturnOrderItem, after “Approve Requisition,” join back in at various points:  
    – Green flows (vendor invoices) go from “Approve Requisition” to “Process Return” or directly to “Create Invoice,” and then to an End node.  
    – Red flows (returns) feed into “Process Return,” then go on to “Close Order” or “Create Invoice,” depending on the path.

Every arrow has a millisecond figure showing average processing delay for that hop (e.g. 300 ms from PurchaseRequisitionItem Start to Create Requisition, 450 ms from ReturnOrderItem Start into Approve Requisition, etc.). By combining objectcounts, latencies, and colorcoded sources, the map gives you a onepage overview of how these five types of business items flow through requisitioning, ordering, packing, shipping, invoicing and closure.
