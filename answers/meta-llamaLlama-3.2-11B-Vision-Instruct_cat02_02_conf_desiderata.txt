**Violations of Normative Rules:**

- **Case 2:** Violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. The credits for suitability considered in second.

**Detecting Additional Violations:**

- **Case 2:** Furthermore, considering it’s indeed a late detection, **does not comply with the decision logic** that when a loan is rejected, you should not finalize documentation before closing the case. The documentation was finalized.

**Additional Findings Indicating Non-Compliance with Desiderata:**

- **Case 3:** The credit check occurred **more than 24 hours after the application was received**, violating the recommendation on timely completion of the credit check.
  
- **Case 3:** The applicant was **not informed promptly** of the loan decision, as intended recommendations advocate for informing the applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision. The actual notification occurred 3 days after the decision.

- **Case 3:** There is **no evidence of a follow-up call to the applicant** before closing the case, which, although not mandatory, is recommended practice to ensure alignment and satisfaction.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

- **Case 1 stands as a model for compliance** with both normative and desiderata rules.
- **Case 2 violated critical sequencing and logic** concerning when and how documentation should be done post-decision.
- **Case 3 deviated from best practice** concerning decision-related timings and did not perform a recommended follow-up call.
