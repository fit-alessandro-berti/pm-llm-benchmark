To infer the case groupings (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we need to analyze the sequence of events and identify patterns based on attributes such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the logical flow of activities. Each case represents a distinct patient journey, so events belonging to the same case must share consistent attributes for `patient_age` and `patient_gender`, and follow a coherent timeline within a single department or across related departments.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Unique Patients**:
   - Events can be grouped by unique combinations of `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. These attributes are constant for each patient across their journey.
   - From the data:
     - Patient 1: `patient_age=45`, `patient_gender=M`
     - Patient 2: `patient_age=62`, `patient_gender=F`
     - Patient 3: `patient_age=28`, `patient_gender=M`

2. **Follow Logical Flow of Activities**:
   - Each patient's journey starts with "Register patient" and ends with "Patient discharged."
   - Intermediate activities vary depending on the patient's needs but must occur in a logical order (e.g., triage  consultation  tests  discharge).

3. **Group Events by Patient**:
   - Using the above criteria, we can assign events to specific patients.
