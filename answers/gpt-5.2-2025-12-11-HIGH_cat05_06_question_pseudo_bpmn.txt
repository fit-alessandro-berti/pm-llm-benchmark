1. What assumptions about customer needs and competitive positioning are made during market research, and how are those assumptions validated before committing to R&D and procurement?

2. How does the organization decide when the prototype is “good enough” to trigger component sourcing, and what governance exists to prevent premature ramp-up?

3. What criteria determine the selection of suppliers across Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the USA, and how are trade-offs (cost, lead time, quality, geopolitical risk, sustainability) explicitly weighted?

4. How is supplier risk assessed and monitored over time (financial health, capacity, yield, geopolitical exposure), and what early-warning indicators trigger mitigation actions?

5. What contingency plans exist if one of the parallel component streams is delayed, and how does the process prioritize mitigation (alternate suppliers, redesign, safety stock, expediting)?

6. How are engineering change orders (ECOs) handled once component procurement has started, and how does the process avoid mismatches between the bill of materials and incoming parts?

7. What mechanisms ensure cross-functional alignment between R&D, procurement, logistics, and manufacturing during the parallel sourcing phase, especially when timelines slip?

8. How are shipping modes and routes to the Malaysia assembly plant chosen, and how often are those decisions revisited based on volatility in freight rates and lead times?

9. What are the key bottlenecks or constraints in the 24/7 assembly operation, and how are capacity decisions made (additional lines, overtime, automation, outsourcing)?

10. How is quality defined and measured at the “Quality Checks & Diagnostics” stage, and how are thresholds set to balance customer experience, cost of rework, and throughput?

11. When a unit fails diagnostics, how does the process determine whether to rework or scrap, and what feedback loops ensure root causes are corrected upstream?

12. How are quality outcomes traced back to specific component lots, suppliers, and assembly shifts, and how quickly can the organization execute targeted containment and recalls?

13. What opportunities exist to shift quality assurance earlier (incoming inspection, in-line testing, design-for-manufacturability) to reduce rework cycles and scrap rates?

14. How does packaging and labeling incorporate regulatory requirements, localization needs, and anti-counterfeiting measures, and what risks arise if these are handled too late?

15. What decision logic determines which markets receive air freight versus sea freight, and how does the organization quantify the service-level vs. cost vs. carbon trade-off?

16. How are customs clearance and regulatory compliance managed across regions, and what process controls prevent shipment holds due to documentation or certification gaps?

17. How do regional distribution centers coordinate to balance inventory and avoid stockouts/overstocks, and what triggers transshipments between regions?

18. In the final distribution split (retail, e-commerce, VIP/pre-orders), how are allocation rules designed during constrained supply, and how are fairness and profitability balanced?

19. What are the most meaningful performance metrics across the end-to-end process (e.g., cash-to-cash cycle, perfect order rate, forecast accuracy, yield, on-time-in-full), and how are they linked to accountability?

20. How does the “Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast” step translate into concrete supplier order adjustments, and what safeguards prevent overreacting to short-term demand noise (e.g., bullwhip effect)?
