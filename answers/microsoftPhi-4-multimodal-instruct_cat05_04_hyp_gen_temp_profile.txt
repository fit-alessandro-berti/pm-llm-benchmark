### Identified Anomalies

- **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average time of ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation (STDEV = 1 hour) is unexpected and indicative of potential rigid approval schedules.
  
- **P to N (Approve to Notify):** An average time of 7 days (STDEV = 2 days) is unusually long, suggesting possible delays in the notification phase, possibly due to resource bottlenecks.

- **A to C (Assign to Close):** The relatively quick average time of 2 hours, potentially without intermediate steps like Evaluation or Approval, raises questions about premature claim closures.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The extremely short average time of 5 minutes (STDEV = 1 minute) between Evaluation and Notification suggests rapid transitions, possibly linking to procedural shortcuts or error.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - Systemic delays or a tightly controlled approval timeframe to meet specific policy or internal deadlines.
   - Automated approval processes reducing the variation and making adherence to an exact schedule minimal.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - Resource constraints causing backlog and delayed notifications.
   - A separate, poorly managed notification workflow causing high variability in timing.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - Missing or underreported Evaluation and Approval events, indicating that the E to C leg might not proceed through the expected intermediary steps.
   - High turnover or purely administrative nature for some processes causing premature closure.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - Skipping of intermediary steps due to automated systems or potential process optimization attempts.
   - Ineffective communication channels causing delays in transitioning tasks.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Verify R to P Timing Anomalies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (N.event_timestamp - R.event_timestamp))) AS avg_time, STDEV_EX(COUNT(DISTINCT R.event_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT R.event_id) AS stdev 
   FROM claim_events R, claim_events P 
   WHERE R.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'R') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='R') 
     AND P.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'P') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P') 
   GROUP BY claim_id 
   HAVING (avg_time - 25) < 1.96 * stdev 
   AND stdev < 1;
   ```

2. **Verify P to N Timing Anomalies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (N.event_timestamp - P.event_timestamp))) AS avg_time, STDEV_EX(COUNT(DISTINCT N.event_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT N.event_id) AS stdev 
   FROM claim_events P, claim_events N 
   WHERE P.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'P') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='P') 
     AND N.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'N') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N') 
   GROUP BY claim_id 
   HAVING (avg_time - 604800) > 2 * stdev 
   AND stdev > 172800;
   ```

3. **Verify A to C Circumstances:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (C.event_timestamp - A.event_timestamp))) AS avg_time 
   FROM claim_events A, claim_events C 
   WHERE A.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'A') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='A') 
     AND C.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'C') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='C') 
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING avg_time < 2;
   ```

4. **Verify E to N Rapid Transitions:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (N.event_timestamp - E.event_timestamp))) AS avg_time, STDEV_EX(COUNT(DISTINCT N.event_id)) / COUNT(DISTINCT N.event_id) AS stdev 
   FROM claim_events E, claim_events N 
   WHERE E.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'E') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='E') 
     AND N.event_id IN (SELECT concat(claim_id, 'N') FROM claim_events WHERE activity='N') 
   GROUP BY claim_id 
   HAVING (avg_time - 300) < 1.96 * stdev 
   AND stdev < 60; 
   ```

These queries isolate specific claims experiencing the anomaly timings, allowing stakeholders to further investigate and address the underlying issues. Analyzing these subsets helps to discern whether the anomalies are isolated incidents or part of a broader systemic problem.
