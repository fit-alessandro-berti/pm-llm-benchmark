#### **3. Gateways (Decision Points)**
- **G1**: Valid PO Present?  
  - **Conditions**:  
    - **Yes**  Proceed to **A3** (Log Invoice)  
    - **No**  **A2** (Send Back to Supplier)  
- **G2**: Discrepancy in Invoice vs. PO?  
  - **Conditions**:  
    - **Yes**  **A7** (Resolve Discrepancy)  
    - **No**  **A8** (Send Confirmation)  
- **G3**: Discrepancy Resolved Easily?  
  - **Conditions**:  
    - **Yes**  Return to **A6** (Re-compare Invoice vs. PO)  
    - **No**  **A11** (Escalate)  
- **G4**: Invoice Approved?  
  - **Conditions**:  
    - **Yes**  **A16** (Schedule Payment)  
    - **No**  **G5** (Reject or Hold?)  
- **G5**: Action on Rejection?  
  - **Conditions**:  
    - **Reject**  End Event (Rejected)  
    - **Hold**  Return to **A9** (Re-match Invoice)

#### **4. Sequence Flow**  
1. **Start**  **A1** (Check for Valid PO)  
2. **G1 (Valid PO?)**   
   - **Yes**: **A3** (Log Invoice)  **A4** (Forward to Purchasing)  
   - **No**: **A2** (Send Back)  *(Loop back to **A1** if supplier provides PO)*  
3. **A4**  **A5** (Confirm Receipt)  **A6** (Compare Invoice vs. PO)  
4. **G2 (Discrepancy?)**   
   - **Yes**: **A7** (Resolve Discrepancy)  *(Supplier provides corrected invoice)*  Return to **A6**  
   - **No**: **A8** (Send Confirmation)  **A9** (Match Invoice)  
5. **A9**  **G3 (Discrepancy Resolved Easily?)**   
   - **Yes**: Return to **A6** (Re-compare)  
   - **No**: **A11** (Escalate to Rita)  **A12** (Resolve Exception)  *(Corrected invoice)*  Return to **A9**  
6. **A9** (No Discrepancy)  **A13** (Send to Manager)  **A14** (Approve)  
7. **G4 (Approved?)**   
   - **Yes**: **A16** (Schedule Payment)  **End**  
   - **No**: **G5**   
     - **Reject**: **End (Rejected)**  
     - **Hold**: Return to **A9** (Re-match after investigation)  

---

#### **5. Exceptions & Variations**  
- **Missing PO**:  
  - **Flow**: **A2** (Send back to supplier)  *(Supplier responds)*  Return to **A1**  
  - **Unresolved**: Supplier fails to provide PO  Escalate to **A12** (Rita)  Create retrospective PO or reject.  
- **Invoice Discrepancy**:  
  - **Flow**: **G2**  **A7**  *(Supplier corrects invoice)*  Return to **A6**  
  - **Unresolved**: **A11**  **A12** (Rita coordinates resolution).  
- **Manager Rejection/Hold**:  
  - **Rejected**: End process with rejection.  
  - **Held**: Return to **A9** for re-matching after investigation.  
- **Supplier Relationship Involvement** (Karen):  
  - **Trigger**: Discrepancies (e.g., pricing, missing PO).  
  - **Action**: Karen checks contracts, informs AP/Purchasing of correct terms, and resolves issues. *(Note: Karen operates outside the core flow but supports exceptions.)*  

---

#### **6. Artifacts**  
- **Inputs**: Invoice, Purchase Order (PO).  
- **Outputs**:  
  - Logged invoice (in accounting system).  
  - Confirmation email (Purchasing  AP).  
  - Approval/rejection (Manager  AP).  
  - Payment schedule (AP  Finance).  
- **Intermediate Artifacts**: Corrected invoices, retrospective POs, supplier correspondence.  

---

#### **7. End Events**  
- **Payment Scheduled**: Invoice processed for payment.  
- **Rejected**: Invoice rejected due to unresolved discrepancies or policy violations.  

---

### Key Assumptions & Notes  
- **Loop Handling**:  
  - Corrected invoices loop back to comparison steps (**A6**, **A9**), not full restart.  
  - Held invoices return to matching (**A9**), not verification (**A1**).  
- **Escalation Logic**:  
  - Rita (**A12**) resolves exceptions (e.g., missing PO, unresolved discrepancies).  
  - Karen supports resolution but does not execute core activities.  
- **Ambiguity Resolution**:  
  - Manager rejection ("hold") defaults to re-matching (**A9**) due to insufficient detail.  
  - Supplier communication is implicit in discrepancy resolution steps.  

This model captures the core workflow, decision logic, and exceptions from all interviews. It can be directly visualized as a BPMN diagram using the described flows, gateways, and roles.
