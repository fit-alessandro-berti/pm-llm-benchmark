To address your task, I'll first identify the recurring activities and then rename them based on their context within each case. Afterward, I will justify these renaming decisions.

### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **Initial Verify Documents**:
   - This activity is the first verification step in each case and focuses on identity documents.
   
2. **Reverify Documents/Physical Docs**:
   - These activities occur after additional information or adjustments are made, indicating a re-check.

3. **Call for Missing Docs**:
   - In C001, this call is specifically to request missing documents due to incomplete verification.
   
4. **Call for Clarification**:
   - This call in C002 is an outbound call to clarify discrepancies detected during the account review process.
   
5. **Confirm Adjustment Call**:
   - After adjustments are made (C002), this is a follow-up call confirming that the changes have been successfully applied and understood by the customer.

6. **Call for Return**:
   - In C003, this call is to bring back a walk-in customer who has stepped out temporarily.
   
7. **Initiate Walk-in Request**:
   - This activity uniquely represents an in-person request, distinguishing it from online submissions.

By renaming these activities based on their specific contexts and roles within each case, the revised event log more clearly reflects the distinct steps taken in each support workflow.
