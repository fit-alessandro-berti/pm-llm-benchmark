Based on the provided constraints, we can derive a process model that describes a sequence of activities related to the submission, approval, and payment handling of a declaration. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The process starts with the activity 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.

2. **Existence and Exactly 1 Constraints**:
   - Each of the following activities must occur exactly once in the process:
     - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'
     - 'Request Payment'
     - 'Payment Handled'
     - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'

3. **Responded Existence**:
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
   - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
   - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.
   - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.

4. **Alternate Response**:
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must occur without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must occur without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must occur without repetitions.

5. **Precedence**:
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must have occurred before.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must have occurred before.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must have occurred before.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before.

6. **Chain Precedence**:
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must directly follow.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must directly follow.

7. **Alternate Precedence**:
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must have occurred before without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must have occurred before without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before without repetitions.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must have occurred before without repetitions.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must have occurred before without repetitions.

8. **Response**:
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur in the future.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must occur in the future.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must occur in the future.
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur in the future.
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must occur in the future.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must occur in the future.

9. **Chain Response**:
   - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must directly follow.
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must directly follow.

10. **Absence**:
    - The following activities do not occur in the process:
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER'
      - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION'
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'
      - 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE'
      - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR'
      - 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER'
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR'
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER'
      - 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER'
      - 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'

11. **Succession**:
    - Both the response and precedence constraints are satisfied for the following pairs:
      - ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
      - ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')
      - ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')

12. **Alternate Succession**:
    - Both the alternate response and alternate precedence constraints are satisfied for the following pairs:
      - ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
      - ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')
      - ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR')
      - ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Payment Handled')

13. **Chain Succession**:
    - Both the chain response and chain precedence constraints are satisfied for the following pairs:
      - ('Request Payment', 'Payment Handled')
      - ('Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment')

14. **Co-Existence**:
    - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
    - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.
    - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
    - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
    - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
    - If 'Payment Handled' occurs, then 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Request Payment' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must also occur.
    - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs, then 'Payment Handled' must also occur.

### Summary of the Process:
1. The process starts with the submission of a declaration by an employee.
2. The declaration is then approved by a supervisor.
3. A request for payment is made.
4. The payment is handled.
5. The declaration is finally approved by the supervisor.

The process ensures that each of these activities occurs exactly once and in a specific order, with certain activities requiring others to occur before or after them. The constraints also ensure that certain activities do not occur at all.

This process model is highly structured and ensures that the declaration submission and payment handling are tightly controlled and follow a specific sequence of events.
