This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that illustrates an order fulfillment process across four organizational departments or "swim lanes":

## **Department Structure:**
- **Sales** (top lane)
- **Production** (second lane) 
- **Procurement** (third lane)
- **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

## **Process Flow:**

**Sales Department:**
- Begins every Monday morning (timer start event)
- Checks order completeness
- Verifies if customer exists in database; if not, adds them
- Processes customer order
- Sends order details to production
- Drafts invoice upon completion

**Production Department:**
- Receives order details from Sales
- Plans production based on the order
- Has a decision point for manufacturing requirements
- Manufactures the product
- Signals completion when product is ready

**Procurement Department:**
- Contains a subprocess for "Material Compensation"
- Handles ordering, checking, and returning materials
- Manages order cancellations when necessary
- Coordinates with production for material availability

**Warehouse Department:**
- Receives notification when product is complete
- Handles sending the finished product to customer

## **Key Features:**
- **Message flows** (dashed arrows) show communication between departments
- **Decision gateways** (diamond shapes) represent branching points in the process
- **Events** (circles) mark start points, intermediate events, and end points
- **Activities** (rectangles) represent work tasks
- The diagram shows both the sequential flow within departments and the coordination required between them

This represents a comprehensive order-to-cash business process from initial order receipt through final product delivery.
