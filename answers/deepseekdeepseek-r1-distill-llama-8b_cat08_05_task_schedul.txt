### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:**

**a) Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

- **Job Flow Times:** By tracking timestamps for job releases and completions, we can analyze the duration from release to completion for each job. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and long-running jobs.
- **Lead Times and Makespan:** Lead times are calculated from release to completion, while makespan is the total time from the start of the first job to the end of the last job. These metrics reveal process variability and throughput.
- **Waiting Times at Work Centers:** Queue Entry events are analyzed to determine how long jobs wait for resource availability at each machine, helping identify bottlenecks.
- **Resource Utilization:** This includes measuring productive time, idle time, and setup time. Setup times are analyzed for dependencies on previous jobs.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:** Historical logs are used to model how setup times vary based on the sequence of jobs, using time series analysis and sequence-dependent modeling.
- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:** Comparing planned vs. actual task durations and due dates to gauge scheduling accuracy and the frequency/magnitude of delays.
- **Impact of Disruptions:** Analyzing events like machine breakdowns and priority changes to assess their effect on overall schedules and KPIs.

**b) Key Insights:**

- **Job Flow Analysis:** Reconstruction of job flow reveals the actual path of each job from release to completion, identifying long wait times and delays.
- **Resource Contention:*****,*,* The distribution of machine utilisations exhibits peaks and troughs, indicating bottlenecks and underutilized resources.
- **Setup Time Variability:*** Sequence-dependent setup times are significant, affecting lead times and schedule adherence.
- **Disruptions:** Machine breakdowns and task priorities have a substantial impact on job completion times and can cause cascading delays.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:**

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Bottleneck Resources:** Analysis reveals specific machines consistently operating beyond capacity, while others remain idle.
2. **Poor Prioritization:** High-priority jobs are often delayed, contributing to late completions.
3. **Setup Time Optimization Need:** Suboptimal sequences increase setup times, causing delays.
4. **Downstream Starvation:** Upstream bottlenecks cause downstream work centers to wait idle, reducing throughput.
5. **Bullwhip Effect:** Variability in upstream leads to fluctuating WIP, causing instability in downstream operations.

**Analysis of Pathologies:**

- **Bottlenecks:** Identified through verbose resource logs and utilization metrics, leading to throughput analysis.
- **Prioritization Issues:** High priority jobs' scheduling is examined for delays relative to other jobs.
- **Setup Time Impact:** Expanding the logs to model setup time dependencies.
- **Starvation:** Investigating machine idle times and upstream task dependencies to uncover scheduling causality.
- **Bullwhip Effect:** Tracking WIP levels over time to observe workflow dynamics.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis:**

**Factors Contributing to Inefficiencies:**

- **Static Dispatching:** Rigid rules fail to adapt to dynamic shop floor conditions.
- **Visibility Limitations:** Lack of real-time machine status and queue data hinders timely adjustments.
- **Inaccuracies:** Errors in task duration or setup times lead to poor planning.
- **Sequence Handling:** Poor management of sequence-dependent setups causing delays.
- **Cross-Workcenter Coordination:** Poor communication between work centers leads to planning inefficiencies.

**Process Mining Contribution:**

**Differentiating Causes:**
- Data from logs helps distinguish between planning issues and resource capacities.
- Identifying whether scheduling logic or process variability is the root cause by analyzing logs for recurring patterns.

### **4. Developing Advanced Scheduling Strategies:**

**Proposed Strategies:**

1. **Enhanced Dispatching Rules:**
   - **Dynamic Dispatching:** Rules that consider multiple factors like remaining processing time, due dates, priority, downstream load, and setup estimates. Weights assigned based on impact on KPIs.
2. **Predictive Scheduling:**
   - Using historical durations and maintenance data to predict future bottlenecks. Scenario simulations to anticipate and mitigate risks.
3. **Setup Time Optimization:**
   - Analyze historical setup times to optimize sequences, use machine learning to group similar jobs for batch processing.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduced WIP and lead times, lower tardiness, improved resource efficiency.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:**

**Simulation Framework:**

- Create a discrete-event simulation using process mined data, testing strategies under various scenarios.
- Validate the effectiveness of strategies against baseline and each other, considering disruptions and high loads.

**Continuous Monitoring:**

- Track KPIs in real-time, using process mining to detect drifts or new inefficiencies, enabling strategy adaptation.
