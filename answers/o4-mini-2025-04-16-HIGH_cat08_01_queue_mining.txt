1. Queue Identification and Characterization  
   a. Defining Waiting Time  
     • For each visit (case) and each pair of consecutive activities AB, compute:  
       WaitingTime(AB) = Timestamp_START(B) – Timestamp_COMPLETE(A)  
     • Nonnegative intervals where the patient is idle (not in any recorded activity) represent queue time.  
   b. Key Queue Metrics  
     • Average waiting time per handover (mean of WaitingTime)  
     • Median waiting time (50th percentile)  
     • 90th percentile waiting time (to capture tail delays)  
     • Maximum waiting time (to identify extreme outliers)  
     • Queue frequency (number of visits experiencing a wait > threshold, e.g., >15 min)  
     • Volume of cases per queue (to gauge overall impact)  
   c. Prioritizing Critical Queues  
     Identify those queues that combine:  
     • High average and 90th percentile wait  
     • Large patient volume (high frequency)  
     • High variability (large gap between mean and median)  
     • Disproportionate impact on specific cohorts (e.g., urgent cases waiting >5 min before nurse triage)  
     Example: if “Registration  Nurse Assessment” has mean=12 min, 90th=25 min, and affects 70% of cases, it becomes a top priority.  

2. Root Cause Analysis  
   a. Potential Sources of Delay  
     • Resource bottlenecks: periods when clerks, nurses or doctors exceed 80–90% utilization  
     • Sequential dependencies: rigid workflows that force AB in series when some steps could overlap  
     • Servicetime variability: some nurses take twice as long on average for the same assessment  
     • Scheduling policies: overbooking in certain time slots, lack of buffer times  
     • Arrival patterns: morning surge with insufficient parallel capacity  
     • Patient mix: new patients requiring longer consults block slots for followups  
   b. Process Mining Techniques  
     • Resource Utilization Analysis: plot utilization timelines per role/room and correlate peaks with long queues  
     • Bottleneck Analysis: identify activities with longest queue times and highest workinprogress (WIP)  
     • Variant Analysis: compare highdelay vs. lowdelay traces to see what differs (e.g., resource allocation, patient type)  
     • Handover Analysis: map frequent resource handoffs and measure associated delays  
     • Arrival Pattern Mining: cluster cases by arrival time and measure subsequent waiting times  

3. DataDriven Optimization Strategies  
   Strategy 1: Flexible Staffing & CrossTraining  
     • Targeted Queue: Nurse Assessment and Doctor Consultation  
     • Root Cause: Peaktime staff overload (utilization >90%)  
     • Proposal:  
       – Introduce a “floater” nurse/physician assistant during identified peaks (e.g., 9:00–11:00)  
       – Crosstrain clerks to assist with vitals or basic intake in lulls  
     • Data Support: Resource utilization chart shows 9:00–10:30 nurse utilization peaking at 95%  
     • Expected Impact:  
       – Reduce mean wait for Nurse Assessment from 10 min to 5 min (50% reduction)  
       – Shift 90th percentile down by 40%  
   Strategy 2: Appointment Scheduling Redesign with TimeSlot Differentiation  
     • Targeted Queue: Registration  Nurse Assessment & Checkout  
     • Root Cause: Arrival clustering and lack of buffer for followups vs. new patients  
     • Proposal:  
       – Block morning slots for new patients (longer slots, e.g., 20 min) and afternoons for followups (shorter slots, e.g., 10 min)  
       – Insert 5minute buffer every fourth appointment to absorb overruns  
     • Data Support: Trace variant shows newpatient visits average 30 min longer than followups, causing spillover  
     • Expected Impact:  
       – Even out arrival peaks, flatten queue length curve  
       – Reduce registration wait peaks by 60%  
   Strategy 3: Parallelization & TechnologyEnabled SelfService  
     • Targeted Queue: Registration  
     • Root Cause: Sequential dependency on frontdesk clerk for forms and insurance checks  
     • Proposal:  
       – Deploy selfcheckin kiosks or mobile preregistration app for basic demographic/insurance input  
       – Allow vitals measurement (weight, blood pressure) in parallel to registration completion  
     • Data Support: Registration mean wait = 6 min, max = 20 min; 25% of patients complete forms in <2 min via kiosk pilot  
     • Expected Impact:  
       – Reduce average registration wait to <3 min (50% reduction)  
       – Free up clerks to focus on exceptions, cutting peak queue length by half  

4. Consideration of Tradeoffs and Constraints  
   a. Potential Tradeoffs  
     • Flexible staffing increases labor costs and scheduling complexity  
     • Timeslot differentiation may inconvenience patients preferring morning slots  
     • Selfservice kiosks require upfront investment and training, and may not be suitable for all (e.g., elderly)  
     • Buffer times reduce theoretical throughput capacity  
   b. Balancing Objectives  
     • Use simulation models fed by eventlog distributions to test “what if” scenarios and find costeffective staffing levels  
     • Pilot changes in one specialty or time block to measure real impact before full rollout  
     • Maintain quality metrics (e.g., length of doctor consultation, readmission rates) to ensure care standards are not compromised  

5. Measuring Success  
   a. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
     • Average and 90th percentile waiting times per transition (e.g., RegNurse, NurseDoctor)  
     • Overall visit duration (START Reg  COMPLETE Checkout)  
     • Resource utilization rates (target 70–85% to avoid overload)  
     • Patient satisfaction scores (postvisit surveys focused on wait perception)  
     • Noshow and overtime rates (to detect scheduling inefficiencies)  
   b. Ongoing Process Monitoring  
     • Continue collecting START/COMPLETE timestamps in the same eventlog format  
     • Build live dashboards with thresholds and alerts (e.g., if queue length >5 patients or wait >15 min)  
     • Monthly processmining refresh to detect drift or new bottlenecks (concept drift analysis)  
     • Regular “control charts” per KPI to confirm sustained improvement and trigger corrective actions if metrics slip
