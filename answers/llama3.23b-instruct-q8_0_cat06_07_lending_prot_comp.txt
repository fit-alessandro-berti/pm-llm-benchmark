Based on the provided data, I can identify some potential unfair differences in the treatment of the "protected" group and the "unprotected" group.

1. **Examination process**: In the protected group, there is a more detailed examination process involving multiple steps, such as requesting a co-signer, making visits to assess collateral, and submitting files to underwriters. This process may be more time-consuming and resource-intensive. In contrast, the unprotected group has fewer steps in their examination process.
2. **Loan approval rates**: The protected group has significantly lower loan approval rates compared to the unprotected group. For example, in the protected group, only 960 out of 1,309 requests (73%) were approved, while in the unprotected group, an average of 92% of requests were approved.
3. **Execution time**: The protected group's process variants tend to have longer execution times compared to those in the unprotected group. For instance, some process variants in the protected group have execution times over 350 minutes (6 hours), whereas similar process variants in the unprotected group have execution times under 390 minutes (6.5 hours).
4. **Number of steps**: The protected group's process variants involve more steps compared to those in the unprotected group. This could lead to increased complexity and potential for errors.
5. **Co-signer requirements**: In the protected group, requesting a co-signer is a mandatory step in many process variants, which may be a barrier for certain borrowers.

These differences suggest that the protected group may face more stringent criteria or additional requirements compared to the unprotected group, which could lead to reduced loan approval rates and increased processing times. However, it's essential to note that these findings are based on a limited dataset and should be further investigated to confirm any potential biases.

Additionally, some process variants in both groups have similar performance metrics (e.g., average loan value), suggesting that other factors may influence the treatment of borrowers in each group.
