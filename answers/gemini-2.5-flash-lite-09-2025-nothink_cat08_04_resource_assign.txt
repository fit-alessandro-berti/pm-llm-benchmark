## Process Mining Approach for Optimizing TechSolve Resource Assignment

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

The event log, linking $\text{Case ID}$, $\text{Activity}$, $\text{Resource (Agent ID)}$, $\text{Agent Tier}$, $\text{Agent Skills}$, $\text{Ticket Priority}$, $\text{Ticket Category}$, and $\text{Required Skill}$, is the core data source for analyzing resource dynamics.

#### Key Metrics and Analysis Focus:

| Analysis Focus | Process Mining Technique | Specific Metrics to Extract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent/Tier Performance** | Footprint Analysis, Performance Views | Mean time spent per activity/tier ($\text{Work L1 Start}$ to $\text{Work L1 End}$), Throughput Time (Total $\text{Ticket Created}$ to $\text{Resolved}$), SLA adherence rate per agent/tier. |
| **Workload Distribution** | Resource Utilization View | Number of active tickets concurrently handled by each agent/tier, total time spent "working" vs. time spent "waiting" (queue time). |
| **Assignment Logic Efficacy** | Path Analysis, Reassignment Frequency | Frequency of direct assignment vs. handovers ($\text{Escalate L1} \rightarrow \text{Assign L2}$), Number of handovers per case variant, Ratio of successful first assignments ($\text{Ticket Created}$ to first $\text{Work Start}$) to total assignments. |
| **Skill Utilization** | Attribute Filtering, Resource Profiling | Percentage of tickets requiring 'Networking-Firewall' that are resolved by agents possessing that skill vs. those resolved after reassignment. **Skill Coverage Score** (the fraction of required skills matched by the assigned agent). |
| **L1 Effectiveness** | Variant Analysis focused on $\text{Work L1 End}$ | First Contact Resolution (FCR) rate for L1, average time spent by L1 on tickets later escalated, analysis of the categories/skills L1 agents *most frequently* fail to resolve. |

#### Revealing Actual Assignment Patterns (Beyond Round-Robin):

1.  **Resource Interaction Analysis (Social Network Analysis):** By mapping handovers ($\text{Reassign}$ or $\text{Escalate}$ activities), we can visualize the *actual* flow of work. If the model shows Agent A05 frequently hands tickets directly to Agent B12, even if the intended logic is round-robin, this suggests an **implicit skill dependency** or informal escalation path.
2.  **Conformance Checking:** The established process map (derived from the log) is compared against the **intended** assignment logic (e.g., "All P1 tickets must go to L2 immediately"). Deviations reveal where agents bypass or override the intended flow, often due to perceived system limitations or personal knowledge.
3.  **Role Discovery:** Analyzing which activities agents perform most often helps confirm their true tier placement, regardless of their formal title. Are L1 agents frequently performing L3 tasks (indicated by high time spent on complex $\text{Work}$ activities)?

#### Analyzing Skill Utilization:

We must filter the event log by the $\text{Required Skill}$ attribute.
*   **Underutilization:** Calculate the average queue time for tickets requiring 'Database-SQL'. If this queue time is high, but L2 agents with 'DB-SQL' skills show low utilization during that period, it indicates a **routing failure**, not a capacity failure.
*   **Skill Over-assignment (The L2/L3 time-sink):** Identify tickets where the $\text{Required Skill}$ matches an L3 specialist skill, but the $\text{Agent Tier}$ remains L1 or L2 for an extended period *before* a specialist is engaged. This reveals valuable work leakage where higher tiers are handling routine tasks assigned inefficiently.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Process mining translates behavioral analysis into quantifiable performance impacts:

*   **Bottlenecks (Capacity vs. Routing):**
    *   If the process model shows significant waiting time ($\text{Assign L2}$ to $\text{Work L2 Start}$) associated with a specific $\text{Required Skill}$ (e.g., 'Security-IAM'), we have a **skill capacity bottleneck**.
    *   Conversely, if high waiting time exists, but the corresponding specialists are idle (low utilization), the issue is **inefficient routing** (the ticket isn't reaching the available specialist quickly).

*   **Impact of Reassignments/Handovers:**
    *   We isolate cases involving $\text{Reassign}$ or $\text{Escalate}$ activities. For these specific cases, we calculate the **"Handoff Delay"**: the average time between the end of work on the previous assignment ($\text{Work L1 End}$) and the start of work on the new assignment ($\text{Work L2 Start}$ on the re-assigned ticket).
    *   **SLA Breach Correlation:** Filter all cases that breached SLA. Overlay the resource activity map. If a high percentage of SLA breaches occur immediately following a resource reassignment, it strongly suggests the delay was introduced by the handover process itself, not necessarily the complexity of the issue.

*   **Incorrect Initial Assignments:** Analyze the $\text{Assign L1}$ step. If tickets initially assigned to L1 frequently require escalation to L3 within one hour, the initial classification/routing decision was flawed, wasting L1 time and delaying the expert engagement.

*   **Uneven Workload:** The utilization analysis directly highlights overloaded agents (high $\text{Work Start}$ density, low idle time) versus underutilized agents (high idle time). This points to failures in the round-robin distribution mechanism.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Process mining helps differentiate symptoms (reassignments) from underlying causes:

| Observed Symptom | Potential Root Cause Revealed by Analysis | Supporting Process Mining Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Frequent Escalations $\text{L1} \rightarrow \text{L2}$ for simple issues. | Poor L1 training/empowerment OR Flawed initial classification. | **Variant Analysis:** Compare variants that resolve at L1 versus those that escalate. If escalated tickets frequently share a simple $\text{Category}$ (e.g., Password Reset), the cause is empowerment/training. |
| Specialists (L2/L3) handling basic tasks. | Inaccurate skill tagging in the system OR Assignment algorithm defaulting to high-skill agents when L1 queues are busy. | **Resource Profiling:** Comparing agent skillset vs. $\text{Required Skill}$ handled. |
| High wait times for specific skills despite available agents. | Inaccurate/Outdated Skill Profiles in the Agent Database. | **Skill Coverage Gap Analysis:** High demand for Skill X, but the current agent pool has low documented competence in Skill X. |
| Inconsistent assignment paths for similar tickets. | Current assignment rules are too simple (e.g., pure round-robin) or depend too heavily on subjective dispatcher input. | **Decision Mining:** Applying decision analysis to the $\text{Assign}$ activity. Inputs (Priority, Category, Time of Day) are correlated against the final assigned resource/tier to reverse-engineer decision logic. |

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

The analysis provides concrete data to shift from heuristic (round-robin) assignment to intelligent routing.

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic, Skill-Proficiency Weighted Routing (Addressing Skill Mismatch and Delays)

*   **Issue Addressed:** Frequent reassignments due to skill mismatch; delays waiting for the *correct* specialist.
*   **Leveraging Insights:** Utilize the historical data ($\text{Required Skill}$ vs. Successful $\text{Resource}$) to establish a **Skill Proficiency Score** for every agent on every skill (e.g., Agent B12 resolves 'App-CRM' in 50% less time than Agent B08, thus B12 has higher proficiency).
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  When a ticket requires a skill (e.g., 'Networking-Firewall'), the system queries the available agent pool.
    2.  It prioritizes agents who possess the required skill *and* have the highest Proficiency Score *and* are currently available (based on their current concurrent load).
*   **Data Required:** Historical resolution time/success rate per agent/skill combination.
*   **Expected Benefit:** Significant reduction in resolution time (due to higher proficiency matches) and a reduction in downstream reassignments.

#### Strategy 2: Tier-Level Workload Balancing and Skill Thresholding (Addressing Uneven Load & L1 Leakage)

*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution; L2/L3 agents handling work better suited for L1.
*   **Leveraging Insights:** Identify the "L1 Threshold" for every major $\text{Category}$ and $\text{Required Skill}$. This is the point in the process where L1 historically fails (e.g., 90% of tickets related to 'Software-OS' requiring 'OS-WindowsServer' skill escalation).
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Intelligent L1 Assignment:** For tickets below the L1 Threshold complexity, route via workload-aware round-robin (Strategy 3).
    2.  **Automated L2 Pre-assignment:** For tickets *above* the L1 Threshold, bypass L1 assignment entirely and route directly to an L2 queue that possesses the necessary skill, optimizing for the agent with the *lowest* current workload (not just the next in line).
*   **Data Required:** Historical resolution paths and successful L1 FCR rates broken down by skill and category.
*   **Expected Benefit:** Reduced L1 stress, optimized utilization of higher-tier specialists (less time wasted on triage), and improved P2/P3 SLA compliance by getting complex issues to the right tier faster.

#### Strategy 3: Real-Time Queue Weighting based on Priority and Skill Availability (Addressing SLA Breaches)

*   **Issue Addressed:** SLA breaches, particularly for P2/P3 tickets, due to agents being busy on lower-priority work.
*   **Leveraging Insights:** Overlay ticket priority onto the resource availability map. Identify agents who spent excessive time on P4 tickets immediately preceding a P2 SLA breach.
*   **Implementation:** Implement a dynamic queue weighting system:
    1.  Tickets are weighted not just by Priority (P1>P2>P3>P4), but also by the **Required Skill scarcity** (if only two agents have the skill, that ticket gets a higher weight).
    2.  The assignment algorithm assigns the ticket to the available agent whose current workload/queue length, when weighted by the ticket's scarcity score, results in the lowest projected impact on overall SLA adherence.
*   **Data Required:** Real-time SLA deadlines, current active workload per agent, and the skill pool associated with each agent.
*   **Expected Benefit:** Direct improvement in SLA compliance by ensuring high-priority, critical-skill tickets are immediately routed to the next available expert, overriding a simple round-robin sequence.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### Simulation and Validation (Pre-Implementation)

Before deploying new routing rules, simulation is crucial to ensure the fix doesn't create new problems (e.g., bankrupting the L1 workload).

1.  **Model Refinement:** Use the mined process model as the baseline. Tag agents with their calculated **Skill Proficiency Scores** (from Strategy 1) and **Current Workload Capacity** (from Strategy 2).
2.  **Scenario Execution:** Simulate the past year's worth of ticket arrivals using the baseline event log, but swap out the old assignment logic for the new proposed logic (e.g., Strategy 1).
3.  **Impact Assessment:** Compare the simulated output metrics (Total Throughput Time, Number of Reassignments, SLA adherence) under the new logic against the historical actuals. If the simulation shows a $20\%$ improvement in P2 resolution time with only a $5\%$ increase in L3 workload variation, the strategy is validated for pilot deployment.

#### Monitoring Post-Implementation

Once a strategy is live, continuous monitoring via process mining dashboards ensures sustained performance and detects configuration drift.

**Key Resource-Related KPIs and Views to Track:**

1.  **Real-Time Reassignment Rate:** A KPI dashboard tracking the percentage of cases involving a $\text{Reassign}$ or $\text{Escalate}$ activity *per hour*. A sudden spike indicates the new logic is failing or a skill profile has become outdated.
2.  **Skill Coverage Performance View:** Monitor the time taken to resolve tickets based on the $\text{Required Skill}$. If the time difference between a 'perfect match' assignment (Agent had the skill from the start) and a 'reassigned' assignment suddenly widens, the skill routing is degrading.
3.  **Workload Velocity Map:** A visual map showing the concurrent active ticket count per agent. The goal is to see lower variance (less divergence between the most and least busy agents) compared to the initial state, confirming Strategy 2's balancing effect.
4.  **L1 FCR Trendline:** A sustained increase in the L1 First Contact Resolution rate confirms that the new routing (or training adjustments informed by the root cause analysis) is successfully allowing L1 to handle more basic issues, freeing up L2/L3.
