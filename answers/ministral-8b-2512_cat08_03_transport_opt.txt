# **Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels’ Last-Mile Optimization**

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **1.1 Data Integration and Preprocessing Challenges**
To create a cohesive event log, the following steps are required:

- **Data Alignment:**
  - **Temporal Alignment:** Ensure timestamps across GPS, scanner, and dispatch systems are synchronized (e.g., using UTC and accounting for local time zones).
  - **Entity Linking:** Match vehicle IDs, driver IDs, and package IDs across systems to avoid fragmentation.
  - **Activity Standardization:** Harmonize event types (e.g., "Arrive Customer" from scanner vs. "Low Speed Detected" from GPS) into a unified taxonomy.

- **Challenges:**
  - **Missing or Inconsistent Data:** GPS may lack driver actions, while scanners may not record travel time.
  - **Granularity Mismatch:** Dispatch data may be high-level (route plans), while GPS provides real-time speed/location.
  - **Noise in Events:** False positives (e.g., "Low Speed Detected" due to hills vs. traffic).
  - **Privacy Constraints:** Driver behavior data may require anonymization.

### **1.2 Process Discovery**
- **Algorithms:**
  - Use **alpha-mining** or **heuristic mining** to extract frequent sequences (e.g., "Depart Depot  Delivery Attempt  Return").
  - Apply **inductive mining** to identify branching paths (e.g., "Delivery Success" vs. "Delivery Failed").
  - **Time-aware process mining** (e.g., using **TimePetri** or **Time-Aware Heuristics**) to model delays and timing deviations.

- **Visualization:**
  - Generate a **process map** showing:
    - **Planned vs. Actual Paths** (e.g., deviations like unscheduled stops).
    - **Cycle Time Analysis** (e.g., average time per delivery stop).
    - **Frequency of Deviations** (e.g., "Failed Delivery" occurs 20% of the time in suburban routes).

### **1.3 Conformance Checking**
- **Comparison Metrics:**
  - **Sequence Deviations:** Check if actual routes match planned routes (e.g., detours due to traffic).
  - **Timing Deviations:** Compare **planned vs. actual arrival times** at stops.
  - **Resource Deviations:** Identify if wrong vehicles/drivers are assigned (e.g., due to last-minute changes).

- **Key Deviations to Detect:**
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Engine warnings, traffic jams, or customer-related delays.
  - **Failed Deliveries:** High frequency in certain areas (e.g., residential zones).
  - **Idle Time:** Prolonged stops due to poor route sequencing.
