To identify the main differences between the process variants for the 'protected' and the 'unprotected' groups, I will consider both **frequency** and **performance** (time-related measures) and point out patterns that could indicate potential **unfair treatment**. I'll also factor in typical actions in processes that involve credit applications and evaluations, such as the need for a co-signer or repeated visits, which can be considered indicators of more stringent requirements or delays.

Here are the main **observations** indicating differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Loan Approval**
   - **Protected Group**: The lower frequencies for successful loan approvals are concerning. For example:
     - Only **39 approvals** in `(Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> ... -> Sign Loan Agreement)` with a time performance of around **330025 ms**.
     - Cumulative variations that result in successfully reaching the "Sign Loan Agreement" activity seem uncommon.
   - **Unprotected Group**: 
     - Much higher rates of approvals, such as **1656 approvals** at a time performance of around **340004 ms**.
     - In process variants leading to loan approval `(Sign Loan Agreement)`, the unprotected group had far more frequent successful outcomes.

   **Fairness Issue**: This suggests a much higher rate of loan denials in the protected group relative to the same process steps, even though performance times are somewhat comparable. This could suggest biases in decision-making or screening criteria.

### 2. **Loan Denials**
   - **Protected Group**:
     - Several long process variations lead to **Loan Denied** outcomes. Examples involve multiple activities like:
       - **Request Co-Signer** or **Make Visit to Assess Collateral**; sometimes repeated multiple times.
       - E.g., `(Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer -> Loan Denied)` occurs in several cases with frequency **88** to **15** in many variants, highlighting the additional effort required for loan applications that end up denied.
     - Some process variants involve making up to **four collateral assessments** before denial, which adds burdensome steps.
     - Highest denial frequencies:
       - E.g., **960 denials** for applications that make it to file submission.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - While denials exist, they are less common proportionally. For instance, **2709 denials** which followed the standard process were with a performance time similar to the top process variants leading to success. 
     - There are some cases of denials after additional steps (like requesting a co-signer), but these instances are comparatively fewer in number.

   **Fairness Issue**: Multiple additional veto steps (like requiring frequent co-signer scrutinies or multiple collateral visits) seem disproportionately applied to the protected group. This suggests more hurdles are placed before approving the loan, yet they are largely fruitless as the eventual result is still a denial.

### 3. **Additional Delays and Hurdles (More Process Complexity)**:
   - **Protected Group**:
     - Process variants for the protected group, especially for cases that lead to loan rejection, often include **additional steps**:
       - **Request Co-Signer On Loan** occurs frequently, with additional performance time spikes for these steps, e.g. **330020 ms** or more in multiple variants.
       - Depending on complexity, these steps can involve repeated collateral assessments (up to **four times** in some variants), e.g. `"Make Visit to Assess Collateral... Make Visit to Assess Collateral..."`.
     - Some variants involve repetitive and time-consuming steps, and performance time inflates to **350000 - 390000 ms** on average for more drawn-out cases.

   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - While there are some instances where **"Request Co-Signer On Loan"** and **"Make Visit to Assess Collateral"** appear, these steps seem less frequent or less likely to be repeated.
     - The time for critical actions (file submission, approval, or denial) is not materially longer than success scenarios, and there is less process over-clustering and revisitations. Higher loan approval rates occur without being subjected to these hurdles as often.
   
   **Fairness Issue**: The additional steps and process complexity in the protected group raise concerns about discriminatory practices. Additional requirements disproportionately target the protected group and result in longer processing times, yet do not proportionately improve outcomes. This suggests inefficiencies in treating these cases, further delaying loans that are often denied regardless of extra effort.

### 4. **Performance Time Differences**:
   - **Protected Group**:
     - Performance times tend to peak at certain points (330k ms to 390k ms) but with no significant advantage in terms of loan approval. A noteworthy issue is the grouping of failure variants in that time spread.
   - **Unprotected Group**:
     - Despite frequent process variants reaching around the same performance times (e.g., **390k ms** in denied cases similar to the protected group), it is the higher frequency of **successful outcomes** in the unprotected group that stands out as unfairly distributed.
   
   **Fairness Issue**: The time performance tends to be longer for the protected group for cases involving repeated steps like collateral assessments or co-signer requests. However, the ultimate success rates are far lower for the protected group overall. The comparative inefficiency in reaching positive outcomes implies systemic delays.

---

### **Summary of Main Differences (Potential Unfair Treatment):**
  - **More Loan Denials for the Protected Group**: A higher proportion of loan denials even when similar steps and comparable performance times are observed.
  - **Additional and Repetitive Hurdles** for the protected group (e.g., more widespread requirements for co-signers, more frequent collateral visits, multiple repeated steps that inflate the length of the process with relatively few loan agreements signed).
  - **Frequency of Successful Loan Approvals** is far less for the protected group irrespective of performance time, indicating a systemic bias or an elevated threshold for loan approvals.
  - **Process Complexity and Burden** disproportionately fall on the protected group, leading to delays but not improved outcomes.
  
These observed differences reflect a concerning pattern of indirect or systemic unfair treatment in the loan approval process for the protected group. Regulatory incentives, implicit bias, or historical barriers to financial access might be playing a role here.
