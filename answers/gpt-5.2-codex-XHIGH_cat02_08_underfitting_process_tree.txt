**Example of a trace that is *allowed* by the model but should be *forbidden* in reality**

A trace such as:

```
Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Close_Order
```

is **accepted** by the given process tree.

---

###  Why the model allows it
In the model, the “successful” branch is defined as:

```
PARALLEL(Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order)
```

A PARALLEL (AND) node means *any ordering* of those three activities is permitted.  
So the model happily accepts an interleaving where **shipping happens first**, followed by payment authorization and packaging.

---

###  Why this trace is wrong in the real OrdertoCash process
From a domain perspective:

- You **cannot ship** an order before payment is authorized.
- You **cannot ship** before the items are packaged.

So the sequence above violates the realworld logic of the process, even though the model does not prohibit it. This is a classic example of **underfitting**: the model is too permissive and allows behavior that should not be possible.

If you'd like, I can also suggest how to fix the model to prevent such traces.
