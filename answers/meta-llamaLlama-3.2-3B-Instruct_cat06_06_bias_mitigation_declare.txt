### Rationale for Added Constraints

1.  **Coexistence (New Constraint):**
    *   We ensure that `ManualReview` always coexists with `FinalDecision` for applicants from sensitive demographics (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`).
    *   This constraint limits the bias by requiring an additional review step when sensitive attributes might influence the decision.
2.  **Response and Succession Constraints (New Constraints):**
    *   We enforce that `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede `RequestAdditionalInfo` and `FinalDecision` when sensitive attributes are involved (`CheckApplicantRace`).
    *   This constraint mitigates bias by introducing a check that ensures decision steps are fair and not influenced by sensitive attributes.
3.  **Non-Succession Constraints (New Constraints):**
    *   We prevent a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `FinalDecision` to avoid biased outcomes.
    *   Additionally, we ensure that `ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck` is always involved in the decision-making process after `CheckApplicantRace` to introduce fairness.
4.  **Bias Mitigation Explanation:**
    *   The updated model incorporates constraints that reduce bias in the loan application process.
    *   These constraints ensure that decision steps are fair, introduce additional checks for sensitive attributes, and prevent direct successions that might lead to biased outcomes.
    *   By incorporating these bias-mitigating constraints, the model promotes fairness and consistency in the loan application process.
