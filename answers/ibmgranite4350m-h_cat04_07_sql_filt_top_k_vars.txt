To accomplish this task, we will first construct a SQL query that extracts the ordered sequence of activities for each `case_id`. This involves joining the `event_log` table with itself on the `case_id` and sorting by the `timestamp`.

The steps are as follows:

1. **Identify the order**: We need to extract the activity in chronological order.
2. **Join with a derived table or subquery** to maintain this sequence for each case.
3. **Group by the derived fields (case_id, sorted_activities)** and aggregate.

Here is an example SQL query that meets these requirements:

```sql
SELECT
    e.case_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT r.activity) AS activities_sequence
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
    FROM event_log
) r ON e.case_id = r.case_id
GROUP BY
    e.case_id;
```

This query does the following:
- It selects each `case_id` and concatenates all distinct activities for that case.
- The subquery (alias `r`) ensures that only unique cases are considered, preserving their order based on `timestamp`.

Next steps:

1. **Group by Case ID**: This groups results by the `case_id`, which we assumed to be our primary key.

2. **Count Variants per Group**: To count how many cases belong to each variant and determine the top K variants (for example, k = 5), you would use a subquery or a window function:

```sql
WITH ranked_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS activity_count,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT e.case_id, r.activities_sequence
FROM ranked_cases r
WHERE r.rank <= k;  -- Replace 'k' with the desired number of top variants
```

3. **Filter to Top K Variants**: This step would involve filtering `r` based on its rank.

4. **Join Returned Events Back** to original log:

```sql
SELECT e.case_id, e.activity, e.timestamp
FROM event_log e
JOIN ranked_cases r ON e.case_id = r.case_id AND r.rank <= k;
```

This query will return all events from the `event_log` table that belong only to cases which are part of the top K variants. It ensures that each returned case's activities sequence is unique and grouped appropriately.

Note: Adjust 'k' according to how many distinct activity sequences you want to identify as a variant.
