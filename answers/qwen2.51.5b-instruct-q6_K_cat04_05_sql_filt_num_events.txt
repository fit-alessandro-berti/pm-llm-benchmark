Certainly! Below is a well-structured DuckDB SQL query that addresses your requirements:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS total_events
    FROM 
        event_log
)
SELECT 
    E1.case_id, E1.activity, E1.timestamp
FROM 
    event_log E1
JOIN 
    event_counts EC ON E1.case_id = EC.case_id AND E1.total_events <= 6
ORDER BY 
    case_id;
```

### Explanation:

- **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `event_counts` CTE calculates the total number of events per `case_id`. It uses a window function (`COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`) to group by `case_id`.

- **Main Query**: 
  - We join the original table with the `event_counts` CTE on `case_id`.
  - The condition in the JOIN clause ensures that only cases with up to six events are considered.
  - Finally, we order the results by `case_id`.

This query effectively filters out any case instances where there are more than six events and returns all the relevant events from those cases.
