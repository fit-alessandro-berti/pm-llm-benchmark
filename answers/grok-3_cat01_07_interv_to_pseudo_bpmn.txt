#### **Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

#### **Overview:**  
This process describes the workflow for approving and scheduling payment for invoices received from suppliers. It involves multiple roles across Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Department Management, and Supplier Relations, with decision points and exception handling for discrepancies or missing information.

---

#### **Roles/Participants (Swimlanes):**
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)** - Responsible for initial invoice receipt, logging, matching, and scheduling payment.
2. **Purchasing Officer** - Confirms receipt of goods/services and validates invoice against purchase order (PO).
3. **Department Manager** - Provides final approval for the invoice.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)** - Handles escalations and exceptions.
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)** - Assists in resolving issues with suppliers.
6. **System** - Refers to the accounting or workflow system that automates notifications and data storage.

---

#### **Artifacts/Data Objects:**
1. **Invoice** - The primary document received from the supplier, containing details like PO number, items, quantities, and pricing.
2. **Purchase Order (PO)** - A reference document used to validate the invoice.
3. **Confirmation Email** - Sent by Purchasing to confirm receipt of goods/services.
4. **Approval Notification** - Automated system message to the Department Manager for final sign-off.
5. **Payment Schedule** - Output artifact indicating when the invoice will be paid.

---

#### **Process Flow Description:**

1. **Start Event:**  
   - **Trigger:** Invoice received by email.  
   - **Role:** AP Clerk.

2. **Activity 1: Check for PO Number**  
   - **Role:** AP Clerk.  
   - **Description:** The AP Clerk checks if the invoice contains a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.  
   - **Output:** Decision on whether PO is present.

3. **Gateway 1: PO Number Present?**  
   - **Decision Point:** Is a valid PO number included on the invoice?  
   - **Yes Path:** Proceed to Activity 2 (Log Invoice).  
   - **No Path:** Proceed to Exception Path 1 (Request PO from Supplier).

4. **Exception Path 1: Request PO from Supplier**  
   - **Role:** AP Clerk (with potential input from SRM).  
   - **Description:** AP Clerk sends a request to the supplier for the missing PO number or a revised invoice. SRM may assist if supplier communication is needed.  
   - **Outcome:** Once PO is received, return to Gateway 1 for re-evaluation. If supplier cannot provide PO, escalate to AP Supervisor for further handling (see Exception Path 3).

5. **Activity 2: Log Invoice into System**  
   - **Role:** AP Clerk.  
   - **Description:** The AP Clerk enters the invoice details into the accounting system.  
   - **Output:** Invoice record in the system.

6. **Activity 3: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation**  
   - **Role:** AP Clerk.  
   - **Description:** The AP Clerk forwards the invoice to the Purchasing Officer to confirm receipt of goods/services.  
   - **Output:** Invoice sent to Purchasing.

7. **Activity 4: Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer.  
   - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer compares the invoice details (quantities, pricing, delivery charges) against the PO and confirms whether goods/services were received as ordered.  
   - **Output:** Confirmation or discrepancy report.

8. **Gateway 2: Invoice Matches PO and Goods Received?**  
   - **Decision Point:** Do the invoice details match the PO, and were goods/services received?  
   - **Yes Path:** Proceed to Activity 5 (Send Confirmation to AP).  
   - **No Path:** Proceed to Exception Path 2 (Resolve Discrepancy).

9. **Exception Path 2: Resolve Discrepancy**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (with potential input from SRM or AP Clerk).  
   - **Description:** If there is a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing, extra units billed), the Purchasing Officer contacts the supplier for clarification or a revised invoice. SRM may assist with supplier communication. If unresolved, the issue is escalated to AP Supervisor.  
   - **Outcome:** Once resolved (e.g., revised invoice received or issue clarified), return to Gateway 2 for re-evaluation. If unresolved, escalate to AP Supervisor (see Exception Path 3).

10. **Activity 5: Send Confirmation to AP**  
    - **Role:** Purchasing Officer.  
    - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer sends a confirmation email to the AP Clerk indicating that the invoice matches the PO and goods/services were received.  
    - **Output:** Confirmation email.

11. **Activity 6: Match Invoice Against PO in System**  
    - **Role:** AP Clerk.  
    - **Description:** The AP Clerk performs a final matching of invoice line items against the PO in the system, incorporating Purchasing’s confirmation.  
    - **Output:** Matched invoice record.

12. **Gateway 3: Final Match Confirmed?**  
    - **Decision Point:** Does the invoice fully match the PO with no discrepancies?  
    - **Yes Path:** Proceed to Activity 7 (Request Manager Approval).  
    - **No Path:** Return to Exception Path 2 (Resolve Discrepancy).

13. **Activity 7: Request Manager Approval**  
    - **Role:** AP Clerk (via System).  
    - **Description:** The system sends an automatic notification to the Department Manager requesting approval of the invoice.  
    - **Output:** Approval notification.

14. **Activity 8: Review and Approve Invoice**  
    - **Role:** Department Manager.  
    - **Description:** The Department Manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmations in the system. If everything is correct (quantities, pricing, budget alignment), the Manager approves the invoice.  
    - **Output:** Approval or rejection decision.

15. **Gateway 4: Manager Approval Granted?**  
    - **Decision Point:** Does the Department Manager approve the invoice?  
    - **Yes Path:** Proceed to Activity 9 (Schedule Payment).  
    - **No Path:** Proceed to Exception Path 4 (Manager Rejection Handling).

16. **Exception Path 4: Manager Rejection Handling**  
    - **Role:** Department Manager and AP Clerk.  
    - **Description:** If the Manager rejects the invoice (e.g., due to budget discrepancies or unexpected items), they notify the AP Clerk to investigate further. The AP Clerk may loop back to Purchasing or escalate to AP Supervisor for resolution.  
    - **Outcome:** Once resolved, return to Activity 8 for re-approval. If unresolvable, the invoice may be rejected permanently (end event).

17. **Activity 9: Schedule Payment**  
    - **Role:** AP Clerk.  
    - **Description:** The AP Clerk schedules the invoice for payment in the next payment cycle.  
    - **Output:** Payment schedule.

18. **End Event:**  
    - **Trigger:** Invoice is scheduled for payment.  
    - **Outcome:** Process completes for the invoice.

#### **Additional Exception Path 3: Escalation to AP Supervisor**  
- **Role:** AP Supervisor.  
- **Trigger:** Issues such as missing PO numbers, unresolved discrepancies, or informal service invoices that cannot be handled by AP Clerk or Purchasing.  
- **Description:** The AP Supervisor coordinates between departments, contacts suppliers, or works with department heads to create retrospective POs or decide on rejection.  
- **Outcome:** Once resolved, the invoice returns to the appropriate point in the main flow (e.g., Activity 2 or Gateway 2). If unresolvable, the invoice may be rejected (end event).

---

#### **Notes on Variations and Ambiguities:**
1. **Conflicting Accounts on Discrepancy Handling:**  
   - Mary (AP Clerk) mentions escalating discrepancies to her supervisor if unresolved, while Dan (Purchasing) suggests holding the invoice or contacting the supplier directly. The model incorporates both paths, prioritizing supplier contact first (via Purchasing or SRM) and escalating to the AP Supervisor only if unresolved.
2. **Role of SRM:**  
   - Karen (SRM) indicates involvement in supplier communication but not in the system directly. The model includes SRM as a supporting role in exception paths rather than a primary participant in the main flow.
3. **Manager Rejection Frequency:**  
   - Carlos (Department Manager) notes rejections are rare (once every couple of months). This is modeled as an exception path rather than a frequent occurrence.
4. **Informal Service Invoices:**  
   - Rita (AP Supervisor) mentions invoices without POs for informal services, requiring retrospective POs. This is captured as a specific case under Exception Path 3 (Escalation to AP Supervisor).

#### **Summary for Visualization:**
This textual model can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram with the following elements:  
- **Swimlanes** for each role (AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, SRM, System).  
- **Tasks** for each activity (e.g., "Check for PO Number," "Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services").  
- **Gateways** for decision points (diamond shapes for Yes/No decisions).  
- **Sequence Flows** to connect tasks and gateways in order.  
- **Data Objects** (e.g., Invoice, PO) attached to relevant tasks with data associations.  
- **Exception Flows** as alternate paths with annotations for clarity.

This model consolidates the perspectives from all interviewees into a coherent process flow, balancing detail with clarity, and explicitly notes exceptions and variations for accurate representation.
