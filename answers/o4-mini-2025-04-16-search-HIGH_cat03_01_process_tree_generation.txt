Here is the complete process tree, in the specified notation, modeling the entire patient-management scenario:

->(
  ->(
    ->( ->('A', 'RG'), 'IA' ),
    ->('TI', 'TC')
  ),
  ->(
    X('CE', 'FBP'),
    ->(
      X(
        tau,
        *(
          ->(
            'SC',
            ->( X('TM', 'SPT'), X('FCE', 'FBA') )
          ),
          tau
        )
      ),
      ->(
        +('AI', 'NC'),
        ->(
          'FAS',
          ->(
            'DDI',
            +('BL', +('ICP', 'MRF'))
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)

Explanation of the structure:

1. The very root is a sequence (->) of two children:
   - Left child: sequence of
     1. ARGIA (arrival, registration, intake assessment),
     2. TITC (triage interview, then classification).
   - Right child: sequence of everything that follows triage.

2. Immediately after triage, an exclusive choice X('CE','FBP') selects the initial diagnostic test.

3. Next is another exclusive choice X(tau, …) which either:
   - Takes the -branch (tau) to skip directly to normal-result activities if the initial test was normal, or
   - Enters the loop *(
       – Body: SC  [ choice of TM or SPT ]  [ choice of FCE or FBA ],
       – Re-entry: tau
     )
     which repeats specialist consultation  treatment choice  re-diagnostic test until results normalize.

4. Once normal results are in, the right-hand sequence continues:
   a. +('AI','NC')  
      – runs Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling in true concurrency,  
   b. 'FAS'  'DDI'  
      – schedules follow-up appointment then gives discharge instructions,  
   c. +('BL', +('ICP','MRF'))  
      – final concurrent block handling Billing in parallel with Insurance-Claims Processing and Medical-Records Finalization.

This tree faithfully captures the required sequences (), exclusive choices (X), parallelism (+), loops (*), and uses  (tau) for the silent step enabling both loop termination and optional skipping of the re-evaluation.
