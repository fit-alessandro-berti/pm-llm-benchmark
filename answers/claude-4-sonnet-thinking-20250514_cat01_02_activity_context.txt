## Analysis of Recurring Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same cases and have contextual differences:

### Activities Recurring Within Same Cases:
1. **"Verify Documents"** - appears twice in C001 and C003 with different purposes
2. **"Call Customer"** - appears twice in C002 with different objectives

### Activities with Different Contexts Across Cases:
1. **"Initiate Request"** - different channels (web portal vs. branch)
2. **"Call Customer"** - different purposes across all cases
3. **"Adjust Account"** - different triggers and contexts

## Justification for Naming Choices:

### 1. **"Verify Documents"  "Initial Document Verification" / "Re-verify Documents"**
- **Contextual clues**: The first occurrence is always the initial check, while subsequent occurrences happen after additional information is provided or account adjustments are made
- **Naming rationale**: Distinguishes between the first-time verification and follow-up verification activities

### 2. **"Call Customer"  Context-specific variants**
- **"Call Customer - Request Docs"**: Called to request missing documentation
- **"Call Customer - Clarify"**: Called to clarify account discrepancies
- **"Call Customer - Confirm"**: Called to confirm that adjustments were made correctly
- **"Call Customer - Request Return"**: Called to ask customer to return to branch
- **Contextual clues**: The additional context column clearly indicates different purposes for each call
- **Naming rationale**: Each call serves a distinct purpose in the workflow and should be tracked separately

### 3. **"Initiate Request"  "Initiate Request - Online" / "Initiate Request - Branch"**
- **Contextual clues**: Different resources (WebPortal vs. BranchReception) and context descriptions
- **Naming rationale**: The channel of initiation affects subsequent process steps and should be distinguished

### 4. **"Adjust Account"  Context-specific variants**
- **"Adjust Account - Post-Clarification"**: Adjustment made after clarifying with customer
- **"Adjust Account - Missing Info"**: Adjustment made due to missing information discovered during process
- **Contextual clues**: Different triggers and timing within the process flow
- **Naming rationale**: Understanding why adjustments are made is crucial for process improvement

This renaming approach ensures that each activity name clearly reflects its role and context within the process, enabling better process analysis and improvement initiatives.
