Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the provided event log, **Cases 2, 3, and 5** deviate from the intended process flow.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the deviations and the violated rules:

## Identified Deviating Cases and Violations

### Case 2 Violation

**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violated Normative Rule:** **Incorrect Sequence of Fulfillment Steps.**

The normative description explicitly states the required order for the fulfillment path: "...after confirming inventory, the process should include the **authorization of payment**, ensuring that the customer’s payment method is valid and approved. Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as **'Package items.'**"

*   **Expectation:** Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Package items.
*   **Case 2 Reality:** Package items $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment.

Case 2 violates the condition that payment authorization must occur before items are prepared for shipment.

### Case 3 Violation

**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Cancel order** $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violated Normative Rule:** **Execution of Fulfillment Activities Post-Cancellation.**

Case 3 follows the initial steps correctly but then transitions to cancellation: "If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order.'"

The description clearly warns: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping), and thus the next reasonable step is to 'Close order.'" Furthermore, the general constraints state that "**'Ship order' should... never after a cancellation.**"

*   **Expectation (Post-Cancellation):** Cancel order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Case 3 Reality:** Cancel order $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.

Case 3 incorrectly proceeds to ship the order after initiating the cancellation process.

### Case 5 Violation

**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.

**Violated Normative Rule:** **Missing Required Activity in Fulfillment Path.**

Case 5 follows the start of the fulfillment path (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize) but skips the packaging step before shipping.

The normative description for the fulfillment path mandates: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as **'Package items.'** **Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'**"

*   **Expectation (Fulfillment Path):** Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Package items $\rightarrow$ Ship order.
*   **Case 5 Reality:** Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Ship order (Skipping Package items).

Case 5 violates the rule requiring packaging to occur between payment authorization and shipping.

## Compliant Cases

**Case 1:** Compliant. Follows the ideal fulfillment path: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close.

**Case 4:** Compliant. Follows the cancellation path: Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close.
