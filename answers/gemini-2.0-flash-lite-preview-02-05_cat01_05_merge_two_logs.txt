Reasoning:
1. **Log Loading and Parsing**: Both logs are loaded as dataframes and timestamps are converted to datetime objects.
2. **Matching Criteria**: Events are matched based on 'order_id' and a timestamp tolerance of 2 seconds. This accounts for possible slight time differences.
3. **Merging**: When matches were found:
   - Log A timestamp is used as the primary timestamp for the merged event.
   - All available attributes from both logs are included in the merged records.
   - Event names from Log B are preserved as additional information. This allows to capture slight variations between both logs event name conventions (ex. OrderReceived vs. Order Received)
   - Unmatched events from each log are included in the final merged log with the source indicated ('Log A' or 'Log B').
4. **Timestamp Handling**: Timestamp differences within the tolerance are accepted as the same event.  The Log A timestamp is used for the merged event, but Log B's original timestamp is retained as a secondary timestamp (system_b_timestamp) for comparison.
5. **Event Name Handling:** The event names are unified with the log B naming convention, but the event_type name is kept for the log A event if matched.
6. **Missing Events**: Events found only in Log B (e.g., 'Quality Check') are included in the merged log, preserving the original event and attributes.
