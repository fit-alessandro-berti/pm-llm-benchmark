# Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for TechSolve Solutions' Resource Assignment Optimization

## Executive Summary

TechSolve Solutions faces significant operational challenges stemming from suboptimal resource assignment practices. This document presents a systematic, data-driven approach using process mining to analyze current resource behavior, identify bottlenecks, diagnose root causes, and develop actionable improvement strategies. The methodology leverages the rich event log data to transform resource management from reactive, rule-based assignment to intelligent, adaptive allocation.

---

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

### 1.1 Performance and Behavior Metrics Framework

To comprehensively understand resource behavior, I would establish a multi-dimensional metrics framework analyzing performance at individual, tier, and organizational levels.

#### **Individual Agent Metrics**

| Metric Category | Specific Metrics | Calculation Method | Purpose |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Workload Distribution** | Tickets handled per day/week | Count(Case IDs) per Resource per time period | Identify over/underutilization |
| | Active handling time ratio | Sum(Work End - Work Start) / Available time | Measure productive utilization |
| | Queue depth over time | Count of assigned but not started tickets | Real-time workload indicator |
| **Processing Efficiency** | Average handling time (AHT) | Mean(Work End - Work Start) by agent | Baseline for performance comparison |
| | AHT by ticket priority/category | Stratified AHT analysis | Identify specialization patterns |
| | Time to first response | Work Start - Assignment timestamp | Responsiveness measure |
| **Resolution Quality** | First-call resolution rate (L1) | Tickets resolved at L1 / Total L1 tickets | L1 effectiveness indicator |
| | Escalation rate | Escalations initiated / Tickets handled | Identifies over-escalation patterns |
| | Reassignment rate (outgoing) | Reassignments initiated / Tickets worked | Quality of initial handling |
| | Rework rate | Tickets reopened / Tickets resolved | Resolution quality measure |
| **Skill Alignment** | Skill match rate | Tickets where Agent Skill matches Required Skill / Total | Assignment accuracy |
| | Skill utilization efficiency | Time spent on skill-matched work / Total work time | Specialist optimization |

#### **Tier-Level Metrics**

```
Tier Performance Analysis:
 L1 Tier
    First-Contact Resolution Rate = Resolved at L1 / Total L1 Tickets
    Appropriate Escalation Rate = Necessary Escalations / Total Escalations
    Average Queue Wait Time
    Throughput Rate (tickets/hour)
 L2 Tier
    Resolution Rate = Resolved at L2 / Escalated to L2
    L3 Escalation Rate
    Average Resolution Time by Skill Category
    Bounce-Back Rate (returned to L1)
 L3 Tier
     Complex Case Handling Time
     Involvement in "Below-Level" Tasks
     Knowledge Transfer Activities
```

#### **Extraction Queries (Conceptual)**

For workload distribution analysis:
```sql
SELECT 
    Resource,
    Agent_Tier,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Case_ID) as Tickets_Handled,
    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Work_Start, Work_End)) as Avg_Handling_Time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Activity = 'Reassign' THEN 1 END) as Reassignments_Initiated,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Activity LIKE 'Escalate%' THEN 1 END) as Escalations
FROM Event_Log
WHERE Timestamp_Type IN ('START', 'COMPLETE')
GROUP BY Resource, Agent_Tier
```

### 1.2 Process Mining Techniques for Pattern Discovery

#### **Resource Interaction Analysis**

Using the event log, I would construct a **handover-of-work matrix** to visualize actual assignment patterns:

```
Handover Matrix (from  to):
                 L1-Pool  L2-Network  L2-App  L2-Database  L3-Specialists
L1-Pool             15%       25%      30%        20%           10%
L2-Network           2%        5%       8%        12%           15%
L2-App               3%        7%       4%        18%           12%
L2-Database          1%        3%       6%         2%           20%
```

This matrix reveals:
- **Escalation pathways**: Which L1 agents escalate to which L2 specialists
- **Cross-tier handovers**: Unexpected patterns like L2L1 bounce-backs
- **Clustering behaviors**: Whether certain agents form informal working relationships

#### **Social Network Analysis (SNA) Based on Handovers**

I would apply SNA metrics to understand resource collaboration:

1. **Degree Centrality**: Agents with highest handover connections (potential bottlenecks or coordinators)
2. **Betweenness Centrality**: Agents who frequently serve as intermediaries in ticket flow
3. **Clustering Coefficient**: Groups of agents who frequently collaborate

```
SNA Visualization Approach:
- Nodes: Individual agents (sized by ticket volume)
- Edges: Handover relationships (weighted by frequency)
- Colors: Agent tier (L1=blue, L2=green, L3=red)
- Edge thickness: Volume of handovers
```

**Expected Findings:**
- Identification of "hub" agents who receive disproportionate handovers
- Discovery of informal escalation paths bypassing official channels
- Detection of isolated agents receiving few tickets despite availability

#### **Role Discovery and Conformance Analysis**

Using organizational mining techniques, I would:

1. **Mine actual roles** based on activity patterns:
   - Group agents by similar activity profiles
   - Compare discovered roles against intended tier assignments

2. **Identify role deviations**:
   - L2 agents performing primarily L1-type activities
   - L3 specialists handling routine tickets
   - L1 agents successfully resolving complex issues (potential promotion candidates)

**Comparison Framework: Intended vs. Actual Assignment Logic**

| Aspect | Intended Logic | Actual Pattern (Discovered) | Gap Analysis |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Initial Assignment | Round-robin within tier | Preference for certain agents | Workload imbalance |
| Escalation Criteria | Skill-based | Often based on availability | Skill mismatches |
| L2 Specialization | Skill-specific queues | Generalist handling | Underutilized expertise |
| Priority Handling | P1/P2 prioritized | FIFO within queues | SLA risk |

### 1.3 Skill Utilization Analysis

To assess whether specialized skills are used effectively:

#### **Skill-Task Alignment Analysis**

```
For each completed ticket:
  Match Score = 
    If Required_Skill IN Agent_Skills: "Aligned"
    Else If Agent_Tier > Required_Tier: "Overqualified"  
    Else: "Misaligned"

Aggregate by Agent and Skill:
  Specialist_Overhead_Rate = 
    Time_On_Below_Level_Tasks / Total_Working_Time
```

#### **Skill Utilization Dashboard Metrics**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Skill Match Rate | Aligned Tasks / Total Tasks | >85% |
| Specialist Utilization | Time on matched-skill tasks / Total time | >75% |
| L3 Overhead Ratio | L3 time on L1/L2 tasks / Total L3 time | <15% |
| Cross-Training Indicator | Successful resolutions outside primary skill | Identify training opportunities |

**Analysis Approach:**
```
SELECT 
    Agent_Skills,
    Required_Skill,
    COUNT(*) as Ticket_Count,
    AVG(Resolution_Time) as Avg_Resolution,
    CASE 
        WHEN Agent_Skills LIKE '%' || Required_Skill || '%' THEN 'Matched'
        ELSE 'Mismatched'
    END as Skill_Alignment
FROM Event_Log
WHERE Activity = 'Work_End' AND Timestamp_Type = 'COMPLETE'
GROUP BY Agent_Skills, Required_Skill, Skill_Alignment
```

---

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

### 2.1 Bottleneck Identification Framework

Based on the analysis framework above, I would systematically identify resource-related problems:

#### **Bottleneck Type 1: Skill Availability Constraints**

**Detection Method:**
- Calculate queue wait times segmented by required skill
- Identify skills with consistently long wait times despite available agents

**Quantification:**
```
Skill Bottleneck Score = 
    (Avg Wait Time for Skill X) / (Overall Avg Wait Time) × 
    (Volume of Skill X Tickets) / (Total Ticket Volume)

Critical Threshold: Score > 2.0 indicates severe bottleneck
```

**Expected Findings (Hypothetical):**
| Required Skill | Avg Wait Time | Volume % | Bottleneck Score | Status |
|---------------|---------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Networking-Firewall | 4.2 hours | 18% | 3.1 | **Critical** |
| Security-IAM | 3.8 hours | 12% | 2.4 | **High** |
| Database-SQL | 2.1 hours | 15% | 1.3 | Moderate |
| App-CRM | 1.5 hours | 22% | 0.9 | Normal |

#### **Bottleneck Type 2: Reassignment Delays**

**Analysis Approach:**
```
For each reassignment event:
  Reassignment_Delay = Next_Work_Start - Reassignment_Timestamp
  Cumulative_Delay = SUM(Reassignment_Delays) per Case

Impact Analysis:
  Tickets with 2 reassignments vs. 0-1 reassignments:
  - Compare SLA compliance rates
  - Calculate average additional cycle time
```

**Quantified Impact (Hypothetical):**
| Reassignment Count | % of Tickets | Avg Resolution Time | SLA Compliance |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0 | 35% | 2.4 hours | 94% |
| 1 | 40% | 4.8 hours | 78% |
| 2 | 18% | 8.2 hours | 52% |
| 3+ | 7% | 14.6 hours | 23% |

**Key Finding:** Each reassignment adds approximately 3.2 hours to average resolution time

#### **Bottleneck Type 3: Incorrect Initial Assignment Impact**

**Detection Logic:**
```
Incorrect_Initial_Assignment = 
    Cases where:
    - First assignment activity followed by Escalate within < 30 minutes
    - OR first assigned agent skill  required skill
    - OR ticket bounced back to lower tier

Impact Calculation:
  Additional_Time = Time_to_Correct_Assignment + Queue_Wait_at_Correct_Tier
```

**Correlation Analysis:**
```
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Initial_Skill_Match = 'Yes' THEN 'Correct Initial Assignment'
        ELSE 'Incorrect Initial Assignment'
    END as Assignment_Quality,
    COUNT(*) as Ticket_Count,
    AVG(Resolution_Time_Hours) as Avg_Resolution,
    SUM(CASE WHEN SLA_Breached = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) as SLA_Breach_Rate
FROM Processed_Tickets
GROUP BY Assignment_Quality
```

#### **Bottleneck Type 4: Agent Workload Imbalance**

**Gini Coefficient Analysis:**
```
Calculate workload distribution inequality:
  Gini_Coefficient = 
    (|xi - xj|) / (2n²)
    
  Where:
    xi, xj = individual agent workloads
    n = number of agents
     = mean workload

Interpretation:
  0.0 = Perfect equality
  0.3-0.4 = Moderate inequality (typical target)
  >0.5 = High inequality (problematic)
```

**Workload Variance Analysis:**

| Tier | Agent Count | Avg Tickets/Day | Std Dev | CV (CoV) | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------|----------|--------|
| L1 | 25 | 18.5 | 8.2 | 0.44 | **High variance** |
| L2 | 15 | 8.2 | 5.1 | 0.62 | **Very high variance** |
| L3 | 5 | 3.5 | 2.8 | 0.80 | **Critical imbalance** |

### 2.2 SLA Breach Correlation Analysis

**Multi-Factor Correlation Matrix:**

```
SLA Breach Predictors (Logistic Regression Variables):
  - Initial_Skill_Match (binary)
  - Reassignment_Count (integer)
  - Queue_Wait_Time (continuous)
  - Agent_Workload_at_Assignment (continuous)
  - Ticket_Priority (categorical)
  - Time_of_Day (categorical)
  - Channel (categorical)
```

**Hypothetical Correlation Results:**

| Factor | Correlation with SLA Breach | Statistical Significance |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Reassignment Count | r = 0.68 | p < 0.001 |
| Initial Skill Mismatch | r = 0.54 | p < 0.001 |
| Agent Overload (>20 tickets) | r = 0.47 | p < 0.001 |
| Queue Wait Time | r = 0.42 | p < 0.001 |
| Off-hours submission | r = 0.31 | p < 0.01 |

**Key Insight:** 72% of SLA breaches can be attributed to reassignment issues and skill mismatches combined.

### 2.3 Comprehensive Issue Summary

```
Resource-Related Issues Impact Summary:

 Issue                            Frequency     Avg Delay Impact SLA Impact     

 Skill-based queue bottleneck     35% tickets   +2.8 hours       +18% breach    
 Incorrect initial assignment     28% tickets   +3.5 hours       +22% breach    
 Multiple reassignments           25% tickets   +5.2 hours       +31% breach    
 Specialist underutilization      40% L3 time   N/A              Opportunity    
 Agent workload imbalance         All tiers     Variable         +12% breach    

```

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

### 3.1 Potential Root Causes Framework

I would investigate the following root cause categories using structured analysis:

#### **Root Cause Category 1: Deficient Assignment Rules**

**Current State Analysis:**
```
Assignment Rule Audit:
 L1 Assignment
    Finding: Pure round-robin, ignores ticket category or urgency
 L2 Escalation
    Finding: Manual selection by L1 agent (subjective)
 Skill Matching
    Finding: No automated skill-to-ticket matching
 Workload Balancing
     Finding: No real-time workload consideration
```

**Evidence from Event Log:**
- Round-robin pattern visible in sequential assignments regardless of ticket type
- High variance in agent-skill match rates (suggests manual override patterns)
- No correlation between agent availability and assignment probability

#### **Root Cause Category 2: Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles**

**Detection Approach:**
```
Skill Profile Accuracy Analysis:
  For each Agent:
    Documented_Skills = Skills listed in system
    Demonstrated_Skills = Skills of tickets successfully resolved
    
    Profile_Accuracy = 
      |Documented  Demonstrated| / |Documented  Demonstrated|
    
    Gaps:
      - Undocumented skills: Demonstrated - Documented
      - Unvalidated skills: Documented - Demonstrated
```

**Hypothetical Findings:**

| Issue Type | Occurrence Rate | Impact |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| Missing skills in profile | 23% of agents | Underutilization |
| Outdated skills listed | 18% of agents | Assignment failures |
| Proficiency level not captured | 100% of profiles | Mismatched complexity |

#### **Root Cause Category 3: Poor Initial Ticket Categorization**

**Analysis Method:**
```
Categorization Accuracy:
  Initial_Category = Category at ticket creation
  Final_Category = Category at resolution
  Required_Skill_Changes = Count of skill requirement modifications
  
  Misclassification_Rate = 
    Tickets where Initial  Final / Total Tickets
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Track tickets where `Required_Skill` changes during lifecycle
- Identify common misclassification patterns (e.g., "Network" issues often reclassified to "Security")

#### **Root Cause Category 4: Limited Real-Time Visibility**

**Current State Assessment:**
- No event log evidence of workload-based decisions
- Fixed assignment pools regardless of queue depth
- No dynamic reallocation patterns observed

#### **Root Cause Category 5: L1 Training and Empowerment Gaps**

**Evidence Identification:**
```
L1 Capability Analysis:
  Escalated_But_Simple = Tickets escalated by L1 but resolved 
                         at L2 in < 15 minutes
  
  Training_Opportunity_Rate = 
    Escalated_But_Simple / Total_L1_Escalations
```

### 3.2 Variant Analysis for Assignment Quality

**Approach:** Compare cases with smooth assignments (0-1 handovers, within SLA) against problematic cases (multiple reassignments, SLA breach)

#### **Variant Definition:**

```
Smooth Variant:
  - Reassignment count  1
  - SLA met
  - Initial skill match = Yes
  
Problematic Variant:
  - Reassignment count  2
  - OR SLA breached
  - OR multiple escalations
```

#### **Comparative Analysis:**

| Attribute | Smooth Variant (n=4,200) | Problematic Variant (n=2,800) | Difference |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Avg Case Duration | 3.2 hours | 12.8 hours | +300% |
| Initial Skill Match | 89% | 34% | **-55%** |
| Created during peak hours | 45% | 62% | +17% |
| Complex category (Network/Security) | 28% | 51% | **+23%** |
| Initial agent workload >15 tickets | 22% | 58% | **+36%** |
| L1 handling time <10 min before escalate | 31% | 67% | **+36%** |

**Key Variant Insights:**
1. Skill mismatch at initial assignment is the strongest predictor of problematic outcomes
2. Tickets in Network/Security categories are disproportionately problematic
3. Agent workload at time of assignment significantly impacts outcomes
4. Very short L1 handling times before escalation suggest either correct quick escalation OR premature escalation

### 3.3 Decision Mining for Assignment Factors

**Decision Point Analysis:**

Using decision tree mining on escalation decisions:

```
Decision Point: "Escalate from L1 to L2"

Input Features:
  - Ticket_Category
  - Ticket_Priority
  - L1_Handling_Time
  - Initial_Description_Keywords
  - Agent_Skills
  - Time_of_Day
  - Agent_Workload

Target: Escalation_Necessary (validated by L2 resolution outcome)
```

**Mined Decision Rules (Hypothetical):**

```
IF Ticket_Category = 'Network' AND Priority IN (P1, P2)
  THEN Escalate = True (Confidence: 94%)

IF L1_Handling_Time > 25 min AND Resolution_Not_Achieved
  THEN Escalate = True (Confidence: 87%)

IF Ticket_Category = 'Software-App' AND Description_Contains('password', 'login')
  THEN Escalate = False (L1 can resolve) (Confidence: 82%)

IF Agent_Workload > 18 AND Priority = P3
  THEN Reassign_to_Available_L1 (Confidence: 71%)
```

**Root Cause Summary Tree:**

```
SLA Breaches & Reassignment Issues
 Assignment Rule Deficiencies (40% contribution)
    Round-robin ignores skills
    No workload consideration
 Skill Profile Inaccuracies (25% contribution)
    Missing skills
    No proficiency levels
 Poor Ticket Categorization (20% contribution)
    Vague initial descriptions
    Incorrect category selection
 L1 Training Gaps (10% contribution)
    Excessive escalation of resolvable issues
 Visibility Limitations (5% contribution)
     No real-time workload awareness
```

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Based on the process mining analysis, I propose five distinct strategies to address identified issues:

### Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing with Proficiency Weighting

#### **Issue Addressed:**
- Skill mismatches in initial assignments (contributing to 55% difference in outcomes)
- Specialist underutilization
- Reassignments due to incorrect skill matching

#### **Strategy Description:**

Implement an automated skill-based routing engine that:
1. Matches ticket `Required_Skill` to agent `Agent_Skills`
2. Weights assignments by proficiency level (Expert > Proficient > Basic)
3. Considers skill adjacencies (related skills for backup routing)

#### **Implementation Logic:**

```
Skill Matching Algorithm:

Input: Ticket T with Required_Skill RS, Priority P
Output: Optimal Agent A

1. Generate Candidate Pool:
   Candidates = {A | RS  A.Skills AND A.Available = True}

2. Score Each Candidate:
   Score(A) = 
     Proficiency_Weight(A, RS) × 0.4 +
     Historical_Success_Rate(A, RS) × 0.3 +
     Current_Workload_Factor(A) × 0.2 +
     Tier_Appropriateness(A, T.Complexity) × 0.1

3. Proficiency Weights:
   Expert = 1.0, Proficient = 0.7, Basic = 0.4

4. Select Agent:
   IF P  {P1, P2}: A = argmax(Score) // Best match for high priority
   ELSE: A = WeightedRandom(Score)   // Load distribution for lower priority

5. Fallback:
   IF Candidates = :
     Expand to Adjacent_Skills OR Escalate to next tier
```

#### **Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Source | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Agent skill profiles | HR/Config system | Matching foundation |
| Skill proficiency levels | Training records + mined performance | Weighting |
| Historical resolution rates by skill | Event log analysis | Success prediction |
| Skill adjacency matrix | Expert input + correlation mining | Fallback routing |
| Real-time availability | Integration with scheduling system | Candidate filtering |

#### **Process Mining Leverage:**
- Mine historical success rates per agent-skill combination
- Discover skill adjacencies through successful reassignment patterns
- Calibrate proficiency weights using resolution time and quality data

#### **Expected Benefits:**
- **25-35% reduction** in skill-mismatch reassignments
- **15-20% improvement** in first-tier resolution rate
- **Estimated 2.1 hours reduction** in average resolution time for mismatched tickets

---

### Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment

#### **Issue Addressed:**
- Agent workload imbalance (Gini coefficient >0.5)
- Queue buildup during peak periods
- Burnout risk for overloaded agents

#### **Strategy Description:**

Implement real-time workload balancing that considers:
1. Current open ticket count per agent
2. Estimated remaining work (based on ticket complexity)
3. Agent capacity thresholds
4. Time-based workload normalization

#### **Implementation Logic:**

```
Workload-Aware Assignment:

Input: New Ticket T, Candidate Pool C (from Strategy 1)
Output: Assigned Agent A

1. Calculate Real-Time Workload:
   For each agent A in C:
     Current_Load(A) = (Expected_Remaining_Time per open ticket)
     Capacity_Ratio(A) = Current_Load(A) / A.Daily_Capacity

2. Apply Workload Penalty:
   IF Capacity_Ratio(A) > 0.8:
     Score_Penalty = (Capacity_Ratio - 0.8) × 2  // Heavy penalty
   ELSE IF Capacity_Ratio(A) > 0.6:
     Score_Penalty = (Capacity_Ratio - 0.6) × 0.5  // Light penalty
   ELSE:
     Score_Penalty = 0

3. Adjusted Assignment Score:
   Final_Score(A) = Skill_Score(A) - Score_Penalty

4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:
   IF Queue_Depth > High_Threshold:
     Expand candidate pool to adjacent tiers
     Reduce capacity thresholds temporarily

5. Select Agent with Highest Final_Score
```

#### **Workload Estimation Model:**

```
Expected_Handling_Time = f(Priority, Category, Complexity_Score)

Where Complexity_Score derived from:
  - Ticket description length
  - Keywords indicating complexity
  - Historical resolution times for similar tickets
```

#### **Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Source | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Open ticket inventory | Real-time ticketing system | Current load calculation |
| Historical handling times | Event log | Expected time estimation |
| Agent capacity configuration | Management input | Threshold setting |
| Complexity indicators | NLP on descriptions + history | Time prediction |

#### **Process Mining Leverage:**
- Mine average handling times by ticket characteristics
- Identify complexity indicators from case attributes
- Discover peak load patterns for proactive capacity planning

#### **Expected Benefits:**
- **40-50% reduction** in workload variance (improved Gini coefficient)
- **12-18% reduction** in agent overtime
- **8-12% improvement** in SLA compliance during peak periods

---

### Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Using Machine Learning

#### **Issue Addressed:**
- Poor initial ticket categorization
- Inability to anticipate required skills from ticket description
- Reactive rather than proactive assignment

#### **Strategy Description:**

Deploy a machine learning model that:
1. Analyzes ticket description and metadata at creation
2. Predicts required skills and complexity level
3. Recommends optimal initial assignment tier and agent

#### **Model Architecture:**

```
Predictive Assignment Model:

Input Features:
  - Ticket description (text  embeddings)
  - Category (selected by user)
  - Priority
  - Submission channel
  - Customer history features
  - Time-based features (hour, day of week)

Output Predictions:
  1. Required_Skill (multi-label classification)
  2. Complexity_Score (regression: 1-10)
  3. Recommended_Tier (L1/L2/L3)
  4. Estimated_Resolution_Time

Model Type: 
  - NLP component: BERT or similar for description encoding
  - Classification head: Multi-layer neural network
  - Calibrated confidence scores for uncertainty quantification
```

#### **Training Approach:**

```
Training Data Generation from Event Log:
  - Features: Initial ticket attributes
  - Labels: 
    - Actual resolving agent's skills
    - Actual resolution time
    - Final tier that resolved
    - Whether reassignment occurred (quality signal)

Validation Strategy:
  - Time-based split (train on older data, validate on recent)
  - Evaluate on reassignment reduction, not just accuracy
```

#### **Decision Logic with Confidence:**

```
IF Confidence(Required_Skill_Prediction) > 0.85:
  Apply direct skill-based routing (Strategy 1)
ELSE IF Confidence > 0.6:
  Route to L1 with flagged complexity for monitoring
ELSE:
  Apply enhanced triage process with human review
```

#### **Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Source | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Historical tickets with descriptions | Event log + ticket system | Training data |
| Resolution outcomes | Event log | Ground truth labels |
| Customer interaction history | CRM integration | Feature enrichment |
| Model performance metrics | Continuous monitoring | Model maintenance |

#### **Process Mining Leverage:**
- Generate labeled training data from resolved ticket histories
- Identify feature patterns that predict complexity through variant analysis
- Continuous model refinement using new resolution data

#### **Expected Benefits:**
- **30-40% improvement** in initial categorization accuracy
- **20-25% reduction** in L1-to-L2 unnecessary escalations
- **Enables proactive specialist allocation** based on incoming ticket predictions

---

### Strategy 4: Data-Driven Escalation Criteria Refinement

#### **Issue Addressed:**
- Excessive escalation of L1-resolvable issues (identified as 35% of escalations)
- Inconsistent escalation decisions across L1 agents
- Specialist time wasted on basic issues

#### **Strategy Description:**

Develop explicit, data-driven escalation guidelines that:
1. Define objective criteria for when escalation is appropriate
2. Provide L1 agents with resolution pathways for common escalation patterns
3. Implement escalation validation checkpoints

#### **Escalation Criteria Development:**

Based on decision mining results:

```
Escalation Decision Framework:

MANDATORY ESCALATION (Route immediately):
 Priority P1 or P2 with Category = Security
 Ticket type in {Server-Down, Data-Breach, Network-Outage}
 VIP customer flag = True AND Priority  P2
 Required skill explicitly identified as L2+

CONDITIONAL ESCALATION (After L1 attempt):
 IF L1_Handling_Time > 20 minutes WITHOUT progress indicators
 IF Troubleshooting_Steps_Completed  3 AND unresolved
 IF Customer explicitly requests specialist
 IF Similar_Tickets (by description) historically required L2+

L1 RESOLUTION PATH (Do not escalate without attempt):
 Password resets (all applications)
 Basic software reinstallation
 Standard access requests (predefined workflows)
 Known-error resolutions (knowledge base matches)
 IF Historical_L1_Resolution_Rate for similar tickets > 70%
```

#### **Implementation Components:**

```
1. Escalation Checklist (UI Integration):
   Before escalation, agent must confirm:
   [ ] Checked knowledge base for solution
   [ ] Completed standard troubleshooting steps
   [ ] Issue does not match L1-resolvable patterns
   [ ] Documented attempted resolution steps

2. Smart Escalation Suggestions:
   System displays:
   - "Similar tickets resolved at L1: 78%"
   - "Suggested resolution path: [link]"
   - "Recommended L2 specialist if escalating: Agent B12"

3. Escalation Quality Feedback:
   Track L2 resolution time after escalation
   IF L2_Resolution_Time < 10 minutes:
     Flag as "potential unnecessary escalation"
     Include in L1 training feedback
```

#### **Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Source | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Historical escalation outcomes | Event log | Criteria calibration |
| L1 resolution success patterns | Process mining analysis | Identify L1-capable issues |
| Knowledge base effectiveness | KB usage logs | Resolution path validation |
| Similar ticket identification | Text similarity + attributes | Guidance provision |

#### **Process Mining Leverage:**
- Mine successful L1 resolutions to expand L1-resolvable issue types
- Identify patterns in unnecessary escalations through variant analysis
- Continuous refinement of criteria based on outcome monitoring

#### **Expected Benefits:**
- **20-30% reduction** in unnecessary escalations
- **15-25% increase** in L1 first-call resolution rate
- **Reclaimed specialist capacity** equivalent to 1-2 FTE at L2/L3

### Strategy 5: Dynamic Tier Reallocation Based on Demand Patterns

#### **Issue Addressed:**
- Fixed tier capacity despite variable demand patterns
- Queue buildup during peak periods
- Underutilization during off-peak times

#### **Strategy Description:**

Implement dynamic resource reallocation that:
1. Monitors real-time queue depth and incoming ticket rates
2. Triggers tier boundary adjustments based on thresholds
3. Enables qualified agents to temporarily shift roles

#### **Dynamic Reallocation Framework:**

```
Demand Monitoring Dashboard:

Real-Time Metrics:
 L1 Queue Depth + Incoming Rate
 L2 Queue Depth by Skill Category
 L3 Queue Depth
 SLA Risk Score (tickets approaching breach)
 Available Agent Capacity by Tier

Reallocation Triggers:
IF L2_Queue_Depth > 2× Normal AND L1_Queue_Depth < 0.5× Normal:
  THEN Promote qualified L1 agents to L2-Support role
  
IF Specific_Skill_Queue > Critical_Threshold:
  THEN Alert cross-trained agents in other skills
  THEN Consider temporary specialist callback

Qualification for Temporary Promotion:
  - Historical success rate in target category > 75%
  - Completion of relevant training modules
  - Manager approval (pre-configured or real-time)
```

#### **Agent Flexibility Classification:**

```
Agent Flexibility Profiles:

 Agent        Primary Role     Secondary Role   Flex Capacity  

 Agent A05    L1-General       L2-App (Basic)   Medium         
 Agent B12    L2-App-CRM       L2-Database      High           
 Agent B08    L2-Network       L1-Overflow      Medium         
 Agent C02    L3-Security      L2-Security      Low (escalated)

```

#### **Shift Patterns Optimization:**

```
Demand Pattern Analysis:
  Peak_Hours: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM (20% higher volume)
  Peak_Days: Monday, Tuesday (15% higher volume)
  Low_Periods: Friday afternoon, weekends

Recommended Shift Adjustments:
  - Increase L2-Network coverage Mon-Tue mornings
  - Cross-train additional L1 for App-CRM (high volume category)
  - Stagger L3 availability to cover extended hours
```

#### **Data Requirements:**

| Data Element | Source | Purpose |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Historical volume patterns | Event log time-series | Demand forecasting |
| Agent skill versatility | Training + performance records | Flex capacity |
| Real-time queue metrics | Ticketing system API | Trigger monitoring |
| Agent availability schedules | HR/Scheduling system | Capacity planning |

#### **Process Mining Leverage:**
- Mine historical demand patterns by time, day, season
- Identify successful cross-tier resolution patterns
- Discover agent versatility through actual performance data

#### **Expected Benefits:**
- **20-30% reduction** in peak-period queue times
- **15-20% improvement** in resource utilization efficiency
- **Better SLA compliance** during demand spikes
- **Increased agent skill development** through controlled exposure

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### 5.1 Business Process Simulation for Strategy Evaluation

Before implementing changes, I recommend using process simulation to evaluate potential impacts:

#### **Simulation Model Construction**

```
Simulation Components (Based on Mined Models):

1. Process Model:
   - Discovered process map with transition probabilities
   - Activity duration distributions (per tier, skill, priority)
   - Escalation and reassignment probabilities

2. Resource Model:
   - Agent pool by tier with skills
   - Capacity constraints and schedules
   - Performance distributions per agent

3. Arrival Model:
   - Ticket arrival rates by time pattern (Poisson process)
   - Category and priority distributions
   - Seasonal and trend factors

4. Assignment Rules:
   - Current: Round-robin (baseline)
   - Proposed: Each strategy as alternative configuration
```

#### **Simulation Scenarios**

| Scenario | Configuration | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Baseline | Current assignment rules | Benchmark |
| Scenario A | Skill-based routing only | Strategy 1 impact |
| Scenario B | Skill + Workload balancing | Strategies 1+2 combined |
| Scenario C | Full predictive assignment | Strategy 3 impact |
| Scenario D | All strategies combined | Maximum improvement estimate |
| Stress Test | 130% volume + all strategies | Capacity validation |

#### **Simulation Execution Framework**

```
For each scenario:
  1. Configure simulation model with appropriate rules
  2. Run 100+ replications (Monte Carlo)
  3. Warm-up period: 2 simulated weeks
  4. Measurement period: 6 simulated months
  5. Collect KPIs:
     - Resolution times by priority
     - SLA compliance rates
     - Reassignment counts
     - Queue depths over time
     - Resource utilization rates
  6. Statistical comparison vs. baseline
  7. Sensitivity analysis on key parameters
```
