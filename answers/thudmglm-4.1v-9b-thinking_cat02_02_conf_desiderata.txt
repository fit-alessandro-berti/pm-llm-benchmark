<answer>### 1. Identify which cases are violating the normative rules and explain the reasons.  


**Case 1**: Does *not* violate the normative rules.  
Explanation: All activities follow the strict sequence (`Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`), and all ordering rules are satisfied:  
- Credit Check (09:30) occurs before Risk Assessment (10:00).  
- Risk Assessment (10:00) occurs before Loan Decision (11:00).  
- Inform Applicant (13:00) occurs after Loan Decision (11:00).  
- For approved loans, Finalize Documentation (13:30) occurs before Close Case (14:00).  
No skipping, reversing, or contradictory actions (e.g., finalization after rejection) occur.  


**Case 2**: *Violates* the normative rules.  
Reasons:  
- **Skipped step/classification**: Credit Check occurred *before* Risk Assessment, but the rule requires *Credit Check* to happen *before* *Risk Assessment*. The sequence was `Application  Risk Assessment  Credit Check` (violating the required order).  
- **Missing activity**: The “Inform Applicant” step is not recorded in the log, but the normative rule requires it *after* Loan Decision.  
- **Contradictory action**: Finalized documentation after a rejected loan (Loan Decision is “Rejected,” but documentation occurred *before* closing the case).  


**Case 3**: Does *not* violate the normative rules.  
Explanation: All activities follow the strict sequence (`Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`), and no actions are skipped, reversed, or contradictory (e.g., documentation for rejected loans, though not required here as the loan is approved). The only issues here are *desideratum* violations (not normative rules).  


### 2. Identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions. (Clarify as suboptimal behavior.)  

Desiderata (recommended practices) include:  
- Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received.  
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision.  
- Follow-up Call before closing (encouraged, not required).  

**Case 1**: *Does not fail* the desiderata.  
Explanation:  
- Credit Check (09:30) occurs ~30 minutes after Application Received (well under 24 hours).  
- Inform Applicant (13:00) occurs ~2 hours after Loan Decision (well under 48 hours).  
- No follow-up call is required (and one is not listed), so this is not a failure.  

**Case 2**: *Fails* the desiderata.  
Explanation:  
- **Missing/late Inform Applicant**: The log does not show the “Inform Applicant” step, and since Loan Decision occurred on the same day as Credit Check, failing to inform the applicant violates the “inform after loan decision” timeline.  
- Suboptimal timing (not directly measurable here due to missing data but logically suboptimal).  

**Case 3**: *Fails* the desiderata.  
Explanation:  
- **Credit Check late**: Credit Check (10:00, 2024-01-14) occurred ~1.5 days after Application Received (2024-01-12), exceeding the “within 24 hours” recommendation.  
- **Inform Applicant late**: Inform Applicant (15:00, 2024-01-16) occurred ~4 hours after Loan Decision (12:00, 2024-01-14), exceeding the “within 48 hours” recommendation.  
- No follow-up call, which is “encouraged” but not required.  


### 3. When possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations.  

**Case 1**:  
- **Justification for optimal compliance**: The process followed strict rules with minimal delays (e.g., credit check in 30 minutes, applicant informed in 2 hours). This likely reflects well-optimized workflows and adherence to both normative rules and desirable timing.  

**Case 2**:  
- **Normative violation (skipped credit check)**: Possible interpretation—human error, misprioritization of tasks, or a system glitch caused Risk Assessment to happen before Credit Check.  
- **Normative violation (finalizing documentation for rejection)**: Likely a processing error (e.g., misclassifying loan approval as rejection, or a staff oversight) despite strict rules disallowing it.  
- **Desideratum failure (missing Inform Applicant)**: Administrative lag, communication breakdown, or lack of emphasis on prompt communication with applicants (though this is a normative rule, not just a desideratum).  

**Case 3**:  
- **Desideratum violation (late credit check)**: The credit check process took longer than expected (e.g., due to Peaks, missing documents, or complex credit verification), causing a delay beyond the 24-hour recommendation.  
- **Desideratum violation (late inform applicant)**: Processing delays between Loan Decision and communication (a common issue in backlogged systems) led to exceeding the 48-hour timing recommendation.  
- **Normative compliance**: Despite timing issues, all steps were done *in order* and no contradictory actions occurred (e.g., finalizing documentation for approved loans, closing cases appropriately).  

Each case’s deviations—from normative rules or desiderata—reflect a mix of strict compliance with core requirements (no normative violations in Cases 1/3) and suboptimal execution of recommended practices (desideratum failures in all but Case 1).
