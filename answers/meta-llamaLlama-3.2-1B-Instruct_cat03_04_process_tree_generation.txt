Here is the Python code that implements a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process in pm4py:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

class PurchaseToPay(ProcessTree):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent=parent)
        self.label = "Purchase-to-Pay"

    def get_operator(self):
        return Operator.PARALLEL

    def get_operator_description(self):
        return "Parallel execution of Purchase steps"

    def get_operator_trace(self):
        # Replace with your actual operator implementation
        # For example, a loop with two steps
        seq1 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=self)
        seq2 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=seq1)
        return [seq1, seq2]

    def get_children(self):
        return [
            ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=self),
            ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=self),
            ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=self),
        ]

    def get_edge(self, child, parent):
        if child.operator == Operator.LOOP:
            # Loop with two steps
            seq1 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=child)
            seq2 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=seq1)
            return [seq1, seq2]
        return []

    def on_member_init(self, parent, member):
        if member.label in ['A', 'B', 'C']:
            # When a leaf node is created, add its operator to the parent's operator set
            parent.add_operator(member.get_operator())
```
This implementation defines a `PurchaseToPay` class that inherits from `ProcessTree`. It has the following properties:

* `label`: the label of the process tree (set to "Purchase-to-Pay")
* `operator`: the operator of the process tree (set to `Operator.PARALLEL`)
* `children`: a list of child process trees
* `on_member_init`: a method that is called when a leaf node is created. It adds the operator of the leaf node to its parent's operator set.

The `get_operator_trace` method returns a list of ProcessTree objects, where each object represents a sequence of steps. The `get_edge` method returns a list of edges that connect the current process tree to its children.

Note that this is just an example implementation, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific requirements. Additionally, you may need to add additional code to handle the operators, such as the `Sequence` and `XOR` operators, which have their own implementation in the `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.Operator` module.
