The diagram illustrates a process flow involving two main components: a credit scoring agent and a scoring service. The overall structure is divided into two sections, each representing one of these components. Key components include rectangles representing processes, diamonds representing decision points, and circles indicating start and end points. Labels such as 'scoring request received,' 'compute credit score (level 1),' and 'send credit score' describe the actions taken at each step. The flow begins with the credit scoring agent receiving a scoring request and proceeds through various stages, including processing and decision-making, before either sending a credit score or reporting a delay. The scoring service follows a similar pattern, starting with receiving a scoring request and moving through computation and decision steps, ultimately sending the credit score or reporting delays. The interactions between these components are depicted with arrows showing the direction of flow and dependencies. The main message of the diagram is to illustrate the sequence and decision logic involved in processing credit scoring requests and handling delays within a system.
