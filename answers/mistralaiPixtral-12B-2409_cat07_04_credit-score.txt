The diagram illustrates a process flow for handling credit scoring requests and delays within a credit scoring system. It is divided into two main sections: the credit scoring agent and the scoring service. The credit scoring agent initiates the process by receiving a scoring request and then requests a credit score. The flow then moves to the scoring service, where a scoring request is received, and the system checks if a credit score is available. If a score is available, it is sent back to the credit scoring agent. If not, the system reports a delay and proceeds to compute the credit score at a higher level. The computed score is then sent back to the credit scoring agent. The process involves several decision points and loops, indicating conditional logic for handling delays and ensuring that a credit score is eventually provided. The overall concept demonstrates a systematic approach to managing credit scoring requests, including handling delays and ensuring the availability of credit scores through a structured flow of actions and interactions between the credit scoring agent and the scoring service.
