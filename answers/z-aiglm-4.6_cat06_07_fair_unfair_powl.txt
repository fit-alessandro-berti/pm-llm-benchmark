<think>
The user wants me to create two POWL models based on a textual description of a hiring process.

**Goal:**
1.  **POWL Model 1 (With Unfairness):** Model the process as described, including the XOR branch that leads to a potentially biased "CommunityAffiliationCheck".
2.  **POWL Model 2 (Without Unfairness):** Model the process but remove the biased XOR branch. Everyone goes through the same "CulturalFitCheck".

**Deconstructing the Process Description:**

*   **Start:** The process begins when an application is received.
*   **Step 1: Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check:**
    *   This involves a loop. The system checks for completeness.
    *   If complete, move on.
    *   If not complete, request more info and then check again. This is a classic `* ( A, B )` structure in POWL, where A is the check and B is the request for info.
    *   Let's define the activities:
        *   `ReceiveApplication`: The starting point.
        *   `DataCompletenessCheck`: The check part of the loop (A).
        *   `RequestMoreInfo`: The action taken if data is incomplete (B).
    *   So, the loop will be `* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )`.
*   **Step 2: Preliminary Skill Assessment:**
    *   This happens after the data completeness loop.
    *   It's a single activity: `SkillAssessment`.
    *   There's a score threshold. If below, the process ends (reject). If above, it continues. This can be modeled as an XOR choice after the assessment: `FinalDecision(Reject)` vs. continue to the next stage. Or, for simplicity, we can just model the "continue" path, assuming the "reject" path is an implicit termination. The user's description focuses on the flow *towards* a hire, so I'll focus on that. The final `FinalDecision` step will handle the approve/reject outcome.
*   **Step 3: Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (The Bias Point):**
    *   This is the key difference between the two models.
    *   **Model 1 (With Unfairness):** An XOR choice is made here.
        *   Branch 1: `CulturalFitCheck` (standard path).
        *   Branch 2: `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (biased path). The description says this path gives an "implicit score adjustment". I'll model this as a distinct activity. The choice itself is the source of bias.
        *   So, this is `XOR ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )`.
    *   **Model 2 (Without Unfairness):** No XOR choice. Everyone goes through the same activity.
        *   Just a single activity: `CulturalFitCheck`.
*   **Step 4: Managerial Review & Final Decision:**
    *   This happens after the cultural fit stage (regardless of which path was taken in Model 1).
    *   Activities: `ManagerialReview`, then `FinalDecision`.
    *   The `FinalDecision` activity should probably be an XOR choice itself: `Hire` vs. `Reject`. This makes the model more complete. Let's add `Hire` and `Reject` as final activities.

**Structuring the POWL Models:**

I need to combine these components into a `StrictPartialOrder` to represent the overall flow.

**Model 1: With Unfairness**

1.  **Nodes:**
    *   `ReceiveApplication` (Transition)
    *   `DataCompletenessCheck` (Transition)
    *   `RequestMoreInfo` (Transition)
    *   `SkillAssessment` (Transition)
    *   `CulturalFitCheck` (Transition)
    *   `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (Transition)
    *   `ManagerialReview` (Transition)
    *   `Hire` (Transition)
    *   `Reject` (Transition)
    *   `loop_node`: `* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )`
    *   `xor_cultural_branch`: `XOR ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )`
    *   `xor_final_decision`: `XOR ( Hire, Reject )`

2.  **Partial Order (Sequence):**
    *   `ReceiveApplication` -> `loop_node`
    *   `loop_node` -> `SkillAssessment`
    *   `SkillAssessment` -> `xor_cultural_branch`
    *   `xor_cultural_branch` -> `ManagerialReview`
    *   `ManagerialReview` -> `xor_final_decision`

3.  **Refinement:** The description mentions a score threshold in `SkillAssessment`. I can model this as an XOR *after* the assessment. One branch leads to the cultural fit stage, the other leads directly to a `Reject` activity. This is more accurate.

    *   **Revised Nodes for Model 1:**
        *   `ReceiveApplication`
        *   `DataCompletenessCheck`
        *   `RequestMoreInfo`
        *   `SkillAssessment`
        *   `CulturalFitCheck`
        *   `CommunityAffiliationCheck`
        *   `ManagerialReview`
        *   `Hire`
        *   `Reject` (This will be used in two places)
        *   `loop_node`: `* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )`
        *   `xor_skill_outcome`: `XOR ( proceed_to_cultural, Reject )` where `proceed_to_cultural` is a silent transition.
        *   `xor_cultural_branch`: `XOR ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )`
        *   `xor_final_decision`: `XOR ( Hire, Reject )`

    *   **Revised Partial Order for Model 1:**
        *   `ReceiveApplication` -> `loop_node`
        *   `loop_node` -> `SkillAssessment`
        *   `SkillAssessment` -> `xor_skill_outcome`
        *   `xor_skill_outcome` (the silent transition part) -> `xor_cultural_branch`
        *   `xor_cultural_branch` -> `ManagerialReview`
        *   `ManagerialReview` -> `xor_final_decision`

This looks better and more faithful to the description. I will use this structure.

**Model 2: Without Unfairness**

1.  **Nodes:**
    *   `ReceiveApplication` (Transition)
    *   `DataCompletenessCheck` (Transition)
    *   `RequestMoreInfo` (Transition)
    *   `SkillAssessment` (Transition)
    *   `CulturalFitCheck` (Transition) - No biased branch.
    *   `ManagerialReview` (Transition)
    *   `Hire` (Transition)
    *   `Reject` (Transition)
    *   `loop_node`: `* ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo )`
    *   `xor_skill_outcome`: `XOR ( proceed_to_cultural, Reject )` where `proceed_to_cultural` is a silent transition.
    *   `xor_final_decision`: `XOR ( Hire, Reject )`

2.  **Partial Order (Sequence):**
    *   `ReceiveApplication` -> `loop_node`
    *   `loop_node` -> `SkillAssessment`
    *   `SkillAssessment` -> `xor_skill_outcome`
    *   `xor_skill_outcome` (the silent transition part) -> `CulturalFitCheck`
    *   `CulturalFitCheck` -> `ManagerialReview`
    *   `ManagerialReview` -> `xor_final_decision`

This structure is simpler and removes the biased `XOR` choice.

**Final Code Generation Plan:**

1.  Import necessary classes: `StrictPartialOrder`, `OperatorPOWL`, `Transition`, `SilentTransition`, `Operator`.
2.  Define all the `Transition` objects with their labels for both models. I can reuse them.
3.  **For Model 1:**
    *   Create the `loop_node` (`*`).
    *   Create the `xor_skill_outcome` (`XOR`).
    *   Create the `xor_cultural_branch` (`XOR`). This is the key part.
    *   Create the `xor_final_decision` (`XOR`).
    *   Create the `root` `StrictPartialOrder` with all the necessary nodes (`ReceiveApplication`, `loop_node`, `SkillAssessment`, `xor_skill_outcome`, `xor_cultural_branch`, `ManagerialReview`, `xor_final_decision`).
    *   Add the edges to define the sequence of execution.
4.  **For Model 2:**
    *   Create the `loop_node` (`*`). Same as Model 1.
    *   Create the `xor_skill_outcome` (`XOR`). Same as Model 1.
    *   **Do NOT** create the `xor_cultural_branch`. Instead, use the single `CulturalFitCheck` activity directly.
    *   Create the `xor_final_decision` (`XOR`). Same as Model 1.
    *   Create the `root` `StrictPartialOrder` with the nodes: `ReceiveApplication`, `loop_node`, `SkillAssessment`, `xor_skill_outcome`, `CulturalFitCheck`, `ManagerialReview`, `xor_final_decision`.
    *   Add the edges to define the sequence of execution.
5.  Add comments to explain each part of the code, especially highlighting the difference between the two models.
6.  Wrap the code in a clear, well-structured response as requested by the user. I will provide two separate code blocks, one for each model.

Of course. Based on the provided description, here are two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model incorporates the potential for unfairness through an XOR branch, while the second model is designed to be fair by removing that branch.

Both models use the `pm4py` library to construct the POWL objects.

---

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model directly translates the described process, including the XOR choice that can lead to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck". This branch is the source of the potential bias, as it creates a different evaluation path for a subset of applicants.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Define all individual activities (Transitions) ---
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_aff_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_hire = Transition(label="Hire")
final_reject = Transition(label="Reject")

# --- Define silent activities for flow control ---
tau_proceed_cultural = SilentTransition()

# --- Construct control-flow operators ---

# 1. Loop for data completeness: execute DataCompletenessCheck, then either exit
#    or execute RequestMoreInfo and repeat.
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# 2. XOR for skill assessment outcome: either proceed to cultural fit or get rejected.
skill_outcome_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[tau_proceed_cultural, final_reject])

# 3. XOR for cultural fit path: this is the source of potential unfairness.
#    Applicants are routed to either a standard check or a community-affiliation check.
cultural_path_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_aff_check])

# 4. XOR for the final hiring decision.
final_decision_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[final_hire, final_reject])

# --- Assemble the process into a StrictPartialOrder ---
# The nodes list contains all top-level components of the workflow.
nodes = [
    receive_app,
    data_loop,
    skill_assess,
    skill_outcome_xor,
    cultural_path_xor,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision_xor
]

root_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# --- Define the sequential order of execution ---
# The edges enforce the process flow.
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(skill_assess, skill_outcome_xor)
# The silent transition from the skill outcome XOR leads to the cultural path XOR
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(skill_outcome_xor, cultural_path_xor)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(cultural_path_xor, managerial_review)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision_xor)

# The model is now constructed and can be visualized or analyzed.
# For example, to visualize:
# pm4py.view_powl(root_with_bias)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model modifies the workflow to ensure fairness. The biased XOR branch is removed, and all applicants who pass the skill assessment undergo the single, standard "CulturalFitCheck". The loop for data completeness and the final decision remain the same.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# --- Define all individual activities (Transitions) ---
# Note: 'community_aff_check' is no longer needed.
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_hire = Transition(label="Hire")
final_reject = Transition(label="Reject")

# --- Define silent activities for flow control ---
tau_proceed_cultural = SilentTransition()

# --- Construct control-flow operators ---

# 1. Loop for data completeness (same as the unfair model).
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# 2. XOR for skill assessment outcome (same as the unfair model).
skill_outcome_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[tau_proceed_cultural, final_reject])

# 3. XOR for the final hiring decision (same as the unfair model).
final_decision_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[final_hire, final_reject])

# --- Assemble the process into a StrictPartialOrder ---
# The nodes list now includes the single 'cultural_fit' activity instead of the XOR.
nodes = [
    receive_app,
    data_loop,
    skill_assess,
    skill_outcome_xor,
    cultural_fit,  # All candidates go through this single activity.
    managerial_review,
    final_decision_xor
]

root_without_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# --- Define the sequential order of execution ---
# The flow is now linear after the skill assessment.
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(skill_assess, skill_outcome_xor)
# The silent transition leads directly to the standard cultural fit activity.
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(skill_outcome_xor, cultural_fit)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision_xor)

# The model is now constructed, representing a fairer process.
# For example, to visualize:
# pm4py.view_powl(root_without_bias)
