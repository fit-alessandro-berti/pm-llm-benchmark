Analyzing these process variants, I can identify several key differences in how the protected and unprotected groups are treated in the rental process:

1. Screening Intensity:
- Protected group faces more "Extensive Screening" in their high-frequency variants (793 cases with extensive screening among top variants)
- Unprotected group has fewer cases of extensive screening in their high-frequency variants (1022 cases, but proportionally lower given the total cases)

2. Rejection Patterns:
- Protected group faces earlier rejections (484 cases of immediate rejection after application)
- More complex rejection paths for protected group (after extensive screening)
- The performance times for rejections are consistently longer for the protected group (270,000 vs 240,000 for similar paths)

3. Rental Duration:
- Protected group shows more short-term tenancies (higher frequencies in shorter rental periods)
- Unprotected group has more stable, long-term tenancies (higher frequencies in variants with multiple rent payments)

4. Eviction:
- Protected group has variants including eviction processes (with "Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant")
- No explicit eviction variants appear in the unprotected group's common process paths

5. Time Differences:
- Generally longer processing times for protected group in similar variants
- Screening and paperwork checking takes longer for protected group (visible in the performance metrics)

These differences suggest potential discriminatory practices in:
- More stringent screening for protected group
- Quicker rejections for protected group
- Less trust/more supervision during tenancy
- Higher barriers to entry
- More scrutiny in the application process

This pattern could indicate systematic bias in the rental process that disadvantages the protected group.
