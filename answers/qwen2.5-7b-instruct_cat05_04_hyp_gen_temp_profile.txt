### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

#### Anomaly 1: R to P (Receive to Approve)
- **Average Time:** 90000 seconds (~1.04 days)
- **STDEV:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Hypothesis:** This suggests a rigid, potentially artificial schedule for approval. It could be that the system enforces a strict 24-hour turnaround for approval, possibly due to internal policies or system constraints.

#### Anomaly 2: P to N (Approve to Notify)
- **Average Time:** 604800 seconds (7 days)
- **STDEV:** 172800 seconds (2 days)
- **Hypothesis:** This indicates an extremely long average delay with a high standard deviation, suggesting that sometimes the notification process is heavily delayed, possibly due to internal backlogs, system delays, or resource constraints. Alternatively, some claims might be quickly processed without the intermediate step of approval.

#### Anomaly 3: A to C (Assign to Close)
- **Average Time:** 7200 seconds (2 hours)
- **Hypothesis:** This short average time, without intermediate steps like evaluation or approval, suggests that some claims are being prematurely closed. It might indicate a process where the assigner closes the claim immediately after assignment, possibly due to oversight or a lack of thorough evaluation.

#### Anomaly 4: E to N (Evaluate to Notify)
- **Average Time:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Hypothesis:** This very short time indicates that the notification is happening almost instantaneously after evaluation, which might suggest skipping intermediate steps or that the evaluation process is overly brief, possibly due to simplification or manual intervention.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### Query 1: Identify Specific Claims with Anomalies
To identify specific claims that fall outside the expected ranges for the identified anomalies.

```sql
-- R to P (Receive to Approve)
SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS receive_time, ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) > 90000 + 3 * 3600  -- 90000 seconds (1.04 days) + 3 standard deviations (1 hour)
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 90000 - 3 * 3600;

-- P to N (Approve to Notify)
SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS approve_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) > 604800 + 2 * 172800  -- 604800 seconds (7 days) + 2 standard deviations (2 days)
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 604800 - 2 * 172800;

-- A to C (Assign to Close)
SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS assign_time, ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 7200 - 3 * 3600  -- 7200 seconds (2 hours) - 3 standard deviations (1 hour)

-- E to N (Evaluate to Notify)
SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time, ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp) < 300 - 3 * 60  -- 300 seconds (5 minutes) - 3 standard deviations (1 minute)
```

#### Query 2: Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Resources
To correlate the anomalies with specific adjusters, claim types, or resources.

```sql
-- Correlate R to P (Receive to Approve) with adjusters
SELECT a.name, c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS avg_time
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 90000 + 3 * 3600
OR AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 90000 - 3 * 3600;

-- Correlate P to N (Approve to Notify) with adjusters
SELECT a.name, c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS avg_time
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800 + 2 * 172800
OR AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 604800 - 2 * 172800;

-- Correlate A to C (Assign to Close) with adjusters
SELECT a.name, c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS avg_time
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200 - 3 * 3600;

-- Correlate E to N (Evaluate to Notify) with adjusters
SELECT a.name, c.claim_type, COUNT(*) AS count, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS avg_time
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id
JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY a.name, c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 300 - 3 * 60;
```

These queries will help in identifying specific instances where the process deviates from the expected behavior and will provide insights into potential causes and areas for further investigation.
