We need to analyze both POWL models relative to normative Hire-to-Retire process, identify anomalies, and decide which model more closely aligns with normative process, justifying.

We need to discuss standard sequence: posting job ad, screening candidates, interview, hiring decision, possibly re-screening or repeat interview? Onboarding, payroll addition, close case. Possibly loop for onboarding? Payroll may be conditional? Provide analysis.

Model1: linear order with edges: Post->Screen, Screen->Decide, Screen->Interview (parallel? Actually edges diverge – but in PO they added only edges, not specifying exclusive choice. In a strict partial order, edges imply precedence; they didn't declare exclusive choice structure, so the model may allow both Decide and Interview concurrently after screen. That's abnormal – you typically need to decide after interview, not before. In given structure they have Decide and Interview both after Screen, meaning they could happen in parallel. Also they add Decide->Onboard edge implying Decide must happen before Onboard, but also have Interview->Decide? No, they didn't add edge from Interview to Decide, they added Loop? Actually they added edge Screen->Interview, but no edge from Interview to Decide; they added Decide after Screen but also edge to Decide from Screen, not from Interview. So Decide could occur before Interview; also they have no loop or XOR structure. So anomalies: parallel activities, premature decision before interview, missing explicit choice operators. Also missing requirement that decision leads to either onboarding if hire or close case if reject? In model, they always go to Onboard after Decide, which is unrealistic if decision could be reject leading to case close.

Thus anomalies: decision node placed too early; no explicit loop for re-screening; no exclusive choice for outcome; no explicit handling for rejection; possible violation of activity ordering: payroll after onboarding may be after close? Also they add edge Payroll->Close, but they never require Onboard->Payroll? Actually they added Onboard->Payroll edge, okay.

Model2: uses XOR and LOOP operators: they add edges Post->Screen, Post->Interview (parallel?), Interview->Decide, Decide->loop_onboarding, loop_onboarding->xor_payroll, xor_payroll->Close. There is also SilentTransition skip etc.

But actual ordering edges are not fully explicit: they didn't add edges for Post->Screen? Yes they added. Also they added Post->Interview (makes sense?) Typically interview occurs after screening, but here they allowed both after Post. They also didn't add edge Screen->Interview; they just have separate paths. They have loop_onboarding containing Onboard and skip, meaning onboarding may be looped or optionally skipped. Also xor_payroll is XOR with children Payroll and skip – meaning payroll may be optionally executed. They also have Close after xor_payroll, so closure occurs after payroll or optionally skip. However they never handle decision outcome leading to reject; they also have loop onboarding before payroll, correct maybe.

But there are anomalies: they placed Interview before Decide (makes sense), but also Post->Interview directly, bypassing Screen; also they didn't enforce screening before interview. Also they used XOR operator for payroll and skip, but typical process may require payroll addition after onboarding irrespective of choice; not optional. Also they used loop_onboarding but placed Decide->loop_onboarding, meaning decision leads to possibly loop of onboarding? But also loop may produce indefinite loops. Also they used silent transitions but didn't add them to nodes list? Actually they added loop_onboarding and xor_payroll to node list, but silent transition skip is not listed as node but used as child? It may cause missing node.

Thus we need identify anomalies: Model1 anomalies: missing exclusive choice for decision outcome, decision before interview, parallelism causing nondeterministic order, no handling of rejection closure, missing requirement that Onboard only after hire decision, etc.

Model2 anomalies: misuse of XOR and LOOP operators; missing required edges; using XOR for payroll which may be mandatory; using silent transition as a child but not part of order; using XOR incorrectly; lacking explicit "Screen" before "Interview"; also ordering edges may lead to interview before screening; also the decision node (Decide) is upstream of loop but maybe leads to indefinite loops; also may permit "skip" leading to missing steps.

Which aligns more with normative? Model1 is more linear but still flawed; Model2 tries to incorporate loops and choices but incorrectly implements them, causing more severe anomalies: wrong ordering, missing basic constraints, optional payroll, silent transition misuse. So Model1 might be closer to normative because it respects basic ordering (post-screen-decide-onboard-payroll-close) albeit missing exclusive outcome but still more aligned. Model2 has more fundamental violations (interview before screening, ambiguous decision, optional payroll, etc). So answer: Model1 is closer.

Need to justify with analysis and explanation.

Will produce structured answer: normative sequence description; then anomalies in each model; then evaluation; conclusion.

Will produce in final answer.

## 1.  The “canonical” HiretoRetire flow (what a *normative* model should look like)

| Step | Typical activity | Controlflow implication |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Post_Job_Ad** – publish vacancy | Must be the first activity that creates the *case* (the recruitment request). |
| 2 | **Screen_Candidates** – CV review, preselection | Must follow the posting; it may generate a *gate* that decides whether we continue. |
| 3 | **Conduct_Interviews** – interview(s) with shortlisted candidates | Usually executed **after** screening; a candidate can only be interviewed if he/she has passed the screen. |
| 4 | **Make_Hiring_Decision** – accept or reject the candidate | The *outcome* of the interview(s).  In a strict normative model this decision is **exclusive**: either we *hire* (continue) or we *reject* (skip the rest). |
| 5a| **Onboard_Employee** – offer contract, collect documents, assign equipment, etc. | Executed **only when the decision is “hire.”** It may be repeated (e.g., if onboarding steps need to be revisited) but is generally a *single* activity that follows a successful decision. |
| 5b| **Add_to_Payroll** – register the employee in the payroll / HRIS system | Must happen **after** a successful onboarding; it is *mandatory* for every hired employee. |
| 6 | **Close_Case** – archive the recruitment request, send “closed” notification | Performed once the employee is on the payroll (or when the process terminates for a rejected candidate). |

A *normative* POWL representation therefore should contain:

* A **linear chain** of mandatory activities (Post  Screen  Interview  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard  Add_to_Payroll  Close).  
* An **exclusive choice/XOR** precisely between **Onboard** and **Close** (or between *Hire* vs *Reject* outcomes).  
* No parallelism that bypasses the logical ordering (e.g., Interview must not start before Screening).  
* No optional steps that break the *obligation* to onboard/payroll once a hire decision is made.  
* Proper use of loops only if the process really can repeat a subflow (e.g., multiple interview rounds); otherwise loops are unnecessary.

## 2.  Anomalies in Each Model

### **Model1**

| What the model does | Why it deviates from the normative flow | Severity |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Edges:** `Screen  Decide` **and** `Screen  Interview` (no ordering between Decide and Interview) | The decision node and the interview node are placed **in parallel** after screening. In reality a decision can only be taken **after** the interview(s) are completed. | **High** – the process can make a hiring decision *before* any interview has taken place, which violates business logic. |
| **No explicit XOR for the hiring outcome** – the model always forces `Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close` | If the decision is “reject,” the case would still be forced through Onboard and Payroll, which are *hireonly* activities. | **Critical** – the model does not allow a *reject* path, so it cannot correctly terminate a recruitment that does **not** result in a hire. |
| **No exclusivechoice operator** – the model treats the precedence constraints as a *strict partial order* without enforcing “exactly one of the outgoing arcs” semantics | The process can, for example, execute `Screen  Decide` **and** `Screen  Interview` simultaneously or in any order, leading to nondeterministic execution. | **MediumHigh** – this breaks the deterministic nature of a recruitment workflow and can cause inconsistent states. |
| **Missing loop (if needed) for multiple interview rounds** – although optional, many organisations use a loop to reinterview candidates. The model simply stops at a single decision. | Not a violation per se, but the model does not capture the *optional* nature that a loop could provide. | **Low** – not a fundamental defect but a limitation. |
| **Payroll precedes Close (correct)**, but because the “reject” path does not exist, the model never reaches Close for a rejected case. | Same as the first critical issue – the model cannot close a case without hiring. | **Critical** – the caseclosure semantics are broken. |

### **Model2**

| What the model does | Why it deviates from the normative flow | Severity |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Edges:** `Post  Screen` **and** `Post  Interview` (both start from the posting) | Interview is allowed **without** a prior screening step, i.e., a candidate can be interviewed directly after the job ad is posted. | **High** – contradicts the usual “screenfirst, interviewlater” logic. |
| **`Decide` precedes `loop_onboarding`** but there is **no edge from Interview  Decide** | The decision node is placed **before** onboarding, yet the model never forces the decision to wait for the interview results; the interview is not modelled as a prerequisite for the decision. | **High** – the decision is not grounded in the actual interview activity. |
| **`loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, SilentTransition)`** – the loop can fire **even when the employee has not been hired** | A silent transition (`skip`) can be taken without executing `Onboard`. Consequently the loop can terminate without ever performing onboarding, which means the process could bypass the *hire* step and go straight to payroll/close. | **Critical** – the loop introduces an *optional* onboarding that can be skipped at will, breaking the mandatory “onboard before payroll” rule. |
| **`xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, SilentTransition)`** – payroll is made **optional** via XOR with a silent transition | In a real recruitment workflow, once a candidate has been onboarded, adding them to payroll is **mandatory**; it must not be skipped. By modelling it as an exclusiveor with a skip, the model allows a case to terminate after onboarding without ever registering the employee in the payroll system. | **Critical** – violates the contractual requirement that every hired employee must be placed on payroll. |
| **`Close` follows `xor_payroll`** – close can be reached *after* skipping payroll or after an (optional) payroll step | The process can close the case *without* ever performing the mandatory payroll step, or after an *illegal* skip of onboarding. | **Critical** – the termination condition no longer reflects the normative “close after payroll” rule. |
| **SilentTransition `skip` is listed as a child of both loop and XOR operators but is **not** part of the `nodes=` list** | The PO model definition requires all operands to be explicit nodes; omitting `skip` from the node collection leads to an inconsistent graph and may cause runtime errors or undefined behaviour. | **Medium** – technical inconsistency but also a semantic problem because a “skip” activity is used without being formally recognised. |
| **No explicit handling of a *reject* path** – the only way to terminate is via `Close` after possibly skipping payroll | Since the reject decision is not modelled as an exclusive branch (e.g., `Close` directly from `Decide`), the model cannot differentiate “reject” from “hireandskippayroll.” | **High** – the model cannot correctly model the termination of a recruitment that does **not** result in a hire. |

## 3.  Which model is *closer* to a normative HiretoRetire process?

### Summary of Findings

| Aspect | Model1 | Model2 |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Basic linear ordering of mandatory steps** | Correct order **Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close** (except for the parallelism problem) | Order is fragmented; interview can start without screening; decisions are not tied to interview outcomes |
| **Exclusivechoice handling of hiring outcome** | Implicitly forces every decision to proceed to onboarding (no reject path)  **missing reject branch** | Uses XOR/LOOP with silent transitions to *optionally* skip hiringrelated steps  **incorrectly makes critical steps optional** |
| **Controlflow operators (XOR, LOOP)** | Uses only a simple PO; no explicit XOR/LOOP (so no *wrong* semantics) | Misuses XOR for **mandatory** steps (payroll) and for **skip**, and uses LOOP for onboarding even though the process does not require repetition; semantics are inverted |
| **Parallelism / nondeterminism** | Allows parallel execution of `Decide` and `Interview`, which can lead to a decision before any interview – a serious logical error | Allows parallel start of `Interview` vs `Screen` and also mixes loop/choice semantics in ways that can bypass required activities |
| **Handling of reject / closure** | No reject path  case cannot close without hiring | No explicit reject path, but the model permits skipping payroll and closing directly, which violates “close after payroll” |
| **Overall structural soundness** | Simpler, mostly a **linear chain** – easier to map to a conventional BPMN flow, albeit with some logical gaps | More sophisticated operator set but applied **incorrectly**, producing *semantic* errors that break the core business rules |

### Verdict

**Model1 is the one that aligns more closely to a normative HiretoRetire process.**  

* It preserves the **essential sequence** (post  screen  decision  onboarding  payroll  close).  
* Although it lacks a proper *reject* branch and a formal XOR operator, it does **not** make any **mandatory** activity optional.  
* The only logical flaw is the **parallelism** between `Decide` and `Interview`, which can be remedied by adding an explicit edge `Interview  Decide` or by wrapping `Interview` in an exclusivechoice submodel. These are relatively minor structural adjustments.

**Model2, while richer in operator notation, introduces several **critical semantic violations**:**

1. **Interview can be launched before screening** – a direct breach of the standard workflow.  
2. **Decision is detached from interview results**, allowing a hiring decision to be taken without any interview.  
3. **Mandatory steps (onboarding, payroll) are wrapped in XOR/LOOP with silent “skip” transitions**, making them *optional* and permitting illegal early termination.  
4. **Close can be reached without payroll**, contradiction of the “close after payroll” rule.  
5. **The graph is inconsistently defined** (silent transition not listed as a node, misuse of XOR semantics).  

These problems are not merely stylistic; they fundamentally change the meaning of the process and could lead to scenarios where an employee is never added to payroll, or where a recruitment case is closed after a “decision” that never involved an interview. Consequently, Model2 **does not faithfully represent** the normative HiretoRetire workflow, whereas Model1, despite its imperfections, adheres more closely to the required activity ordering and mandatory steps.

## 4.  Recommendations for a Correct POWL Model

1. **Introduce a proper exclusivechoice (XOR) after the interview**:  
   ```python
   decide = Transition(label="Make_Hiring_Decision")
   hire   = Transition(label="Onboard_Employee")
   reject = Transition(label="Close_Case")   # or a silent “reject” transition
   model.order.add_edge(Interview, decide)
   model.order.add_edge(decide, hire)
   model.order.add_edge(decide, reject)   # exclusive choice
   ```

2. **Make payroll mandatory after a successful onboarding** and connect it directly to `Close` only after payroll finishes.

3. **Add the edge `Interview  Decide`** (or place `Decide` after `Interview` in the order) to eliminate the parallelism problem.

4. **If a loop is required** (e.g., multiple interview rounds), model it explicitly with a **Loop** operator that encloses the interview subprocess, not the onboarding step.

5. **All operator children must be declared in the `nodes=` list** to keep the PO model syntactically sound.

By applying these fixes, a POWL model can faithfully capture the normative HiretoRetire process while still being able to express legitimate variations (e.g., optional rescreening loops).  

--- 

**Bottom line:** *Model1*, despite needing a few refinements, is the closer approximation to a correct, normconforming HiretoRetire workflow; *Model2* deviates in several fundamental ways that jeopardize the logical integrity of the process.
