Based on the provided tables, I'll create a comprehensive event log using `order_id` as the Case ID. Here's my approach:

**Assumptions Made:**
1. Each order line picking represents a distinct "Item Picked" event
2. Multiple deliveries for the same order are separate events
3. Multiple invoices for the same order are separate events
4. Each payment is a separate event
5. The process flow is: Order Created  Items Picked  Order Dispatched  Order Arrived  Invoice Issued  Payment Received

**Final Event Log:**

| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp              | Resource/Actor   | Additional Attributes                              |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

**Notes:**
- Order 1004 is incomplete in the process (missing delivery, invoice, and payment events)
- The Resource/Actor column uses the actual names from the Resources table where available
- Payment events don't have a specific resource since the Payments table doesn't include a resource identifier
- All events are sorted chronologically within each case
- Additional attributes provide context about specific events (item details, amounts, delivery notes, etc.)
