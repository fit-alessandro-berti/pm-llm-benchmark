Here’s one possible LogSkeleton for the described orderfulfilment process.  We assume every activity happens exactly once per order and in the strict sequence:

```python
# list of all activities
activities = ['RO',  # Receive Order
              'CA',  # Check Availability
              'RI',  # Reserve Items
              'PI',  # Pick Items
              'QC',  # Quality Check
              'PO',  # Pack Order
              'GSL', # Generate Shipping Label
              'D',   # Dispatch
              'IC',  # Invoice Customer
              'RP']  # Record Payment

log_skeleton = {
    # every pair of distinct activities occurs equally often (once)
    'equivalence': {(a, b) for a in activities for b in activities if a != b},

    # if X occurs, Y must have occurred before X
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),
        ('RI', 'CA'),
        ('PI', 'RI'),
        ('QC', 'PI'),
        ('PO', 'QC'),
        ('GSL', 'PO'),
        ('D',  'GSL'),
        ('IC', 'D'),
        ('RP', 'IC'),
    },

    # if X occurs, Y must occur sometime afterwards
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D',  'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP'),
    },

    # no mutually exclusive activities in this simple linear scenario
    'never_together': set(),

    # each activity must occur exactly once per case
    'activ_freq': { act: {1} for act in activities },

    # direct successions in the happypath sequence
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO',  'CA'),
        ('CA',  'RI'),
        ('RI',  'PI'),
        ('PI',  'QC'),
        ('QC',  'PO'),
        ('PO',  'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D',   'IC'),
        ('IC',  'RP'),
    }
}
```

Explanation of the key constraints:

• `equivalence`: Because every activity appears exactly once in each case, all pairs of distinct activities are “equivalent” in occurrence count.  
• `always_before`: enforces the order–if you see CA, RO must already have happened; if you see RI, CA must have happened, etc.  
• `always_after`: the mirror of the above—if RO happens, CA must eventually follow, and so on down to RP.  
• `activ_freq`: each activity’s count is constrained to the singleton set `{1}`.  
• `directly_follows`: pins down the immediate successor relationships in the standard flow.  
• `never_together`: empty here since there are no two activities that cannot coexist in the same case.
