The user wants two POWL models based on a textual description of a hiring process at "GlobalTeq Solutions".

**Process Analysis:**

1.  **Receive Application / Data Completeness:** Resumes are submitted. An automated system checks for completeness.
    *   If incomplete: Loop back to request more info.
    *   If complete: Proceed.
    *   *POWL Representation:* This looks like a Loop structure. Let's call the check "DataCompletenessCheck". If it fails, "RequestMoreInfo" happens, then check again. Or, "ReceiveApplication" -> Loop(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). The prompt suggests activity labels like "ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck", "RequestMoreInfo". A standard loop structure in POWL is `*(A, B)`, execute A, then exit or execute B and then A again.
    *   Let's refine the loop logic. Usually, we do the check. If it passes, exit loop. If it fails, request info and check again.
    *   POWL Loop `*(A, B)` semantics: Execute A, then exit OR execute B and start over (execute A again).
    *   So, let A = `DataCompletenessCheck`. Let B = `RequestMoreInfo`.
    *   Logic: Do check. If good, exit loop. If bad, execute `RequestMoreInfo` and go back to `DataCompletenessCheck`. This fits the POWL Loop definition.

2.  **Skill Assessment:** After data is complete, "SkillAssessment" occurs. This is a sequential step.

3.  **Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation (The Bias Point):**
    *   *Model 1 (Unfair):* There is an XOR choice.
        *   Branch 1: Standard "CulturalFitCheck".
        *   Branch 2: "CommunityAffiliationCheck" (which implies preferential treatment/uplift). The description says "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments." It mentions "CommunityAffiliationCheck" as an activity label. Let's assume the unfair path is distinct.
        *   Let's model this as an XOR between `CulturalFitCheck` (Standard) and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (Biased/Preferential). Or perhaps `CommunityAffiliationCheck` is an activity that grants the advantage. The prompt says: "One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other to a 'CommunityAffiliationCheck' activity that gives a subtle advantage...".
    *   *Model 2 (Fair):* No XOR branch. Everyone goes through "CulturalFitCheck".

4.  **Managerial Review & Final Decision:**
    *   "ManagerialReview" happens.
    *   "FinalDecision" happens.
    *   These seem sequential.

**Structure Construction:**

*   **Common Start:** `ReceiveApplication` (implied start of the flow or part of the loop context). The prompt suggests "ReceiveApplication" as a label. Let's put it before the loop.
*   **Loop:** `*(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)`.
*   **Sequence:** ReceiveApplication -> Loop -> SkillAssessment -> [Cultural Logic] -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

**Model 1: POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

1.  Nodes:
    *   `ReceiveApplication` (Transition)
    *   `LoopNode` = `*(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)`
    *   `SkillAssessment` (Transition)
    *   `XorNode` = `X(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)`
        *   Child 1: `CulturalFitCheck` (Transition)
        *   Child 2: `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (Transition) - representing the biased path.
    *   `ManagerialReview` (Transition)
    *   `FinalDecision` (Transition)

2.  Order (Strict Partial Order):
    *   `ReceiveApplication` -> `LoopNode`
    *   `LoopNode` -> `SkillAssessment`
    *   `SkillAssessment` -> `XorNode`
    *   `XorNode` -> `ManagerialReview`
    *   `ManagerialReview` -> `FinalDecision`

**Model 2: POWL Model Without Unfairness**

1.  Nodes:
    *   `ReceiveApplication` (Transition)
    *   `LoopNode` = `*(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)`
    *   `SkillAssessment` (Transition)
    *   `CulturalFitCheck` (Transition) - No XOR, just the single activity.
    *   `ManagerialReview` (Transition)
    *   `FinalDecision` (Transition)

2.  Order (Strict Partial Order):
    *   `ReceiveApplication` -> `LoopNode`
    *   `LoopNode` -> `SkillAssessment`
    *   `SkillAssessment` -> `CulturalFitCheck`
    *   `CulturalFitCheck` -> `ManagerialReview`
    *   `ManagerialReview` -> `FinalDecision`

**Python Code Construction:**

I need to write the Python code using `pm4py.objects.powl.obj` as requested.

*   Imports: `Transition`, `SilentTransition`, `StrictPartialOrder`, `OperatorPOWL`, `Operator`.
*   **Model 1:**
    *   Define transitions.
    *   Define Loop: `OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])`.
    *   Define XOR: `OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])`.
    *   Define Partial Order with nodes: `ReceiveApplication`, `loop_node`, `SkillAssessment`, `xor_node`, `ManagerialReview`, `FinalDecision`.
    *   Add edges in sequence.

*   **Model 2:**
    *   Define transitions.
    *   Define Loop: same as above.
    *   Define Partial Order with nodes: `ReceiveApplication`, `loop_node`, `SkillAssessment`, `CulturalFitCheck`, `ManagerialReview`, `FinalDecision`.
    *   Add edges in sequence.

**Refining the "ReceiveApplication" part:**
The description says: "Applicants first submit their resumes... Once the basic application data is received... An automated system scans...".
So `ReceiveApplication` comes first. Then the check.
In the loop logic `*(A, B)`:
We do A (`DataCompletenessCheck`).
If complete -> Exit loop.
If incomplete -> Do B (`RequestMoreInfo`) and repeat A.
This assumes the data is already there to check (from `ReceiveApplication`).
This fits perfectly.

**Checking Constraints:**
- POWL representation rules: `StrictPartialOrder` for sequences/parallel. `OperatorPOWL` for Loop/XOR.
- Labels: Use requested labels ("ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck", etc.).
- Format: Provide the code snippets for both models.

**Drafting the code (Mental Check):**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Model 1
rec_app = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
dcc = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
rmi = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
skill = Transition("SkillAssessment")
cfc = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
cac = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
mgr = Transition("ManagerialReview")
fin = Transition("FinalDecision")

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [dcc, rmi])
xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [cfc, cac])

root = StrictPartialOrder([rec_app, loop_node, skill, xor_node, mgr, fin])
root.order.add_edge(rec_app, loop_node)
root.order.add_edge(loop_node, skill)
root.order.add_edge(skill, xor_node)
root.order.add_edge(xor_node, mgr)
root.order.add_edge(mgr, fin)
```

This looks correct for Model 1.

For Model 2:
The XOR is gone. `CulturalFitCheck` is just a transition in the main partial order.

```python
# Model 2
# ... definitions ...
loop_node2 = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [dcc2, rmi2])

root2 = StrictPartialOrder([rec_app2, loop_node2, skill2, cfc2, mgr2, fin2])
# ... edges ...
```

This looks correct for Model 2.

One detail: "Process includes loops... XOR choices... sequential ordering".
In Model 2, the XOR is removed to ensure fairness. The prompt explicitly asks to "ensure no special community-based branch exists". So Model 2 is linear regarding that step.

Let's double check the provided example syntax in the prompt.
`root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])`
`root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)`
Yes, the syntax matches.

I will present the solution as two code blocks as implied by the request structure (similar to the example). I will generate the Python code for both scenarios.

**Activity Labels to use:**
- ReceiveApplication
- DataCompletenessCheck
- RequestMoreInfo
- SkillAssessment
- CulturalFitCheck
- CommunityAffiliationCheck
- ManagerialReview
- FinalDecision

**Structure for Model 1 (Unfair):**
Sequence:
ReceiveApplication
Loop(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
SkillAssessment
XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
ManagerialReview
FinalDecision

**Structure for Model 2 (Fair):**
Sequence:
ReceiveApplication
Loop(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
SkillAssessment
CulturalFitCheck
ManagerialReview
FinalDecision

I will write the response now.

Here are the two POWL models representing the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model represents the workflow as described, including an XOR branching point after the skill assessment. One branch executes a standard `CulturalFitCheck`, while the alternative branch executes a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (which implies the preferential treatment or "uplift"). This branch creates the potential for bias, as the evaluation path differs based on affiliation status.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
check_data = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
# Structure: *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
# Logic: Perform check; if incomplete, request info and loop back.
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[check_data, request_info])

# Define XOR for Cultural Fit / Affiliation Check (Source of Unfairness)
# Structure: X(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
# Logic: Choice between standard evaluation and the affiliation-based path.
fairness_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# Define Partial Order (Workflow Structure)
# Sequence: Receive -> Loop -> Skill -> XOR -> Review -> Decision
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, fairness_xor, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add edges to define the sequential flow
unfair_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(skill_test, fairness_xor)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(fairness_xor, manager_review)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes the XOR branch that provided selective advantages. All applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck` activity after the skill assessment, ensuring a uniform evaluation process. The loop for data completeness and the sequential hiring steps remain, but the specific branch for community affiliation has been eliminated.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define Activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
check_data = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for Data Completeness
# Structure remains the same: *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[check_data, request_info])

# No XOR is defined here. The process flows directly to CulturalFitCheck for everyone.

# Define Partial Order (Workflow Structure)
# Sequence: Receive -> Loop -> Skill -> CulturalFitCheck -> Review -> Decision
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision])

# Add edges to define the sequential flow
fair_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
fair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
fair_model.order.add_edge(skill_test, cultural_fit)
fair_model.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
fair_model.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```
