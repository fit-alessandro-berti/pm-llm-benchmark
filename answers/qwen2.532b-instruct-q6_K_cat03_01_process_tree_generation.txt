To model the intricate hospital patient management scenario described above into a single process tree using the provided operators and notation, we need to accurately represent each step and decision point. Below is the construction of the corresponding process tree in Python using the `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj.ProcessTree` class:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Define all activities
A = ProcessTree(label="A")
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG")
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA")

TI = ProcessTree(label="TI")
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC")

CE = ProcessTree(label="CE")
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP")

SC = ProcessTree(label="SC")

TM = ProcessTree(label="TM")
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT")

RDT = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=RDT)  # FCE is a child of RDT
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=RDT)  # FBA is a child of RDT

AI = ProcessTree(label="AI")
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC")

FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS")
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI")

BL = ProcessTree(label="BL")
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP")
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF")

# Construct the full process tree

root = ProcessTree()

# Arrival and Initial Registration/Assessment
initial_steps = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
initial_steps.children.append(A)
initial_reg_assess = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=initial_steps)
RG.parent = initial_reg_assess
IA.parent = initial_reg_assess
initial_reg_assess.children.append(RG)
initial_reg_assess.children.append(IA)

# Triage Interview and Classification
triage_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
TI.parent = triage_seq
TC.parent = triage_seq
triage_seq.children.append(TI)
triage_seq.children.append(TC)

# Exclusive choice between CE and FBP based on triage classification
diag_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
CE.parent = diag_choice
FBP.parent = diag_choice
diag_choice.children.append(CE)
diag_choice.children.append(FBP)

# Loop for Specialist Consultation followed by Treatment and Re-Diagnostic Test
loop_root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
SC.parent = loop_root

treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop_root)
TM.parent = treatment_choice
SPT.parent = treatment_choice
treatment_choice.children.append(TM)
treatment_choice.children.append(SPT)

# Append the re-diagnostic test (RDT) and its children FCE/FBA to loop root
FCE.parent = RDT
FBA.parent = RDT
RDT.children.append(FCE)
RDT.children.append(FBA)
loop_root.children.append(SC)
loop_root.children.append(treatment_choice)
loop_root.children.append(RDT)

# Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling in true concurrency
AI_NC_concurrency = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
AI.parent = AI_NC_concurrency
NC.parent = AI_NC_concurrency
AI_NC_concurrency.children.append(AI)
AI_NC_concurrency.children.append(NC)

# Follow-up Appointment Scheduling and Detailed Discharge Instructions in sequence
followup_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
FAS.parent = followup_sequence
DDI.parent = followup_sequence
followup_sequence.children.append(FAS)
followup_sequence.children.append(DDI)

# Final Administrative Steps in true concurrency
admin_concurrency = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
BL.parent = admin_concurrency
ICP.parent = admin_concurrency
MRF.parent = admin_concurrency
admin_concurrency.children.append(BL)
admin_concurrency.children.append(ICP)
admin_concurrency.children.append(MRF)

# Append all top-level nodes to the root
root.children.append(initial_steps)
root.children.append(triage_seq)
root.children.append(diag_choice)
root.children.append(loop_root)
root.children.append(AI_NC_concurrency)
root.children.append(followup_sequence)
root.children.append(admin_concurrency)

print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Steps**: The patient arrives (`A`), followed by registration and intake assessment (`RG`, `IA`) in sequence.
2. **Triage Interview and Classification**: Triage interview (`TI`) followed by triage classification (`TC`) sequentially.
3. **Exclusive Diagnostic Choice**: Exclusive choice between Comprehensive ECG (`CE`) or Full Blood Panel (`FBP`).
4. **Loop for Specialist Consultation, Treatment, and Re-Diagnostic Test**:
   - The loop starts with a specialist consultation (`SC`), followed by an exclusive treatment choice between Targeted Medication (`TM`) or Specialized Physical Therapy (`SPT`).
   - After treatment, the patient undergoes a re-diagnostic test (`RDT`), which is either Follow-up ECG (`FCE`) or Follow-up Blood Analysis (`FBA`).
5. **Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling**: These activities occur in true concurrency.
6. **Follow-Up Steps**:
   - Sequence of follow-up appointment scheduling (`FAS`) and detailed discharge instructions (`DDI`).
7. **Final Administrative Concurrency Block**: Billing (`BL`), Insurance Claims Processing (`ICP`), Medical Records Finalization (`MRF`) happen concurrently.

This process tree accurately represents the complex patient management scenario as described.
