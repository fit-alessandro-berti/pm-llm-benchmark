1. **Verify Documents**
   - **First occurrence**: Initial verification of documents (may be incomplete or require follow-up).
   - **Second occurrence**: Re-verification after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made.

2. **Call Customer**
   - **First occurrence (C001, C003)**: Outbound call to request missing documents or information.
   - **First occurrence (C002)**: Outbound call to clarify an account discrepancy.
   - **Second occurrence (C002)**: Follow-up call to confirm adjustments.

3. **Adjust Account** (appears in C002 and C003)
   - **C002**: Adjustment made after clarifying an account discrepancy.
   - **C003**: Internal correction due to missing information.

### **Justification for Renaming Choices**

1. **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Re-Verify Documents**
   - **Contextual Clues**:
     - The first occurrence is always the initial check (e.g., "Agent checks identity documents").
     - The second occurrence happens after additional documents are submitted (C001) or after an account adjustment (C003).
   - **Why?**
     - "Initial" distinguishes the first check from later re-verifications.
     - "Re-Verify" explicitly indicates a second check after new information or corrections.

2. **Call Customer  Call to Request Missing Documents / Call to Clarify Discrepancy / Call to Request Customer Return / Follow-Up Confirmation Call**
   - **Contextual Clues**:
     - In **C001**, the call is to request missing documents ("Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs").
     - In **C002**, the first call clarifies an account discrepancy ("Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy"), while the second is a follow-up ("Follow-up call to confirm adjustments").
     - In **C003**, the call is to ask the customer to return ("Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return").
   - **Why?**
     - The purpose of the call varies, so the new names reflect the **intent** (requesting docs, clarifying issues, confirming changes, or asking the customer to return).

3. **Adjust Account  Adjust Account After Clarification / Adjust Account for Missing Info**
   - **Contextual Clues**:
     - In **C002**, the adjustment follows a clarification call ("Adjust account details internally after call").
     - In **C003**, the adjustment is due to missing information ("Internal correction due to missing info").
   - **Why?**
     - The reason for the adjustment differs, so the new names specify the **trigger** (clarification vs. missing info).

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Temporal context matters**: The same activity name can mean different things depending on when it occurs in the process.
- **Resource and additional context provide clues**: The "Resource" and "Additional Context" columns often hint at the true purpose of an activity.
- **Disambiguation improves process clarity**: Renaming activities makes the workflow more intuitive for analysis, auditing, and automation.

This revised log now clearly distinguishes between similar-sounding activities, reducing ambiguity in process mining or workflow optimization efforts.
