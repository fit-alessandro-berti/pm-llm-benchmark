Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to check each case in the event log and see if they follow the normative process described. Let me start by understanding the process thoroughly.

The process starts with "Receive order". Then, "Check inventory" must come next. If inventory is sufficient, the steps are Authorize Payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If not, after Check inventory, it goes to Cancel order and then Close order. 

Key constraints from the description:
1. Authorize Payment must be after Check inventory and before Package.
2. Package must be after Authorize and before Ship.
3. Ship can't happen after Cancel.
4. Close order is always the last activity.

Now, let's go through each case.

**Case 1:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.
This follows the sufficient inventory path exactly. No violations. Correct.

**Case 2:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Here, Package comes before Authorize. According to the rules, Authorize must come before Package. So this is a violation. The order here skipped authorizing payment before packaging, which isn't allowed.

**Case 3:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close.
Wait, after Check inventory, they Authorized payment, then Cancel, then Ship. But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient (leading to Cancel), you shouldn't proceed to Ship. Also, Cancel should come right after Check if inventory is low. Here, they did Check  Authorize  Cancel. Authorize shouldn't happen in the cancellation path. So two issues: Authorize in a cancellation scenario (which isn't supposed to happen) and then Shipping after Cancel, which is forbidden.

**Case 4:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
This is the correct cancellation path. No violations here.

**Case 5:**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Missing Package items between Authorize and Ship. The normative process requires Package before Ship. So violation here because they skipped packaging.

So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's detail each violation:

- **Case 2:** Package before Authorize. Rule says Authorize must be before Package.
- **Case 3:** Authorized after Check but then Canceled, which isn't allowed in the cancellation path. Also, Ship after Cancel which is not allowed.
- **Case 5:** Ship without Package in between. 

Wait, let me double-check Case 3. The normative process says if inventory is insufficient, after Check, go to Cancel, then Close. So in Case 3, after Check, they did Authorize, which isn't part of the cancellation flow. So that's a problem. Then they Canceled, but then shipped, which is invalid. So two violations here: Authorize in cancellation path and Ship after Cancel.

Yes, that's right. So Cases 2, 3, 5 are the ones violating.

**1. Violating Cases:**
- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

**2. Explanation of Violations:**

#### **Case 2 Violation**  
**Sequence:** `Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close`  
**Rule Violated:** "Package items" must occur **after** "Authorize payment."  
**Explanation:** The normative process requires authorization before packaging. In Case 2, packaging occurred *before* payment authorization, violating the mandated sequence.

---

#### **Case 3 Violations**  
**Sequence:** `Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close`  
**Violations:**  
1. **"Authorize payment" in a cancellation scenario**  
   **Rule Violated:** "Authorize payment" is only valid in the *sufficient inventory* pathway. After "Check inventory," a cancellation should directly lead to "Cancel order" without authorization.  
   **Explanation:** The process incorrectly authorized payment despite proceeding to cancel the order, indicating inventory insufficiency.  

2. **"Ship order" after "Cancel order"**  
   **Rule Violated:** "Ship order" cannot occur after cancellation.  
   **Explanation:** Shipping logically follows fulfillment steps, not cancellation. Case 3 attempted to ship an already canceled order.

---

#### **Case 5 Violation**  
**Sequence:** `Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close`  
**Rule Violated:** "Package items" must precede "Ship order."  
**Explanation:** The normative process explicitly requires packaging before shipment. Case 5 skipped the "Package items" activity entirely, violating this critical dependency.

---

### Summary  
- **Case 2**: Bypassed payment authorization before packaging.  
- **Case 3**: Improperly authorized payment during cancellation and shipped a canceled order.  
- **Case 4** and **Case 1**: Compliant with the normative process.  
- **Case 5**: Shipped without packaging.  

These deviations directly contravene the explicit constraints outlined in the textual description.
