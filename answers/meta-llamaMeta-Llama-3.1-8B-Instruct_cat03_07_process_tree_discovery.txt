Based on the provided event log, I have identified the main flow and the repeating loop. Here is the final process tree model:

`+ ( 'RA', -> ( 'AE', 'AD' ) )`

 Inside the `-> ( 'AE', 'AD' )` sequence:

`-> ( 'VF', 'RMI' -> ( 'VF', 'AD' ) )`

Inside the `RMI` loop:

`* ( 'RMI', 'VF' )`

 Inside the `VF` branch of the loop:

`-> ( 'AD', 'SC' )`

`SC` leads to `AC`, but this is not shown as a separate node in the main model, as it's part of the main flow.

Here's a visual representation of the process tree:

```
+ ( RA )
  |
  |---> ( AE )
  |       |
  |       |---> ( AD )
  |       |
  |       |---> ( VF )
  |       |       |
  |       |       |---> ( RMI )
  |       |       |       |
  |       |       |       |---> ( VF )
  |       |       |       |       |
  |       |       |       |       |---> ( AD )
  |       |       |       |
  |       |       |       |---> ( RMI )
  |       |       |       |       |
  |       |       |       |       |---> ( VF )
  |       |       |       |       |       |
  |       |       |       |       |       |---> ( AD )
  |       |       |
  |       |       |---> ( SC )
  |       |
  |       |---> ( AC )
```

This process tree captures the main sequence of activities (`RA` -> `AE` -> `AD`), the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation (`RMI` -> `VF`), and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival (`AD` -> `SC` -> `AC`).
