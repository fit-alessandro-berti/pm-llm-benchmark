To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, we'll integrate data from the provided tables, focusing on the key activities in the order lifecycle. Here's how we'll proceed:

1. **Identify Cases**: Use `order_id` as the case identifier.
2. **Derive Activities**: Define events based on the tables:
   - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table.
   - "Items Picked" from the `Order Lines` table.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table.
   - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table.
   - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table.
3. **Map Timestamps**: Ensure each event has a timestamp, maintaining chronological order.
4. **Combine Data**: Link events using `order_id` and other relevant keys.
5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: Include resources like sales persons, warehouse staff, carriers, and billing clerks where applicable.

Here's the final event log in Markdown format:

### Assumptions:
- Each `item_picking_date` is treated as a separate "Items Picked" event if multiple items are picked on different dates.
- The `sales_person_id` from the `Orders` table is used as the resource for the "Order Created" activity.
- The `picker_id` from the `Order Lines` table is used as the resource for the "Items Picked" activity.
- The `carrier_id` from the `Delivery` table is used as the resource for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" activities.
- The `billing_person_id` from the `Invoice` table is used as the resource for the "Invoice Issued" activity.
- The `payment_method` and `payment_reference` from the `Payments` table are included in the "Payment Received" activity.
