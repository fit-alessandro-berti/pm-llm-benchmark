### Summary
The process involves a series of activities starting from collecting goods and loading them onto trucks, driving the trucks to terminals, handling containers through weighing, stock placement, and loading onto vehicles, managing vehicle booking and departures, and finally ensuring that customer orders and transport documents are processed correctly. The forklifts play a crucial role in moving containers between different stages of the process. The data also shows that there are multiple rescheduling activities, indicating a dynamic and sometimes complex logistics environment.
