The drawing is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that explains how a computer-hardware company prepares an outgoing shipment.  
The canvas is organised as swim-lanes, so you can see who is responsible for each activity:

1. Logistics (top lane)  
2. Secretary / clerical staff (middle lane)  
3. Warehouse (bottom lane)  

Process flow (left  right)

A. Start event – “Ship goods” is triggered in the Secretary lane.

B. Parallel gateway  
   • One branch goes straight to the Warehouse so the goods can already be packed.  
   • The other branch stays in the Secretary lane where the clerical part of the shipment is clarified.

C. “Clarify shipment method”  
   • An exclusive gateway asks: “Special handling?”  
     – If YES, the goods need insurance.  
         · Task “Check if insurance is required” consults customer data.  
         · A second gateway decides:  
             • If insurance is required, the parcel is insured (“Insure parcel”).  
             • In all cases a shipping label is created (“Write package label”).  
     – If NO special handling is needed, a standard logistics service is selected.  
         · Three quotations are collected (“Get 3 offers from logistic companies”).  
         · The preferred carrier is chosen and the order is placed (“Select logistic company and place order”).

D. A merging exclusive gateway reunites the special-handling path with the standard path.

E. Synchronisation parallel gateway  
   • One incoming token comes from the clerical/logistics path above.  
   • The second incoming token comes from the Warehouse after packing is finished.  
   The shipment cannot proceed until both prerequisites are met.

F. Warehouse work  
   • “Package goods” is performed in parallel with the clerical activities.  
   • A timer intermediate event (48 h) is attached to the packaging task. If packaging is not finished within two days, the customer is informed (“Notify customer about delay”).

G. After synchronisation the process continues in the Secretary lane:  
   • “Fill out shipment paperwork”  
   • “Move package to pickup area”

H. End event – “Shipment prepared”.

Key points illustrated by the diagram

• Role separation: clerical vs. warehouse vs. logistics functions.  
• Parallelism: packing happens at the same time as carrier/insurance selection.  
• Decision logic: special-handling and insurance branches.  
• Escalation: automatic customer notification if packing exceeds 48 h.  
• Synchronisation: the shipment cannot close until both the physical package and the administrative work are ready.

Overall, the diagram shows a well-structured shipping workflow with clear responsibilities, decision gates, time monitoring and final hand-off to the carrier.
