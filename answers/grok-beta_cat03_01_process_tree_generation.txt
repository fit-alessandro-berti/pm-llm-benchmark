Let's construct the process tree for the described hospital patient management scenario step-by-step:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Initialize the root of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# 1. Arrival, Registration, and Intake Assessment
arrival_registration_intake = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=arrival_registration_intake)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=arrival_registration_intake)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=arrival_registration_intake)
arrival_registration_intake.children = [A, RG, IA]
root.children.append(arrival_registration_intake)

# 2. Triage Process
triage = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage)
triage.children = [TI, TC]
root.children.append(triage)

# 3. Initial Diagnostic Tests (Exclusive Choice)
initial_test = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=initial_test)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=initial_test)
initial_test.children = [CE, FBP]
root.children.append(initial_test)

# 4. Loop for Specialist Consultation, Treatment, and Re-Diagnostic
loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=loop)
treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=treatment_choice)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=treatment_choice)
treatment_choice.children = [TM, SPT]

re_diagnostic = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=re_diagnostic)
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=re_diagnostic)
re_diagnostic.children = [FCE, FBA]

# Constructing the loop
loop.children = [SC, treatment_choice, re_diagnostic]
root.children.append(loop)

# 5. Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling in Parallel
imaging_counseling = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=imaging_counseling)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=imaging_counseling)
imaging_counseling.children = [AI, NC]
root.children.append(imaging_counseling)

# 6. Final Administrative Steps
final_admin = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=final_admin)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=final_admin)
final_admin.children = [FAS, DDI]
root.children.append(final_admin)

# 7. Final Concurrent Activities
final_concurrent = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=final_concurrent)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=final_concurrent)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=final_concurrent)
final_concurrent.children = [BL, ICP, MRF]
root.children.append(final_concurrent)

# The process tree is now constructed
```

This code constructs the process tree for the complex hospital patient management scenario as described:

- **Sequence (->)** operations are used for steps that must be done in order.
- **Exclusive Choice (X)** operations for decisions where only one option is taken.
- **Parallel (+)** operations for activities that can occur concurrently.
- **Loop (*)** operation for the repeated diagnostic and treatment cycle.

Remember, after normal results are achieved, the loop would naturally exit, and the process would continue with the steps following the loop. The `tau` (silent step) was not necessary in this scenario, but if needed for any hidden transitions, it could be added similarly as other activities.
