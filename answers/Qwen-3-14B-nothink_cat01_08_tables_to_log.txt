# Event Log for Order Processing Process Mining

This event log has been derived from the ERP system data and represents the full lifecycle of each order from creation to payment receipt. The events are ordered chronologically and linked by `order_id`.

### Assumptions and Notes:

- **Activity Names**: Derived from the lifecycle of the order based on table fields (e.g., `item_picking_date`  "Items Picked").
- **Timestamps**: Used the earliest possible date for multi-item picking and delivery events. If multiple deliveries exist for an order, each is treated as a separate event.
- **Case ID**: Used `order_id` as the unique identifier for process instances.
- **Resource Mapping**: Used the `resource_id` from the tables and matched with the `Resources Table` to infer actor names and roles.
- **Missing Data**: No missing data was encountered in the key fields used for event generation. All events for all `order_id`s were included.

This event log is now ready for use in process mining tools for analysis of the order-to-payment process.
