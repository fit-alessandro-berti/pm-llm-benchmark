4.  What strategies are used to ensure ethical sourcing of materials and fair labor practices throughout the entire supply chain, including sub-tier suppliers?

5.  How does the company adapt its supply chain strategy for new product launches (which have high uncertainty in demand) versus established products (which have more predictable demand)?

6.  What specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to monitor and evaluate the overall performance and efficiency of the supply chain, and how frequently are they reviewed?

7.  How are demand forecasting models updated and refined based on real-time sales data, market trends, and promotional activities? How is the accuracy of these forecasts assessed?

8.  What are the most significant risks associated with relying on a single assembly plant in Malaysia, and what mitigation strategies are in place?
