This is a business process flow diagram (likely in BPMN notation) that illustrates a goods shipping workflow across three organizational swim lanes:

## Swim Lanes:
1. **Logistics** (top)
2. **Dispatch/Secretary Stop** (middle)  
3. **Warehouse** (bottom)

## Process Flow:

The process begins with "Ship goods" and follows two main paths:

**Main Path:**
- Starts with a decision point about "Special handling?"
- If YES: Routes to "Clarify shipment method"
- Then proceeds to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies"
- Followed by "Select logistic company and place order"

**Insurance Path:**
- If NO special handling: Goes to "Check if insurance is required"
- Connects to a "Customer information" database
- If insurance is needed, it triggers "Write package label" (always) and "Insure parcel" (in Logistics lane)

**Warehouse Operations:**
- "Package goods" activity (with 48-hour timer)
- "Notify customer about delay" subprocess
- "Fill out shipment paperwork"
- "Move package to pickup area"
- Ends with "Shipment prepared"

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols including circles for start/end events, rectangles for tasks, diamonds for decision gateways, and shows the coordination between different departments in the shipping process.
