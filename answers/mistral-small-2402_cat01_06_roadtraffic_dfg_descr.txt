This data represents a process flow for handling fines and penalties. The process begins with the creation of a fine, which can then either be paid directly or sent for further processing. If sent for further processing, the fine is recorded and a notification is inserted. From here, a penalty can be added and the case can be sent for credit collection. If the offender chooses to appeal, the case goes to a prefecture and then possibly to a judge. If the appeal is successful, the offender is notified and the case may be closed or further penalties may be added. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the case can be sent for credit collection or further penalties can be added. There are also some loops in the process, such as when a payment is made and the case is sent back to an earlier step.
