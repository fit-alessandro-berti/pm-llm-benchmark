1. Normativerule compliance (hard constraints)

Case 1 – COMPLIANT  
• All mandatory activities are present.  
• Required ordering is respected (Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant …).  
• Approved-branch activities (Finalize Documentation  Close Case) are correct.  

Case 2 – VIOLATION  
a) Ordering error – Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check.  
b) Mandatory activity missing – “Inform Applicant” never happens.  
c) Forbidden action – “Finalize Documentation” is executed even though the decision is Rejected.  
d) Consequently, the case is closed in an invalid state.  

Case 3 – COMPLIANT  
• Every mandatory activity is present and in the right order.  
• Approved branch is respected (Finalize Documentation precedes Close Case).  


2. Desiderata compliance (soft, “nice-to-have”)

                                     Credit-check  24 h?   Inform  48 h?   Follow-up Call?
Case 1                                     (30 min)           (2 h)            (missing)
Case 2                                     (1 h)              (not sent)       (missing)
Case 3                                     (49 h)             (51 h)           (missing)

Interpretation:

• Case 1 only misses the optional Follow-up Call – a minor imperfection.  
• Case 2 already breaks hard rules; soft-rule evaluation is immaterial, but it also lacks the Follow-up Call and the notification.  
• Case 3 shows two timing overruns and no Follow-up Call – sub-optimal yet still legally/contractually sound.


3. Possible explanations & recommendations

Case 1  
– Looks like the reference (“happy-path”) execution; simply encourage staff to add a quick Follow-up Call before closing future cases.

Case 2  
– The ordering mistake suggests that either (i) the Risk Assessment team started work before the credit bureau reply was available, or (ii) the event log was keyed in out of order.  
– Finalizing documentation after a rejection may stem from re-using an “approved” script without checking the outcome.  
Action: treat as a process breach; trigger corrective training or system controls that block Risk Assessment until Credit Check is logged and block Finalize Documentation when decision = Rejected.

Case 3  
– Delays hint at workload peaks, holidays, or waiting for external information.  
– Although not critical, prolonged waiting can hurt customer satisfaction; consider SLA monitoring dashboards or automated reminders for:  
   • Perform Credit Check within 24 h of application receipt.  
   • Notify applicants within 48 h of decision.  
– Encourage adding the (optional) Follow-up Call to reinforce customer relationship.

Summary:
• Normative violations only occur in Case 2 (ordering, missing notification, forbidden documentation).  
• Desiderata shortfalls: Follow-up Calls are missing in all three cases; timing overruns in Case 3.
