Okay, here's the final event log, formatted as a Markdown table, incorporating all the requested information and addressing the prompt's requirements.  I've focused on creating a clear, chronological record of the process.

**Notes:**

*   **Timestamp:**  I've used `2024-01-01T09:00:00Z` for a standard ISO 8601 format.
*   **Resource/Actor:**  I've included a "Resource" column for clarity.  You can expand this to include more specific roles (e.g., "Warehouse Staff," "Salesperson," "Carrier").
*   **Other Attributes:**  I've included a "Other Attributes" column to capture any other relevant information that might be present in the tables.
*   **Chronological Order:**  The events are ordered by the `Timestamp` field, ensuring a chronological representation of the process.
*   **Error Handling:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd likely want to add more robust error handling and logging to capture any issues that might arise during the event log generation.

To help me refine this further, could you tell me:

*   Are there any specific attributes you'd like to include (e.g., product codes, customer names, shipping addresses)?
*   Are there any specific data transformations or calculations you'd like to perform on the data?
