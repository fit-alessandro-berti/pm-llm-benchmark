# Description of the Visualization

This image contains three related diagrams illustrating the **proclet modeling approach** for workflow systems:

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels

This is the main diagram showing two interacting workflow processes:

**Left side - "Lab visit" process:**
- Activities include: Order entry, Take blood sample, Receive result, Judge results, Do tests again, Receive updated result, and Send report
- Roles involved: doctor, lab assistant

**Right side - "Lab test" process:**
- Activities include: Perform test, Make report, Finish lab test, Perform test again, and Provide updated report
- Role involved: chemical analyst

**Communication Channels:**
- **Order system**: Connects order entry to lab test initiation
- **HIS**: Handles results communication between processes

Cardinality notations (1,1 and 1,?) indicate message multiplicities.

## (b) Class Diagram
A simple UML-style diagram showing:
- "Lab visit" **requires** "Lab test"
- Cardinality: 1..1 to 1..* (one lab visit requires one or more lab tests)

## (c) Example of a Performative
A table showing a sample message with fields:
- **Time**: 11:00
- **Channel**: Order system
- **Content**: "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
- **Direction**: OUT
