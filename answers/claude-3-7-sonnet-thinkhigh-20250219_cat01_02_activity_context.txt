# Analysis of Support Workflow Event Log and Activity Renaming

After carefully examining the provided event log, I've identified several activities that appear multiple times but carry different contextual meanings. Below is my analysis and revised event log with renamed activities.

## 1. Identification of Recurring Activities

The following activities appear multiple times with different contexts:

- **Verify Documents**: Occurs twice in cases C001 and C003, with different purposes
- **Call Customer**: Occurs with different intents across all cases
- **Initiate Request**: Occurs through different channels
- **Adjust Account**: Occurs for different purposes in C002 and C003

## 2. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities

## 3. Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Initiate Request**  **Initiate Online Request** / **Initiate In-Branch Request**
   - Contextual clue: The channel through which the request was submitted (web portal vs. physical branch)
   - This clarifies the origin point of the customer request journey

2. **Verify Documents**  **Initial Document Verification** / **Re-verify Documents**
   - Contextual clue: First occurrence is always the initial check, while second occurrence happens after additional information or corrections
   - This distinguishes between first-time verification and subsequent reviews

3. **Call Customer**  Various purposes (**for Missing Documents**, **for Clarification**, **for Confirmation**, **to Return**)
   - Contextual clue: The stated purpose of the call varies significantly across instances
   - These names capture the specific intent behind each customer contact

4. **Submit Additional**  **Submit Additional Documents**
   - Contextual clue: "Customer uploads the requested ID scan"
   - The new name clarifies what is being submitted

5. **Adjust Account**  **Adjust Account Details** / **Correct Account Information**
   - Contextual clue: Different reasons for account modification (post-clarification vs. missing information)
   - These names reflect the specific nature of the adjustment being made

6. **Approve Request**  **Final Request Approval**
   - Contextual clue: Always the last step in the process
   - The new name emphasizes its role as the concluding activity

By renaming these activities based on their context, the process flow becomes much clearer and the specific purpose of each activity is immediately apparent, making the log more useful for process analysis and improvement.
