<answer>### Step 1: Analyze Both POWL Models Relative to the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process  


The **standard Hire-to-Retire process** follows a sequential flow:  
*Post Job Ad  Screen Candidates  Conduct Interviews  Make Hiring Decision  Onboard Employee  Add to Payroll  Close Case*. Critical steps like onboarding and payroll are mandatory, and activities are ordered logically to ensure hiring integrity (e.g., interviews precede final decisions, onboarding precedes payroll).  


- **POWL Model 1 Analysis**:  
  Model 1’s structure includes:  
  - `Post  Screen  Decide` (direct flow from Screen to Decide).  
  - `Screen  Interview` (another path from Screen).  
  - `Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close` (sequential mandatory steps after decision).  

  *Alignment with Standard*: While Model 1 allows branching from *Screen* (either *Decide* or *Interview*), the sequential order *Decide  Onboarding  Payroll  Close* aligns with the core logic of a decision leading to onboarding and payroll. However, the option to proceed *without an interview* (via `Screen  Decide`) is a deviation from standard practice, where interviews typically occur before final decisions.  

- **POWL Model 2 Analysis**:  
  Model 2’s structure includes:  
  - Parallel paths from `Post` (both `Screen` and `Interview` branch directly from `Post`).  
  - A loop (`*(Onboard, skip)*`) and an exclusive choice (`Xor(Payroll, skip)`) for critical steps like onboarding and payroll.  

  *Alignment with Standard*: Model 2 introduces severe deviations. Parallel paths for `Screen` and `Interview` (starting simultaneously from `Post`) contradict the standard sequence (*post*  *screen*  *interview*). Additionally, the loops allow skipping *Onboard* (*skip* after the loop) and *Payroll* (via the Xor node), which makes the process incomplete (hired employees cannot be added to payroll without onboarding).  


### Step 2: Identify Anomalies in Each Model  


#### Anomalies in Model 1:  
1. **Branching After Screening**: The `Screen  Decide` and `Screen  Interview` edges create a branching where the decision (or interview) can occur directly after screening, without a requirement for interviews in all cases.  
   - *Severity*: Less severe (still allows a standard “screen  interview  decide” path).  
2. **Possible Bypass of Interviews**: The `Screen  Decide` path bypasses interviews, which is non-standard—interviews typically occur before final hiring decisions.  


#### Anomalies in Model 2:  
1. **Parallel Paths from Initial Step**: `Post  Screen` and `Post  Interview` (starting screen and interview simultaneously after posting) violates the standard sequence (*post*  *screen*  *interview*).  
2. **Loops for Critical Steps**:  
   - `loop_onboarding` (optional onboarding via `skip`) makes it possible to skip onboarding, which is essential for payroll setup.  
   - `xor_payroll` (optional payroll via `skip`) makes it possible to skip payroll, which is necessary after onboarding.  
   - *Severity*: Severe, as they eliminate mandatory steps in the hiring process.  


### Step 3: Decide Which Model Aligns with the Normative Process  


**Model 1 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process.** Here’s the justification:  

1. **Essential Steps Are Not Eliminated**: Model 1 retains the critical sequence *Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close*, ensuring that hiring decisions lead to onboarding and payroll (necessary for employment). While it allows an optional path `Screen  Decide`, the core mandatory steps (onboarding, payroll) remain intact.  
2. **Less Severe Anomalies**: Model 1’s anomalies are primarily “optional paths” (e.g., skipping interviews), but it does not eliminate critical steps entirely (unlike Model 2, which allows skipping onboarding and payroll). The standard process may still permit some flexibility (e.g., hiring without interviews for very Entry-level roles), which Model 1 can accommodate without breaking process integrity.  
3. **Model 2’s Severe Anomalies**: By allowing parallel initial steps (Screen/Interview) and skipping critical loops (Onboarding/Payroll), Model 2 fundamental violates the essence of the process—hiring requires onboarding and payroll, which Model 2 explicitly makes optional via its structures.  


In summary, while both models deviate from the standard, Model 1’s anomalies are less severe and preserve process integrity, making it closer to a normative “Hire-to-Retire” workflow.
