1. An example of a “legallooking” trace that the tree will accept, but that clearly violates the OrdertoCash business rules is:

   Receive_Order  
   Check_Inventory  
   Ship_Order  
   Authorize_Payment  
   Package_Items  
   Close_Order  

2. Why this is a problem:

   • In the tree, the three “successful” tasks (Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order) are under a PARALLEL node.  That means the model will happily accept them in any order, as long as all three occur before the final Close_Order.  
   • In reality you cannot ship goods before (a) the customer’s payment has been authorized, and (b) the goods have been packaged.  By shipping first and only later authorizing payment and packaging, you would be sending out unpaid, unprepared merchandise—obvious domain nonsense.  

The root cause is underfitting: the model allows arbitrary interleavings of those three activities, whereas the true business process imposes the stricter sequence  
   Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Ship_Order.
