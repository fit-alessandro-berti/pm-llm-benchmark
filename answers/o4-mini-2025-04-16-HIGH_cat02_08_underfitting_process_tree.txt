A perfectly legal trace under this tree is, for example:

  1. Receive_Order  
  2. Check_Inventory  
  3. Ship_Order  
  4. Package_Items  
  5. Authorize_Payment  
  6. Close_Order  

Why the model accepts it  
• After Check_Inventory the model goes into a PARALLELblock over {Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order}.  
• A PARALLEL operator allows any interleaving of its children, as long as each one eventually occurs.  
• Here we interleave them as Ship  Package  Authorize, and then we exit the XOR and fire the final Close_Order.  

Why it is domain–invalid  
1. Business rule: you must *authorize payment* before you do any packing or shipping.  
2. Business rule: you must *package* the goods before shipping them.  

In the trace above you have shipped goods (Ship_Order) and even packed them (Package_Items) *before* ever authorizing the customer’s payment. That is obviously nonsensical from an Order-to-Cash perspective, but the underfitting (over-permissive) PARALLEL operator in the model fails to block it.
