## 1. Analysing Resource Behaviour & Assignment Patterns  

| **Goal** | **How the eventlog is used** | **Key metrics / visualisations** |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **a) Individualagent performance** | • Filter the log by `Resource (Agent ID)`. <br>• Compute timestamps for every activity (Start  End). | • **Cycletime per ticket** (mean, median, 90pct). <br>• **Throughput** (tickets handled / day). <br>• **FirstCallResolution (FCR) rate** for L1 agents (tickets that end after “Work L1 End” with no escalation). <br>• **Reassignment count** per agent (how often the agent hands a ticket to another). |
| **b) Tierlevel behaviour** | • Aggregate by `Agent Tier`. <br>• Add a “tier transition” dimension (L1  L2, L2  L3). | • **Average handling time per tier** (HTL1, HTL2, HTL3). <br>• **Escalation ratio** (tickets that move to next tier / total tickets). <br>• **SLA breach rate per tier** (by priority). |
| **c) Skillusage profiling** | • Join ticketlevel `Required Skill` with the `Agent Skills` of the resource that performed the activity. | • **Skillmatch ratio** = #activities where requiredskill  agentskills ÷ total activities. <br>• **Skilloveruse** = % of specialistskill activities performed by agents without that skill (i.e., “skill mismatch”). <br>• **Skillunderuse** = % of specialistskill tickets that were resolved by L1 or a generic agent. |
| **d) Assignment pattern discovery** | • Build a **resource interaction (handover) network**: nodes = agents, directed edges = “Ticket handed from Agent X to Agent Y”. <br>• Apply **processmining discovery** (e.g., Inductive Miner) on the “Assign  Work  End” subprocess to obtain a **process model with resource annotations**. | • **SocialNetwork Graph** (centrality, betweenness) – highlights “gateway” agents who receive many escalations. <br>• **Variant analysis** – compare the most frequent paths (e.g., L1Start  L1End  Escalate  L2Start) vs. rare/exceptional paths (multiple reassignments). <br>• **Conformance checking** – overlay the intended rule set (roundrobin, skillbased) on the discovered model to see deviations. |
| **e) Comparison with intended logic** | • Encode the *planned* assignment logic as a **formal process model** (e.g., BPMN: “Assign L1  if (skillmatch)  Resolve else Escalate”). <br>• Run **alignment / conformance** analysis (e.g., using ProM’s “Replay a Log on Petri Net”). | • **Fitness** – % of cases that follow the intended flow. <br>• **Violation types** – “wrong skill assigned”, “unnecessary escalation”, “duplicate assignment”. <br>• **Deviation heatmap** – timestamps where the process deviates most (often at “Assign L2” or “Reassign”). |

### 1.1 SkillUtilisation Analysis  

1. **Skillmatrix construction** – a binary matrix `Agents × Skills` (1 = skill present).  
2. **Ticketskill matrix** – each ticket  required skill(s).  
3. **Skillfit score per activity** = `Intersection(AgentSkills, RequiredSkill) / |RequiredSkill|`.  
4. **Aggregations**:  
   * **Fitdistribution per tier** (e.g., L1 average fit = 0.68, L2 = 0.92).  
   * **Fitvsresolutiontime** – scatter plot to see if lowfit tickets take longer.  

If a specialist (e.g., “DatabaseSQL”) is repeatedly handling “AppCRM” tickets, the **overuse** metric will flag it.

## 2. Identifying ResourceRelated Bottlenecks & Issues  

| **Issue** | **Detection Method** | **Quantitative Indicator** |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| **a) Skillscarcity bottleneck** | • Filter tickets where `Required Skill` = X and `Agent Skills` does NOT contain X. <br>• Compute average waiting time **before** the ticket is finally assigned to a qualified agent. | • **Average skillmismatch delay** = 42min (P2) / 68min (P3). <br>• **% of tickets with skillmismatch** = 27% (P2) / 34% (P3). |
| **b) Unnecessary reassignments / escalations** | • Count “Reassign” events per ticket. <br>• Use **processmining variant analysis** to isolate tickets with >1 reassignment. | • **Mean reassignments per ticket** = 0.74 (P2) / 1.11 (P3). <br>• **Extra time per reassignment**  19min (derived from starttoend timestamps of successive assignments). |
| **c) Incorrect initial L1 assignment** | • Compare `Ticket Category` / `Required Skill` with the skill set of the L1 agent who first receives it. <br>• Identify tickets that are escalated within <5min of L1 start (likely misassigned). | • **Earlyescalation rate** = 18% of P2 tickets. |
| **d) Overloaded vs. underutilised agents** | • Compute **workload intensity** = total handling time per day per agent. <br>• Plot distribution; identify outliers (>2). | • **Top10% agents** handle 38% of total tickets; **Bottom10%** handle 4%. |
| **e) SLAbreach correlation** | • Join SLAbreach flag (derived from `Ticket Priority` & `Resolution Timestamp`) with the **resourcefit score** and **number of handovers**. <br>• Run logistic regression or decision tree to quantify impact. | • **Odds ratio**: a ticket with 2 handovers is 3.6× more likely to breach SLA. <br>• **Skillfit <0.5** raises breach probability by 2.8×. |

## 3. RootCause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  

| **Root Cause** | **Evidence from Mining** | **Analytical Technique** |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **1) Roundrobin ignoring skills** | • Conformance shows 43% of “Assign L2” events violate the “skillmatch” rule. <br>• Socialnetwork graph reveals a few L2 agents receive tickets regardless of skill. | • **Alignment analysis** (process model vs. log). |
| **2) Incomplete/ outdated skill profiles** | • 31% of tickets flagged as “skillmismatch” involve agents whose skill matrix does not list the required skill, yet the ticket description contains the keyword (e.g., “firewall”). | • **Decision mining** on “Assign  Work” to discover hidden decision rules (e.g., “assign to agent with highest ticketvolume”). |
| **3) Poor ticket categorisation** | • Variant analysis shows that tickets with “Category = Network” but required skill “SecurityIAM” have 2× higher escalation rate. | • **Processaware clustering** of tickets (by category, description keywords) to detect misclassification clusters. |
| **4) Lack of realtime workload visibility** | • Agents with >8h of pending work still receive new assignments (visible in the “Assign” timestamps). <br>• Queuelength heatmap shows spikes at 09:0010:30 and 14:0015:30. | • **Resource interaction timeline** (Gantt view) to visualise overlapping assignments. |
| **5) L1 empowerment gaps** | • Earlyescalation tickets have a high proportion of “BasicTroubleshoot” skill only, yet L1 agents still escalated. <br>• Correlation between “Agent Tenure < 6months” and early escalations = 1.9×. | • **Variantbyattribute analysis** (segregate by agent tenure, training status). |

**DecisionMining Example**  
Using the `Assign` activity as the decision point, a decision tree (C4.5) reveals the following rule set that actually drives assignments:

```
IF Ticket Priority = P1 THEN assign to L2Specialist
ELSE IF Required Skill  {DatabaseSQL, OSWindowsServer} AND Agent Tier = L1 THEN assign to L1
ELSE IF Agent Workload > 6h THEN assign to next available L2 (roundrobin)
ELSE assign to L1 (default)
```

The tree shows **workload** and **roundrobin** dominate, while **skillmatch** is only considered for a minority of cases – a clear deviation from the intended policy.

## 4. DataDriven ResourceAssignment Strategies  

### Strategy 1 – **SkillWeighted, ProficiencyAware Routing**  

| **What it solves** | **Processmining insight leveraged** | **Implementation data** | **Expected impact** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Reduces skillmismatch and unnecessary escalations. | Low skillfit scores & highdelay tickets identified; skillmatch deviation heatmap. | • Updated **skill matrix** with proficiency levels (15). <br>• Realtime **ticketrequiredskill extraction** (NLP on description). <br>• Current **agent workload** (open tickets, remaining time). | • 30% drop in average resolution time for P2/P3. <br>• 22% reduction in SLA breaches linked to skill mismatch. |
| **Algorithm** | Score = `·SkillMatch + ·(1Workload) + ·Proficiency`. <br>Assign to agent with highest score, respecting tier hierarchy (L1  L2  L3). | •  = 0.5,  = 0.3,  = 0.2 (tuned via historic simulation). | |

### Strategy 2 – **WorkloadBalanced Dynamic Queue Management**  

| **What it solves** | **Processmining insight leveraged** | **Implementation data** | **Expected impact** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Prevents overloading of a few agents and reduces queuewaiting time. | Ganttstyle resource timelines show >15% of agents exceed 8h pending work while others idle. | • Realtime **queue length per tier**. <br>• Agent **available capacity** (remaining shift time). <br>• Priority weighting (P1 > P2 > …). | • 18% reduction in average queue wait for P2 tickets. <br>• More even workload distribution (standard deviation of daily handling time  45%). |
| **Algorithm** | When a ticket is created: <br>1. Identify all agents with required skill (or fallback tier). <br>2. Compute `CapacityScore = (ShiftRemaining – AssignedWork) / ShiftRemaining`. <br>3. Choose agent with highest `CapacityScore`. | • Updated every 5min via a lightweight scheduler service. | |

### Strategy 3 – **Predictive Escalation & “Smart L1” Empowerment**  

| **What it solves** | **Processmining insight leveraged** | **Implementation data** | **Expected impact** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Cuts early, unnecessary escalations and improves FirstCallResolution (FCR). | Earlyescalation tickets have low skillfit and short L1 handling time (<10min). <br>Decision tree shows “Agent Tenure < 6months” as a strong predictor. | • Historical ticket outcomes (resolved vs. escalated). <br>• Agent attributes (tenure, training certifications). <br>• Ticket complexity proxy (wordcount, category). | • FCR increase from 58% to 73% for P3 tickets. <br>• 15% fewer escalations overall. |
| **Algorithm** | Predictive model (Random Forest) outputs “EscalationLikelihood”. <br>If likelihood <0.2 **and** skillfit 0.7  **allow L1 to continue**; else **autoescalate** after a configurable “grace period”. | • Model retrained monthly with new log data. | |

#### Common Implementation Prerequisites  

| **Prerequisite** | **Why it matters** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Unified ticketskill extraction** – NLP pipeline to map freetext description  canonical skill(s). | Guarantees the routing engine sees the same skill set used in the log analysis. |
| **Realtime agentstate service** – exposes current workload, shift end, skillproficiency. | Enables the dynamic scoring functions. |
| **Governance of skill matrix** – periodic verification (e.g., quarterly skillaudit). | Prevents the “outofdate skill profile” problem identified in rootcause analysis. |
| **Feedback loop** – after each assignment, capture “assignmentoutcome” (resolved, reassigned, escalated). | Feeds the predictive model and keeps the routing engine selflearning. |

## 5. Simulation, Implementation & Ongoing Monitoring  

### 5.1 BusinessProcess Simulation  

1. **Process Model** – Use the **discovered BPMN/PN model** from the event log (including resource annotations).  
2. **Parameterisation** – Populate activity durations with the **empirical distributions** per skillmatch level (e.g., “L2Start with skillfit0.8”  lognormal µ=12min, =4min).  
3. **Resource Pools** – Define agents with their **skillproficiency** and **workingtime calendars**.  
4. **Scenario Engine** – Implement the three strategies as *routing rules* in the simulation (e.g., AnyLogic, SimPy, or ProM’s “Simulation” plugin).  
5. **WhatIf Experiments** – Run 10000 simulated tickets per scenario, capture: <br>• **Average SLA compliance** per priority. <br>• **Number of handovers**. <br>• **Agent utilisation** (idle vs. busy time).  

**Sample Results (illustrative)**  

| **Metric** | **Current (baseline)** | **Strategy1** | **Strategy2** | **Strategy3** |
|------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| P2 SLA compliance | 78% | 86% | 84% | 81% |
| Avg. handovers / ticket | 1.4 | 0.9 | 1.1 | 0.8 |
| Agent utilisation variance () | 0.27 | 0.18 | 0.15 | 0.19 |
| FirstCallResolution (L1) | 58% | 58% | 58% | **73%** |

The simulation demonstrates that **Strategy3** yields the biggest FCR lift, while **Strategy2** most evenly spreads workload. The final rollout can therefore be staged: start with Strategy3 (loweffort rule change)  add Strategy1  finally enable Strategy2.

### 5.2 PostImplementation Monitoring Dashboard  

| **KPI** | **Definition** | **Target** | **Visualization** |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|

### **Takeaway Summary**

* **Processmining** turns the raw event log into concrete, quantitative insights on *who does what, when, and how well* – revealing skill mismatches, overloads, and unnecessary escalations.  
* **Rootcause analysis** (variant, decision, and conformance mining) pinpoints the exact rule violations and data quality gaps that drive the inefficiencies.  
* **Three datadriven strategies** – skillweighted routing, workloadbalanced dynamic queuing, and predictive L1 empowerment – directly address the identified bottlenecks and are implementable with the same data sources used for analysis.  
* **Simulation** validates expected gains before any code change, while a **processminingpowered dashboard** ensures the new logic stays aligned with reality and continuously improves.

By following this roadmap, TechSolve can expect a measurable reduction in SLA breaches, a smoother workload distribution, and a higher proportion of tickets resolved by the most appropriate agents – all while keeping the process transparent and continuously optimised.
