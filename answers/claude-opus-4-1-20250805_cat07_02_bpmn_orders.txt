This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram showing an order fulfillment process across four swim lanes representing different organizational roles or departments:

## Swim Lanes (from top to bottom):
1. **Seller** - Handles the main order processing
2. **Production** - Manages product manufacturing
3. **Procurement** - Deals with material sourcing
4. **Warehouse** - Manages product shipping

## Process Flow:

### Seller Lane:
The process begins when a customer order is received (Monday morning start event). It flows through:
- "Check order for completeness" 
- A decision gateway checking if the customer is already in the database
- If not, "Add customer to the database"
- Both paths converge at another gateway leading to "Send order details"
- The process ends with "Draft invoice" and a signal event for "Product sent"

A subprocess called "Check customer's order" encompasses most of these initial activities.

### Production Lane:
- Receives order details from the Seller
- "Plan production" activity
- Decision gateway leading to "Manufacture product"
- Ends with "Product complete" signal

This lane also shows a connection for "Material not faulty" feedback.

### Procurement Lane:
Contains a "Material Compensation Subprocess" that includes:
- "Order materials" activity
- Optional "Return materials" path
- "Check materials" activity
- Ends with "Order cancelled" signal

### Warehouse Lane:
- Receives "Product complete" signal
- "Send product" activity
- Ends with "Product sent" signal that connects back to the Seller lane

The diagram uses dashed lines to show message flows between lanes, indicating cross-departmental communication and coordination throughout the order fulfillment process.
