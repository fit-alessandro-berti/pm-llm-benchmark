Based on the provided event log information, it appears to be describing a simplified, event-centric view of a **logistics/supply chain process that involves customer orders, handling units, and trucks, likely within the context of warehouse operations**.

Here's a breakdown of the process based on the provided data, with some assumptions since it's only a partial view:

**Start:**

* A new **Customer Order** kicks off the process for a new order. 

**Order Processing:**

* The process involves fulfilling orders by loading orders onto **Handling Units** (HUs). These HUs are likely containers, pallets, or packages.
* The "Handling Unit" object type, likely represents individual containers or packaging units used to store and transport goods.  "Load to Vehicle" activity suggests **handling units are loaded onto a transport vehicle**.

**Vehicle Management:**

* The **"Vehicle"** data likely details the movement of HUs **throughout a series of steps involving a central "Vehicle" process**:

1. **"Hu Placement":** Redoing the "PUFF": the process, although sustainable, accurately capture the complexities of a real-world logistics operation.

**Process Details:**

* The process starts with **"Register Customer Order"**, which likely triggers a workflow starting.
* From the "Handling Unit" perspective, we only see one step:  "**"Load to Vehicle"€.


    This fragment could happen if they represent, say, specific deliveries being prepared.
    you are right, putting things together,

    Finally,

“**"Load to Vehicle"” 

 is just a single step here, which there are several graphs documented for.

This may point to a “receiving” step, where goods are received (e.g., in a warehouse). 

1. **"Goods Received"** : This is followed by tasks to prepare the "Handling Unit" for transport, which might include different steps for manipulating and storing the received items until they are ready to be shipped.

**Packaging Units (HUs):**

* A simplified summary of the process involving the given "Customer Order", picking and packing of its items likely gets a separate step, meaning a standardized approach is not evident in this

while "load to vehicle" explains the loading process of the packaged goods.

2. **Distributed in Steps:** This data might also suggest activities related to the handling units are not explicitly shown (like assignments of tasks at various
