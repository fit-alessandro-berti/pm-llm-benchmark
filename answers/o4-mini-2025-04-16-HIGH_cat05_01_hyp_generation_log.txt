Below is a sketch of the main anomalies we see in the sample cases, some hypotheses about root causes, and a set of SQL queries you can run against your `order_event_log`, `orders` and `resources` tables to investigate further.

1.  Anomalies & hypotheses  
   a.  Outoforder shipments  
       – Case 1002: “Confirm Shipment” and “Ship Goods” occur before “Perform Credit Check” and “Validate Stock.”  
       – Hypotheses:  
         •  Manual override for “priority” orders or servicelevel agreements  
         •  Interface/system bug that logs some events with wrong timestamps  
         •  Rogue user or inadequate training allowing bypass of credit/stock checks  
   b.  Missing or skipped steps  
       – Case 1003: No “Validate Stock” event at all; “Ship Goods” happens immediately after credit check.  
       – Hypotheses:  
         •  Stockvalidation system outage or hardcoded fallback  
         •  Process exception for small/standard orders  
   c.  Premature payments/invoicing  
       – Case 1004: “Receive Payment” before “Issue Invoice” and even before any shipment confirmation.  
       – Hypotheses:  
         •  Cashiers posting payments without invoicing (system bug or bad UI)  
         •  Test transactions or reconciliation entries in prod  
   d.  Shipments with “shipment_scheduled=N”  
       – Case 1004: Confirm Shipment says “N” but later “Ship Goods” is logged.  
       – Hypotheses:  
         •  Logistics manager manually forces pick/pack after autocancel  
         •  Data inconsistency between scheduling and execution modules  

2.  Investigation queries  

a.  Find all cases where Ship Goods happened before credit check or stock validation:  
```sql
SELECT
  case_id,
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods'           THEN timestamp END) AS ship_ts,
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) AS credit_ts,
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock'       THEN timestamp END) AS stock_ts
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING
     ship_ts < COALESCE(credit_ts, '9999-12-31'::timestamp)
  OR ship_ts < COALESCE(stock_ts,  '9999-12-31'::timestamp);
```

b.  Identify cases missing one or more required activities:  
```sql
SELECT
  case_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT activity)                          AS total_events,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock'       THEN 1 END) AS has_stock,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) AS has_credit
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock'       THEN 1 END) = 0
 OR COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 END) = 0;
```

c.  Cases with payment before invoicing:  
```sql
SELECT
  case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END)
  <
  MIN(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice'    THEN timestamp END);
```

d.  Ship Goods after a “shipment_scheduled=N” confirm:  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l.case_id
FROM order_event_log l
JOIN order_event_log c
  ON l.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE
  c.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND c.additional_info LIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%'
  AND l.activity = 'Ship Goods';
```

e.  Correlate anomalies with order type (e.g., priority vs. standard):  
```sql
WITH anomalies AS (
  /* reuse query (a) or (c) to tag case_id as anomalous */
  SELECT case_id FROM /* … */ 
)
SELECT
  o.order_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.case_id) AS num_anomalies,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.case_id) AS total_orders
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN anomalies a
  ON o.case_id = a.case_id
GROUP BY o.order_type;
```

f.  See which roles/departments are most often involved in anomalous steps:  
```sql
WITH anomaly_events AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM /* pick one anomaly definition, e.g. paymentbeforeinvoice */
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING /* … */
)
SELECT
  r.department,
  r.role,
  el.activity,
  COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM order_event_log el
JOIN resources r
  ON el.resource = r.resource_id
JOIN anomaly_events a
  ON el.case_id = a.case_id
GROUP BY r.department, r.role, el.activity
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
```

—  
These queries will flag outoforder, missing, or contradictory events; correlate them with order attributes and with the people/systems executing them; and help you surface patterns for further rootcause analysis (system bugs, policy exceptions, training gaps, etc.).
