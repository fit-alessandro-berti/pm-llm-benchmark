Here’s a sketch of how you might proceed:

1. Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors  
• Case 1002 “Confirm Shipment” (and even “Ship Goods”) happens before both “Perform Credit Check” and “Validate Stock” (additional_info says attempted_early=Y).  
• Case 1003 “Ship Goods” and “Issue Invoice” occur before “Validate Stock,” and “Confirm Shipment” comes only later (late_confirmation=Y).  
• Case 1004 “Receive Payment” appears immediately after “Register Order,” before “Issue Invoice” and before a successful “Confirm Shipment” (shipment_scheduled=N).  
• Across 1002–1004 we see both missing/out-of-order steps and payments or invoices recorded in the wrong sequence.

2. Hypotheses (possible root causes)  
• Manual overrides or policybypass by Sales/Logistics to expedite “priority” or high-value orders.  
• System or clock synchronization errors mis-ordering timestamps.  
• Processcontrol loopholes (insufficient validation in the app) letting steps be skipped.  
• Staff training gaps—people not following the correct SOP.  
• Dataentry mistakes in additional_info flags (e.g. mis-tagged attempted_early).

3. SQL Queries for Further Investigation  
(a) Detect any case where key steps are out-of-order:  
```sql
WITH times AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END)    AS t_credit,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Validate Stock'       THEN timestamp END)    AS t_validate,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Confirm Shipment'     THEN timestamp END)    AS t_confirm,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Ship Goods'           THEN timestamp END)    AS t_ship,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Issue Invoice'        THEN timestamp END)    AS t_invoice,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='Receive Payment'      THEN timestamp END)    AS t_payment
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id
FROM times
WHERE 
   (t_confirm < t_credit OR t_confirm < t_validate)
OR (t_ship    < t_confirm)
OR (t_invoice < t_ship)
OR (t_payment < t_invoice);
```

(b) List cases missing any mandatory activity:  
```sql
SELECT o.case_id
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT case_id,
         COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FILTER (
           WHERE activity IN (
             'Register Order','Perform Credit Check','Validate Stock',
             'Confirm Shipment','Ship Goods','Issue Invoice','Receive Payment'
           )
         ) AS cnt
  FROM order_event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
) x ON o.case_id = x.case_id
WHERE x.cnt < 7;
```

(c) Find all shipments confirmed early or late by flag:  
```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, additional_info
FROM order_event_log
WHERE activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
  AND (additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%'
    OR additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%');
```

(d) Spot payments recorded before invoices:  
```sql
SELECT case_id,
       MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Receive Payment') AS pay_ts,
       MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Issue Invoice')  AS inv_ts
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING pay_ts < inv_ts;
```

(e) Which roles/departments are most involved in anomaly cases?  
```sql
WITH bad_cases AS (
  -- reuse query (a) here to list case_id
  SELECT case_id FROM times
  WHERE …  -- same conditions as above
)
SELECT r.department,
       r.role,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.case_id) AS anomaly_count
FROM order_event_log e
JOIN bad_cases b   ON e.case_id = b.case_id
JOIN resources r   ON e.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY r.department, r.role
ORDER BY anomaly_count DESC;
```

(f) Measure timelags between steps, to spot outliers or toofast “ConfirmShip”:  
```sql
SELECT
  case_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM
    MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Perform Credit Check')
  - MIN(timestamp)  FILTER (WHERE activity='Register Order')
  )/60 AS mins_to_credit,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM
    MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Ship Goods')
  - MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='Confirm Shipment')
  )/60 AS mins_confirm_to_ship
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id;
```

These queries will help you quantify how many orders deviate, who’s involved, and where to dig deeper (e.g. join back to `orders.order_type` or filter by `additional_info` channels).
