Based on the analysis of the normative process description and the event log, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow.

### 1. Summary of Deviating Cases

The cases that violate the normative process are:

*   **Case 2**
*   **Case 3**
*   **Case 5**

Cases 1 and 4 are **conforming**. Case 1 perfectly follows the "Sufficient Inventory" path, and Case 4 perfectly follows the "Insufficient Inventory" path.

### 2. Explanation of Violations

Below is a detailed explanation of the rules violated by each deviating case, with references to the normative process description.

#### **Case 2**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> **Package items -> Authorize payment** -> Ship order -> Close order
*   **Violation:** Incorrect activity order. The activity "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment".
*   **Explanation:** The normative description explicitly states the correct sequence for a fulfilled order: "...the process should include the authorization of payment... **Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment**—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" This establishes a clear dependency where payment authorization must precede packaging. In Case 2, the items were packaged *before* the payment was authorized, which violates this core rule of the fulfillment path.

#### **Case 3**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Cancel order -> Ship order** -> Close order
*   **Violation 1:** Performing fulfillment activities after cancellation. The order was shipped *after* it had been canceled.
*   **Explanation:** The description is unambiguous on this point: "Once an order is canceled, **it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)**..." Shipping a canceled order is a direct contradiction of the process logic.

*   **Violation 2:** Mixing of fulfillment and cancellation paths. The process includes both "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order".
*   **Explanation:** The normative process describes two mutually exclusive paths after "Check inventory": one leading to fulfillment (starting with "Authorize payment") and another leading to cancellation ("Cancel order"). This case illogically combines activities from both paths. According to the cancellation scenario, "Cancel order" should follow "Check inventory" directly. Instead, payment was authorized first, and then the order was canceled, which is a confused and non-standard sequence.

#### **Case 5**

*   **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> **Ship order** -> Close order
*   **Violation:** A required activity is missing. The "Package items" activity was skipped.
*   **Explanation:** The normative description outlines a mandatory sequence for fulfillment: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' **Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'**" By moving directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order," this case skips the essential step of packaging. This violates the rule that an order must be packaged before it can be shipped.
