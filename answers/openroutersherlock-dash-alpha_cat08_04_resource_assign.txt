# Process Improvement Plan for TechSolve Solutions' IT Service Desk Using Process Mining

## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To analyze individual agent and tier performance, I would extract key resource-centric metrics from the event log using process mining tools like Celonis, Disco, or ProM:

**Key Metrics to Focus On:**
- **Workload Distribution:** Total cases handled per agent/tier, average cases per day, peak hour workload.
- **Processing Times:** Average/median cycle time per activity per agent/tier (Work L1 Start  Work L1 End), service time excluding waiting.
- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** Percentage of L1 assignments that complete without escalation (filter cases where "Escalate L2" activity is absent).
- **Skill-Specific Performance:** Throughput and resolution time for tickets requiring specific skills (e.g., App-CRM tickets handled by Agent B12 vs. others).
- **Escalation/Reassignment Frequency:** Number of escalations/reassignments initiated by each agent.

**Process Mining Techniques:**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Create resource perspective views showing handovers between agents (e.g., A05  B12  B15 for INC-1001). This reveals actual vs. intended tier progression.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Build handover networks weighted by frequency/duration. High-density connections between L1-L2 for specific categories indicate specialization gaps.
- **Role Discovery:** Use unsupervised clustering on activity profiles to discover emergent roles (e.g., "CRM Specialist," "Firewall Expert") vs. documented tiers/skills.
- **Dotted Chart Analysis:** Visualize timestamps to identify agent-specific bottlenecks (e.g., Agent B12's queue delays).

**Skill Utilization Analysis:**
- Cross-tabulate "Required Skill" vs. "Agent Skills" for all assignments.
- Calculate **Skill Match Rate** = (Assignments where agent has required skill) / Total assignments.
- Identify **Underutilization** by comparing specialists' time spent on basic tasks vs. complex ones.

*Expected Insight:* Current round-robin ignores skills, causing 30-50% skill mismatches and excessive handovers.

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the analysis above, pinpoint issues through targeted process mining views:

**Specific Problems to Identify:**
- **Skill Bottlenecks:** Filter by "Required Skill" and measure **Queue Time** (Assign  Work Start). Example: Networking-Firewall tickets wait 45+ minutes due to few specialists.
- **Reassignment Delays:** Calculate **Reassignment Overhead** = Average time from Reassign activity to next Work Start (e.g., INC-1001: 50 minutes from B12 to B15).
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments:** Analyze L1 FCR by category – low FCR (<20%) for Network/Security tickets indicates poor dispatcher decisions.
- **Overloaded Agents:** Identify agents with >120% utilization (workload/capacity) using throughput time distributions.
- **SLA Correlation:** Create **SLA Breach Sankey Diagram** segmented by assignment path (L1-only vs. L1L2 vs. L1L2Reassign).

**Quantified Impact Examples:**
```
Reassignment Impact: Each reassignment adds 38 min avg delay (p95: 90 min)
Skill Mismatch: 42% of P2 tickets initially assigned to non-matching agents
SLA Breaches: 67% of P2 SLA violations occur after escalation/reassignment
L1 Over-Escalation: 73% of Software-App tickets escalated despite L1 capability
```

**Bottleneck Detection:** Use **Performance Spectra** to highlight activities/agents with longest waiting times, correlated with ticket priority.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

**Potential Root Causes (Validated via Process Mining):**
1. **Round-Robin Blindness:** No skill consideration – confirmed by uniform distribution of complex tickets across unqualified L1 agents.
2. **Incomplete Skill Profiles:** Agent skills not updated – revealed by frequent reassignments within same tier (L2L2).
3. **Poor Ticket Triage:** Inaccurate "Required Skill" assignment at creation – shown by correlation between initial category and final resolved skill.
4. **No Workload Visibility:** Agents with high WIP receive new tickets – detected via parallel activity analysis.
5. **L1 De-Skilling:** Excessive escalation despite L1 success patterns – identified through variant analysis.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare "Happy Path" variants (L1Resolve, 0 reassigns) vs. "Problematic" variants (>2 reassigns). Use decision mining to identify decision points (Assign L1, Escalate L2) where poor choices diverge.
  ```
  Happy Path (25% cases): P3 Software-OS  L1 Agent A03 (OS-Windows)  Resolve
  Problem Path (15%): P2 Network  L1 Agent A05 (Basic)  Escalate  Reassign
  ```
- **Decision Mining:** Extract rules at assignment/escalation points: `IF Category=Network AND Priority=P2 THEN Escalate? [YES:65%, NO:35%]`
- **Context-Aware Analysis:** Correlate notes field keywords ("Escalation needed," "Needs DB skill") with outcomes.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Skill-Matched Initial Routing
**Issue Addressed:** Initial skill mismatches causing 42% of escalations.  
**Process Mining Insight:** 68% of tickets have predictable required skills based on Category+Priority.  
**Implementation:** 
```
Rule: IF Required_Skill IN Agent_Skills AND Agent_Utilization < 80% THEN Assign
Fallback: Route to Skill Queue (L2/L3 specialists)
```
**Data Required:** Historical CategoryRequired_Skill mapping, real-time agent skills/utilization.  
**Expected Benefits:** +25% FCR, -40% initial escalations, 20 min avg faster P2 resolution.

### Strategy 2: Workload-Balanced Dynamic Assignment
**Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload (top 20% agents handle 45% volume).  
**Process Mining Insight:** Overloaded agents have 2x cycle times; underutilized specialists handle basic tasks.  
**Implementation:** 
```
Priority Score = (Skill_Match * 0.5) + (1-Utilization/100 * 0.3) + (Priority_Weight * 0.2)
Assign to highest score available agent within tier ceiling
```
**Data Required:** Real-time WIP count, historical processing times per agent/skill.  
**Expected Benefits:** -35% SLA breaches, balanced utilization (80-90% target), -15% specialist time on L1 tasks.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Skill & Complexity Routing
**Issue Addressed:** Dispatcher guesswork on L1 vs. L2 capability.  
**Process Mining Insight:** Decision trees show 82% accuracy predicting L1 resolution from Category+Priority+Channel+Notes keywords.  
**Implementation:** ML model trained on historical data:
```
Predict: L1_Resolvable (Y/N), Required_Skill, Complexity_Level
Route: P2 High-Complexity  Direct L2; P3 Low-Complexity  L1
```
**Data Required:** Ticket text (description, notes), historical resolution outcomes.  
**Expected Benefits:** -50% unnecessary escalations, +30% L1 utilization, 18% overall throughput increase.

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**Business Process Simulation:**
- **Tool:** ProSim or Celonis Simulate using discovered process models + resource calendars.
- **Scenarios:** Baseline (current round-robin) vs. each proposed strategy.
- **Parameters:** Stochastic arrival rates from log, agent capacities, skill matrices.
- **KPIs:** End-to-end cycle time, SLA compliance, resource utilization, cost per ticket.
```
Simulation Results (Expected):
Strategy 1: SLA Compliance 78%  91% (+16%)
Strategy 2: Avg Resolution Time 4.2h  3.1h (-26%)
Combined: Throughput +22%, Reassignments -61%
```

**Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:**
```
**Process Mining Dashboards (Real-time):**

Resource KPIs:
- Utilization Rate per Agent/Tier (target: 80-90%)
- Skill Match Rate (>90% target)
- FCR Rate L1 (>35% target)

Process Views:
- Performance Heatmap (activity durations by resource)
- Handover Network (reduced density target)
- SLA Breach Root Cause (drill-down by assignment path)
- Variant Explorer (monitor problematic paths)

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Reassignment Rate >5% weekly  Investigate
- Skill Bottleneck Queue >30min  Capacity alert
- SLA Breach >15% P2 tickets  Immediate review
```

**Implementation Roadmap:**
1. **Phase 1 (4 weeks):** Process mining discovery + simulation
2. **Phase 2 (8 weeks):** Pilot Strategy 1+2 on 20% volume
3. **Phase 3 (12 weeks):** Full rollout + Strategy 3 ML model
4. **Continuous:** Weekly dashboard reviews, quarterly model retraining

This data-driven approach will transform TechSolve's assignment logic from reactive round-robin to predictive, skill-aware orchestration, delivering measurable SLA improvements and resource optimization.
