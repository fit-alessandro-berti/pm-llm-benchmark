Certainly! Here are 20 relevant questions about the process, along with their proposed confidence scores:

### Process Understanding and Flow:
1. **What is the first step in this declaration process?**
   - *Confidence Score: High*
   
2. **Who can reject a declaration at any stage of the approval process?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*

3. **If an employee submits a declaration, how many times does it generally go through a full cycle before being approved?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-Low*

4. **Can a declaration be rejected at any point by the Administration, Budget Owner, or Pre-approver?**
   - *Confidence Score: High*

5. **What happens if a declaration is initially rejected by the Supervisor and then resubmitted by the employee?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*

### Specific Scenarios:
6. **If an employee submits a declaration, it gets approved by Administration but rejected by Budget Owner, what are the next steps?**
   - *Confidence Score: High*

7. **What is the probability of a declaration being initially rejected and eventually approved after re-submission?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*
   
8. **When does a declaration get "FINAL_APPROVED" status, and what happens next?**
   - *Confidence Score: High*

9. **How often does a declaration go through multiple rounds of rejection before it is finally approved or permanently rejected?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-Low*

10. **What are the reasons why declarations might be rejected by various stakeholders in this process?**
    - *Confidence Score: Low-Medium*

### Performance Metrics:
11. **Which stage of the approval process takes the longest time to complete, based on performance data provided?**
    - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*
   
12. **How does the frequency and performance data impact the overall efficiency of this declaration process?**
    - *Confidence Score: High*

13. **What is the average performance score for declarations that were eventually approved after multiple rejections?**
    - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*

14. **Is there a correlation between the number of times a declaration is rejected and its final performance metric when it is approved?**
    - *Confidence Score: High*

### Process Optimization:
15. **Are there any steps in this process that could be streamlined to improve overall efficiency?**
    - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*
   
16. **Which stakeholders have the most significant impact on the final performance metrics of a declaration?**
    - *Confidence Score: High*

17. **Can we identify key bottlenecks in this process based on the performance and frequency data provided?**
    - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*

18. **How can the process be optimized to reduce the number of rejections, thereby improving efficiency?**
    - *Confidence Score: High*

### Specific Actions and Outcomes:
19. **If a declaration is rejected by the Pre-approver, what should an employee do next in terms of resubmitting or amending the declaration?**
   - *Confidence Score: Medium-High*
   
20. **How does the process handle declarations that are permanently rejected and not resubmitted by the employee?**
    - *Confidence Score: Medium-Low*

These questions aim to cover different aspects of understanding, performance analysis, and potential optimization of the given declaration approval process.
