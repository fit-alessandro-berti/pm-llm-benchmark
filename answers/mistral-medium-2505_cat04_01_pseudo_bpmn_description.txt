### **Detailed Explanation of the Pseudo-BPMN Business Process**

This process represents a **customer request handling workflow**, where requests are categorized as either **Standard** or **Custom**, leading to different validation and approval paths. Below is a breakdown of each step, gateway, and path convergence.

---

## **1. Process Overview**
The workflow begins with receiving a customer request and branches based on the request type (Standard or Custom). Depending on the path, different validation, approval, and invoicing steps are executed before finalizing the order.

## **2. Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **Start Event**
- **Purpose:** Initiates the process when a customer submits a request.

### **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose:** Captures and logs the customer’s request details.

### **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**
- **Purpose:** Determines whether the request is **Standard** or **Custom**.
- **Behavior:** Exclusive (XOR) gateway—only one path is taken based on the condition.

#### **Path 1: Standard Request (If Type = Standard)**
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
  - **Purpose:** Validates the request against predefined business rules (e.g., product availability, pricing).
- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
  - **Purpose:** Executes multiple checks simultaneously.
  - **Behavior:** Parallel (AND) gateway—both tasks run concurrently.
    - **Task C1: "Credit Check"** – Verifies customer creditworthiness.
    - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"** – Ensures product availability.
- **Join (AND): "All Parallel Checks Completed"**
  - **Purpose:** Waits for both checks to finish before proceeding.
- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
  - **Purpose:** Determines the expected delivery timeline.

#### **Path 2: Custom Request (If Type = Custom)**
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
  - **Purpose:** Assesses whether the custom request is technically and financially viable.
- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
  - **Purpose:** Decides if the custom request can be fulfilled.
    - **If Yes  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
      - **Purpose:** Generates a tailored price and terms for the customer.
    - **If No  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"  End Event**
      - **Purpose:** Terminates the process if the request is not feasible.

### **Convergence Point (After Standard or Custom Path)**
- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
  - **Purpose:** Determines if managerial approval is required (e.g., for high-value orders).
    - **If Yes  Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
      - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
        - **If Yes  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
        - **If No  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
          - **Loop Back:**
            - For **Standard Path**  Returns to **Task D (Calculate Delivery Date)**.
            - For **Custom Path**  Returns to **Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)**.
    - **If No  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**

### **Final Steps (Common for Both Paths)**
- **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
  - **Purpose:** Notifies the customer of order confirmation.
- **End Event**
  - **Purpose:** Marks the successful completion of the process.

## **3. Key Differences Between Standard and Custom Paths**

| **Aspect**            | **Standard Request** | **Custom Request** |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Validation**         | Predefined rules (Task B1) | Feasibility analysis (Task B2) |
| **Parallel Checks**   | Credit & Inventory (Tasks C1, C2) | Not applicable |
| **Quotation**         | Not required (proceeds to delivery date) | Custom quotation (Task E1) |
| **Rejection Handling** | Not applicable | Rejection notice (Task E2) if unfeasible |

---

## **4. Conditions for Approvals & Rework Loops**

- **Approval Needed?**
  - Triggered if the order exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., cost, complexity).
- **Approval Granted?**
  - If **Yes**  Proceeds to invoicing.
  - If **No**  Re-evaluates conditions (Task H) and loops back to adjust terms.
- **Rework Loop**
  - For **Standard Path:** Recalculates delivery date (Task D).
  - For **Custom Path:** Revises quotation (Task E1).

## **5. Summary of Gateways & Their Roles**

| **Gateway Type** | **Location** | **Behavior** |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **XOR (Exclusive)** | "Check Request Type" | Chooses between Standard or Custom path. |
| **AND (Parallel)** | "Run Parallel Checks" | Runs Credit & Inventory checks simultaneously. |
| **XOR (Exclusive)** | "Is Customization Feasible?" | Decides if custom request is viable. |
| **XOR (Exclusive)** | "Is Approval Needed?" | Determines if managerial approval is required. |
| **XOR (Exclusive)** | "Is Approval Granted?" | Decides whether to proceed or re-evaluate. |

### **Conclusion**
This process ensures that **Standard** requests follow a streamlined validation path, while **Custom** requests undergo feasibility checks and potential rework loops. Approvals are conditionally triggered, and rework steps ensure compliance before finalizing the order. The use of **XOR and AND gateways** ensures proper branching and synchronization of parallel tasks.
