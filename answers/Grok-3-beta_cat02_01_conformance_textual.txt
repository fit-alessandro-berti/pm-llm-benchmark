Let’s analyze the event log against the normative process description to identify deviations and explain the violations. The normative process outlines two acceptable sequences based on inventory sufficiency:
Sufficient Inventory Path: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order.
Insufficient Inventory Path: Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order.
Key constraints from the description include:
"Check inventory" must occur after "Receive order" and before "Authorize payment" or "Cancel order."
"Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items" (only in the sufficient inventory path).
"Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
"Ship order" must occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order."
"Close order" must be the final activity in all cases.
No fulfillment activities (e.g., "Authorize payment," "Package items," "Ship order") should occur after "Cancel order."
Now, let’s examine each case in the event log.
Case 1
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order
Analysis: This follows the sufficient inventory path exactly as described: "Receive order" starts the process, "Check inventory" precedes "Authorize payment," "Package items" follows payment authorization, "Ship order" comes after packaging, and "Close order" finalizes the process.
Result: No violations.
Case 2
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Package items → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
Analysis: 
"Receive order" and "Check inventory" start correctly.
However, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the rule that "Authorize payment should only occur … before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known." The normative description implies that payment must be authorized before preparing items for shipment, as it ensures the customer’s payment method is valid prior to fulfillment steps.
The subsequent "Ship order" and "Close order" follow the expected order relative to each other but are tainted by the earlier violation.
Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," breaking the required sequence of Authorize payment → Package items.
Case 3
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Cancel order → Ship order → Close order
Analysis: 
"Receive order" and "Check inventory" begin correctly.
"Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory," which is fine if inventory were sufficient, but then "Cancel order" follows, indicating insufficient inventory. The description states that if inventory is insufficient, the process should proceed directly to "Cancel order" after "Check inventory," and no fulfillment activities (like "Authorize payment") should occur. Thus, "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" is a deviation, as payment authorization is unnecessary and illogical in a cancellation scenario.
"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which explicitly violates the constraint that "‘Ship order’ should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." Shipping an order after cancellation contradicts the process logic.
"Close order" ends the sequence as required, but the prior steps invalidate the process.
Violations:
"Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which is inappropriate in the insufficient inventory path (should be Check inventory → Cancel order).
"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," violating the rule that shipping should never follow cancellation.
Case 4
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order
Analysis: This matches the insufficient inventory path perfectly: "Receive order" starts, "Check inventory" reveals insufficient stock, "Cancel order" follows, and "Close order" finalizes the process. No fulfillment activities occur after cancellation, as required.
Result: No violations.
Case 5
Sequence: Receive order → Check inventory → Authorize payment → Ship order → Close order
Analysis: 
"Receive order," "Check inventory," and "Authorize payment" follow the sufficient inventory path correctly.
"Ship order" follows "Authorize payment," but "Package items" is missing. The normative description states that "only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with ‘Ship order,’" and "‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization and before shipping." Skipping "Package items" violates the explicit sequence of Authorize payment → Package items → Ship order.
"Close order" ends the process as expected, but the missing "Package items" step is a deviation.
Violation: "Package items" is omitted between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order," breaking the required sequence.
Summary of Deviations
Case 1: No violations.
Case 2: Violation – "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
Case 3: Violations – (1) "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," (2) "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
Case 4: No violations.
Case 5: Violation – "Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
Explanation of Violations
Case 2: The reversal of "Package items" and "Authorize payment" violates the logical flow that payment must be confirmed before preparing items for shipment. This could lead to packaging items for an order that ultimately cannot be paid for, wasting resources.
Case 3: 
"Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" suggests an unnecessary step was taken before deciding to cancel, contradicting the rule that cancellation should follow directly from an insufficient inventory check.
"Ship order" after "Cancel order" is a severe violation, as it implies fulfilling an order that was already canceled, which defies the process intent and could result in customer confusion or operational errors.
Case 5: Omitting "Package items" skips a critical step required before shipping. The normative description emphasizes that items must be packaged before they can be shipped, so this deviation could imply items were shipped without preparation, which is impractical.
Ambiguity Resolution
The normative description notes potential ambiguities (e.g., whether "Authorize payment" could precede certain checks). I interpreted it strictly: "Authorize payment" must follow "Check inventory" and precede "Package items" in the sufficient inventory path, and it should not appear in the cancellation path. This aligns with the process’s logical intent—payment authorization is only relevant when fulfillment is possible. For Case 5, I assumed "Package items" is mandatory before "Ship order," as the description explicitly sequences these activities without suggesting optional steps.
This analysis highlights Cases 2, 3, and 5 as deviations from the normative process, each breaking specific rules or expectations outlined in the description.
