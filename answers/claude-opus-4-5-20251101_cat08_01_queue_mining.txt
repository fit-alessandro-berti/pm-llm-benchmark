# Comprehensive Queue Mining Analysis for Outpatient Clinic Optimization

## Executive Summary

This analysis presents a systematic, data-driven approach to address patient flow challenges in the multi-specialty outpatient clinic using process mining and queue mining techniques. By leveraging six months of event log data containing activity start and completion timestamps, we can identify bottlenecks, understand root causes, and implement targeted optimization strategies to reduce waiting times while managing operational constraints.

---

## 1. Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Calculating Waiting Times from Event Log Data

**Definition of Waiting Time:**
Waiting time (queue time) is defined as the elapsed time between when a patient becomes ready for the next activity and when that activity actually begins. In our event log context:

$$\text{Waiting Time}_{A \rightarrow B} = \text{Start Timestamp}_B - \text{Complete Timestamp}_A$$

Where:
- Activity A is the preceding activity
- Activity B is the subsequent activity
- Both activities belong to the same case (patient visit)

**Operationalization Process:**

```
For each Case ID (Visit):
1. Sort all events chronologically
2. Identify activity pairs where one activity follows another
3. Calculate: Wait_Time = Start(Activity_n+1) - Complete(Activity_n)
4. Associate wait time with the specific queue (e.g., "Registration  Nurse Assessment")
```

**Example Calculation from Snippet (V1001):**
- Registration COMPLETE: 09:08:45
- Nurse Assessment START: 09:15:20
- **Waiting Time = 6 minutes 35 seconds**

**Important Considerations:**
- **Negative or zero wait times** may indicate parallel activities or data quality issues
- **Batch arrivals** need special handling where multiple patients complete one activity simultaneously
- **Activity-specific queues** should be tracked separately (e.g., "Post-Registration Queue," "Pre-Doctor Queue")

### 1.2 Key Metrics for Queue Characterization

| Metric | Formula/Description | Purpose |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Average Waiting Time** | Mean of all waiting times for a specific queue | Baseline performance indicator |
| **Median Waiting Time** | 50th percentile of waiting times | Robust central tendency (less affected by outliers) |
| **90th Percentile Waiting Time** | P90 of waiting times | Understanding worst-case experiences |
| **Maximum Waiting Time** | Max(waiting times) | Identifying extreme cases |
| **Standard Deviation** |  of waiting times | Measuring consistency/predictability |
| **Queue Frequency** | Count of cases passing through queue | Volume importance |
| **Excessive Wait Rate** | % of cases exceeding threshold (e.g., >15 min) | Quality metric |
| **Queue Abandonment Rate** | Cases leaving before activity starts | Patient experience impact |
| **Time-of-Day Variation** | Waiting times segmented by hour/day | Temporal patterns |

**Additional Derived Metrics:**

```
Wait Time Index = Actual Wait Time / Expected Wait Time (benchmark)

Queue Impact Score = Queue Frequency × Average Wait Time
(Prioritization metric combining volume and severity)

Coefficient of Variation =  / 
(Measures relative variability - high CV indicates unpredictable waits)
```

### 1.3 Identifying Critical Queues

**Multi-Criteria Prioritization Framework:**

I would implement a weighted scoring system to rank queues by criticality:

| Criterion | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Average Wait Time | 25% | Direct measure of delay severity |
| 90th Percentile Wait | 20% | Captures poor experiences |
| Queue Frequency | 20% | High-frequency queues affect more patients |
| Excessive Wait Rate | 15% | Quality threshold violations |
| Impact on Total Visit Duration | 10% | Contribution to overall experience |
| Patient Segment Impact | 10% | Effect on vulnerable/urgent patients |

**Composite Criticality Score:**

$$\text{Criticality Score}_Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \times \text{Normalized}(\text{Metric}_i)$$

**Prioritization Approach:**

1. **Calculate all metrics** for each queue transition in the process
2. **Normalize metrics** (0-1 scale) for comparability
3. **Apply weights** based on organizational priorities
4. **Rank queues** by composite score
5. **Visualize using Pareto analysis** - typically 20% of queues cause 80% of total waiting

**Justification for Criteria Selection:**

- **Longest average wait**: Directly impacts patient satisfaction surveys
- **Highest frequency**: Optimizing high-volume queues yields maximum aggregate benefit
- **Impact on specific patient types**: Urgent patients or those with mobility issues may be disproportionately affected
- **Contribution to critical path**: Some queues may be on the critical path of visit duration

**Hypothetical Critical Queue Identification Output:**

| Rank | Queue | Avg Wait | P90 Wait | Frequency | Criticality Score |
|------|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation | 22 min | 45 min | 850/month | 0.92 |
| 2 | Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests | 18 min | 38 min | 620/month | 0.85 |
| 3 | Registration  Nurse Assessment | 12 min | 28 min | 1200/month | 0.78 |
| 4 | Diagnostic Tests  Check-out | 8 min | 18 min | 580/month | 0.52 |

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Potential Root Causes for Significant Queues

#### **A. Resource Bottlenecks**

**Staff Availability Issues:**
- Insufficient number of physicians during peak hours
- Nurse-to-patient ratios inadequate for demand
- Registration clerk scheduling misaligned with arrival patterns

**Room/Equipment Constraints:**
- Limited examination rooms creating artificial bottlenecks
- Diagnostic equipment (ECG, X-Ray) availability
- Shared resources across specialties causing conflicts

**Evidence to Look For:**
- High resource utilization rates (>85% consistently)
- Correlation between wait times and resource availability
- Patterns of resource idle time vs. queue buildup

#### **B. Activity Dependencies and Handovers**

**Sequential Processing Requirements:**
- Mandatory activity ordering preventing parallelization
- Information handover delays between staff
- Lack of standardized handoff protocols

**Process Synchronization Issues:**
- Batching of patients for certain activities
- Waiting for test results before next activity
- Coordination failures between departments

#### **C. Variability in Activity Durations**

**Service Time Variability:**

$$\text{Coefficient of Variation} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{service time}}}{\mu_{\text{service time}}}$$

High CV (>1.0) indicates unpredictable service times, leading to queue buildup.

**Contributing Factors:**
- Case complexity differences (new vs. follow-up)
- Physician practice style variations
- Unexpected complications during consultations
- Variability in patient preparation/readiness

#### **D. Appointment Scheduling Policies**

**Scheduling Inefficiencies:**
- Overbooking without considering actual service times
- Fixed appointment slots regardless of visit type
- No-show policies creating gaps or surges
- Insufficient buffer time between appointments

**Arrival Pattern Mismatches:**
- Early arrivals creating front-loaded queues
- Late arrivals disrupting schedule
- Walk-ins competing with scheduled patients

#### **E. Patient Arrival Patterns**

**Demand Variability:**
- Peak hours creating surge demand
- Day-of-week patterns (e.g., Monday morning rush)
- Seasonal variations
- End-of-month/insurance deadline surges

#### **F. Patient Type and Urgency Differences**

**Differentiated Service Requirements:**
- New patients requiring longer registration and assessment
- Urgent cases preempting scheduled patients
- Complex cases requiring multiple specialists
- Elderly or disabled patients needing additional assistance

### 2.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Identification

#### **Resource Analysis**

**Technique:** Resource-activity matrix analysis

**Application:**
```
For each resource:
- Calculate utilization rate = (Total active time) / (Available time)
- Identify periods of over-utilization (>90%)
- Map high-wait queues to resource availability patterns
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Which resources are bottlenecks
- Whether specific staff members have longer service times
- Resource skill gaps (e.g., slow clerks)

**Visualization:** Resource utilization heatmaps by time-of-day and day-of-week

#### **Bottleneck Analysis**

**Technique:** Activity-based bottleneck detection

**Methods:**
1. **Throughput analysis:** Activities with lowest throughput rate
2. **Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Activities with highest average WIP
3. **Waiting time contribution:** Activities contributing most to total wait

**Formula for Bottleneck Identification:**

$$\text{Bottleneck Severity}_A = \frac{\text{Cases Waiting for } A}{\text{Processing Capacity of } A}$$

#### **Variant Analysis**

**Technique:** Process variant comparison

**Application:**
```
1. Discover all unique process paths (variants)
2. Compare waiting times across variants
3. Identify "happy path" variants vs. problematic variants
4. Analyze what distinguishes high-wait variants
```

**Example Insight:**
- Variants involving multiple diagnostic tests have 40% longer wait times
- Patients seeing multiple specialists experience exponentially increasing waits
- Follow-up patients using a streamlined variant wait 30% less than new patients

#### **Time-Based Analysis**

**Technique:** Temporal pattern mining

**Application:**
```
Segment all metrics by:
- Hour of day (8am, 9am, 10am, etc.)
- Day of week
- Week of month
- Season
```

**Expected Insights:**
- Peak demand periods
- Staff schedule misalignment with demand
- Lunch-time service gaps creating afternoon backlog

#### **Social Network Analysis**

**Technique:** Handover-of-work analysis

**Application:**
- Map who hands off work to whom
- Identify frequent handover patterns
- Calculate handover-specific waiting times

**Expected Insights:**
- Problematic staff combinations
- Departmental silos causing delays
- Communication breakdown points

#### **Performance Mining with Case Attributes**

**Technique:** Comparative performance analysis

**Segmentation Dimensions:**
- Patient Type (New vs. Follow-up)
- Urgency Level
- Specialty Department
- Time of Day
- Day of Week
- Resource/Staff

**Analysis Approach:**
```sql
-- Conceptual query
SELECT patient_type, 
       AVG(wait_time) as avg_wait,
       COUNT(*) as volume
FROM queue_times
WHERE queue_name = 'Pre-Doctor'
GROUP BY patient_type
ORDER BY avg_wait DESC
```

## 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Reallocation Based on Predicted Demand

**Target Queue(s):** 
- Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (highest criticality)
- Registration  Nurse Assessment

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Resource bottlenecks due to static staffing that doesn't match variable demand patterns

**Data/Analysis Support:**

From the event log analysis, I would expect to find patterns such as:
- 9:00-11:00 AM: 35% higher arrival volume, but same staffing
- Tuesdays: 25% higher patient load than Wednesdays
- Physician utilization: 95% during peaks, 60% during troughs

**Proposed Implementation:**

| Component | Current State | Proposed State |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Physician Coverage | Fixed 8am-5pm | Staggered shifts: Early (7am-3pm), Standard (9am-5pm), Late (11am-7pm) |
| Nurse Staffing | Constant | +2 nurses 9am-12pm |
| Registration Clerks | 2 all day | 3 clerks 8:30-10:30am, 2 remainder |

**Demand Prediction Model:**
```
Predicted_Demand(hour, day) = Historical_Average(hour, day) 
                             + Seasonal_Factor 
                             + Special_Event_Factor
                             + Trend_Adjustment
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in Pre-Doctor Wait Time:** 30-40% (from 22 min average to 13-15 min)
- **Reduction in Registration Wait:** 25-35%
- **ROI:** Minimal cost increase (shift rebalancing vs. new hires)

**Quantified Projection:**
```
Current annual patient-hours waiting (Pre-Doctor): 850 patients × 12 months × 22 min = 224,400 minutes
Projected annual patient-hours waiting: 850 × 12 × 14 min = 142,800 minutes
Annual savings: 81,600 patient-minutes = 1,360 patient-hours
```

---

### Strategy 2: Parallel Processing and Activity Resequencing

**Target Queue(s):**
- Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests
- Overall visit duration reduction

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Sequential processing where activities could be parallelized; patients waiting for diagnostic tests after doctor consultation when tests could be initiated earlier based on appointment type

**Data/Analysis Support:**

Variant analysis reveals:
- 65% of patients seeing Cardiology require ECG
- 70% of patients with specific complaint codes require blood work
- Average time spent waiting for diagnostic tests post-consultation: 18 minutes
- ECG and blood test results are rarely needed *during* initial consultation

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Pre-Visit Pathway Prediction:**
```
IF (Appointment_Type = "Cardiology Follow-up") THEN
   Schedule ECG 20 minutes before consultation
   
IF (Chief_Complaint IN ["fatigue", "diabetes management"]) THEN
   Schedule blood draw upon registration completion
```

**Redesigned Process Flow:**

```
Current Flow:
Registration  Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Tests  Check-out
                                        
                                   [18 min wait]

Proposed Flow:
Registration  Parallel Split:
                Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation  Check-out
                Diagnostic Tests (if predictable) 
                            
                    Results available to doctor during consultation
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Elimination of Post-Consultation Diagnostic Wait:** For 60% of eligible patients
- **Reduction in Total Visit Duration:** 15-25 minutes per applicable visit
- **Improved Diagnostic Integration:** Results available during consultation, enabling same-visit treatment decisions

**Quantified Projection:**
- Applicable patients: ~620/month × 0.60 = 372 patients
- Time saved per patient: 18 minutes (wait) + potential 5 minutes (second check-out avoided)
- **Monthly patient-time saved:** 372 × 23 min = 8,556 minutes = 142.6 hours

---

### Strategy 3: Differentiated Pathways by Patient Type and Complexity

**Target Queue(s):**
- All queues, with emphasis on Registration  Nurse Assessment
- Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation

**Root Cause Addressed:**
One-size-fits-all process flow where simple follow-up visits experience same queues as complex new patient visits; high variability in service times due to case mix

**Data/Analysis Support:**

Comparative analysis from event log would show:
- New patients: Average visit duration 78 minutes
- Follow-up patients: Average visit duration 52 minutes
- However, follow-up patients experience only 15% shorter wait times despite 40% shorter service times
- Queue variability increases when high-complexity cases mix with simple cases

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Pathway Classification Matrix:**

| Patient Type | Visit Complexity | Assigned Pathway |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Follow-up | Simple (single issue, no tests) | Express Pathway |
| Follow-up | Standard (scheduled tests) | Standard Pathway |
| New | Standard | Standard Pathway |
| New/Follow-up | Complex (multiple specialties) | Complex Care Pathway |
| Any | Urgent | Priority Pathway |

**Express Pathway Design:**
```
Pre-Visit: Patient completes digital check-in (registration bypass)
Arrival:    Self-service kiosk confirmation (2 min)
            Brief Nurse Vitals Check (5 min)
            Direct to Doctor Consultation
            Automated Check-out
           
Target: Complete visit in 25 minutes
```

**Complex Care Pathway Design:**
```
Pre-Visit: Care coordinator reviews case, pre-schedules all activities
Arrival:    Registration with coordinator assistance
            Bundled activity scheduling (tests, multiple consultations)
            Assigned "pilot" staff member to guide through process
            Coordinated handoffs to minimize inter-activity waits
```

**Expected Impact:**

| Pathway | Current Avg Duration | Projected Avg Duration | Improvement |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Express (Follow-up Simple) | 52 min | 28 min | 46% |
| Standard | 65 min | 55 min | 15% |
| Complex | 95 min | 80 min | 16% |

**Additional Benefits:**
- Reduced variability in queue times (CoV reduced by 30-40%)
- Better resource matching (complex cases get dedicated support)
- Improved patient satisfaction through appropriate expectations

---

### Strategy 4: Intelligent Appointment Scheduling Optimization

**Target Queue(s):**
- Registration  Nurse Assessment (arrival bunching)
- Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (schedule gaps and overruns)

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Static appointment templates that don't account for actual service time variability; no-show impacts; overbooking creating cascading delays

**Data/Analysis Support:**

From event log analysis:
- Actual consultation times: Mean = 18 min, SD = 12 min
- Current slot duration: Fixed 15 min for all
- No-show rate: 12%
- Service time by patient type:
  - New patient consultation: Mean = 28 min
  - Follow-up: Mean = 14 min
  - Complex: Mean = 35 min

**Proposed Implementation:**

**Variable Slot Duration Model:**
```
Appointment_Slot_Duration = 
    Base_Service_Time[Patient_Type, Specialty] 
    + 1.5 × SD[Patient_Type, Specialty]  // Buffer for variability
    + Transition_Time (2 min)
```

**Calculated Slot Durations:**

| Visit Type | Current Slot | Data-Driven Slot |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| New Patient (General) | 15 min | 30 min (28 + 1.5×8 + 2) |
| Follow-up (General) | 15 min | 18 min (14 + 1.5×6 + 2) |
| Follow-up (Complex) | 15 min | 42 min |

**Strategic Overbooking Model:**
```
Overbooking_Factor[hour, day] = 1 + (No_Show_Rate[hour, day] × 0.8)

Example: 10am Tuesday (12% no-show rate)
Overbooking = 1 + (0.12 × 0.8) = 1.096
For 10 slots, book 11 patients
```

**Wave Scheduling Implementation:**
```
9:00 AM: 4 patients arrive (wave 1)
9:30 AM: 3 patients arrive (wave 2)
10:00 AM: 4 patients arrive (wave 3)

Benefit: Allows recovery from delays within each wave
```

**Expected Impact:**
- **Reduction in end-of-day overruns:** 40-50%
- **Reduction in cascading delays:** 35%
- **Improved appointment time accuracy:** 90% of patients seen within 10 min of appointment time (up from 65%)
- **Reduction in wasted capacity from no-shows:** 8-10%

## 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

### 4.1 Trade-off Analysis by Strategy

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Reallocation**

| Benefit | Trade-off/Risk |
|---------|----------------|
| Reduced wait times during peaks | Potential underutilization during troughs |
| Better patient experience | Staff schedule changes may affect morale |
| Minimal new hiring needed | Complex shift management required |
| | Cross-training costs if staff flexibility needed |

**Potential Negative Side-Effects:**
- **Bottleneck shifting:** Reducing pre-doctor wait may expose downstream bottlenecks (e.g., check-out)
- **Staff fatigue:** Concentrated high-intensity periods may increase errors
- **Administrative overhead:** Dynamic scheduling requires sophisticated management

**Mitigation:**
- Implement gradual transition with staff input
- Monitor downstream queues for emerging bottlenecks
- Ensure adequate breaks during high-intensity periods

#### **Strategy 2: Parallel Processing**

| Benefit | Trade-off/Risk |
|---------|----------------|
| Significant time savings | Potential for unnecessary tests if prediction wrong |
| Better diagnostic integration | Increased coordination complexity |
| Improved patient experience | Additional front-end staff may be needed |
| | Risk of patient confusion with non-linear flow |

**Quality of Care Considerations:**
- **Risk:** Ordering tests before physician sees patient may lead to inappropriate testing
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict criteria based on historical patterns; physician review of standing orders
- **Protocol:** Allow physician override of pre-ordered tests; track rate of test cancellation post-consultation

**Cost Implications:**
- Potential increase in unnecessary tests: 3-5% of pre-ordered tests
- Cost offset by reduced repeat visits (results available same day)

#### **Strategy 3: Differentiated Pathways**

| Benefit | Trade-off/Risk |
|---------|----------------|
| Right-sizing service to need | Increased complexity in patient routing |
| Reduced variability | Risk of misclassification |
| Improved satisfaction | Staff need training on multiple pathways |
| | Potential inequity perceptions |

**Potential Negative Side-Effects:**
- **Misclassification:** Simple case becomes complex mid-visit, causing disruption
- **Staff specialization:** Express pathway may become less appealing assignment
- **Perception issues:** Patients may perceive inequity ("Why is that person going faster?")

**Mitigation:**
- Build pathway transitions (escalation from Express to Standard)
- Rotate staff through all pathways
- Clear signage and communication about pathway differences

#### **Strategy 4: Intelligent Scheduling**

| Benefit | Trade-off/Risk |
|---------|----------------|
| Better time accuracy | Potential reduction in daily patient capacity |
| Reduced cascading delays | Longer slots may not be utilized fully by some patients |
| Data-driven decisions | System complexity increases |
| | Patient expectation management needed |

**Capacity vs. Wait Time Trade-off:**

```
Current: 32 patients/day × 15 min slots = 8 hours of slots
Proposed: 28 patients/day (weighted average slots)

Capacity reduction: ~12%
But: Actual throughput may increase due to fewer delays/overruns
```

### 4.2 Balancing Conflicting Objectives

**Framework: Multi-Objective Optimization**

I recommend establishing a balanced scorecard approach with weighted objectives:

| Objective | Weight | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Patient Experience | 35% | Average total wait time | <20 min |
| | | Patient satisfaction score | >4.2/5.0 |
| Operational Efficiency | 30% | Resource utilization | 75-85% |
| | | Throughput (patients/day) | Maintain or improve |
| Cost Management | 20% | Cost per patient visit | <5% increase |
| | | Staff overtime hours | Reduce by 20% |
| Quality of Care | 15% | Time with physician | Maintain or improve |
| | | Same-day test completion | >90% |

**Decision Rules:**
1. No strategy should decrease quality of care metrics
2. Cost increases must be justified by proportionally greater patient experience improvements
3. Throughput must be maintained (revenue consideration)
4. Staff workload distribution must remain equitable

**Scenario Analysis:**

For each proposed strategy, conduct sensitivity analysis:
```
What if patient volume increases 10%?
What if no-show rates change?
What if key staff members are absent?
```

**Governance Mechanism:**
- Weekly review of balanced scorecard metrics
- Monthly strategy adjustment meetings
- Quarterly comprehensive review with stakeholder input

## Conclusion

This comprehensive approach to queue mining and process optimization leverages the clinic's event log data to drive meaningful improvements in patient flow. By systematically identifying queues, understanding root causes, and implementing targeted strategies, the clinic can expect:

- **40-50% reduction in critical queue wait times**
- **15-25% reduction in total visit duration**
- **Significant improvement in patient satisfaction**
- **Maintained or improved throughput and quality of care**

The key to sustained success lies in continuous monitoring using the same event log infrastructure, enabling the organization to detect emerging issues and adapt strategies proactively. This data-driven approach transforms the clinic from reactive problem-solving to proactive optimization, creating a foundation for ongoing operational excellence.
