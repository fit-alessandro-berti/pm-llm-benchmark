**DECLARE Model for Product Design and Launch Process**
============================================================

Below is a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for the described product design and launch process. Note that, for simplicity, the confidence values are set to 1.0 for all rules, assuming each rule is fully confident based on the process description. In a real-world scenario, these values would be derived from process mining analysis.

```python
declare_model = {
    # Existence: Activities that must exist in every instance
    'existence': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Final Launch (FL)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Approval Gate (AG)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },

    # Absence: Activities that must not exist in any instance
    'absence': {},
    
    # Exactly One: Exactly one of these activities must exist in every instance
    'exactly_one': {
        'Design Draft (DD)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        # Assuming alternative design methods could be added here
    },
    
    # Init: The first activity in every instance
    'init': {
        'Idea Generation (IG)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Responded Existence: If A occurs, B must also occur
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Laboratory Testing (LT)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Coexistence: If A occurs, B must also occur (order doesn’t matter)
    'coexistence': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Response: A must be directly followed by B
    'response': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Marketing Plan (MP)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Precedence: A must occur before B (not necessarily directly)
    'precedence': {
        ('Design Draft (DD)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Succession: A must be directly preceded by B
    'succession': {
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Design Draft (DD)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Final Launch (FL)', 'Marketing Plan (MP)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Alt-Response, Alt-Precedence, Alt-Succession: Applicable when alternatives exist
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    
    # Chain Response, Chain Precedence, Chain Succession: For longer chains of activities
    'chainresponse': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Design Draft (DD)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        ('Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)', 'Cost Evaluation (CE)', 'Prototype Creation (PC)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        ('Laboratory Testing (LT)', 'User Testing (UT)', 'Approval Gate (AG)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    
    # Non-Coexistence, Non-Succession, Non-Chain Succession
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Idea Generation (IG)', 'Final Launch (FL)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        ('Prototype Creation (PC)', 'Idea Generation (IG)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        ('Approval Gate (AG)', 'Design Draft (DD)', 'Idea Generation (IG)'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```

**Notes:**
- **Assumptions**: The model assumes a linear progression with some parallel activities (e.g., Technical Feasibility Check and Cost Evaluation) based on the provided scenario. Real-world process mining data should inform these relationships.
- **Missing Values**: For simplicity, some DECLARE elements (e.g., `altresponse`, `altprecedence`, `altsuccession`) are left empty, as the scenario doesn't explicitly describe alternative paths that would necessitate these rules. In practice, these would be populated based on process analysis.
- **Confidence and Support**: All confidence and support values are set to 1.0 for demonstration purposes. In a practical application, these would be derived from actual process data.
