### Analysis and Renaming of Activities

After analyzing the event log, I identified the following activities that appear multiple times within the same case, with contextual differences:

1. **Verify Documents**
   - Appears in **Case C001** (twice), **Case C002** (once), and **Case C003** (twice).
   - **Contextual Differences**:
     - First occurrence: Initial verification (may be incomplete or require additional steps).
     - Second occurrence: Re-verification after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made.

2. **Call Customer**
   - Appears in **Case C001** (once), **Case C002** (twice), and **Case C003** (once).
   - **Contextual Differences**:
     - First occurrence: Initial call to request missing documents or clarify issues.
     - Second occurrence (if applicable): Follow-up call to confirm adjustments or next steps.

3. **Adjust Account**
   - Appears in **Case C002** (once) and **Case C003** (once).
   - **Contextual Differences**:
     - Only appears once per case, but its purpose varies (e.g., correcting discrepancies vs. internal corrections).

### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Re-Verify Documents After Update / Re-Verify Documents After Adjust**
   - The first occurrence is renamed to reflect the initial verification step.
   - Subsequent occurrences are renamed to indicate that they are re-verifications after additional steps (e.g., document submission or account adjustments).

2. **Call Customer  Call Customer for Missing Docs / Call Customer for Clarification / Follow-Up Call to Confirm / Call Customer to Return**
   - The purpose of the call is specified in the new name (e.g., requesting missing docs, clarifying discrepancies, or confirming adjustments).
   - This makes it clear why the call is being made and its role in the process.

3. **Adjust Account  Adjust Account for Discrepancy / Adjust Account for Missing Info**
   - The new names specify the reason for the adjustment (e.g., correcting discrepancies or addressing missing information).

These renamings ensure that the activities are disambiguated and their roles in the process flow are clear. The additional context in the log (e.g., "Verification incomplete" or "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy") was used to determine the appropriate new names.
