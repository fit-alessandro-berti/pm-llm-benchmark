We are given a normative process description and an event log with 5 cases. We need to check each case against the normative process and identify deviations.

Normative process summary:
- The process always starts with "Receive order".
- Then, "Check inventory" must occur.
- After "Check inventory":
   - If inventory is sufficient: 
        Sequence: Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order.
   - If inventory is insufficient:
        Sequence: Cancel order -> Close order.

Key constraints:
1. "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
2. "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
3. "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation.
4. "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios.

Violations to look for:
- Authorizing payment before checking inventory.
- Packaging items before authorization.
- Shipping items before packaging or after cancellation.
- Closing order not being the last activity.
- In the cancellation path: any activity between "Cancel order" and "Close order" (except possibly "Close order" immediately after) that is not allowed (like shipping after cancellation).

Now, let's analyze each case:

Case 1:
  Activities: 
    Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
  This matches the sufficient inventory path. No violation.

Case 2:
  Activities:
    Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
  Violation: 
    "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". 
    According to the normative process: "Package items" should only occur after authorization. 
    So, this is a violation of the constraint: "Package items should only occur after authorization".

Case 3:
  Activities:
    Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
  Violations:
    - After "Cancel order", the next activity is "Ship order". This is not allowed because after cancellation, we should not ship. 
      The normative process says: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)".
    - Also, note that "Authorize payment" was done before "Cancel order". However, the normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, we should go directly to "Cancel order" after checking. 
      But in this case, they did "Authorize payment" and then "Cancel order". This is also a violation because in the insufficient inventory path, we should not authorize payment at all.

  So two violations in case 3:
    a) Authorizing payment in an insufficient inventory scenario (which should not happen because we should cancel immediately after check).
    b) Shipping after cancellation.

Case 4:
  Activities:
    Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
  This matches the insufficient inventory path. No violation.

Case 5:
  Activities:
    Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
  Violation:
    Missing "Package items". 
    According to the normative process: after authorizing payment, we should package items before shipping. 
    The constraint says: "Ship order should only occur after packaging". 
    Therefore, shipping without packaging is a violation.

Summary of violations:

Case 2: 
  - Violation: Packaging before authorization.

Case 3:
  - Violation 1: Authorizing payment in a scenario that should have been canceled (because after check inventory we should have canceled, but they authorized payment and then canceled).
  - Violation 2: Shipping after cancellation.

Case 5:
  - Violation: Shipping without packaging.

Now, we write the answer accordingly.

Based on the normative process description and the event log, the following cases contain deviations from the intended process flow:

### Violations Identified:
1. **Case 2**  
   - **Violation:** `Package items` occurs before `Authorize payment`.  
   - **Rule Broken:** The normative process explicitly states that payment authorization must occur *before* packaging items. Specifically:  
     > *"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging... "Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*  
     In Case 2, `Package items` is executed at 10:00, while `Authorize payment` occurs later at 10:30. This reverses the required sequence, violating the dependency between authorization and packaging.

2. **Case 3**  
   - **Violation 1:** `Authorize payment` occurs *after* `Check inventory` but *before* `Cancel order`, despite insufficient inventory.  
     - **Rule Broken:** When inventory is insufficient, the process must branch directly to cancellation *without* payment authorization. The description states:  
       > *"If the inventory is found to be insufficient... the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order'."*  
       Here, `Authorize payment` (10:00) is executed even though `Check inventory` (09:40) likely indicated insufficient stock (leading to cancellation at 10:00). Payment authorization is irrelevant for canceled orders and should be skipped.  
   - **Violation 2:** `Ship order` occurs *after* `Cancel order`.  
     - **Rule Broken:** Shipping must never occur after cancellation. The description emphasizes:  
       > *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."*  
       `Ship order` (10:30) directly follows `Cancel order` (10:00), which is a severe deviation from the process.

3. **Case 5**  
   - **Violation:** `Ship order` occurs *without* preceding `Package items`.  
     - **Rule Broken:** Packaging must precede shipping under all circumstances. The description mandates:  
       > *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping... "Ship order" should only occur after packaging.*  
       In Case 5, `Ship order` (11:00) follows `Authorize payment` (10:30) but skips `Package items` entirely. This violates the logical dependency between packaging and shipping.

### Cases with No Violations:
- **Case 1:** Follows the full sufficient-inventory path (`Receive`  `Check`  `Authorize`  `Package`  `Ship`  `Close`). No deviations.  
- **Case 4:** Follows the insufficient-inventory path (`Receive`  `Check`  `Cancel`  `Close`). No deviations.

### Key Ambiguities Resolved:
- **Payment Authorization in Cancellation Path:** The normative description implies payment authorization is *only* relevant for sufficient-inventory cases. Case 3 violates this by authorizing payment before cancellation.  
- **Shipping After Cancellation:** The description explicitly forbids fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) after cancellation, clarifying that `Ship order` must never follow `Cancel order`.  
- **Packaging as a Mandatory Step:** The process requires `Package items` *before* `Ship order` in all scenarios (sufficient inventory). Case 5 violates this by omitting packaging.  

These deviations highlight failures in adhering to the process logic, such as executing activities out of sequence or skipping critical steps. Case 3 contains the most severe violations due to the illogical combination of payment authorization and cancellation, followed by shipping after cancellation.
