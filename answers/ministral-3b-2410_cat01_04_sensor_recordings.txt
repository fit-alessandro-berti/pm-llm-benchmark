To analyze the patterns in the given events and determine which events belong to which high-level manufacturing activities, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify distinct patterns or "phases" in the readings:**
   - **Phase 1:** Stable, low readings (e.g., temperature around 20-25°C, pressure around 1 bar, vibration level around 0-5 Hz, material flow around 0-2 units/s, tool position around 0-20 mm, energy consumption around 0.4-1.6 kWh).
   - **Phase 2:** Significant increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption (e.g., temperature around 50-80°C, pressure around 1-2 bar, vibration level around 30-50 Hz, material flow around 5 units/s, tool position around 5-15 mm, energy consumption around 2-5 kWh).

2. **Group related events together:**
   - **Phase 1:** Events 1-3, 13-15
   - **Phase 2:** Events 4-12

3. **Assign intuitive labels to each group of events:**
   - **Phase 1:** "Idle/Preparation" - This phase represents the machine being idle or in a preparation state, with low sensor readings.
   - **Phase 2:** "Cutting Metal" - This phase represents a cutting operation, indicated by the significant increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption.

4. **Rationale for each label:**
   - **Idle/Preparation:** The low and stable readings suggest that the machine is not actively performing any operations. The tool position and material flow are also low, indicating no material is being processed.
   - **Cutting Metal:** The significant increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption suggests that the machine is actively cutting metal. The material flow and tool position indicate that material is being moved and processed.

**Labeled Activities:**

1. **Idle/Preparation:**
   - Events: 1-3, 13-15
   - Rationale: Low and stable readings suggest the machine is idle or in a preparation state.

2. **Cutting Metal:**
   - Events: 4-12
   - Rationale: Significant increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption indicates an active cutting operation.

By analyzing the patterns in the given events, we have been able to determine which events belong to which high-level manufacturing activities and assign meaningful labels to each set of related events.
