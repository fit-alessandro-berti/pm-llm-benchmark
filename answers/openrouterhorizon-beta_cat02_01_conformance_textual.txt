Here is a concise conformance assessment based on the normative description:

Key rules inferred:
1) Receive order must be first; Check inventory must occur before any payment, packaging, shipping, or cancellation decisions.
2) If inventory sufficient (fulfillment path): Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. Packaging must be after authorization; shipping after packaging; no cancellation in this path.
3) If inventory insufficient (cancellation path): Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order. No packaging, shipping, or payment authorization after cancellation.
4) Close order should be last in all scenarios.

Case-by-case review:

Case 1:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close
Assessment: Conformant. Follows fulfillment path exactly.

Case 2:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close
Violations:
- Packaging before payment authorization (violates “Package items should only occur after authorization”).
- Payment authorization occurs after packaging (ordering constraint broken).

Case 3:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close
Violations:
- Shipping after cancellation (explicitly disallowed: “Ship order should never occur after a cancellation”).
- Mixed paths: after cancellation, no fulfillment steps (shipping) should occur.
Note: Authorize before Cancel is not explicitly banned, but once cancel happens, fulfillment must stop; the shipping is the clear violation.

Case 4:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close
Assessment: Conformant. Matches cancellation path.

Case 5:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close
Violations:
- Shipping without prior packaging (violates “Ship order should only occur after packaging”).
- Missing “Package items” step that should precede shipping in the fulfillment path.

Summary of violating cases: 2, 3, and 5.
- Case 2: Packaging before authorization.
- Case 3: Shipping after cancellation (and mixing fulfillment after cancel).
- Case 5: Shipping without packaging (packaging missing before ship).
