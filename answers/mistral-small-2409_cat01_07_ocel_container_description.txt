Based on the provided directly follows graph, here's a description of the process underlying the data, broken down by object types:

1. **Handling Unit**
   - The process begins with the "Collect Goods" activity, which directly leads to "Load Truck".

2. **Truck**
   - After a Handling Unit is loaded onto a Truck ("Load Truck"), the truck can either load another Handling Unit ("Load Truck" again) or drive to the terminal ("Drive to Terminal").
   - Upon arriving at the terminal ("Drive to Terminal"), the truck can either load another Handling Unit ("Load Truck") or proceed to weigh the containers ("Weigh").

3. **Container**
   - Containers can be loaded onto a Truck ("Load Truck") from different activities like ordering empty containers ("Order Empty Containers"), picking up empty containers ("Pick Up Empty Container"), or bringing containers to the loading bay ("Bring to Loading Bay").
   - After loading onto a truck, containers can either be driven to the terminal ("Drive to Terminal") or weighed ("Weigh").
   - After weighing, containers can be placed in stock ("Place in Stock"), brought to the loading bay ("Bring to Loading Bay"), or rescheduled ("Reschedule Container").
   - Containers in stock can be brought back to the loading bay or rescheduled.
   - Rescheduled containers can either be loaded onto a vehicle ("Load to Vehicle") or book vehicles ("Book Vehicles").

4. **Vehicle**
   - Vehicles can load containers ("Load to Vehicle"), book vehicles ("Book Vehicles"), or depart ("Depart").
   - After loading a container, a vehicle can load another container, book vehicles, or depart.
   - Vehicles can be rescheduled ("Reschedule Container") from booking vehicles or after loading a container.
   - Rescheduled vehicles can either load another container, book vehicles, or be rescheduled again.

5. **Forklift**
   - Forklifts are involved in moving containers between different locations and activities, such as bringing containers to the loading bay ("Bring to Loading Bay"), loading them onto vehicles ("Load to Vehicle"), weighing them ("Weigh"), and placing them in stock ("Place in Stock").
   - Forklifts can also move containers between stock and the loading bay or weighing station.

6. **Customer Order**
   - The process starts with registering a customer order ("Register Customer Order"), which leads to creating a transport document ("Create Transport Document").

7. **Transport Document**
   - After creating a transport document, vehicles are booked ("Book Vehicles").
   - Booked vehicles lead to ordering empty containers ("Order Empty Containers"), which in turn results in the departure of the vehicle ("Depart").
   - Departure can lead to rescheduling containers ("Reschedule Container") or vice versa.
   - Rescheduling containers can also lead to ordering empty containers or departing.

In summary, the process involves collecting goods, loading them onto trucks, driving to the terminal, weighing and storing containers, and eventually departing. Forklifts facilitate the movement of containers, and the process is initiated by registering customer orders and creating transport documents.
