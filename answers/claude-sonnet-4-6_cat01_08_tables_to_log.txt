# Process Mining Event Log

## Assumptions & Notes

1. **One event per item pick**: Since items are picked at different times by different warehouse staff, each item picking is recorded as a separate "Items Picked" event.
2. **One event per delivery dispatch/arrival**: Each delivery record generates two events ("Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived"), since split shipments are meaningful process variants.
3. **One event per invoice**: Each invoice generates an "Invoice Issued" event.
4. **One event per payment**: Each payment generates a "Payment Received" event.
5. **Order 1004**: Has no delivery, invoice, or payment records — only "Order Created" and "Items Picked" events are included. This may indicate an incomplete or in-progress case.
6. **Resource mapping**: Resource IDs are resolved to names and roles using the Resources Table where available. Carrier IDs are used as resources for dispatch/arrival events.
7. **Chronological ordering**: Events are sorted by timestamp within each case.

> **Note on Order 1004**: This case appears incomplete in the source data — no delivery, invoice, or payment records exist. This could indicate a pending, cancelled, or data-entry-incomplete order. It should be flagged for investigation during process analysis.

> **Note on Order 1002 row ordering**: The "Order Arrived" event for DLV-5003 (2024-01-08T10:00:00Z) appears slightly before "Invoice Issued" for INV-1002 (2024-01-08T10:15:00Z), which is chronologically consistent and has been preserved as such in the log.
