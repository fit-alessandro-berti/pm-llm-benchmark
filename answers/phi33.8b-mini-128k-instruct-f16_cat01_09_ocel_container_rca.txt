 Given the data you have provided seems to represent a complex set of tasks performed on an inventory system using Java-like pseudocode, we can identify several potential bottlenecks that could be affecting the performance issues:

1. The "Reschedule Container" task is taking significantly longer than others because it has more operations involved in its execution which include initializing a map with two loops over an array (I presume you are trying to create 75,000 lists of integers), finding and removing the first empty spot, counting unique items for each container and their corresponding delivery statuses.

The main issues here could be:

- The nested loop is performing a search in the middle of both loops (it can potentially iterate through an array with O(n^2) complexity due to the use of `ArrayList` data structure, which might slow it down considerably when operating on large datasets. To improve this, you may want to change your approach by creating a hash map for better efficiency or using other methods like binary search for faster searching and insertion in Python's built-in collections (e.g., HashMaps) as opposed to Lists.

- The algorithm is not properly handling the removal of duplicates, which can be slowed down by the use of a Set collection (`HashSet<Integer>`) - it takes O(n^2). You could solve this in Python using sets or hash-maps (like a `HashSet` for instance) but if your data is sorted then you can achieve a better solution than that.

- The code does not contain any parallelism, which means the time complexity grows exponentially with n due to nested loops. The outer and inner loop are causing this performance issue. You could potentially reduce it by using `ConcurrentSkipListSet` instead of HashMap in Java 8 for faster sorting of elements when removing duplicates; you can also use a HashSet or Set instead of an array/arraylist since its contains() method is O(1 operation.
