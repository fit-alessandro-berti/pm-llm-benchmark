### Case Analysis

Let's analyze each case in the provided event log against the normative process flow:

**Case 1:**
- **Violations:** None identified so far. Follows the sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:** Authorizing payment before checking inventory (10:30) and shipping after cancellation (11:30). This violates both the "Authorize payment" rule ("should only occur after 'Check inventory'") and the "Cancel order" sequence ("should not proceed with activities like packaging or shipping").

**Case 3:**
- **Violations:** Authorizing payment before checking inventory (9:40), shipping after cancellation (10:30). This violates both the "Authorize payment" rule and the "Cancel order" sequence.

**Case 4:**
- **Violations:** None identified so far. Follows the sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

**Case 5:**
- **Violations:** Authorizing payment before checking inventory (10:30). This violates the "Authorize payment" rule ("should only occur after 'Check inventory'").

### Conclusion

Cases 2 and 3 both violate the normative process by authorizing payment prior to checking inventory, which directly contradicts the stated requirement. Additionally, Case 3 goes further by shipping after cancellation, which also violates the "Ship order" rule ("should never occur after a cancellation").
