Below is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics. The dictionary includes a representative subset of activity pairs, capturing both directly connected activities and those separated by multiple steps. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on the nature of the activities and their likely temporal relationships in a complex supply chain. Times are expressed in seconds, reflecting realistic durations for such processes (e.g., days or hours converted to seconds).

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected or closely related activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 21600),    # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: ~1 day avg, with ~6 hours std dev (due to varying decision times)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),   # Order Placement to Receive Components: ~7 days avg, with ~1 day std dev (due to supplier lead times)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),    # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: ~1 day avg, with ~4 hours std dev (inspection scheduling variability)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),   # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: ~2 days avg, with ~12 hours std dev (preparation for assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),   # Component Assembly to Product Testing: ~3 days avg, with ~1 day std dev (assembly and testing complexity)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 21600),    # Product Testing to Packaging: ~1 day avg, with ~6 hours std dev (quick transition if tests pass)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (43200, 10800),    # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: ~12 hours avg, with ~3 hours std dev (logistics within facility)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 43200),   # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: ~2 days avg, with ~12 hours std dev (shipping coordination)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (1209600, 259200), # Distribution to After-Sales Support: ~14 days avg, with ~3 days std dev (time until customer issues arise)

    # Pairs separated by multiple steps (longer temporal distances)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (691200, 100800),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: ~8 days avg, with ~1.17 days std dev (includes order placement delays)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1209600, 172800), # Supplier Selection to Product Testing: ~14 days avg, with ~2 days std dev (entire production cycle variability)
    ('OP', 'CA'): (864000, 129600),  # Order Placement to Component Assembly: ~10 days avg, with ~1.5 days std dev (includes receiving and inspection)
    ('RC', 'PK'): (518400, 100800),  # Receive Components to Packaging: ~6 days avg, with ~1.17 days std dev (assembly and testing duration)
    ('QI', 'DT'): (604800, 129600),  # Quality Inspection to Distribution: ~7 days avg, with ~1.5 days std dev (post-inspection stages)
    ('CA', 'AS'): (1468800, 302400), # Component Assembly to After-Sales Support: ~17 days avg, with ~3.5 days std dev (post-production and customer feedback)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),   # Product Testing to Distribution: ~3 days avg, with ~1 day std dev (packaging and shipping)
}
```

### Explanation of Estimations:
- **Directly Connected Activities**: Pairs like `('SS', 'OP')` or `('RC', 'QI')` have shorter average times and smaller standard deviations because they are sequential steps with relatively predictable transitions.
- **Multiple-Step Separations**: Pairs like `('SS', 'PT')` or `('CA', 'AS')` have longer average times and larger standard deviations, reflecting the cumulative variability of intermediate steps (e.g., supplier delays, testing issues, or distribution logistics).
- **Variability Factors**: Standard deviations are estimated to be roughly 20-30% of the average times for most pairs, reflecting realistic uncertainty in supply chain processes (e.g., supplier reliability, inspection outcomes, or shipping delays). For longer spans like `('DT', 'AS')`, variability is higher due to unpredictable customer behavior.
- **Time Units**: All times are in seconds. For example, 86400 seconds = 1 day, 604800 seconds = 7 days, etc., aligning with realistic durations for supply chain activities (e.g., days for procurement, hours for in-facility transitions).

This dictionary captures a subset of all possible pairs to maintain readability while demonstrating the concept of a temporal profile across both short and long temporal distances in the process. If a full set of pairs is needed, it can be expanded to include every combination of activities that eventually follow each other. The values can also be adjusted based on real event log data or domain-specific insights.
