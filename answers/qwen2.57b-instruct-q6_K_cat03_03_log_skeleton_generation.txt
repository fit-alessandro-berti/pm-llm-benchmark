To construct the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process, we need to define constraints based on typical workflows and logical sequences. Here are some reasonable assumptions and constraints:

1. **Equivalence:** Items in stock should be checked before being reserved.
2. **Always Before:** The quality check can only occur after picking items.
3. **Always After:** Packaging an order occurs only after all items have been picked, inspected, and the shipping label is generated.
4. **Never Together:** Checking availability and picking items cannot happen at the same time; neither should checking and packing orders.
5. **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity can be processed one or more times (though in reality, some may not require multiple occurrences).
6. **Directly Follows Constraints:** Generating a shipping label must occur before dispatching the order.

Here is how we would represent this in Python:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('CA', 'RI')},  # Check availability and reserve items should be equivalent

    'always_before': {('CA', 'PI'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('GSL', 'D')},  # Constraints for logical sequence of activities

    'always_after': {('PI', 'QC'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')},  # Ensuring correct order of operations

    'never_together': {('CA', 'PI'), ('QC', 'RO')},  # Activities that cannot occur at the same time

    'activ_freq': {'RO': {1, 1}, 'CA': {1, 1}, 'RI': {1, 1}, 'PI': {1, 1}, 
                   'QC': {0, 1}, 'PO': {1, 1}, 'GSL': {1, 1}, 'D': {1, 1}, 'IC': {1, 1}, 'RP': {1, 1}},  # Each activity can occur once

    'directly_follows': {'PI': {'QC'}, 'QC': {'PO'}, 'PO': {'GSL'}, 'GSL': {'D'}}  # Directly-follows constraints
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Equivalence:** `('CA', 'RI')` means that checking availability and reserving items are equivalent actions.
- **Always Before:** `('CA', 'PI')`, `('QC', 'PO')`, and `('GSL', 'D')` ensure that one activity must happen before another in the correct order.
- **Always After:** `('PI', 'QC')`, `('PO', 'GSL')`, and `('GSL', 'D')` ensure that activities occur after specific previous activities.
- **Never Together:** `('CA', 'PI')` ensures that checking availability cannot happen at the same time as picking items, which is a logical sequence constraint. Similarly, `('QC', 'RO')` means quality check and receiving an order are separate activities (though in this case, it might be redundant since RO only happens once).
- **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity can occur 1 or more times.
- **Directly Follows Constraints:** Ensures that picking items must directly follow checking availability, inspecting must directly follow picking, and generating a shipping label must directly follow packing the order.

This skeleton provides a foundational structure for modeling the order fulfillment process in the distribution center.
