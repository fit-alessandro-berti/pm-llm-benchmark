Let's analyze the event log and identify the manufacturing activities based on the sensor readings.

**Activity Analysis:**

1. **Idle/Startup Phase (Events 1-3)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Low, stable temperature (20-21°C)
     * Minimal pressure (1 bar)
     * Zero vibration
     * No material flow
     * Tool at initial position (0 mm)
     * Low energy consumption (0.40-0.50 kWh)
   - Label: **Machine Initialization/Idle State**
   - Rationale: These initial events represent the machine at rest, preparing for operation.

2. **Cutting/Machining Phase (Events 4-6)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Sharp temperature increase (50-58°C)
     * Slight pressure increase (1-1.5 bar)
     * High vibration (30-38 Hz)
     * Consistent material flow (5 units/s)
     * Tool position advancing (5-10 mm)
     * Increased energy consumption (2.00-3.00 kWh)
   - Label: **Metal Cutting/Machining**
   - Rationale: The combination of high temperature, vibration, material flow, and tool movement suggests an active cutting or machining process.

3. **Assembly/Positioning Phase (Events 7-8)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Temperature drop (40°C)
     * Pressure increase (2 bar)
     * Low vibration (10 Hz)
     * Reduced material flow (2 units/s)
     * Tool at mid-position (15 mm)
     * Moderate energy consumption (2.00 kWh)
   - Label: **Part Positioning/Assembly**
   - Rationale: Stable conditions suggest precise positioning or component assembly.

4. **Welding/High-Intensity Phase (Event 9)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Extreme temperature spike (80°C)
     * Sustained pressure (2 bar)
     * Very high vibration (50 Hz)
     * No material flow
     * Tool stationary (15 mm)
     * Peak energy consumption (5.00 kWh)
   - Label: **Welding/High-Intensity Processing**
   - Rationale: The dramatic temperature and energy spike indicates an intense, focused operation like welding.

5. **Cool Down/Transition Phase (Events 10-12)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Temperature reduction (30-25°C)
     * Pressure returning to baseline (1 bar)
     * Low vibration (1-5 Hz)
     * Minimal material flow (1 unit/s)
     * Tool repositioning (15-20 mm)
     * Reduced energy consumption (1.00-1.60 kWh)
   - Label: **Cool Down/Preparation for Next Cycle**
   - Rationale: The system is cooling and preparing for the next operational phase.

6. **Return to Idle (Events 13-15)**
   - Characteristics:
     * Return to initial conditions (similar to startup phase)
   - Label: **Machine Reset/Ready State**
   - Rationale: Machine returns to initial configuration, ready for next process cycle.

**Process Flow Summary:**
1. Machine Initialization
2. Metal Cutting/Machining
3. Part Positioning/Assembly
4. Welding/High-Intensity Processing
5. Cool Down/Transition
6. Machine Reset

**Key Insights:**
- The process shows a clear cyclic pattern
- Each phase is characterized by distinct sensor reading patterns
- Energy consumption and temperature are particularly strong indicators of activity type

This analysis demonstrates how process mining can extract meaningful manufacturing activities from raw numerical sensor data by identifying characteristic patterns across multiple sensor dimensions.
