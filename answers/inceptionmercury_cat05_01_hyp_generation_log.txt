Okay, I understand. I'm given a PostgreSQL database schema with tables for order event logs, orders, and resources. The goal is to analyze the event log data to identify anomalies or undesirable behaviors in the order processing flow, hypothesize causes, and then generate SQL queries to investigate these hypotheses.

I will focus on identifying deviations from the assumed normal process flow, unusual resource usage, and potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
