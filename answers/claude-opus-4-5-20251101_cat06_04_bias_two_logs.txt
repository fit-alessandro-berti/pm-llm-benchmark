# Bias Analysis: Comparing Group A and Group B Event Logs

## Executive Summary

**Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** through a systematic scoring advantage mechanism that is unavailable to Group A applicants. This bias manifests through the "Community Boost" score adjustment tied to local residency and community group membership.

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Key Differentiating Factors

| Factor | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **LocalResident** | All FALSE | All TRUE |
| **CommunityGroup** | All "None" | Mixed (some have membership) |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always 0 | 0 or +10 (Community Boost) |

---

### 2. How Bias Manifests

#### The "Community Boost" Mechanism

The scoring system applies a **+10 point adjustment** to applicants who:
- Are local residents (LocalResident = TRUE), **AND**
- Belong to a recognized community group (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club")

**This creates a structural advantage exclusively available to Group B members.**

#### Case-by-Case Comparison

| Comparison | Group A Case | Group B Case | Analysis |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Equal Starting Score** | P001: 720  720 (Approved) | U001: 720  730 (Approved) | U001 gets +10 boost despite identical baseline |
| **Borderline Cases** | P002: 710  710 (Rejected) | U003: 695  705 (Approved) | U003 approved with *lower* initial score due to boost |
| **No Boost Scenario** | P002: 710 (Rejected) | U002: 710 (Rejected) | Same outcome when boost unavailable |

---

### 3. Critical Evidence of Disparate Impact

#### The Most Revealing Comparison: P002 vs U003

```
P002 (Group A): 710 preliminary score  No adjustment  REJECTED
U003 (Group B): 695 preliminary score  +10 boost  705  APPROVED
```

**This demonstrates that a Group B applicant with a 15-point LOWER creditworthiness indicator received approval, while the Group A applicant was rejected.**

### 4. Structural Barriers for Group A

The bias operates through **proxy discrimination**:

```

                    BIAS PATHWAY                             

  Protected Group Status                                     
                                                            
  Cannot be Local Resident (LocalResident = FALSE)           
                                                            
  Cannot join local Community Groups                         
                                                            
  Ineligible for "Community Boost"                           
                                                            
  Systematically disadvantaged in final decisions            

```

### 5. Quantified Impact

| Metric | Group A | Group B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Approval Rate** | 66.7% (2/3) | 66.7% (2/3) |
| **Avg. Score Adjustment** | 0 | +6.67 |
| **Boosted Approvals** | 0 | 2 (U001, U003) |
| **Approvals that would fail without boost** | N/A | 1 (U003) |

*Note: While approval rates appear equal in this small sample, U003's approval despite a lower baseline score reveals the systemic advantage.*

---

## Conclusion

### Type of Bias: **Indirect/Proxy Discrimination**

The system doesn't explicitly discriminate based on protected group membership. Instead, it uses **facially neutral criteria** (local residency, community membership) that:

1. **Correlate perfectly** with protected group status in this data
2. **Provide material advantages** (score boosts) only accessible to the unprotected group
3. **Influence final outcomes** in ways that disadvantage the protected group

### Fairness Implications

This scoring mechanism violates principles of:
- **Equal treatment**: Different evaluation standards based on group-correlated attributes
- **Counterfactual fairness**: A Group A member with identical financials as U003 would be rejected
- **Disparate impact**: The policy, while neutral in wording, produces unequal outcomes

### Recommendation

The "Community Boost" adjustment should be **removed or reformed** to ensure that creditworthiness decisions are based solely on financial merit, not attributes that serve as proxies for protected characteristics.
