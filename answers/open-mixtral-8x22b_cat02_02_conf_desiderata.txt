1. Case 2 is violating the normative rules. The violation occurs in the sequence of activities, where the Risk Assessment is performed before the Credit Check. This is a violation of the normative constraints, which state that the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment. Additionally, Case 2 performs Finalize Documentation after a rejection, which is also against the normative constraints.

2. Case 3 fails to meet the desiderata conditions. The Credit Check is performed more than 24 hours after the application is received, which is later than the recommended timeframe. Similarly, the applicant is informed later than the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision. While these deviations are not severe violations, they represent suboptimal behavior as they do not adhere to the recommended best practices. Additionally, Case 3 does not include a Follow-up Call, which is encouraged but not strictly required.

3. The observed behaviors in Case 2 could potentially be justified by unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden increase in workload or a temporary lack of resources, which might have led to the Risk Assessment being performed before the Credit Check. However, the performance of Finalize Documentation after a rejection is a clear violation and cannot be justified within the given constraints. As for Case 3, the delay in performing the Credit Check and informing the applicant could be due to a backlog of applications or other administrative delays. The absence of a Follow-up Call could be due to resource constraints or an oversight, but it is important to note that this does not justify the deviation from the recommended best practice.
