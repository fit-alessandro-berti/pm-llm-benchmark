Here’s a refined version of the prompt along with a corresponding SQL query to address the problem:

### **Refined Prompt**

You are tasked with analyzing an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in this table represents a single event, and the table contains at least the following columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The `case_id` column groups events that belong to the same process instance (or "case").

Your goal is to filter out all cases (`case_id`) that contain more than six events. Specifically, you need to:
1. Count the number of events for each `case_id`.
2. Exclude any `case_id` where the count exceeds six.
3. Return all events from the remaining cases.

The result should include the full set of events (all columns) for cases that have six or fewer events.

### **SQL Query**

Below is the SQL query to achieve the desired result:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
valid_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        case_event_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    valid_cases vc
ON 
    el.case_id = vc.case_id;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **Step 1: Count Events Per Case**
   - The `case_event_counts` Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the total number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the rows in the `event_log` table and counting the rows per group.
   - This step ensures we know how many events each `case_id` has.

2. **Step 2: Filter Cases with Six or Fewer Events**
   - The `valid_cases` CTE filters the results from `case_event_counts` to include only those `case_id`s where the `event_count` is less than or equal to six.

3. **Step 3: Retrieve Full Event Data for Valid Cases**
   - The final `SELECT` statement retrieves all columns (`el.*`) from the `event_log` table for the `case_id`s listed in the `valid_cases` CTE.
   - This is achieved by performing an inner join between the `event_log` table and the `valid_cases` CTE on the `case_id` column.

### **Key Considerations**
- **Performance:** The query is designed to efficiently handle large datasets by leveraging grouping and filtering operations.
- **Scalability:** The use of CTEs improves readability and modularity, making it easier to adapt the query if additional conditions or transformations are required.
- **Correctness:** The query ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result, while preserving all relevant event details.
