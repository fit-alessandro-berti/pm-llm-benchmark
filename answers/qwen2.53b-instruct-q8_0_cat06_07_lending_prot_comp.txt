To identify the main differences based on the provided data, we can analyze the flow of processes and their outcomes across different scenarios.

### Common Process Flow:
The process generally follows a consistent structure:
1. Request Appointment
2. Set Appointment
3. Hand In Credit Application
4. Verify Borrowers Information
5. Various Actions (e.g., Make Visit to Assess Colateral, Submit File to Underwriter, etc.)
6. Loan Status (Denied or Agreement Signed)

### Differences Identified:

#### 1. **Different Final Outcomes:**
   - Loan Denied and Agreement Signed are the primary outcomes.
   - There seem to be fewer cases of signing a loan agreement compared to loan denial.

#### 2. **Additional Steps Introduced:**
   - Multiple visits to assess collateral (Make Visit to Assess Colatteral)
     - This is seen in scenarios where additional verification or reassessment steps occur before finalizing the process.
  
#### 3. **Presence/Sequence of Co-Signer Requests:**
   - Sometimes a request for co-signer on loan is included, and sometimes it's skipped.
   - It appears to be conditional based on the assessment of collateral and borrower information.

### Specific Differences in Detailed Steps:

**Main Differences in Process Flow:**
1. **Steps Added/Removed for Loan Denial Cases:**
   - Many scenarios that end in denial involve more steps (e.g., making visits to assess collaterals, requesting co-signers) compared to those that lead to agreement signing.

2. **Conditional Actions Based on Assessment of Collateral Information:**
   - Co-signer requests seem to be conditional on the assessment of collateral. If the loan is denied after multiple assessments and verification steps (e.g., visit for collaterals, request co-signers), it implies issues with the borrower's credit or lack of acceptable collateral.

### Summary:
- The primary difference lies in the final outcome: Loan Denied versus Agreement Signed.
- There are more complex processes that lead to loan denial involving multiple visits and additional verification steps.
- The conditional nature of some steps, particularly regarding co-signer requests based on collaterals, seems to play a significant role.

### Conclusion:
The key differences stem from the variety in outcomes (denial vs. agreement), the inclusion/exclusion of certain intermediate steps that affect the decision-making process, and the presence or absence of co-signers conditional on the assessment of collateral.
