Here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions to deepen your understanding of the property onboarding process, organized by key themes:

---

### **1. Documentation & Initial Review**
- How do landlords typically submit their initial documentation (e.g., deeds, inspection reports)? Is there a standardized checklist or portal they use, or does this vary by region?
- What are the most common gaps or issues you encounter in landlord-submitted documentation? How long does it usually take to resolve these?
- Are there regional or city-specific compliance requirements that add complexity to the documentation review? How do you stay updated on these?
- Who is responsible for verifying the authenticity of documents (e.g., deeds, certificates)? Is this done internally, or do you rely on third-party services?

---

### **2. Property Manager Assignment**
- What criteria are most heavily weighted when assigning a property manager (e.g., workload, geographic proximity, property type experience)? Are there ever conflicts between these factors?
- How do you measure a property manager’s "track record" with landlords who have unique requirements? Are there KPIs or past performance metrics used?
- What happens if no property manager is available with the right expertise? Do you delay onboarding, assign a temporary manager, or provide additional training?
- How is the landlord’s preference (if any) for a specific property manager incorporated into the assignment process?

---

### **3. Landlord-Manager Alignment Meeting**
- What are the most common "special conditions" or policies landlords request during this meeting? How often do these require negotiation or compromise?
- Are there standard templates or guidelines the property manager uses to set expectations (e.g., maintenance responsibilities, pet policies)? Or is this customized per landlord?
- How do you document the outcomes of this meeting? Is there a formal agreement or just internal notes?
- What happens if the landlord’s expectations (e.g., rental price, tenant screening criteria) conflict with the company’s policies or market realities?

---

### **4. Property Inspection & Photography**
- How do you select and schedule inspectors and photographers? Are these internal teams, preferred vendors, or landlord-chosen providers?
- What are the most frequent issues inspectors flag, and how do you prioritize resolving them? Are there "deal-breakers" that would pause onboarding?
- Who bears the cost of repairs or upgrades identified during inspection—the landlord or the company? How is this communicated upfront?
- How long does the inspection-to-repair cycle typically take? Are there SLAs (service-level agreements) for this phase?

---
### **5. Marketing & Pricing**
- How do you determine the "expected rental price range" for a new property? Is this based on internal data, third-party tools, or the landlord’s input?
- What channels do you use for marketing (e.g., company website, Zillow, local agents)? How do you decide where to prioritize?
- How often do you adjust pricing or marketing strategies based on tenant interest (or lack thereof)? Who makes this call?
- Are there properties that require specialized marketing (e.g., luxury units, student housing)? How does that process differ?

---
### **6. Tenant Screening & Lease Finalization**
- What are the non-negotiable criteria for tenant approval (e.g., credit score, income ratio)? How do you handle edge cases (e.g., a tenant with excellent references but poor credit)?
- How do you manage situations where multiple qualified tenants apply? Is it first-come-first-served, highest bidder, or another method?
- Who drafts the lease agreement—the property manager, a legal team, or a template system? How often are custom clauses added?
- What’s the typical turnaround time from tenant application to lease signing? Where do delays usually occur?

---
### **7. Compliance & Internal Audits**
- What are the most critical compliance risks you audit for (e.g., fair housing, local rent control laws)? How do you train staff to spot these?
- How do you handle cases where a landlord insists on lease terms that may violate regulations (e.g., discriminatory clauses)?
- Who conducts the financial review of rental pricing? What happens if the agreed price falls outside profitability targets?
- How do you ensure data consistency across systems (e.g., CRM, rental portal, accounting)? Are there automated checks or manual reviews?

---
### **8. Exceptions & Edge Cases**
- What are the most common "exceptions" you encounter in onboarding (e.g., properties with unique insurance needs, landlords with custom demands)? How do you standardize handling these?
- Are there properties that get fast-tracked (e.g., high-value landlords, urgent vacancies)? How does that impact the process?
- How do you handle disputes between landlords and property managers during onboarding (e.g., disagreements over repairs or pricing)?
- Have you ever had to *decline* onboarding a property? What were the reasons, and how was that communicated?

---
### **9. Communication & Tools**
- How do you track communication between landlords, property managers, and support teams? Are there tools (e.g., CRM, Slack, email) that work better than others?
- What’s the biggest communication bottleneck in this process? Where do messages or tasks most often get dropped?
- How do landlords provide feedback on the onboarding experience? Is this collected systematically or ad hoc?
- Are there any parts of the process that are still heavily manual (e.g., data entry, document reviews)? What would you automate if you could?

---
### **10. Process Improvement & Metrics**
- How do you measure the success of the onboarding process? Are there metrics like time-to-activate, landlord satisfaction scores, or tenant placement rates?
- What’s the average time to onboard a property from first contact to tenant move-in? How does this vary by property type or region?
- Where do you see the most friction or inefficiencies in the current process? What’s been tried to improve these?
- If you could redesign one part of this process, what would it be and why?

---
### **11. Stakeholder Perspectives**
- How do landlords typically describe their experience with this process? What do they praise or criticize most?
- What do property managers find most challenging about onboarding? Is it workload, landlord expectations, or something else?
- How do tenants perceive the quality of properties onboarded through this process? Are there common complaints (e.g., inaccurate listings, delayed repairs)?

---
### **12. Scalability & Growth**
- How would this process need to change if the company expanded to a new city or country? What local factors would you research first?
- Are there parts of the process that wouldn’t scale well with a sudden increase in onboarding volume? How would you address that?
- How do you onboard property managers themselves? Is there training specific to this process?

These questions aim to uncover **hidden complexities**, **decision-making tradeoffs**, and **pain points** while avoiding overly technical or implementation-focused details. Would you like to prioritize any of these areas further?
