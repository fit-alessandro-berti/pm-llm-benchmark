**Violations Identification and Explanation**

After carefully reviewing the event log and the normative process description, I have identified the following cases that deviate from the intended process flow:

1. **Case 2**: The order is shipped before authorization and packaging, which is a violation of the normative process. According to the description, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
2. **Case 3**: The order is shipped after cancellation, which is a clear violation of the normative process. According to the description, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after a cancellation. In this case, the order is first canceled and then shipped.
3. **Case 4**: The order is canceled and then shipped, which is another violation of the normative process. According to the description, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items," and in this case, the order is canceled before any packaging occurs.
4. **Case 5**: The order is shipped before authorization and packaging, which is similar to Case 2 but with different timestamps. Again, this violates the normative process, as "Package items" should occur before "Ship order."

In all of these cases, the deviating activity (shipping before authorization, packaging, or cancellation) is not followed by the required subsequent activities, which are either "Package items" or "Close order" in the case of cancellation. The normative process description emphasizes the importance of maintaining a logical sequence of activities, and these cases demonstrate violations of that sequence.

The textual description also provides guidance on interpreting the conditions under which these sequences may be deviated from, but in these cases, the deviations are clear and violate fundamental principles of the process.
