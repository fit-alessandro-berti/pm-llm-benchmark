Okay, let's see. I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that does a few things. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the task is to exclude cases that have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. So the final result should be all events except those from such cases.

So, the approach would be:

1. Identify all case_ids that have the exact sequence of those three activities with no other events in between. Then check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

2. Then, exclude all events from those case_ids.

So, first, I need to find the cases that meet both conditions. Then, select all events not in those case_ids.

How to find the cases with the sequence?

In the event_log, for each case, we need to check if there's a sequence of three consecutive activities (in the same case) where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order', with no other activities in between.

Wait, "direct succession" means that the three activities are consecutive in the event log for that case. So for a given case, the events are ordered by timestamp. So for each case, we need to check if there's a point where the current event is 'Approve...', next event is 'Create Order', next after that is 'Confirm Order'.

But how to check for consecutive events in DuckDB?

One way is to use the LEAD() window function to look at the next two events for each row in the same case. For example, for each event in a case, check if the current activity is 'Approve...', then the next activity (using LEAD(1)) is 'Create Order', and the LEAD(2) is 'Confirm Order'.

But to do that, we need to order the events by timestamp for each case. So first, partition by case_id, order by timestamp.

So for each row in the event_log, we can look at the next two rows in the same case. If the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next is 'Create Order', next next is 'Confirm Order', then this case has the sequence.

But also, need to check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Wait, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence. So for the case where the three activities are consecutive, the 'Create Order' event's timestamp and the 'Confirm Order' event's timestamp should have a difference >5 days.

Wait, but in the sequence, the 'Create Order' is the second event, and 'Confirm Order' is the third. So for the row where the current activity is 'Create Order', but wait, no. Let's see: the three activities in sequence are:

1. Approve Purchase Requisition (current row)
2. Create Order (next row)
3. Confirm Order (next next row)

So for the current row (Approve...), the next row is Create Order, next next is Confirm Order. So the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is the timestamp of the third event minus the timestamp of the second event.

But the problem says "the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days".

So yes, that's the difference between the timestamp of the Confirm Order event and the Create Order event. So for the case where the three consecutive events are in order, we need to check that (Confirm Order timestamp - Create Order timestamp) > interval '5 days'.

So to find all such case_ids, we can:

- For each case, sort by timestamp.

- For each row, check if current activity is 'Approve...', LEAD(1) is 'Create Order', LEAD(2) is 'Confirm Order'.

- Then check if (LEAD(timestamp, 2) - timestamp) > 5 days. Wait, no. Wait, the current row's timestamp is the Approve event. The LEAD(1) is the Create Order's timestamp. LEAD(2) is Confirm Order's timestamp.

So the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is LEAD(2) - LEAD(1). So for the current row (Approve), the next event is Create Order, then Confirm Order. So the difference between LEAD(1) and LEAD(2) is the time between Create and Confirm. So that should be >5 days.

Wait, but the problem says "time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event". So yes, that's the time between those two specific events. So for the sequence where they are consecutive, the time between them is the difference between the Confirm Order's timestamp and the Create Order's timestamp. So if that difference is >5 days, then the case meets the condition.

So for the case to be excluded, the three activities must be in direct succession, and the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days.

So first, we need to find all case_ids that have at least one occurrence of such a sequence.

Once we have those case_ids, we need to exclude all events from those cases.

So the plan is:

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence (Approve  Create  Confirm) with no other events in between, and the time between Create and Confirm >5 days.

2. Then select all events from event_log where case_id is not in that list.

So how to find those case_ids.

We can create a subquery that selects the case_id where the condition is met.

For example:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
) AS sub
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

Wait, but the time between Create and Confirm is next_next_timestamp (Confirm) minus next_timestamp (Create). So yes, that's correct.

So the condition for the time is (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > interval '5 days'.

Then, the case_ids from this subquery are the ones to exclude.

Then, the main query is to select all rows from event_log where case_id is not in that list.

So the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS sub
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

But wait, in DuckDB, how to handle the interval? INTERVAL '5 days' is correct. Also, the subtraction of two timestamps gives an interval, so comparing to interval '5 days' should work.

But need to check if the LEAD functions are correctly used. Because for the last two events in a case, LEAD(1) or LEAD(2) would be NULL. But in the WHERE clause, we're checking activity = 'Approve...', so only rows where the current activity is that, and then next_activity and next_next_activity are not NULL. So the LEAD would only return non-NULL for cases where there are at least two more events after the current one. So for rows where there are not enough events after, the LEAD would return NULL, and the WHERE clause would filter them out. So that's okay.

So the subquery will only return case_ids where there's a valid sequence of three consecutive events. So the NOT IN clause would exclude those case_ids.

But another way is to use EXISTS or a JOIN, but NOT IN should work.

Wait, but in DuckDB, the NOT IN might have issues if there are NULLs in the subquery, but in our case, the subquery selects case_id, which shouldn't be NULL. So that's okay.

Alternatively, using NOT EXISTS might be better, but for simplicity, NOT IN should work here.

So the main query would select all events where case_id is not in the list of case_ids that have the sequence.

But let's check the time part again. The time between Create Order and Confirm Order. The Create Order is the next_activity, which is the next row after the Approve. So the next_timestamp is the Create Order's timestamp, next_next_timestamp is Confirm Order's. So the difference between next_next_timestamp and next_timestamp should be >5 days.

Yes.

So in the subquery, the condition is:

(next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

Yes.

So the query should work.

Wait, but what if the same case has multiple such sequences? Then the subquery would return the case_id multiple times, but in NOT IN, duplicates don't matter. So the main query will exclude the case_id once it's present in the subquery.

So the query should be correct.

Let me test with a small example.

Suppose a case has events:

1. Approve, timestamp t1

2. Create, t2

3. Confirm, t3

And t3 - t2 >5 days.

Then the case_id will be in the subquery, so excluded.

Another case where the sequence is there but the time is less than 5 days: not excluded.

Another case where the sequence is not present: included.

Another case where the sequence is present but not consecutive (e.g., Approve, some other activity, then Create, Confirm), then it's not considered because the LEAD(1) for Approve would not be Create. So such a case would not be included in the subquery.

Yes.

So the query seems correct.

Now, possible edge cases:

- What if a case has more than three events, but the sequence is in the middle. Like:

Approve, Create, Confirm, some other activity. Then for the first event (Approve), next is Create, next next is Confirm. So it would be detected.

Yes.

What if the case has multiple sequences? Like Approve, Create, Confirm, Approve, Create, Confirm. Then the first three would be detected, and the next three as well. But the case_id would be in the subquery once, so excluded.

Yes.

Another edge: if the time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days. Then the condition is >5 days, so not included. So such cases are not excluded.

So the query is correct.

Now, writing the actual SQL.

In DuckDB, the syntax for interval is INTERVAL '5 days' or INTERVAL '5 day'?

Probably INTERVAL '5 days' is correct.

Also, when subtracting two timestamps, the result is an interval. So comparing to INTERVAL '5 days' should work.

So the subquery part:

SELECT case_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
) AS sub
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

Then the main query:

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN ( ... )

Yes.

Alternatively, using NOT EXISTS:

SELECT * FROM event_log e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM (
        ... same subquery ...
    ) AS s
    WHERE s.case_id = e.case_id
)

But NOT IN is simpler here.

But in DuckDB, if the subquery returns NULLs, NOT IN might not work as expected. But in our case, case_id is not NULL, and the subquery selects case_id which is not NULL. So NOT IN is safe.

So the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
        FROM event_log
    ) AS sub
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Yes.

Wait, but in the subquery, the LEAD functions are applied on the entire event_log. But we need to partition by case_id and order by timestamp. Which is done in the OVER clause.

Yes, correct.

Another possible issue: if the same case has multiple sequences. For example, two separate sequences of the three activities. Then the subquery would return the case_id once for each sequence. But when using NOT IN, it's still the same case_id. So the main query will exclude the case_id once it's present in the subquery, regardless of how many times. So that's correct.

So this query should work.

Let me check the time difference again. The time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp. Because next_timestamp is the Create Order's timestamp, next_next_timestamp is the Confirm Order's.

Yes. So the difference between them is the time between Create and Confirm.

So if that's >5 days, then condition is met.

Yes.

So the query should be correct.
