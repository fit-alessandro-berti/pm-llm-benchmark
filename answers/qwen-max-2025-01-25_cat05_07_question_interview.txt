Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions designed to clarify and deepen the understanding of the property onboarding process described:

### **Documentation and Initial Review**
1. How does the property coordinator determine which documents are required for each property? Are there any differences in requirements based on location or property type?
2. What happens if the landlord is unable or unwilling to provide updated documentation after it’s requested? Are there any escalation procedures or alternative solutions?
3. Can you describe how discrepancies in the submitted documents (e.g., conflicting square footage figures) are resolved during the verification process?

### **Property Manager Assignment**
4. What specific criteria or tools are used to evaluate a property manager’s current workload and geographic specialization when assigning them to a new property?
5. How do you ensure that the assigned property manager has sufficient experience with unique landlord requirements, such as handling luxury units or student housing?
6. Could you elaborate on what typically happens during the introductory call between the property manager and the landlord? Are there common topics or issues that arise at this stage?

### **Inspection and Photography**
7. How far in advance are inspections and photography sessions scheduled, and what factors influence the timeline for these activities?
8. If significant repairs are needed after the inspection, how does the company decide whether to recommend contractors or allow the landlord to handle the work themselves?
9. Are there cases where properties fail inspection repeatedly? If so, how does the company manage those situations?

### **Marketing and Activation**
10. How does the digital marketing team tailor their strategies for different types of properties, such as luxury rentals versus student housing?
11. What role does market trend analysis play in setting rental prices, and who is responsible for making final pricing decisions?
12. Once the property is activated in the rental portal, how long does it typically take before tenant applications start coming in? Does this vary by location or season?

### **Tenant Screening and Lease Negotiation**
13. Can you walk me through the tenant screening process in more detail? For example, how are borderline applicants (e.g., low credit score but strong employment history) evaluated?
14. When negotiating lease terms with multiple interested tenants, what factors are prioritized in deciding whom to select?
15. Are there standard templates for lease agreements, or are custom clauses frequently added? If so, who reviews and approves these customizations?

### **Quality Checks and Audits**
16. Who conducts the compliance review of the lease agreement, and what specific regulations or policies do they check for adherence?
17. How does the financial analyst assess whether the agreed rental price aligns with profitability targets? Is there a benchmark or formula used for this evaluation?
18. What kinds of errors or inconsistencies have been identified during IT audits of property data entries, and how are they corrected?

### **Exception Handling**
19. Can you give examples of exceptions that commonly occur during the onboarding process, such as properties requiring special insurance or landlords insisting on nonstandard lease terms?
20. How are exceptions escalated within the organization, and who has the authority to approve deviations from the standard process?
21. Have there been instances where the process had to be paused or restarted due to unforeseen complications? If so, how were they managed?

### **Communication and Coordination**
22. How is communication coordinated among all stakeholders—regional offices, landlords, property managers, inspectors, photographers, etc.—throughout the onboarding process?
23. Are there recurring challenges in maintaining clear communication across teams, especially when relying on email threads, CRMs, and project management tools? If so, how are they addressed?
24. How often do regional offices interact directly with landlords versus delegating tasks entirely to property managers?

### **Timing and Sequencing**
25. On average, how long does the entire onboarding process take from initial contact with the landlord to activating the property in the rental portal?
26. Which steps in the process tend to cause delays, and what measures are in place to mitigate them?
27. Are there seasonal variations in the volume of properties being onboarded, and how does the company adjust its resources to accommodate fluctuations?

### **Roles and Responsibilities**
28. Aside from the property coordinator and property manager, what other roles are heavily involved in the onboarding process, and what are their key responsibilities?
29. How are performance metrics or accountability tracked for individuals or teams involved in the process? For example, is there a way to measure how efficiently coordinators verify documentation or how effectively managers negotiate leases?
30. Is there cross-training or overlap between roles, such as property coordinators assisting with inspections or marketing tasks, to ensure continuity if someone is unavailable?

These questions aim to uncover nuances in decision-making, clarify roles, explore exception-handling mechanisms, and better understand the overall flow and timing of the process.
