Based on the process variants provided, here are some potential differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group:

1. **Different Outcomes**: The protected group has a higher frequency of outcomes where the prospective tenant is rejected, such as "Reject Prospective Tenant" and "Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant". This could suggest that the screening process is more thorough and careful for the protected group.

2. **Different Execution Time**: The protected group has a lower average execution time for the outcome "Reject Prospective Tenant" (480013.530) compared to the unprotected group (80000.654). This could indicate that the screening process for the protected group is more efficient.

3. **Different Tenancy Outcomes**: The protected group has a higher frequency of outcomes where the prospective tenant signs a contract and moves in, such as "Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In" (719988.306). This could suggest that the protected group is more likely to progress to the tenancy stage.

4. **Different Tenancy Termination Outcomes**: The protected group has a higher frequency of outcomes where the tenant cancels the apartment lease, such as "Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" (1119986.154) and "Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" (1280091.444). This could suggest that the protected group is more likely to remain in the rental unit for a longer period.

5. **Different Payment Outcomes**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of outcomes where rent is missed, such as "Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" (6  performance = 990084.833). This could suggest that the unprotected group is more likely to experience payment issues.
