I'll highlight the main differences in treatment success rates between different departments and treatment modalities.

**Main differences:**

1. **Department of Observation (OD):** Treatment successful / Discharge frequency > 90% vs <40%. These departments have a higher likelihood of treatment being successful, with discharge frequencies above 80%, compared to other departments.
2. **ER Department:** Treatment successful / Discharge frequency > 91% vs 41%. ER departments tend to achieve better treatment outcomes, while DR (Day Rehabilitation) department has a lower success rate in treatment and discharge.
3. **Thorough Examination / Thorough Examination Diagnosis / Treatment successful / Discharge:** Treatment successful / Discharge frequency > 96.4% - A higher success rate is achieved when all aspects of examination are thorough and diagnosis meets expectation criteria, while the treatment outcome is consistent over time (TDS). 
4. **Expert Examination:** Treatment unsuccessful/Discharge frequent (>90%) vs Treatment successful / Discharge frequency > 80%. Expert examinations have lower confidence in diagnosis and result interpretation, often resulting in fewer favorable discharge rates.

**Additional observations:**

* High success rate with TSD (Thorough Examination Diagnosis Success) when overall treatment is considered.
* Higher discharge frequencies occur when the initial evaluation is comprehensive; DR department does better without requiring interventions from specialists such as OT's).
* Higher failure frequency of TDS treatment in ER departments, suggesting that more complex or urgent cases require hospital management, which may impact overall diagnosis and success.
