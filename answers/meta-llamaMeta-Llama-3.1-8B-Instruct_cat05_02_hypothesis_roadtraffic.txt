I'll do my best to propose a list of 20 relevant questions that can be answered using the process variant data. I'll also provide a confidence score for each question, indicating how confident I am in the question's relevance and answerability.

Here are the 20 questions:

1. **What is the average execution time of the process variant "Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Payment"?**

Confidence score: 90% (Average performance is provided for this sequence, making it easy to calculate the execution time)

2. **Which process variant is executed most frequently in the process?**

Confidence score: 85% (Frequency data is provided for each process variant, making it possible to identify the most frequent one)

3. **How long does it take to execute the process variant "Create Fine -> Payment -> Send Fine" on average?**

Confidence score: 80% (Performance data is available for this sequence, but it's not clear if it's the complete execution time or just one part of it)

4. **What is the percentage of process variants that result in a payment being made?**

Confidence score: 75% (Security in assuming that a "Payment" step implies a payment was made)

5. **Which step in the process has the highest average execution time?**

Confidence score: 70% (Performance data is provided for each step, but it's not clear if the values are absolute or relative to each step's position)

6. **How many process variants include the "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" step?**

Confidence score: 65% (Frequency data is provided for most process variants, but it's not clear if "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture" is included)

7. **What is the average time spent on the "Add penalty" step in all process variants?**

Confidence score: 60% (Performance data is provided for each process variant, but it's not clear if the values are absolute or relative to each step's position)

8. **Which process variant includes the most steps?**

Confidence score: 55% (Number of steps is not explicitly included in the data, but can be inferred)

9. **What is the percentage of process variants that result in a credit collection?**

Confidence score: 50% (Assuming that a "Send for Credit Collection" step implies a credit collection was initiated)

10. **How often is the "Insert Fine Notification" step executed in
