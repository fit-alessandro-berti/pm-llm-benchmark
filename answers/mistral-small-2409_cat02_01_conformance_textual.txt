To identify which cases in the event log violate the normative process, we need to compare each case against the expected sequence of activities as described in the normative process description.

The normative process description outlines the expected sequence of activities and the constraints between them. For example, "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order."

Let's analyze each case in the event log to identify any violations:

Case 1:
- The sequence of activities is: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.
- This sequence follows the expected flow described in the normative process description.
- No violations are found in Case 1.

Case 2:
- The sequence of activities is: Receive order, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- In this sequence, "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items," which violates the constraint that "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items."
- Case 2 violates the normative process.

Case 3:
- The sequence of activities is: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
- In this sequence, "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which violates the constraint that "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order."
- Case 3 violates the normative process.

Case 4:
- The sequence of activities is: Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.
- This sequence follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory scenarios as described in the normative process description.
- No violations are found in Case 4.

Case 5:
- The sequence of activities is: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
- This sequence follows the expected flow described in the normative process description.
- No violations are found in Case 5.

In summary, cases 2 and 3 violate the normative process as described. Case 2 violates the constraint that "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items," and Case 3 violates the constraint that "Ship order" should not occur after "Cancel order."
