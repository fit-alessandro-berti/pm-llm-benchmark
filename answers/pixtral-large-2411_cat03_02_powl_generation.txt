Below is the Python code to construct the POWL model for the described complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company using the `pm4py` library.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Creating transitions for each activity
SR = Transition(label="Service Request")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Creating loop for BNC and DR
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Creating exclusive choice for deployment methods
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Creating the partial order for the initial tasks
initial_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, deployment_choice, QA, SA, GLA])
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(loop, deployment_choice)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
initial_tasks.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# No direct order between DA and ACI, hence they are concurrent
# No direct order between QA and SA, hence they are concurrent

# The root of the POWL model is the initial_tasks partial order
root = initial_tasks

# Output the model (for verification or further use)
print(root)
```

This code constructs the POWL model according to the specified scenario:

1. **Service Request (SR)** verification is the starting point.
2. **Contract Setup (CS)** follows SR.
3. **Datacenter Allocation (DA)** and **Access Control Initialization (ACI)** can occur concurrently after CS.
4. Once DA and ACI are complete, the loop between **Base Network Configuration (BNC)** and **Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)** is executed until the configuration is stable.
5. After the loop, an exclusive choice is made between **Containerized Deployment (CD)** and **Monolithic Deployment (MD)**.
6. **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Security Audit (SA)** can be performed concurrently after deployment.
7. Finally, **Go-Live Approval (GLA)** occurs after both QA and SA are completed.
