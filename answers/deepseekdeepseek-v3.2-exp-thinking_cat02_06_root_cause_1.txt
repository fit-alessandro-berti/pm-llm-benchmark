First, I need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The total resolution time is from the "Receive Ticket" event to the "Close Ticket" event. I'll list out the timestamps for each case.

Starting with Case 101:

- Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00

- Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15

The time difference is from 08:00 to 10:15 on the same day. That's 2 hours and 15 minutes. But since we're dealing with timestamps, I should calculate in hours or minutes for consistency.

Let me convert all timestamps to a common unit, say minutes from a reference point, but since all are on the same date or consecutive, I can calculate the duration in hours.

Actually, for Case 102, it spans two days, so I need to consider the date as well. The timestamps include dates, so I'll calculate the total time in hours.

I'll compute the time difference between "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket" for each case.

Case 101:

Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00

Close: 2024-03-01 10:15

Difference: 10:15 - 08:00 = 2 hours 15 minutes = 2.25 hours

Case 102:

Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05

Close: 2024-03-02 09:15

This is over two days. From 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-02 09:15.

First, from 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-02 08:05 is 24 hours. Then from 08:05 to 09:15 is 1 hour 10 minutes, so total 25 hours 10 minutes? Let me calculate properly.

The number of hours from start to end:

From 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-02 08:05 is 24 hours.

But close is at 09:15, so from 08:05 to 09:15 is 1 hour 10 minutes, so total 25 hours 10 minutes. But in decimal, 25 + 10/60 = 25.1667 hours.

Since timestamps are in minutes, I should use minutes for accuracy.

Let me use minutes from a common point. But for simplicity, I'll calculate the time difference in minutes for each case.

Set a reference: 2024-03-01 00:00 as zero. But since all cases start on 2024-03-01, I can compute the minutes from midnight on 2024-03-01.

Actually, for Case 102, close is on 2024-03-02, so I need to include the full day.

I can convert all timestamps to Unix timestamps or something, but since it's a small log, I'll compute manually.

Let me list the datetime for each event.

Assume all dates are in the same timezone, so no issue.

For Case 102:

Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05

Close: 2024-03-02 09:15

Time difference: from Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 2 09:15.

Days: 1 day = 24 hours.

From Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 2 08:05 is 24 hours.

From Mar 2 08:05 to Mar 2 09:15 is 1 hour 10 minutes.

So total 25 hours 10 minutes = 1510 minutes? Let's see: 25 hours * 60 = 1500 minutes + 10 minutes = 1510 minutes.

But 25 hours is 1500 minutes, plus 10 minutes is 1510 minutes. Yes.

Similarly, for other cases.

I'll compute for all cases in minutes.

First, define the start time for each case as the receive ticket timestamp, and end time as close ticket timestamp.

Case 101:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:00

End: 2024-03-01 10:15

Difference: from 08:00 to 10:15 is 2 hours 15 minutes = 135 minutes (since 2*60=120, +15=135)

Case 102:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:05

End: 2024-03-02 09:15

As above, 1510 minutes? But let's confirm.

From Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 2 08:05 is exactly 24 hours? No, from Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 1 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes? Better to calculate total minutes.

The number of minutes from start to end.

First, find the time on Mar 1 from start to end of day.

Start: 08:05

End of day: 24:00 or 00:00 next day? Since close is on Mar 2, from Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 2 00:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes? Let's think in hours.

From Mar 1 08:05 to Mar 2 00:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes? No.

From 08:05 to 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes? 24:00 - 08:05 = 15:55, so 15 hours and 55 minutes.

But 15 hours 55 minutes = 15*60 +55 = 900+55=955 minutes.

Then from Mar 2 00:00 to Mar 2 09:15 is 9 hours 15 minutes = 9*60+15=540+15=555 minutes.

So total minutes: 955 + 555 = 1510 minutes. Yes.

Similarly, for other cases.

Case 103:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:10

End: 2024-03-01 09:30

Difference: from 08:10 to 09:30 is 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes? 1 hour = 60 minutes, 20 minutes, so 80 minutes? From 08:10 to 09:10 is 60 minutes, to 09:30 is another 20 minutes, so 80 minutes. Yes.

Case 104:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:20

End: 2024-03-02 08:30

From Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 08:30.

From Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 08:20 is 24 hours? No, from Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 1 24:00 is 15 hours 40 minutes? Calculate minutes.

From Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 00:00: 24:00 - 08:20 = 15 hours 40 minutes? 24:00 is 00:00 next day, so from 08:20 to 00:00 is 15 hours 40 minutes? Let's see: from 08:20 to 20:20 is 12 hours, but to 24:00 is from 20:20 to 24:00, which is 3 hours 40 minutes? No.

Better: from time A to time B on different days.

Total time from Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 08:20 is exactly 24 hours? No, because Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 08:20 is 24 hours only if we ignore time, but in terms of clock time, it is 24 hours only if the time is the same, but from 08:20 to 08:20 next day is 24 hours exactly.

But here end is at 08:30, so from Mar 1 08:20 to Mar 2 08:20 is 24 hours, then from 08:20 to 08:30 is 10 minutes, so total 24 hours 10 minutes = 1450 minutes? 24*60=1440, +10=1450 minutes.

Yes.

Case 105:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:25

End: 2024-03-03 09:30

This spans three days.

From Mar 1 08:25 to Mar 3 09:30.

From Mar 1 08:25 to Mar 2 08:25 is 24 hours.

From Mar 2 08:25 to Mar 3 08:25 is another 24 hours, so 48 hours up to Mar 3 08:25.

Then from Mar 3 08:25 to Mar 3 09:30 is 1 hour 5 minutes.

So total 49 hours 5 minutes? But let's in minutes.

48 hours = 48*60=2880 minutes

From Mar 3 08:25 to 09:30 is 65 minutes? From 08:25 to 09:25 is 60 minutes, to 09:30 is 5 minutes, so 65 minutes.

Total minutes: 2880 + 65 = 2945 minutes.

But from start to end: from Mar 1 08:25 to Mar 3 09:30.

The number of days: 2 full days from Mar 1 to Mar 3? From Mar 1 to Mar 2 is one day, Mar 2 to Mar 3 is another day, so from Mar 1 08:25 to Mar 3 08:25 is 48 hours, then to 09:30 is 65 minutes, so 48*60=2880 +65=2945, yes.

Now, I have total resolution time in minutes for each case:

Case 101: 135 minutes

Case 102: 1510 minutes

Case 103: 80 minutes

Case 104: 1450 minutes

Case 105: 2945 minutes

Now, to identify which cases have significantly longer total resolution times, I need to see the average or compare them.

First, list the times:

101: 135 min

102: 1510 min

103: 80 min

104: 1450 min

105: 2945 min

Now, clearly, cases 102, 104, and 105 have much longer times than 101 and 103.

101 and 103 are under 150 minutes, while others are over 1400 minutes.

So significantly longer are 102, 104, and 105.

Now, I need to find potential root causes for these delays.

I should look at the event sequences and see where the delays occur.

For each case, I can see the time between activities.

Let me list the events for each case with timestamps and compute the time between consecutive events.

Start with Case 101:

Events:

1. Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:00

2. Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10  time since previous: 10 minutes

3. Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 08:20  time since previous: 10 minutes

4. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 09:00  time since previous: 40 minutes

5. Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:00  time since previous: 60 minutes

6. Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 10:15  time since previous: 15 minutes

Total: 135 minutes

Now, the gaps are between Assign and Investigate (40 minutes) and Investigate and Resolve (60 minutes). But overall, it's fast.

Case 102:

Events:

1. Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05

2. Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:30  time since previous: 25 minutes

3. Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00  time since previous: 30 minutes

4. Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 11:30  time since previous: 150 minutes (2.5 hours)

5. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 14:00  time since previous: 150 minutes (2.5 hours)

6. Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:00  time since previous: from Mar 1 14:00 to Mar 2 09:00 is 19 hours? Let's calculate.

From Mar 1 14:00 to Mar 2 09:00. From 14:00 to 24:00 is 10 hours, then from 00:00 to 09:00 is 9 hours, so total 19 hours? But 19 hours = 1140 minutes? But we need time since previous event.

Previous event: Investigate at 14:00 on Mar 1, next event: Resolve at 09:00 on Mar 2.

Time difference: from 14:00 to 24:00 is 10 hours, from 24:00 to 09:00 is 9 hours, so 19 hours = 1140 minutes.

Then:

7. Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15  time since previous: 15 minutes

So, in Case 102, there are long gaps between Assign and Escalate (150 minutes), between Escalate and Investigate (150 minutes), and especially between Investigate and Resolve (1140 minutes).

Also, note that after escalation, investigate happens on the same day but later, and resolve on the next day.

Case 103:

Events:

1. Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:10

2. Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:15  time since previous: 5 minutes

3. Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 08:30  time since previous: 15 minutes

4. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 08:45  time since previous: 15 minutes

5. Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:15  time since previous: 30 minutes

6. Close Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:30  time since previous: 15 minutes

Total: 80 minutes

All steps are quick, no escalation.

Case 104:

Events:

1. Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20

2. Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:00  time since previous: 40 minutes

3. Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:30  time since previous: 30 minutes

4. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 13:00  time since previous: 210 minutes (3.5 hours)

5. Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:00  time since previous: from Mar 1 13:00 to Mar 2 08:00 is 19 hours? Calculate: from 13:00 to 24:00 is 11 hours, from 00:00 to 08:00 is 8 hours, so 19 hours = 1140 minutes

6. Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30  time since previous: 30 minutes

So, long gaps between Assign and Investigate (210 minutes) and between Investigate and Resolve (1140 minutes).

No escalation in this case.

Case 105:

Events:

1. Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25

2. Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:35  time since previous: 10 minutes

3. Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00  time since previous: 25 minutes

4. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 09:10  time since previous: 10 minutes

5. Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 10:00  time since previous: 50 minutes

6. Investigate Issue: 2024-03-02 14:00  time since previous: from Mar 1 10:00 to Mar 2 14:00? Calculate: from Mar 1 10:00 to Mar 2 10:00 is 24 hours, then to 14:00 is 4 hours, so 28 hours? But let's in minutes.

From Mar 1 10:00 to Mar 2 10:00 is 24 hours = 1440 minutes

From Mar 2 10:00 to Mar 2 14:00 is 4 hours = 240 minutes

So total 1680 minutes? But from previous event Escalate at 10:00 Mar 1 to Investigate at 14:00 Mar 2 is exactly 28 hours? From 10:00 Mar 1 to 10:00 Mar 2 is 24 hours, to 14:00 Mar 2 is 4 hours, so 28 hours = 1680 minutes.

Then:

7. Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:00  time since previous: from Mar 2 14:00 to Mar 3 09:00. From Mar 2 14:00 to Mar 3 14:00 is 24 hours, but to 09:00 is 5 hours less, so 24 hours - 5 hours? No.

From Mar 2 14:00 to Mar 3 09:00. From 14:00 to 24:00 on Mar 2 is 10 hours, then from 00:00 to 09:00 on Mar 3 is 9 hours, so total 19 hours? But 19 hours = 1140 minutes? Let's see: from 14:00 to 24:00 is 10 hours, from 00:00 to 09:00 is 9 hours, so 19 hours, yes.

But 19 hours = 1140 minutes.

Then:

8. Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30  time since previous: 30 minutes

So, in Case 105, there is a long gap between Escalate and the second Investigate (1680 minutes) and between Investigate and Resolve (1140 minutes).

Also, note that after escalation, there is a second Investigate activity.

Now, to find root causes, I need to see common factors in the delayed cases.

From the event log, I see that cases with escalations (102 and 105) have long delays, but case 104 has no escalation but still has long delays.

Case 104 has long gaps between Assign and Investigate and between Investigate and Resolve.

Similarly, case 102 has escalations but also long gaps.

Let me list the cases with long total time: 102, 104, 105.

Now, for these, what are the common points?

First, all of them have a long gap between Investigate and Resolve: 1140 minutes for each of 102, 104, and 105. That's about 19 hours.

In case 102, after Investigate, it takes 19 hours to Resolve.

In case 104, after Investigate, it takes 19 hours to Resolve.

In case 105, after the second Investigate, it takes 19 hours to Resolve.

But in case 105, the second Investigate is on Mar 2 14:00, and Resolve on Mar 3 09:00, which is about 19 hours? From 14:00 to 09:00 next day is 19 hours, yes.

Similarly, in case 102, Investigate at 14:00 on Mar 1, Resolve at 09:00 on Mar 2, which is 19 hours.

In case 104, Investigate at 13:00 on Mar 1, Resolve at 08:00 on Mar 2, which is 19 hours? From 13:00 to 08:00 next day is 19 hours? From 13:00 to 24:00 is 11 hours, from 00:00 to 08:00 is 8 hours, so 19 hours, yes.

So, in all delayed cases, there is a consistent 19-hour delay between Investigate and Resolve. This suggests that after investigation, there might be a waiting period or a shift change where resolution happens only the next day.

Similarly, for case 105, between Escalate and Investigate, there is a long delay, but that might be due to escalation process.

Now, for case 104, there is no escalation, but still has delay between Assign and Investigate and between Investigate and Resolve.

Let me see the time of day for these activities.

In case 104, Assign at 09:30, Investigate at 13:00, which is 3.5 hours later. This might be due to lunch break or something, but 3.5 hours is long.

Similarly, in case 102, between Assign and Escalate, there is 150 minutes, which is 2.5 hours.

But the most significant is the 19-hour delay after Investigate.

Now, for case 105, after Escalate, it takes 28 hours to Investigate again, which is even longer.

But in case 105, the first Investigate is at 09:10, then Escalate at 10:00, then second Investigate at 14:00 next day, so the delay after escalation is long.

Now, to find root causes.

Potential factors:

1. Escalation: When tickets are escalated to Level-2 agents, it introduces delays because Level-2 agents might be busy or have different working hours.

2. Long waiting times between activities: For example, between Assign and Investigate, or between Investigate and Resolve.

3. Time of
