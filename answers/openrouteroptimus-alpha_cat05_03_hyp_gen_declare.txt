### 1. Identified Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

- **Contradiction:**
  - **Existence ("C") requires every case to be closed.**
  - **Noncoexistence ("E", ["C"]) states that "E" (Evaluate) and "C" (Close) cannot co-occur in a case.**
    - **Conflict:** If all cases must end with "C" and "E" and "C" can’t both happen for the same case, then cases that include "E" can never be closed—contradictory, since closing is required.

- **Undermined Business Logic:**
  - **Responded Existence ("E", ["A"])—every time "E" occurs, "A" must have previously occurred.**
    - This aligns with typical flow but is rendered moot if "E" cannot co-exist with closure due to above.
  - **Precedence ("C", ["R"])—"C" must be preceded by "R".**
    - Does not enforce the full process flow; permits direct transition from "R" to "C" and skipping all other activities, which is likely unintended.

- **Allowed Undesired Execution Paths:**
  - **Trace in which only "R" and "C" occur is permitted:**
    - This allows cases to be closed immediately after being received, skipping assignment, evaluation, approval, and notification steps.

### 2. Hypotheses for Model Anomalies

- **Misinterpretation of Requirements:**
  - Wrongly believing that evaluation and closure are mutually exclusive, perhaps conflating separate variants or misunderstanding the process.

- **Policy Drift or Inconsistent Updates:**
  - Business rules or regulatory changes may have led to ad hoc additions (such as "noncoexistence") without reviewing the impact on the whole model.

- **Technical/Data Mining Error:**
  - Algorithmic extraction from incomplete or noisy logs, missing traces in which evaluation and closure did co-occur, leading to false constraints.

- **Pressure for Expediency:**
  - Exceptional fast-track claims might have led to constraints enabling the closure of claims without stepping through assignment, evaluation, approval, or notification, which became embedded in the model without proper vetting.

### 3. SQL-Based Investigation Strategies

**A. Claims Closed Without Evaluation (only “R” and “C”, or missing “E”):**
```sql
SELECT
  c.claim_id
FROM
  claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
)
;
```

**B. Claims Where Evaluation and Closing Both Occur (violating noncoexistence):**
```sql
SELECT
  c.claim_id
FROM
  claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
)
AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
)
;
```

**C. Claims Where Evaluation Occurs Without Assignment (responded_existence check):**
```sql
SELECT
  c.claim_id
FROM
  claims c
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
)
;
```

**D. Claims That Skipped Intermediate Steps (e.g., “R” followed directly by “C”):**
```sql
SELECT
  claim_id
FROM (
  SELECT
    ce.claim_id,
    ARRAY_AGG(ce.activity ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS activities
  FROM
    claim_events ce
  GROUP BY
    ce.claim_id
) t
WHERE
  activities = ARRAY['R','C']
;
```

**E. Evaluate Adjuster Assignment Coverage (Does every “E” link to an assigned adjuster?):**
```sql
SELECT
  ce.claim_id,
  ce.event_id
FROM
  claim_events ce
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_a
  ON ce.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
WHERE
  ce.activity = 'E'
  AND ce_a.event_id IS NULL
;
```
