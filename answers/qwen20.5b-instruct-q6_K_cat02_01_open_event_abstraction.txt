Event abstraction is a technique that involves breaking down large processes or events into smaller, more manageable components. This approach allows for better collaboration between team members who are working on the same task, as each component has its own purpose and can be executed independently.
To effectively utilize event abstraction to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs, consider implementing the following strategies:

  * Use clear and descriptive names for events. This helps others in your team understand what each event is related to and how it affects other processes.
  * Implement event tracing to monitor the progress and impact of individual components within a process.
  * Ensure that all components are well-defined and implement clear rules for their actions.
  * Create unit tests and integration tests to verify that the components are functioning correctly within the process.
  * Use automated testing tools to validate the functionality of the components and ensure they meet their expectations.

By implementing these strategies, you can create more manageable processes that require less collaboration and communication between team members. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done by only having to focus on one component at a time, making it easier for teams to iterate on changes and improve the process as needed.
