Here is the comprehensive event log generated from the provided ERP tables.

### Assumptions & Methodology
1.  **Case Identifier**: `order_id` is used as the Case ID.
2.  **Resource Mapping**: Resource IDs (SP, WH, CR, BL) were mapped to their names from the Resources table. Payment methods were used as the resource for Payment events where no specific person was listed.
3.  **Item Descriptions**: Item IDs were enriched with descriptions from the Products table.
4.  **Logic & Sorting**:
    *   Events are sorted first by `Case ID`, then chronologically by `Timestamp`.
    *   **Order 1002**: This case involves split deliveries (two dispatch/arrival pairs) and split invoices. All events are listed chronologically.
    *   **Order 1004**: Data for delivery, invoice, and payment is absent. The log reflects only the available events (Creation and Picking), indicating an incomplete or ongoing process.
    *   **Payment Linking**: Payments were linked to Orders via `invoice_id`.
