Here’s a plausible endtoend narrative of the loan application process, showing how each DECLARE constraint shapes and safeguards it.

1. Customer applies (Receive_Application)  
   – init: the very first event must be Receive_Application.  
   – existence: it must occur at least once.  
   – response: each application immediately triggers a Preliminary_Credit_Check.  
   Realworld: you can’t do anything until you have an application on file.

2. Preliminary credit check (Preliminary_Credit_Check)  
   – exactly_one: you run this check exactly once per application.  
   – succession: once the check completes, you must then Gather_Additional_Documents (see next).  
   Realworld: you get a quick “go/nogo” on creditworthiness before burdening the applicant with paperwork.

3. Document collection (Gather_Additional_Documents)  
   – existence: you must collect any required documents at least once.  
   – coexistence: if you collect docs at all, you must eventually Authorize_Contract_Terms (you won’t collect documents for a file you’ll never approve).  
   – altsuccession: after you’ve gathered docs, you must perform a Quality_Assurance_Review.  
   Realworld: you don’t finalize terms until you’ve seen pay stubs, IDs, etc., and you don’t pass an application until records have been QA’d.

4. Quality assurance review (Quality_Assurance_Review)  
   – altsuccession (from docs) or chainsuccession (from later steps) ensure QA happens before you prepare the final offer.  
   – precedence: QA must happen before any Authorization of Contract Terms.  
   Realworld: compliance teams spotcheck every package for accuracy, regulatory compliance, fraud flags.

5. Authorization of contract terms (Authorize_Contract_Terms)  
   – chainprecedence: you cannot authorize terms until you’ve done the preliminary check.  
   – precedence (in the intended sense): you cannot authorize until QA is done.  
   – coexistence: if you authorize, you must have gathered docs.  
   Realworld: senior officers give final signoff only when all checks are green.

6. Assemble loan offer package (Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package)  
   – chainsuccession: once QA is complete, you assemble interestrates, repayment schedules, disclosures.  
   – responded_existence: every assembled package must lead to at least one QA review (no “backdoor” offers).  
   Realworld: loan operations teams prepare the final offer document, pulling in approved terms.

7. Funds disbursement (Transfer_Funds)  
   – chainresponse: after assembling the package, you must transfer funds.  
   – noncoexistence: you may not reopen a new application once funds have been transferred (no circular “reapply and retransfer” loops).  
   – absence: Proceed_Without_Compliance must never occur—no bypassing all these steps.  
   Realworld: the bank wires or deposits the money only after everything is signed, approved, and logged.

8. Customer notification (Notify_Customer)  
   – altresponse: every Transfer_Funds must be followed by a Notify_Customer.  
   – altprecedence: you may not notify before the money has gone out.  
   – nonsuccession / nonchainsuccession: you cannot slip in a notification before critical checks (e.g., credit check, authorization) are done.  
   Realworld: customers get an email or call telling them “Your loan has been funded,” ensuring transparency and satisfaction.

Underlying motivations  
• Regulatory compliance: “no transfer without QA, docs, credit check” maps to “no money out unless we’ve checked identity, solvency, and internal policies.”  
• Fraud prevention & risk management: layered checks (credit  docs  QA  authorization) make it hard for a bad actor to slip through.  
• Operational best practice: clear handoffs (“after A do B”) avoid lost or forgotten steps.  
• Customer experience: timely notifications and onetime credit checks minimize churn and confusion.

What if you violated the order?  
• Skip credit check  dramatically higher default risk, regulatory fines.  
• Transfer funds too early  possible moneylaundering violations, system reversals.  
• Omit QA or authorization  legal noncompliance, reputational damage.  
• Never notify  angry customers, support escalations, SLA breaches.  
• Invoke Proceed_Without_Compliance  automatic audit flags, system shutdowns.

In sum, the DECLARE constraints carve out a rigid but necessary choreography—from Receive_Application through Preliminary_Credit_Check, Document Gathering, QA, Authorization, Assembly, Fund Transfer, to Customer Notification—ensuring every loan is handled consistently, safely, and in full compliance.
