Here’s a plausible “real-world” enactment of the loan application process implied by your DECLARE model, step by step, with a sketch of how each constraint type keeps things in order and why it matters in practice. At the end I’ll show what can go wrong if you violate these rules.

1. Receive_Application  
   – Enforced by  
     • init(Receive_Application): must be the very first event.  
     • existence(Receive_Application): you can’t proceed without ever seeing an application.  
   – Real-world motive: KYC/AML, audit trail, a clear trigger for everything that follows.

2. Preliminary_Credit_Check  
   – Enforced by  
     • response(Receive_Application  Preliminary_Credit_Check): once you have an application, you must run exactly one credit check.  
     • exactly_one(Preliminary_Credit_Check): no double-checks, no skipping.  
   – Motive: you must assess basic creditworthiness before any further effort or risk is incurred.

3. Gather_Additional_Documents  
   – Enforced by  
     • succession(Preliminary_Credit_Check  Gather_Additional_Documents): immediately after checking credit you collect missing pay stubs, IDs, etc.  
     • existence(Gather_Additional_Documents): you cannot ignore this step entirely.  
     • coexistence(Gather_Additional_Documents  Authorize_Contract_Terms): if you gather docs you’re committed to completing the approval later.  
   – Motive: regulatory compliance (e.g. proof of income), fraud prevention, complete file.

4. Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  
   – Enforced by  
     • responded_existence(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Quality_Assurance_Review): as soon as you build the package of rates, fees and legal text, you must queue it for QA.  
     • chainsuccession(Quality_Assurance_Review  Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package): QA and assembly happen back-to-back—no other steps in between.  
   – Motive: operational best practice, minimize rework, ensure consistency.

5. Quality_Assurance_Review  
   – Enforced by  
     • precedence(Quality_Assurance_Review  Authorize_Contract_Terms): the offer may only be authorized if it has passed QA first.  
     • chainprecedence(Authorize_Contract_Terms immediately after Quality_Assurance_Review): no “back-door” signing.  
   – Motive: compliance check, legal sign-off, institutional governance.

6. Authorize_Contract_Terms  
   – Enforced by  
     • coexistence (with Gather_Additional_Documents): you can’t authorize unless you did your due diligence on docs.  
   – Motive: risk management, executive sign-off.

7. Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer  
   – Enforced by  
     • altresponse(Transfer_Funds  Notify_Customer) & altprecedence(Notify_Customer  Transfer_Funds): every disbursement triggers a customer notice—and conversely you can’t notify without a disbursement.  
     • altsuccession: they form a guaranteed pair, in that order.  
     • chainresponse(Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package  Transfer_Funds): in some very lean setups you might automate funds-transfer immediately once the offer is assembled—QA and authorization having already been “baked in” by earlier constraints.  
   – Motive: customer satisfaction, SLAs, closing the loop.

Global Guardrails  
– absence(Proceed_Without_Compliance): you may never skip or shortcut mandatory checks.  
– noncoexistence(Transfer_Funds  Receive_Application): once you disburse, you can’t treat that same case as a fresh application again.  
– nonsuccession(Notify_Customer  Preliminary_Credit_Check) & nonchainsuccession(Authorize_Contract_Terms  Notify_Customer): forbid “we tell you the outcome before we even check your credit” or “signing then immediate notification without funds” loops.

What if you break the rules?  
- Skip the credit check or docsgathering  you expose the bank to undiscovered defaults, fraud and AML fines.  
- Omit QA or authorization  you risk mispriced loans, legal non-compliance and massive remediation costs.  
- Disburse funds before checks are done  huge fraud risk and regulatory violation.  
- Fail to notify the customer in a timely, ordered way  poor customer experience, reputational damage, SLA breaches.  
- Proceed_Without_Compliance ever occurs  immediate red flag, potential regulatory enforcement action or license revocation.

In short, each DECLARE constraint corresponds to a business or regulatory policy that (a) prevents dangerous shortcuts, (b) enforces a clear, auditable sequence of checks, and (c) ties off the process with correct hand-offs and customer communication. Violate any of them and you trade speed or convenience for legal, financial and reputational peril.
