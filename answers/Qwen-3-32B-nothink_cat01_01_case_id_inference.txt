To infer the **case groupings** (i.e., which events belong to the same patient journey), we can use the following **attributes and logical reasoning**:

---

###  **Key Observations for Grouping Events**:

1. **`patient_age` and `patient_gender`** must match across events for the same case.
2. **`department`** and **`activity`** sequences often follow logical patient pathways (e.g., ER  Radiology  ER again).
3. **`timestamp`** helps with ordering and identifying when a new case might start.
4. **`additional_info`** (e.g., `insurance`, `triage_code`, `reason`, `followup`) can provide context and help distinguish cases.
5. **Events like `Register patient`**, `Doctor consultation`, and `Patient discharged` are typically the **start**, **middle**, and **end** of a case.

###  **Inferred Groupings (Cases)**

We now group the events by case based on the above criteria:

---

#### **Case 1: Male, 45 years old, ER (Trauma Pathway)**
- 1. `Register patient` (ER)
- 4. `Initial triage` (ER)
- 7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology)
- 12. `Doctor consultation` (ER)
- 15. `Patient discharged` (ER)

**Key attributes:**
- `patient_age` = 45
- `patient_gender` = M
- `department` = ER (mostly)
- `activity` flows: registration  triage  imaging  doctor  discharge

---

#### **Case 2: Female, 62 years old, ER (Minor Infection Pathway)**
- 2. `Register patient` (ER)
- 5. `Initial triage` (ER)
- 8. `Lab test requested` (ER)
- 10. `Lab test completed` (Lab)
- 11. `Doctor consultation` (ER)
- 14. `Prescription created` (ER)
- 17. `Patient discharged` (ER)

**Key attributes:**
- `patient_age` = 62
- `patient_gender` = F
- `department` = ER (mostly)
- `activity` flows: registration  triage  lab  doctor  prescription  discharge

---

#### **Case 3: Male, 28 years old, Surgery (Surgery Pathway)**
- 3. `Register patient` (Surgery)
- 6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery)
- 9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery)
- 13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery)
- 16. `Recovery room` (Surgery)
- 18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery)

**Key attributes:**
- `patient_age` = 28
- `patient_gender` = M
- `department` = Surgery (entire case)
- `activity` flows: registration  consultation  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge

---

###  **Final Grouped Cases**

| Case ID | Patient Age | Gender | Department | Events Involved |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Case 1** | 45 | M | ER | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 |
| **Case 2** | 62 | F | ER | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 |
| **Case 3** | 28 | M | Surgery | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 |

---

###  **Summary**

- **3 distinct cases** were identified based on patient attributes and logical event flow.
- No explicit case ID was in the data, but we could infer it by tracking consistent `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and department/activity sequences.

Let me know if you'd like a **visual timeline** or **BPMN-style process map** for any of the cases!
