### **High-Level Process Step Grouping for Manufacturing Event Log**

Based on the provided event log, we can group the low-level events into meaningful high-level process steps. Below is the proposed grouping, along with justifications and names for each aggregated step.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Justification:**
- These events are all related to preparing the raw material for further processing.
- They occur at the start of the workflow and involve handling, positioning, and preheating the metal sheet.
- The same resource (Operator A and Robot Arm #2) is involved in most of these steps, indicating a cohesive phase.

---

### **2. Assembly (Welding)**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Justification:**
- These events involve the actual assembly of the product (welding).
- They are performed by the same operator (Operator B) and follow logically from tool pickup to welding.
- This is a distinct phase where the product is physically constructed.

---

### **3. Quality Inspection (Welding)**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Justification:**
- This is a quality check step that ensures the welding was performed correctly.
- It occurs immediately after welding, making it part of the assembly verification process.

---

### **4. Surface Treatment (Coating)**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Justification:**
- These events involve applying and curing a protective layer on the product.
- They are performed by specialized equipment (Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2).
- This is a distinct phase where the product is finished for durability.

---

### **5. Final Quality Inspection**
**Included Low-Level Events:**
- Visual check

**Justification:**
- This is the last step before the product is considered complete.
- It ensures the final product meets quality standards.
- Performed by a different operator (Operator C), indicating a separate verification phase.

### **Structured Representation of High-Level Activities**

| **High-Level Activity**       | **Low-Level Events Included**                          | **Justification**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**      | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet | Initial handling and preparation of raw material.                                |
| **Assembly (Welding)**        | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B    | Physical construction of the product via welding.                              |
| **Quality Inspection (Welding)** | Measure weld integrity                              | Verification of welding quality.                                                 |
| **Surface Treatment (Coating)** | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                | Application and curing of protective coating.                                   |
| **Final Quality Inspection**  | Visual check                                          | Final visual verification before completion.                                      |

### **Key Observations for Generalization**
1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events that occur close together in time are likely part of the same high-level step.
2. **Resource Consistency:** If the same resource (operator/machine) performs multiple events, they likely belong to the same phase.
3. **Logical Flow:** Events that follow a natural sequence (e.g., pickup tool  use tool  inspect result) should be grouped.
4. **Domain Knowledge:** Understanding manufacturing processes helps in naming steps meaningfully (e.g., "Welding" vs. "Assembly").

This grouping allows for a clearer understanding of the manufacturing workflow while preserving the essential details of the process.
