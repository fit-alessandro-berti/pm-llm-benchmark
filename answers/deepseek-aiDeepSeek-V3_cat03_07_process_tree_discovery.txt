Based on the provided event log, the process tree should capture the main sequence of activities, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival. Here is the final process tree structure:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> (
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            * (
                tau,
                -> (
                    'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                    'Validate Form (VF)'
                )
            ),
            -> (
                'Approval Decision (AD)',
                -> (
                    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
                    'Archive Case (AC)'
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Sequence (`->`)**:
   - The process starts with `Receive Application (RA)`.
   - This is followed by `Validate Form (VF)`.
   - Then, `Assess Eligibility (AE)` is executed.

2. **Optional Repeating Loop (`*`)**:
   - After `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there is a loop (`*`) that allows for the optional repetition of requesting missing information and re-validation.
   - The loop starts with a silent step (`tau`), indicating the possibility of exiting the loop.
   - If the loop continues, it executes `Request Missing Info (RMI)` followed by `Validate Form (VF)`.

3. **Final Sequence (`->`)**:
   - After exiting the loop, the process continues with `Approval Decision (AD)`.
   - This is followed by `Send Confirmation (SC)`.
   - Finally, the process ends with `Archive Case (AC)`.

This process tree captures the main flow of activities, the optional repeating loop for handling missing information, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival of the case.
