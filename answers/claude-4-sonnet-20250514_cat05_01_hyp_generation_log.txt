Looking at this order event log data, I can identify several concerning anomalies and process deviations that warrant investigation. Let me analyze the patterns and propose SQL queries to investigate further.

## Identified Anomalies

### 1. **Sequence Violations and Missing Critical Steps**
- **Case 1002**: Ships goods before performing credit check or stock validation
- **Case 1003**: Missing stock validation entirely
- **Case 1004**: Payment received before invoice issued, missing credit check and stock validation

### 2. **Temporal Anomalies**
- **Case 1002**: Ships goods only 20 minutes after order registration
- **Case 1003**: Ships goods before confirming shipment
- **Case 1004**: Payment received 5 minutes after order registration

### 3. **Control Gaps**
- Multiple cases bypass mandatory risk controls (credit checks, stock validation)
- Post-facto confirmations and validations

## Investigative SQL Queries

### Query 1: Identify cases with missing critical control activities
```sql
-- Find orders missing mandatory control steps
WITH mandatory_activities AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Register Order'
),
control_checks AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_stock_validation
    FROM order_event_log 
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT m.case_id, 
       c.has_credit_check, 
       c.has_stock_validation,
       o.order_value,
       o.order_type
FROM mandatory_activities m
LEFT JOIN control_checks c ON m.case_id = c.case_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON m.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE c.has_credit_check = 0 OR c.has_stock_validation = 0
ORDER BY o.order_value DESC;
```

### Query 2: Detect sequence violations in critical process steps
```sql
-- Identify cases where goods are shipped before completing prerequisite checks
WITH activity_timestamps AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) as ship_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN timestamp END) as credit_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) as stock_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN timestamp END) as confirm_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT case_id,
       ship_time,
       credit_time,
       stock_time,
       confirm_time,
       CASE 
           WHEN ship_time < credit_time OR credit_time IS NULL THEN 'Shipped before credit check'
           WHEN ship_time < stock_time OR stock_time IS NULL THEN 'Shipped before stock validation'
           WHEN ship_time < confirm_time OR confirm_time IS NULL THEN 'Shipped before confirmation'
       END as violation_type
FROM activity_timestamps
WHERE ship_time IS NOT NULL 
  AND (ship_time < credit_time OR credit_time IS NULL 
       OR ship_time < stock_time OR stock_time IS NULL
       OR ship_time < confirm_time OR confirm_time IS NULL);
```

### Query 3: Analyze unusually fast processing times
```sql
-- Find cases with suspiciously short processing times
WITH case_durations AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MIN(timestamp) as start_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) as ship_time,
           COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as activity_count
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT cd.case_id,
       cd.start_time,
       cd.ship_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cd.ship_time - cd.start_time))/60 as processing_minutes,
       cd.activity_count,
       o.order_value,
       o.order_type
FROM case_durations cd
JOIN orders o ON cd.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cd.ship_time - cd.start_time))/60 < 60  -- Less than 1 hour
ORDER BY processing_minutes ASC;
```

### Query 4: Investigate payment-before-invoice anomalies
```sql
-- Detect cases where payment is received before invoice is issued
WITH payment_invoice_timing AS (
    SELECT case_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN timestamp END) as payment_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN timestamp END) as invoice_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN additional_info END) as payment_info
    FROM order_event_log
    WHERE activity IN ('Receive Payment', 'Issue Invoice')
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT pit.case_id,
       pit.payment_time,
       pit.invoice_time,
       pit.payment_info,
       o.order_value,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (pit.invoice_time - pit.payment_time))/60 as minutes_diff
FROM payment_invoice_timing pit
JOIN orders o ON pit.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE pit.payment_time < pit.invoice_time
ORDER BY minutes_diff DESC;
```

### Query 5: Analyze resource behavior patterns for policy violations
```sql
-- Identify resources involved in process violations and their departments
WITH violation_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id 
    FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE case_id IN (
        SELECT case_id FROM (
            SELECT case_id,
                   MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit,
                   MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_stock
            FROM order_event_log 
            GROUP BY case_id
        ) sub WHERE has_credit = 0 OR has_stock = 0
    )
)
SELECT oel.resource,
       r.role,
       r.department,
       COUNT(*) as violation_count,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT oel.activity, ', ') as activities_performed,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT oel.case_id::text, ', ') as case_ids
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN violation_cases vc ON oel.case_id = vc.case_id
LEFT JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY oel.resource, r.role, r.department
ORDER BY violation_count DESC;
```

### Query 6: Check for high-value orders with insufficient controls
```sql
-- Examine control bypass patterns for high-value orders
SELECT o.case_id,
       o.order_value,
       o.order_type,
       MAX(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_credit_check,
       MAX(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_stock_check,
       MIN(oel.timestamp) as order_start,
       MAX(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN oel.timestamp END) as ship_time,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT oel.resource, ', ') as involved_resources
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
WHERE o.order_value > 1500  -- Focus on higher value orders
GROUP BY o.case_id, o.order_value, o.order_type
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    OR MAX(CASE WHEN oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
ORDER BY o.order_value DESC;
```

## Hypotheses for Investigation

1. **System Integration Issues**: The payment-before-invoice pattern suggests possible ERP system integration problems
2. **Emergency Override Procedures**: Fast processing might indicate use of emergency procedures without proper documentation
3. **Training Deficiencies**: Resources may not understand mandatory process sequences
4. **Fraud Risk**: Deliberate control bypasses, especially for high-value orders
5. **Process Design Flaws**: The system may allow activities to proceed without proper prerequisites
6. **Resource Capacity Issues**: Staff shortcuts due to workload pressures

These queries will help identify patterns of non-compliance, resource accountability, and potential systemic issues requiring process redesign or additional controls.
