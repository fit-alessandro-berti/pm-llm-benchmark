## **Key Distinguishing Factors:**

1. **Patient Demographics:** Age (45M, 62F, 28M) and gender remain consistent within each case
2. **Department Flow:** Cases 1 & 2 follow ER pathways; Case 3 follows surgical pathway
3. **Temporal Logic:** Events follow logical clinical sequences within each case
4. **Clinical Context:** Each case has distinct diagnoses/procedures (fracture, infection, knee surgery)
5. **Resource Continuity:** Same doctors/staff tend to handle the same patient (e.g., Dr. Smith with 62F patient)
