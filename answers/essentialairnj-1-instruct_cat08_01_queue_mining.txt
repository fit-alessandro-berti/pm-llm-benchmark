```python
# Code logic is more textual approach as provided scenario is conceptual and no actual event log is provided.
# This is a text model and the code is only the result of a conceptual walkthrough.
# Potential code could involve pandas dataframes, numpy for calculation, or data visualization.

# Example of conceptual python code skeleton

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming event_log_df is the DataFrame with event log data
# event_log_df = pd.read_csv(event_log_file_path)

# Queue Identification and Characterization
event_log_df['Waiting Time'] = event_log_df.sort_values(by=['Case ID', 'Timestamp']).groupby('Case ID')['Timestamp'].diff()
event_log_df['Queuing Period'] = (event_log_df['Timestamp Type'] == 'START').astype(int).groupby(event_log_df['Case ID']).diff().ne(0).astype(int).groupby(event_log_df['Case ID']).cumsum()

queue_summary = event_log_df.groupby(['Case ID', 'Queuing Period']).agg({
    'Waiting Time': ['mean', 'median', 'max', 'quantile_90']
}).reset_index()

most_critical_queues = queue_summary[queue_summary['Waiting Time'].apply(lambda x: x['max']).idxmax()][['Case ID', 'Queuing Period', 'Waiting Time']]

# Root Cause Analysis
# (implemented strategies to identify root causes using event_log_df)

# Data-Driven Optimization Strategies
def reduce_registration_queue():
    # Example: Adjust staffing levels or appointment scheduling
    # Assuming optimized_staff_schedule and optimized_appointments are functions that leverage the event log data
    optimized_staff_schedule = adjust_staffing_staff_log(event_log_df)
    optimized_appointments = adjust_appointments_policy(event_log_df)
    return optimized_staff_schedule, optimized_appointments

def optimize_resource_allocations():
    # Example: Enhance resource allocation or deployment with tools,
    # using metrics derived from the event log like service times or separate resource logs
    resource_allocations = improve_resource_planning(event_log_df)
    return resource_allocations

def implement_coordination_mechanism():
    # Example: Introduce a department manager or healthcare professional who oversees process
    # and seeks to resolve bottlenecks with data insights
    coordination_mechanism = introduce_control_process(event_log_df)
    return coordination_mechanism

# Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints
# Various points to consider, possibly comparing strategies' pros and cons

# Measuring Success
def get_kpi():
    kpis = {
        'Average Waiting Time': calculate_average_wait_time(),
        'Visit Duration': calculate_visit_duration(),
        'Throughput': calculate_throughput()
    }
    return kpis

# Using Process Mining techniques to monitor KPIs
# event_log_df can be continuously updated and analyzed to track KPI progress

**Note:** The solution above provides an example structure for how one might approach the implementation of the given problem. It is important to remember that the original event log data is conceptual, and the solution would need specific data processing and analysis to implement the answered questions accurately. The given solution is a high-level conceptual answer detailing how one might approach the problem using Python with pandas and numpy, assuming proper data is available.
