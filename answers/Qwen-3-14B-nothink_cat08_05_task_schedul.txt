# **Advanced Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc. Using Process Mining and Data-Driven Techniques**

---

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **Reconstructing Job and Task Flow Using Process Mining**

To reconstruct the *actual* flow of jobs and tasks, we would leverage **process mining techniques** such as **Conformance Checking**, **Process Discovery**, and **Event Log Analysis**. Using the detailed MES logs, we can:

- **Map process models** using **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristics Miner**, or **Inductive Miner** to discover the actual process flow across the shop floor.
- **Discover task sequences** per job, identifying deviations from ideal routes or standard operating procedures.
- **Visualize process variants** to understand how different job routings affect scheduling and performance.

### **Key Metrics and Techniques for Analysis**

#### **a. Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Use **case-level analysis** to compute:
  - **Lead time** (from job release to completion)
  - **Cycle time** (from start of first task to completion)
  - **Makespan** (total time to complete all jobs in a period)
- **Statistical Analysis:** Use **histograms, box plots, and quantile analysis** to understand the distribution of these times and identify outliers.

#### **b. Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Work Centers**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Extract **event logs** and compute **waiting times** between:
  - **Queue Entry** and **Task Start** for each task.
- **Aggregation:** Group by **machine/resource**, to identify:
  - **Average waiting times**
  - **Peak queue times**
  - **Workload imbalance** across machines

#### **c. Resource Utilization: Productive, Idle, and Setup Times**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Use **resource-centric analysis** to compute:
  - **Total time** per resource
  - **Productive time** (actual task execution)
  - **Setup time** (sequence-dependent)
  - **Idle time** (waiting for jobs)
- **Utilization Rate:** Calculate as:
  $$
  \text{Utilization} = \frac{\text{Productive + Setup Time}}{\text{Total Time}} \times 100
  $$

#### **d. Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Identify **setup events** and link them to **previous job** and **current job** using:
  - **Event logs with `Previous Job`** field
  - **Setup Duration** and **Setup Required** flags
- **Analysis:**
  - Build a **setup time matrix** for each machine: $ S_{ij} = $ setup time from job $ i $ to job $ j $
  - Use **clustering or similarity analysis** to group jobs with similar setup requirements
  - Use **regression or ML models** to predict setup times based on job features (material, geometry, etc.)

#### **e. Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Calculate **tardiness** per job as:
  $$
  \text{Tardiness} = \max(0, \text{Completion Time} - \text{Due Date})
  $$
- **Analysis:**
  - **Tardiness distribution** across job priorities
  - **On-time delivery rate** per work center
  - **Tardiness correlation with setup delays, queue times, and disruptions**

#### **f. Impact of Disruptions (Breakdowns, Priority Changes)**
- **Process Mining Technique:** Use **event correlation analysis** to:
  - Identify **disruption events** (e.g., breakdowns, hot jobs)
  - Trace **causal paths** from disruption to downstream delays
  - Use **temporal analysis** to quantify **delay propagation** and **recovery time**
- **Tools:** **Temporal Process Mining** (e.g., **Temporal Miner**), **Event Sequence Analysis**

---

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **Key Pathologies Identified via Process Mining**

#### **a. Bottleneck Resources and Throughput Impact**
- **Bottleneck Identification:** Use **resource-centric analysis** to:
  - Compute **utilization rates** and **queue lengths**
  - Identify **machines with 100% utilization** or **high waiting times**
- **Impact:** Bottlenecks delay downstream jobs, increasing **WIP and lead times**

#### **b. Poor Task Prioritization**
- **Analysis:**
  - Compare **priority-based dispatching** (e.g., EDD, priority tags) with **actual job completion order**
  - Use **variant analysis** to compare **on-time vs. late jobs** in terms of scheduling decisions
- **Evidence:** High-priority jobs may be delayed due to **queueing behind lower-priority jobs** with longer task durations

#### **c. Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Times**
- **Analysis:**
  - Use **setup time matrix** to identify **inefficient job sequences**
  - Compare **actual setup durations** with **predicted or average durations**
  - Use **clustering analysis** to group jobs with similar setups and suggest **batching or sequencing strategies**
- **Evidence:** Jobs with similar setups are processed non-consecutively, increasing **setup overhead**

#### **d. Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- **Analysis:**
  - Use **process flow visualization** to trace **job flow** and identify **upstream delays** causing **downstream starvation**
  - Use **queue time analysis** to detect **asynchronous flow** between work centers
- **Evidence:** Bottlenecks in upstream stages cause **starvation in downstream machines**, increasing **WIP and lead time**

#### **e. Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels**
- **Analysis:**
  - Use **WIP time series analysis** and **process variant analysis** to identify:
    - **Unpredictable WIP fluctuations**
    - **Scheduling variability** causing **inventory buildup**
- **Evidence:** Scheduling decisions based on **local dispatching rules** lead to **WIP peaks and troughs**, increasing **holding costs and variability**

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **Potential Root Causes**

#### **a. Static Dispatching Rules in a Dynamic Environment**
- **Cause:** Rules like **FCFS** or **EDD** are **static** and do **not adapt** to **real-time changes** (e.g., breakdowns, hot jobs)
- **Process Mining Insight:** Show **deviations** between **planned vs. actual job sequences**, especially under disruptions

#### **b. Lack of Real-Time Visibility**
- **Cause:** Work centers operate **in isolation**, without **global visibility** of:
  - Machine availability
  - Queue lengths
  - Job priorities
- **Process Mining Insight:** Use **event logs** to trace **job progress** and **resource allocation** in real-time

#### **c. Inaccurate Task Duration and Setup Time Estimations**
- **Cause:** Scheduling is based on **planned durations**, not **actual durations** or **setup times**
- **Process Mining Insight:** Use **actual vs. planned duration analysis** to quantify **estimation errors** and **setup overheads**

#### **d. Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- **Cause:** No **setup optimization** or **job batching** strategy
- **Process Mining Insight:** Use **setup time matrix** to identify **setup inefficiencies** and **job similarity groups**

#### **e. Poor Coordination Between Work Centers**
- **Cause:** No **inter-machine coordination** or **pull-based scheduling**
- **Process Mining Insight:** Use **process variant analysis** and **flow time analysis** to identify **inefficiencies in inter-machine coordination**

#### **f. Inadequate Response to Disruptions**
- **Cause:** No **disruption response protocols** or **dynamic re-scheduling**
- **Process Mining Insight:** Use **event correlation analysis** to trace **disruption impact** and **recovery delays**
