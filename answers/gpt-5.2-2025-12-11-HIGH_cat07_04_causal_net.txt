The visualization is a workflow/process model (drawn in a Petrinet/workflownet style) showing how a “request” is handled from start to end.

### Main process flow
- **a – “register request”**: the process starts here.
- From **a**, the request can proceed to different handling activities:
  - **b – “examine thoroughly”**
  - **c – “examine casually”**
  - **d – “check ticket”**
- There is also a rework/loop path involving:
  - **f – “reinitiate request”**, which feeds back into earlier steps (indicating the request may be restarted and reprocessed).
- The paths converge into **e – “decide”**.
- After **e**, the process branches to an outcome:
  - **g – “pay compensation”** or
  - **h – “reject request”**
- Both outcomes lead to **z – “end”**.

### Notation / legend
In the lower-right, a legend explains the black-dot routing constructs used in the diagram:
- **XOR-split / XOR-join**: exclusive choice / merge (one path).
- **AND-split / AND-join**: parallel branching / synchronization (all paths).
- **OR-split / OR-join**: inclusive branching / merge (one or more paths).

Black dots act as split/join connectors between the rounded activity boxes, indicating where the flow branches, merges, or synchronizes.
