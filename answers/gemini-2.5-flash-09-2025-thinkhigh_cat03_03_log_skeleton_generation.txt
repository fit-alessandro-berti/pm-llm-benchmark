This Log Skeleton captures the primary sequential flow (logistics) and the necessary causal links (financial tracking) of the described order fulfillment process.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one.
    # Assumption: If an order is Received (RO), it must eventually be Dispatched (D).
    # Assumption: If an Invoice is generated (IC), Payment must eventually be Recorded (RP).
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously.
    # Assumption: Recording Payment (RP) logically requires the Invoice (IC) to have been generated first.
    'always_before': {
        ('RP', 'IC')
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events.
    # Assumption: Invoicing (IC) occurs only after the physical dispatch (D) has occurred.
    'always_after': {
        ('D', 'IC')
    },

    # The two activities cannot co-exist inside the same case.
    # In a standard success flow, all activities must occur, so none are mutually exclusive.
    'never_together': set(),

    # Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case.
    # Assumption: A typical successful fulfillment process executes each step exactly once.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # Receive Order
        'CA': {1},  # Check Availability
        'RI': {1},  # Reserve Items
        'PI': {1},  # Pick Items
        'QC': {1},  # Quality Check
        'PO': {1},  # Pack Order
        'GSL': {1}, # Generate Shipping Label
        'D': {1},   # Dispatch
        'IC': {1},  # Invoice Customer
        'RP': {1}   # Record Payment
    },

    # If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after.
    # This captures the strict sequential logistics flow.
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),  # Receive Order -> Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),  # Check Availability -> Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),  # Reserve Items -> Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),  # Pick Items -> Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),  # Quality Check -> Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'), # Pack Order -> Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D')   # Generate Shipping Label -> Dispatch
    }
}
