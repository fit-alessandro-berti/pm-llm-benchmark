### **Labeled Activities and Process Mining Analysis**

We analyze the provided event log step-by-step to identify patterns that correspond to different manufacturing activities. We will group events based on changes in sensor values over time and assign meaningful labels accordingly.

#### **1. Events 1–3: Machine Startup / Idle State**
**Events:** 1, 2, 3  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:00 – 08:00:10  
**Labels:** *Idle / Initialization*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Low temperature (~20–21°C)
- Minimal vibration (0 Hz)
- No material flow (0 units/s)
- Tool at rest (0 mm)
- Stable low energy consumption (~0.40–0.45 kWh)

**Rationale:**
These initial readings suggest the machine is idle or initializing—no active operations are occurring. The system is likely warming up or waiting for a command.

---

#### **2. Events 4–6: Cutting / Shaping Operation**
**Events:** 4, 5, 6  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:15 – 08:00:25  
**Label:** *Cutting Metal*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Rapid increase in temperature (from 20°C to 58°C)
- Vibration rises significantly (0 to 38 Hz)
- Material flow starts and remains steady (5 units/s)
- Tool position increases steadily (0 to 10 mm)
- Energy usage jumps from ~0.5 kWh to 3.0 kWh

**Rationale:**
The sharp rise in temperature and vibration indicates mechanical work being performed—likely cutting or shaping. The consistent material flow and increasing tool position support this interpretation.

---

#### **3. Events 7–8: Transition / Positioning Phase**
**Events:** 7, 8  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:30 – 08:00:35  
**Label:** *Tool Adjustment / Positioning*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Temperature drops slightly (58°C  40°C)
- Vibration decreases (38 Hz  10 Hz)
- Material flow reduces (5  2 units/s)
- Tool position increases further (10  15 mm)
- Energy stabilizes at ~2.0 kWh

**Rationale:**
This appears to be a transition phase where the machine adjusts its tooling or prepares for the next operation. The drop in vibration and temperature suggests reduced activity, but the tool continues to move into position.

---

#### **4. Events 9: High-Energy Operation**
**Events:** 9  
**Timestamp:** 08:00:40  
**Label:** *Welding or Joining*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Temperature peaks sharply (40°C  80°C)
- Vibration moderate (50 Hz)
- No material flow (0 units/s)
- Tool remains fixed (15 mm)
- Energy consumption spikes to 5.0 kWh

**Rationale:**
A sudden rise in temperature with no material flow and fixed tool position strongly suggests a localized high-energy process like welding or joining. The high vibration could indicate mechanical stress during the weld.

---

#### **5. Events 10: Cool-down / Reset**
**Events:** 10  
**Timestamp:** 08:00:45  
**Label:** *Cool-down / Post-Weld Reset*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Sharp drop in temperature (80°C  30°C)
- Vibration nearly ceases (50 Hz  1 Hz)
- No material flow
- Tool position unchanged
- Energy dips to 1.0 kWh

**Rationale:**
Following the high-energy welding phase, the system rapidly cools down and reduces power, indicating a reset or stabilization period before the next task.

---

#### **6. Events 11–12: Feeding or Assembling**
**Events:** 11, 12  
**Timestamps:** 08:00:50 – 08:00:55  
**Label:** *Assembling Components / Feeding*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Steady temperature (~25°C)
- Low vibration (5 Hz)
- Low but consistent material flow (1 unit/s)
- Tool moves to new position (15  20 mm)
- Gradual increase in energy (1.0  1.6 kWh)

**Rationale:**
This phase shows controlled, low-intensity activity, likely feeding components or beginning an assembly process. The movement of the tool and minimal resource use align with such tasks.

---

#### **7. Events 13–15: Return to Idle**
**Events:** 13, 14, 15  
**Timestamps:** 08:01:00 – 08:01:10  
**Label:** *Return to Idle / Shutdown*

**Sensor Observations:**
- Temperature returns to baseline (25°C  20–21°C)
- Vibration stops (5 Hz  0 Hz)
- No material flow
- Tool retracts to zero position
- Energy consumption returns to ~0.40–0.50 kWh

**Rationale:**
The final events show the machine returning to its idle state. All operational parameters return to baseline levels, indicating completion of the process cycle.
