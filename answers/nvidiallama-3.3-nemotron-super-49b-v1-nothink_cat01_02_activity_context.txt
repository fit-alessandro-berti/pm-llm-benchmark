### **Task 4: Justification for Naming Choices**

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Initial Document Verification**: Clearly indicates the first step in document checking, setting the baseline for the customer's request.
   - **Re-verification of Documents**: Highlight's the activity's purpose in double-checking after updates, emphasizing the iterative nature of verification.

2. **Call Customer**:
   - **Request Missing Documents via Call (C001)**: Specifies the call's objective in the context of C001, distinguishing it from other call purposes.
   - **Clarification/Coordination Call (C002, C003)**: A broader title that encapsulates the various reasons for these calls (clarification, follow-up, coordination), reflecting their adaptive nature in different scenarios.
