 In this BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram, the tasks can be inferred from the `sequenceFlow` elements. However, as there is no explicit task element defined in the provided XML snippet, I'll label each connection as a task for simplicity. Here's a list of tasks based on the sequence flows:

1. Task 0: Start Event (assumed)
2. Task 1: From `sequenceFlow` with id "idid37d193f5-4ea8-4878-89d3-a8bf304b282d"
3. Task 2: From `sequenceFlow` with id "idide522380c-6a5f-4483-b6b2-13869776e4d5"
4. Task 3: From `sequenceFlow` with id "ididd401aa5b-8c47-4ee7-a629-375e3f4270b4"
5. Task 4: From `sequenceFlow` with id "ididf3264316-df43-4e89-96d6-af7e56e8f3d3"
6. Task 5: From `sequenceFlow` with id "idid70cba5cf-d9af-4bd9-bc9f-7906c7b9b8d8"
7. Task 6: From `sequenceFlow` with id "ididd394604e4-1b8f-4346-b194-39938251ad53"
8. Task 7: From `sequenceFlow` with id "idid956cfd06-9c43-470d-aed0-2f7fc30a1af7"
9. Task 8: To `sequenceFlow` with id "idide522380c-6a5f-4483-b6b2-13869776e4d5" (assumed End Event)
