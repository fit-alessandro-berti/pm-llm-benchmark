The attributes that are sensitive for fairness are:

  * Gender (Male)
  * Religious affiliation (Christian)
  * German speaking ability
  * German citizenship

These attributes are sensitive because they are related to demographic characteristics that could potentially lead to bias in the selection process. For example, if the organization prefers to hire candidates who are male, Christian, or fluent in German, this could lead to discrimination against candidates who do not fit into those categories. Similarly, if the organization prefers to hire candidates who are German citizens, this could lead to discrimination against non-German citizens. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these attributes are not used in the selection process, in order to avoid bias and promote fairness.
