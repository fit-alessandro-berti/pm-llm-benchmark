2. **CommunityGroup**: Whether the applicant is associated with a community group.
3. **ScoreAdjustment**: Any adjustment made to the preliminary score based on community affiliation.
4. **FinalDecision**: The outcome of the application.

### Analysis of Bias

1. **LocalResident Attribute**:
   - Group A applicants are all non-local residents (`FALSE`), while Group B applicants are all local residents (`TRUE`).
   - The event logs do not explicitly mention how local residency affects the decision-making process. However, the fact that all Group A applicants are non-local residents and all Group B applicants are local residents raises the question of whether local residency is a factor in the approval process.

2. **CommunityGroup Attribute**:
   - For Group B, applicants associated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 score adjustment, which is not available to Group A applicants.
   - This score adjustment is explicitly mentioned for U001 and U003 in Group B, but there is no such adjustment for Group A applicants.

3. **ScoreAdjustment**:
   - Group A applicants do not receive any score adjustments, while Group B applicants associated with a community group receive a +10 score adjustment.
   - This score adjustment can significantly impact the final decision, as it raises the preliminary score from 720 to 730 for U001 and from 695 to 705 for U003, potentially affecting their eligibility for approval.

4. **FinalDecisions**:
   - In Group A, one of the applicants (P002) is rejected, while the other two (P001 and P003) are approved.
   - In Group B, one of the applicants (U002) is rejected, while the other two (U001 and U003) are approved.
   - The rejection of U002, who is a local resident but not associated with any community group, contrasts with the approval of U001 and U003, who are both local residents and community group members. This suggests that being a member of a community group has a significant positive impact on the final decision.

### Manifestation of Bias

The event logs suggest a form of **institutional bias** where applicants from the Unprotected Group (Group B) who are local residents and members of community groups are given preferential treatment through score adjustments. This bias manifests in the following ways:

1. **Score Adjustment Based on Community Affiliation**:
   - Group B applicants who are members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 score adjustment, which is not available to Group A applicants or Group B applicants who are not part of a community group.
   - This score adjustment can significantly influence the final decision, making it easier for Group B applicants to achieve an approving score.

2. **LocalResident Advantage**:
   - All Group B applicants are local residents, and their applications are generally approved, while Group A applicants, who are not local residents, do not receive the same benefits and are less likely to be approved.
   - This suggests that local residency may play a role in the approval process, potentially at the expense of non-local residents.

3. **Systematic Differences in Final Decisions**:
   - The final decisions reflect the systematic differences in score adjustments and community group affiliations. Group B applicants are more likely to be approved, especially if they are part of a community group, while Group A applicants are less likely to be approved, even if they have higher preliminary scores.

### Conclusion

The event logs from Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibit bias. The bias is primarily due to the preferential treatment given to local residents who are members of community groups, as evidenced by the score adjustments and the higher approval rates for these applicants. This bias systematically disadvantages applicants from Group A (Protected Group), who do not receive similar benefits and are less likely to be approved. To mitigate this bias, the scoring system should be reviewed to ensure that all applicants are evaluated fairly, regardless of their local residency status or community group affiliations.
