<think>
Okay, I need to create an event log from the given tables for process mining. Let me start by understanding each table and how they connect.

First, the Orders table has order creation details. Each order has an order_id and order_date. So the first event for each order should be "Order Created" with the order_date. The sales_person_id can be linked to the Resources table to get the sales person's name and role.

Next, the Order Lines table has items picked for each order. Each item has an item_picking_date and a picker_id. So for each item in an order, there should be an "Items Picked" event. The picker_id corresponds to a warehouse staff member from the Resources table. But wait, if an order has multiple items, each picked at different times, I need to create separate events for each item's picking. However, the problem says "Items Picked" events from the Order Lines table. So each line item's picking is a separate event. But maybe the activity should be "Item Picked" instead of plural if each is a separate event. Hmm, but the example says "Items Picked" as plural. But looking at the sample data, each item in Order Lines has its own picking date. So perhaps each item's picking is an individual event. Or should we group them by order_id and have one event per order with multiple items? The prompt says "produce one event per activity if it's meaningful, or summarize if appropriate." But the instruction says "include one row per event." Also, the example says "Items Picked" events (plural), implying that each item's picking is an event. So I think each item's picking should be a separate event. So for order 1001, two items picked on different dates: each is an event. But activity name would be "Item Picked" or "Items Picked"? Maybe "Item Picked" per item. The example in the prompt says "Items Picked" as the event name. Hmm, maybe the plural form is used as a single event for all items in the order. Wait, but the data has multiple item_picking_date per order. For example, order 1001 has two item_picking_date entries. So if each is a separate event, then each would be "Item Picked" with item details. But according to the problem statement, the example says "Items Picked" events from the Order Lines table. Maybe plural for each item. So each item picked is an event. So activity name would be "Item Picked" and each item would be an event. But the example in the problem says "Items Picked" as a key step. Maybe the activity is "Items Picked" and each item's picking is a separate event. Or maybe the problem considers all items in the order being picked over time, but each picking event is a single line here. So each line in Order Lines represents an item being picked, so each should be an event. So activity name is "Item Picked" for each.

Then, the Delivery table has dispatch and arrival dates. Each delivery record can have a dispatch date and arrival date. So for each delivery entry, we have two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived". However, if an order has multiple deliveries (like order 1002 has two deliveries), each delivery would have its own dispatch and arrival events. So each delivery record in the Delivery table leads to two events. The carrier_id can be linked to the Resources table to get the carrier's name and role.

The Invoice table has invoice_issue_date. For each invoice linked to an order, there's an "Invoice Issued" event. The billing_person_id links to the Billing Clerk in the Resources table.

The Payments table has payment_date per invoice. Each payment on an invoice becomes a "Payment Received" event. Each payment entry in Payments table is an event, linked via invoice_id to the order. So each payment is an event for the order, since the invoice is linked to the order. The resource here might be the billing clerk again, but the Payments table doesn't have a resource ID. Hmm, the problem says that the Resource column is optional. The Payments table doesn't have a resource ID; maybe we can't assign a resource here unless inferred. The problem says to include resource if available, so if not available, leave it blank or note that. So for Payment Received, maybe no resource.

Now, the task is to integrate all these into a single event log. Each row is an event. The columns needed are Case ID (order_id), Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and other attributes.

Let's outline each event type:

1. Order Created: from Orders.order_date, resource is the sales person.
2. Item Picked (each line in Order Lines): Order Lines.item_picking_date, resource is picker_id (warehouse staff)
3. Order Dispatched: Delivery.delivery_dispatch_date, resource is carrier
4. Order Arrived: Delivery.delivery_arrival_date, resource is carrier
5. Invoice Issued: Invoice.invoice_issue_date, resource is billing person
6. Payment Received: Payments.payment_date, resource might not be available.

Other attributes:

- For Order Created: customer_type, order_priority
- For Item Picked: item_id, quantity, maybe item_category from Products table
- For Dispatch and Arrival: carrier_id, delivery_note
- For Invoice: invoice_amount
- For Payment: payment_method, payment_reference

Need to check if we can enrich the events with data from other tables. The prompt says "Other Attributes (if available): Any additional relevant data."

So for each event, include relevant attributes.

Now, let's process each order step by step.

Take order 1001:

- Orders Table: order_date 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z, so event "Order Created" with timestamp, resource Alice Brown (SP-001), customer_type Retail, order_priority High.

Order Lines for 1001: two items. Each item_picking_date is separate. So two events: "Item Picked" at each timestamp. Resources are WH-001 and WH-002. Attributes: item_id, quantity, item_category from Products table.

Delivery: one delivery record. Dispatch date 2024-01-03, arrival 2024-01-05. Two events: Dispatched and Arrived. Carrier is CR-01 (GlobalTransport). Delivery note "Normal route".

Invoice: INV-1001, issue date 2024-01-06. Event "Invoice Issued" by BL-001 (Gina Carter), amount 250.00.

Payments: Payment for INV-1001 on 2024-01-10. Event "Payment Received", method Credit Card, reference REF-CC-123. No resource listed here.

Now, arrange all events for order 1001 in timestamp order:

Order Created (2024-01-01)
Item Picked ITEM-001 (2024-01-02 10:15)
Item Picked ITEM-002 (2024-01-02 11:00)
Order Dispatched (2024-01-03 08:30)
Order Arrived (2024-01-05 14:45)
Invoice Issued (2024-01-06 09:00)
Payment Received (2024-01-10 11:30)

Similarly, process all orders.

Now, need to link all tables. The challenge is joining tables via foreign keys. Orders to Order Lines via order_id. Orders to Delivery via order_id. Orders to Invoice via order_id, then Invoice to Payments via invoice_id.

Need to make sure that for each order, all events from all related tables are included.

Also, the Products table can be joined to Order Lines via item_id to get item_category and item_description.

Resources table can be used to get resource names and roles for sales_person_id, picker_id, carrier_id, billing_person_id, etc.

For example:

- Order's resource: sales_person_id  resource_name and role (Sales Person)
- Order Lines' picker_id  Warehouse Staff
- Delivery's carrier_id  Carrier
- Invoice's billing_person_id  Billing Clerk
- Payments: no resource in table, so leave blank.

Now, for each event:

Activity Name mapping:

Orders: Order Created
Order Lines: Item Picked
Delivery: Dispatched and Arrived
Invoice: Invoice Issued
Payments: Payment Received

Now, attributes:

Order Created:

- customer_type, order_priority, sales_person (resource name), sales_person_role (Sales Person)

Item Picked:

- item_id, quantity, item_category (from Products), picker (resource name), picker_role (Warehouse Staff)

Order Dispatched:

- carrier (resource name), delivery_note

Order Arrived:

Same carrier and note.

Invoice Issued:

- invoice_amount, billing_person

Payment Received:

- payment_method, payment_reference

Now, handling missing data: if an order has no delivery, then dispatched and arrived events would be missing. But according to the data, all orders except 1004 have deliveries. Order 1004 has a delivery DLV-5004? Wait:

Looking at Delivery table:

Delivery entries:

1001 has DLV-5001

1002 has DLV-5002 and 5003

1003 has DLV-5004

1005 has DLV-5005

Order 1004: is there a delivery? No. Wait, Delivery table lists order 1004?

Wait Delivery table:

| delivery_id | order_id | delivery_dispatch_date    | delivery_arrival_date     | carrier_id | delivery_note               |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| DLV-5004    | 1003     | 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z      | 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z      | CR-03      | Expedited delivery          |
| DLV-5005    | 1005     | 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z      | 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z      | CR-02      | Fragile items, handle with care |

Wait, order 1004 is in Orders table (order_id=1004), but there's no delivery record for 1004 in the Delivery table. That's a problem? Or maybe the data entry missed. Wait, looking at the Delivery table:

Looking at the data:

delivery_id DLV-5001 to DLV-5005 have order_ids 1001, 1002 (twice), 1003, 1005. So order 1004 has no delivery record. That's a missing data. How to handle this? According to the problem statement, "if data is missing or ambiguous, document any assumptions made." So for order 1004, there's no delivery data. So events "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" would be missing. So the process for order 1004 would be: Order Created, Items Picked, Invoice Issued, Payment Received, but no delivery events.

Similarly, check other tables:

Order 1004: in Orders table. Order Lines entry: yes, order 1004 has item ITEM-001 picked on 2024-01-06. Delivery table: no entry. Invoice table: looking at invoices:

Invoice table:

invoice_id | order_id | invoice_issue_date       | invoice_amount | billing_person_id |
------------|----------|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
INV-1001   | 1001     | ...                      | ...            | ...               |
...
INV-1004   | 1003     | ...                      | ...            | ...               |
INV-1005   | 1005     | ...                      | ...            | ...               |

So order 1004 has no invoice. Wait, the invoice table lists order 1004? No. Looking at the Invoice table, the order_ids are 1001, 1002 (twice), 1003, 1005. So order 1004 has no invoice. Which implies that there would be no invoice issued and no payment received. So the events for order 1004 would be:

Order Created

Item Picked (ITEM-001)

But no delivery, invoice, or payment. So the process is stuck after picking? Or perhaps the data is incomplete. But according to the problem, we need to include all events that exist in the tables. So if the data is missing, we just don't include those events.

Similarly, check Payments: for example, INV-1004 (order 1003) has PAY-2004. Order 1004's invoice is missing, so payment would be missing.

So order 1004 would have:

Order Created (2024-01-04 14:15:00Z)

Item Picked (ITEM-001, 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z)

But no delivery, invoice, or payment events.

This is an important point. So the event log must include all existing events per the data, but if the data is missing (like no delivery or invoice for an order), those steps are omitted.

Now, proceed to map all events.

Next, the Products table is optional but can be used to get item_category and description.

For each Order Line item, join with Products to get item_category.

For example:

Order Line with item_id ITEM-001  item_category Widgets.

So in the event for item picked, include item_category.

Now, the steps to build the event log:

For each order_id:

1. Orders table: create "Order Created" event.

2. Order Lines table: for each line item, create "Item Picked" event.

3. Delivery table: for each delivery record of the order, create two events: Dispatched and Arrived.

4. Invoice table: for each invoice of the order, create "Invoice Issued" event.

5. Payments table: for each payment linked to an invoice of the order, create "Payment Received" event.

Now, for each of these events, extract the data.

Now, to build the event log:

We need to union all these events, sorted by order_id and timestamp.

Let me outline each event for each order.

Starting with Order 1001:

Events:

Order Created (order_date)
Item Picked ITEM-001 (item_picking_date)
Item Picked ITEM-002 (item_picking_date)
Order Dispatched (delivery_dispatch_date)
Order Arrived (delivery_arrival_date)
Invoice Issued (invoice_issue_date)
Payment Received (payment_date)

Order 1002:

Order Created
Two items picked (ITEM-003 and ITEM-005)
Two deliveries (DLV-5002 and DLV-5003) each with dispatch and arrival
Two invoices (INV-1002 and INV-1003)
Two payments (PAY-2002 and PAY-2003)

Order 1003:

Order Created
Two items picked
One delivery (DLV-5004)
One invoice (INV-1004)
One payment (PAY-2004)

Order 1004:

Order Created
One item picked (ITEM-001)
No delivery, invoice, or payment.

Order 1005:

Order Created
Two items picked
One delivery (DLV-5005)
One invoice (INV-1005)
One payment (PAY-2005)

Now, for each event, map attributes and resources.

Now, the challenge is to join all tables and collect all events.

Now, let's start constructing the event log.

First, the "Order Created" events:

For each order in Orders table:

Case ID: order_id

Activity: "Order Created"

Timestamp: order_date

Resource: sales_person_id joined to Resources to get name and role.

Other attributes: customer_type, order_priority

So:

Order 1001: Alice Brown (SP-001), role Sales Person

Order 1002: Bob Smith (SP-002)

Order 1003: Bob Smith (SP-002)

Order 1004: Charlie Kim (SP-003)

Order 1005: Alice Brown (SP-001)

Now, Order Lines events:

Each line item  "Item Picked" event.

Timestamp: item_picking_date

Resource: picker_id  warehouse staff.

Attributes: item_id, quantity, item_category (from Products), picker name and role.

Join Order Lines with Products on item_id.

Delivery events:

Each delivery record  two events. Timestamps dispatch and arrival.

Resource: carrier_id. Attributes: delivery_note, carrier name.

Invoice events:

Each invoice: timestamp invoice_issue_date.

Resource: billing_person_id. Attribute: invoice_amount.

Payments events:

Each payment: timestamp payment_date.

Attributes: payment_method, payment_reference.

Resource? Payments table doesn't have a resource ID, so leave blank.

Now, compiling all events:

Let's start building each row.

Order 1001:

1. Order Created
   - order_date: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z
   - Resource: Alice Brown / Sales Person
   - customer_type: Retail, order_priority: High

2. Item Picked ITEM-001

3. Item Picked ITEM-002
   - 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z
   - Resource: Eva Johnson / Warehouse Staff
   - item_category: Widgets, quantity:1

4. Order Dispatched
   - 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z
   - Resource: GlobalTransport / Carrier
   - delivery_note: Normal route

5. Order Arrived

   - Resource: Gina Carter / Billing Clerk
   - invoice_amount: 250.00

7. Payment Received
   - 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z
   - Resource: (empty)
   - payment_method: Credit Card, reference: REF-CC-123

Order 1002:

1. Order Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z, Bob Smith / Sales Person, customer_type Wholesale, Medium

2. Item Picked ITEM-003: 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z, Eva Johnson (WH-002) / Warehouse Staff, Gadgets, 4

3. Item Picked ITEM-005: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z, David Lin (WH-001), Gadgets, 2

4. Delivery Dispatched DLV-5002: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z, FastShip (CR-02)/Carrier, Requires signature

5. Delivery Arrived DLV-5002: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z

6. Delivery Dispatched DLV-5003: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z, GlobalTransport, Partial backorder

7. Delivery Arrived DLV-5003: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z

8. Invoice Issued INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z, Harry Lee / Billing Clerk, 400.00

9. Invoice Issued INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z, Harry Lee, 100.00

10. Payment Received PAY-2002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z, Wire Transfer, REF-WT-XYZ

11. Payment Received PAY-2003: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z, Check, REF-CH-789

Order 1003:

1. Order Created: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z, Bob Smith, customer_type Retail, order_priority High

2. Item Picked ITEM-002: 2024-01-05T15:30:00Z, Frank Miller (WH-003), Widgets, 1

3. Item Picked ITEM-006: 2024-01-05T15:45:00Z, David Lin (WH-001), Parts, 3

4. Order Dispatched: 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z, AirExpress (CR-03)/Carrier, Expedited delivery

5. Order Arrived: 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z

6. Invoice Issued: 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z, Gina Carter / Billing Clerk, 150.00

7. Payment Received: 2024-01-11T10:30:00Z, Credit Card, REF-CC-456

Order 1004:

1. Order Created: 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z, Charlie Kim / Sales Person, customer_type Government, Low

2. Item Picked ITEM-001: 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z, Eva Johnson, Widgets, 5

Order 1005:

1. Order Created: 2024-01-05T08:45:00Z, Alice Brown, customer_type Retail, High

2. Item Picked ITEM-007: 2024-01-06T09:30:00Z, Frank Miller, Widgets, 10

3. Item Picked ITEM-002: 2024-01-06T09:45:00Z, Eva Johnson, Widgets, 2

4. Order Dispatched: 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z, FastShip (CR-02), Fragile items...

5. Order Arrived: 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z

6. Invoice Issued: 2024-01-10T09:30:00Z, Irene Park (BL-003), 500.00

7. Payment Received: 2024-01-15T12:00:00Z, Credit Card, REF-CC-789

Now, all events need to be ordered per timestamp.

Now, compiling all these into a table.

But need to make sure that all events are in chronological order for each case.

For example, Order 1002 has two deliveries. The dispatch dates are 2024-01-04 and 2024-01-05. The arrival dates are later.

Now, to structure each row with:

Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, Other Attributes.

For Other Attributes, perhaps include:

For Order Created: customer_type, order_priority

For Item Picked: item_id, quantity, item_category

For Dispatched and Arrived: carrier_id, delivery_note

For Invoice: invoice_amount

For Payment: payment_method, payment_reference.

Now, let's build each row.

Starting with Order 1001:

| Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp           | Resource              | Other Attributes                                                                 |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1001    | Order Created       | 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z| Alice Brown         | customer_type: Retail, order_priority: High                                      |
| 1001    | Item Picked         | 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z| David Lin           | item_id: ITEM-001, quantity: 2, item_category: Widgets                           |
| 1001    | Item Picked         | 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z| Eva Johnson         | item_id: ITEM-002, quantity: 1, item_category: Widgets                           |
| 1001    | Order Dispatched    | 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z| GlobalTransport     | delivery_note: Normal route                                                     |
| 1001    | Order Arrived       | 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z| GlobalTransport     | delivery_note: Normal route                                                     |
| 1001    | Invoice Issued      | 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z| Gina Carter         | invoice_amount: 250.00                                                          |
| 1001    | Payment Received    | 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z| -                   | payment_method: Credit Card, payment_reference: REF-CC-123                       |

Similarly for other orders.

Now, Order 1002:

Events ordered by timestamp:

Order Created: 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z

Item picked ITEM-003: 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z

Item picked ITEM-005: 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z

Order Dispatched DLV-5002: 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z

Order Dispatched DLV-5003: 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z (Wait, but DLV-5003 dispatch date is 2024-01-05)

Order Arrived DLV-5002: 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z

Order Arrived DLV-5003: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z

Invoice Issued INV-1002: 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z (before DLV-5002 arrival?)

Wait, the invoice issue date for INV-1002 is 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z, which is before the arrival of DLV-5003 (Jan 8 10:00 AM arrival, same date but earlier time. Wait DLV-5003 arrival is 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z, and invoice is 10:15 same day. So invoice after arrival of DLV-5003?

Wait:

DLV-5003 arrival: 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z.

Invoice INV-1002 issued at 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z. So invoice after DLV-5003 arrival.

Payment PAY-2002: 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z

Invoice INV-1003: 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z (before payment PAY-2002)

Payment PAY-2003: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z

So event order for 1002:

1. Order Created (Jan 2 12:30)
2. Item ITEM-003 picked (Jan 3 9:45)
3. Item ITEM-005 picked (Jan 3 10:00)
4. Dispatched DLV-5002 (Jan 4 7:20)
5. Dispatched DLV-5003 (Jan 5 7:00)
6. Arrived DLV-5002 (Jan 7 16:10)
7. Invoice Issued INV-1002 (Jan 8 10:15)
8. Arrived DLV-5003 (Jan 8 10:00) [Wait, this timestamp is before the invoice?]
   - Wait, arrival of DLV-5003 is 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z, which is before invoice's 10:15. So order Arrived event before invoice issued.

But the invoice is issued after some deliveries?

That's possible, depending on business process. The event log should reflect the actual timestamps.

Then:

9. Invoice Issued INV-1003 (Jan 10 11:00)
10. Payment Received PAY-2002 (Jan 12 14:00)
11. Payment Received PAY-2003 (Jan 15 09:00)

So arranging all events in order:

The timestamps for order 1002 are:

2024-01-02T12:30:00Z (Order Created)

2024-01-03T09:45:00Z (Item picked ITEM-003)

2024-01-03T10:00:00Z (Item picked ITEM-005)

2024-01-04T07:20:00Z (Dispatched DLV-5002)

2024-01-05T07:00:00Z (Dispatched DLV-5003)

2024-01-07T16:10:00Z (Arrived DLV-5002)

2024-01-08T10:00:00Z (Arrived DLV-5003)

2024-01-08T10:15:00Z (Invoice INV-1002)

2024-01-10T11:00:00Z (Invoice INV-1003)

2024-01-12T14:00:00Z (Payment PAY-2002)

2024-01-15T09:00:00Z (Payment PAY-2003)

Note: The Arrived DLV-5003 (Jan 8 10:00) is before the Invoice INV-1002 (Jan 8 10:15). So the order of events should be Arrived first, then invoice.

So the event order should be:

Order Created

Item picked 003

Item picked 005

Dispatched 5002

Dispatched 5003

Arrived 5002

Arrived 5003

Invoice INV-1002

Invoice INV-1003

Payment 2002

Payment 2003

Now, building these into the event log.

Similarly for other orders.

Now, compiling all events for all orders in chronological order per case.

Now, the final step is to format all this into a Markdown table.

But this is time-consuming. Let's proceed.

The final event log should have all events for all order_ids in order of timestamp per case.

Assumptions made:

- Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment events due to missing data.

- Each item picked in Order Lines is a separate "Item Picked" event.

- Delivery dispatch and arrival are separate events.

- Each payment corresponds to an invoice, which is linked to an order, hence each payment is an event for the order.

- Resources are mapped using the Resources table where applicable.

- Payment events have no resource assigned.

Now, writing out the full Markdown table.

But since the user requires the final answer as a Markdown table, I'll proceed to structure it.

Each row:

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Other Attributes (or separate columns?)

Wait, the output format says "structured table" with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource/Actor (optional), and Other Attributes. But "Other Attributes" can be multiple data points. However, the prompt says "if available, include additional relevant data." So perhaps include as separate columns the key attributes, but the example in the problem isn't given.

Alternatively, the "Other Attributes" could be a single column with a dictionary-like string.

But the example in the prompt's sample output isn't provided, but the instruction says "structured table" with each row as an event. To make it structured, perhaps each attribute should be a separate column. However, this could lead to many columns.

Alternatively, merge the other attributes into a single column.

The problem says "Other Attributes (if available): Any additional relevant data." So perhaps the Resource is optional, and other attributes are optional but we can include as columns.

But given the example in the initial prompt's task description, perhaps it's better to include all possible attributes as separate columns. However, given the number of varying attributes, this could complicate the table.

Alternatively, follow the minimal required columns plus any other attributes as key-value pairs.

The user instruction says: "Please provide the final event log as a structured table (in Markdown format) where each row represents a single event."

Given that, perhaps the columns are:

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | customer_type | order_priority | item_id | quantity | item_category | carrier | delivery_note | invoice_amount | payment_method | payment_reference | sales_person | ... etc.

But that would be a very wide table with many nulls.

Alternatively, keep "Other Attributes" as a single column with key=value pairs.

But the user might prefer separate columns. However, the problem says "at a minimum" the columns mentioned, and "Other Attributes (if available)".

But in the absence of clear guidance, perhaps to have the five columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and Other Attributes (as a single column with additional data).

So the final table would have:

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Other Attributes

And the Other Attributes column contains relevant data depending on the event type.

For example:

For "Order Created", Other Attributes: customer_type=Wholesale, order_priority=Medium

For "Item Picked": item_id=ITEM-003, quantity=4, item_category=Gadgets

Etc.

This seems manageable.

Now, compiling all events.

Let's proceed to list each event row by row.

Order 1001:

1. Order Created: Resource Alice Brown, Other: customer_type=Retail, order_priority=High

2. Item ITEM-001 picked: David Lin, item details.

3. Item ITEM-002 picked: Eva Johnson.

4. Dispatched: carrier, delivery note.

5. Arrived: same.

6. Invoice: Gina Carter, amount.

7. Payment: method and ref.

Order 1002:

1. Order Created: Bob Smith, customer_type=Wholesale, order_priority=Medium

2. ITEM-003 picked: Eva Johnson, Gadgets.

3. ITEM-005 picked: David Lin, Gadgets.

4. Dispatched DLV-5002: FastShip, signature required.

5. Dispatched DLV-5003: GlobalTransport, backorder.

6. Arrived DLV-5002: same carrier.

7. Arrived DLV-5003: same.

8. Invoice INV-1002: Harry Lee, 400.00.

9. Invoice INV-1003: Harry Lee, 100.00.

10. Payment PAY-2002: Wire Transfer.

11. Payment PAY-2003: Check.

Order 1003:

Order Created: Bob Smith, Retail, High.

Two items picked.

Dispatched: AirExpress, Expedited.

Arrived.

Invoice: Gina Carter, 150.00.

Payment: Credit Card.

Order 1004:

Order Created: Government, Low.

Item picked ITEM-001.

Order 1005:

Order Created: Alice Brown, Retail.

Two items picked.

Dispatched: FastShip, Fragile.

Arrived.

Invoice: Irene Park, 500.00.

Payment: Credit Card.

Now, structuring all this into a Markdown table.

But due to the length, I'll summarize each row concisely.

Final event log:

Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp | Resource | Other Attributes

The Markdown table:

| Case ID | Activity Name       | Timestamp           | Resource              | Other Attributes                                                                 |

I need to check for chronological order within each case.

For example, Order 1002:

The timestamps are in order as listed above.

Similarly, all events are ordered.

Assumptions:

- Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment events.

- Payment events have no resource.

- Delivery events have carrier as resource.

Thus, this table should meet the requirements.

### Assumptions:
1. **Order 1004** lacks delivery, invoice, and payment data, so only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events are included.
2. **Payment events** have no assigned resource since the `Payments` table lacks a resource identifier.
3. **Delivery events** are split into "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" per delivery record.
4. **Item Picking** events are captured individually for each line item in the `Order Lines` table.
5. **Timestamps** are preserved in chronological order to reflect real process flow.
