Decomposition strategies are a crucial approach in process mining, allowing for the analysis and improvement of complex processes by breaking them down into manageable and more detailed subprocesses. Here's a comprehensive overview of the main benefits and challenges associated with applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects:

**Benefits:**

1.  **Improved process understanding:** Decomposition helps break down complex processes into manageable components, enabling a deeper understanding of the individual subprocesses and any interdependencies.
2.  **Enhanced root cause analysis:** By focusing on specific subprocesses, decomposition supports the identification and analysis of bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or quality issues, leading to targeted improvements.
3.  **Resource optimization:** Decomposition enables the identification of areas where resources can be optimized, such as reducing unnecessary delays, minimizing personnel requirements, or streamlining workflows.
4.  **Prioritization of process improvements:** By identifying key subprocesses that drive business outcomes, decomposition supports the prioritization of process improvements based on business value.
5.  **Improved collaboration:** Decomposition fosters collaboration among cross-functional teams by breaking down process ownership and responsibility into manageable, local ownership.

**Challenges:**

1.  **Complexity and intricacy:** Large-scale process mining projects often involve intricate and complex processes, making decomposition a challenging task that requires significant expertise and resources.
2.  **Information overload:** Decomposition generates a vast amount of data, which can lead to information overload, making it difficult to identify key insights and prioritize improvements.
3.  **Scope creep:** Decomposition can lead to scope creep if not managed effectively, as teams may become fixated on specific subprocesses and lose sight of the overall process goals.
4.  **Change management:** Decomposition requires a significant cultural shift in organizations, particularly when working with cross-functional teams. This can lead to resistance to change and adoption barriers.
5.  **Infrastructure and technical limitations:** Decomposition may be limited by existing infrastructure and technical capabilities, making it challenging to execute and analyze the subprocesses effectively.

Overall, decomposition strategies offer numerous benefits for improving large-scale process mining projects, but their successful application requires careful management, expertise, and resources to overcome the associated challenges.
