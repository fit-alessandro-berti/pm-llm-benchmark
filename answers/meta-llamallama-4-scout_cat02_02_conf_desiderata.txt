## Step 1: Identify the normative rules for the loan application process
The normative rules for the loan application process are as follows:
- The process starts with receiving a loan application.
- A credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation.
- A risk assessment must be conducted after the credit check and before the loan decision.
- A loan decision (either approved or rejected) must be made after the risk assessment.
- The applicant must be informed of the outcome after the loan decision.
- If the loan is approved, documentation must be finalized before the case is closed.
- If the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.

## 2: Analyze Case 1 for adherence to normative rules
Case 1 sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- This case follows the normative sequence without violations.

## 3: Analyze Case 2 for adherence to normative rules
Case 2 sequence: Application Received  Risk Assessment (wrong order)  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- Violation: The risk assessment was done before the credit check, which is not allowed.
- Additionally, finalize documentation was done after a rejection, which is also not allowed.

## 4: Analyze Case 3 for adherence to normative rules
Case 3 sequence: Application Received  Credit Check (delayed)  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- This case follows the normative sequence but with a delay in informing the applicant.

## 5: Identify violations of normative rules
- Case 2 violates the normative rules because it performs a risk assessment before a credit check and also finalizes documentation after a rejection.

## 6: Determine which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions
Desiderata conditions:
- Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after application receipt.
- Inform Applicant should ideally happen within 48 hours of the loan decision.
- A Follow-up Call is recommended but not required.

## 7: Analyze Case 1 against desiderata
- Case 1 completes all steps in a timely manner without violations.

## 8: Analyze Case 2 against desiderata and normative rules
- Case 2 violates normative rules as identified but does not provide information on timing that could relate to desiderata.

## 9: Analyze Case 3 against desiderata
- Case 3 has a credit check completed more than 24 hours after application receipt and informs the applicant more than 48 hours after the loan decision, but it does not violate the normative rules directly.

## 10: Summarize findings for normative process behavior
- Case 2 is a clear violation of the normative rules because it performs activities out of order and skips steps.

## 11: Summarize findings for desiderata
- Case 3 violates the desiderata by not completing the credit check within 24 hours and not informing the applicant promptly after the loan decision.

## 12: Interpret and justify observed behaviors
- Case 2 seems to have been mishandled as it skips necessary steps and performs actions out of order, violating the strict rules.
- Case 3 suggests a need for more efficient processing to adhere to recommended timing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Case 2}$
