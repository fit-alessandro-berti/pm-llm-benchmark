Looking at this event log, I need to group events by patient case using the available attributes and their temporal sequence.

Let me trace through the events systematically:

**Case 1 (Patient M, age 45):**
- Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- Pattern: Register  Initial triage  X-ray  Doctor consultation  Discharge
- All events involve a 45-year-old male patient

**Case 2 (Patient F, age 62):**
- Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- Pattern: Register  Initial triage  Lab test requested  Lab test completed  Doctor consultation  Prescription  Discharge
- All events involve a 62-year-old female patient

**Case 3 (Patient M, age 28):**
- Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- Pattern: Register  Doctor consultation  Surgery preparation  Surgery performed  Recovery  Discharge
- All events involve a 28-year-old male patient

The grouping is clear because:
1. Each patient has unique age-gender combinations
2. The temporal ordering prevents ambiguity (events for different cases interleave but maintain chronological consistency)
3. The activity sequences are logical and distinct for each case

**Case IDs:**
- Case 1: Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 (45-year-old male)
- Case 2: Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 (62-year-old female)  
- Case 3: Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 (28-year-old male)
