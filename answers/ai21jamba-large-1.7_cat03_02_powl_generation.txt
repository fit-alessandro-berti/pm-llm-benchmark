Here's the Python code representing the described process as a POWL model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Verify Service Request
SR = Transition(label="SR")  # Service Request verification

# Step 2: Contract Setup
CS = Transition(label="CS")  # Contract Setup

# Step 3: Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)
DA = Transition(label="DA")  # Datacenter Allocation
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")  # Access Control Initialization

# Sequential execution for DA and ACI
DA_ACI_seq = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA_ACI_seq])
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA_ACI_seq)

# Step 4: Looped configuration phase
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")  # Base Network Configuration
D_R = Transition(label="D&R")  # Debug & Reconfigure

# Create the loop for BNC and D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, D_R])

# Step 5: Exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD)
CD = Transition(label="CD")  # Containerized Deployment
MD = Transition(label="MD")  # Monolithic Deployment

xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 6: Final tasks (Quality Assurance, Security Audit, and Go-Live Approval)
QA = Transition(label="QA")  # Quality Assurance
SA = Transition(label="SA")  # Security Audit
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")  # Go-Live Approval

# Final tasks partial order
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
final_tasks.order.add_edge(QA, SA)  # QA and SA can be concurrent, but GLA depends on both
final_tasks.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Assemble the full POWL model
root.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_seq, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, final_tasks)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transitions**: Each step and activity is represented as a `Transition` object. Silent transitions are not explicitly needed in this case since all steps are labeled.
2. **Partial Orders**: `StrictPartialOrder` is used to enforce dependencies between activities. For example, the Service Request (`SR`) must be completed before the Contract Setup (`CS`).
3. **Loop**: A loop node is added to handle the repeated execution of `BNC` and optional `D&R` until the configuration stabilizes.
4. **Exclusive Choice (XOR)**: An `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR` ensures that only one of the deployment methods (`CD` or `MD`) is performed.
5. **Final Partial Order**: The QA and SA tasks are partially ordered, and their completion enables the Go-Live Approval (`GLA`).

This implementation accurately represents the workflow described in the complex scenario.
