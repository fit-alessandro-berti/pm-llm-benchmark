To model the complex digital service provisioning process described, we'll construct a POWL model using the provided classes and structure. The model will include transitions for each activity, partial orders for concurrent tasks, and operators for loops and exclusive choices.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Create all transitions with corresponding labels
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
DR = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# Partial Order: DA and ACI executed in parallel
DA_ACI_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])

# Loop between BNC and D&R (execute BNC, then optionally D&R and repeat)
loop_BNC_DR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Exclusive Choice between CD and MD
xor_CD_MD = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Partial Order: QA and SA executed in parallel
QA_SA_parallel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Root partial order encapsulating the entire process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA_ACI_parallel, loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD, QA_SA_parallel, GLA])

# Define execution order between nodes in the root partial order
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)                   # SR must complete before CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA_ACI_parallel)      # CS must complete before DA/ACI
root.order.add_edge(DA_ACI_parallel, loop_BNC_DR)  # DA/ACI must complete before loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_BNC_DR, xor_CD_MD)   # Loop must complete before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(xor_CD_MD, QA_SA_parallel)  # Deployment choice must complete before QA/SA
root.order.add_edge(QA_SA_parallel, GLA)      # QA/SA must complete before GLA
```

### Explanation:
1. **Transitions**: Each activity (e.g., `SR`, `CS`, `DA`) is represented as a `Transition` with its corresponding label.
2. **Concurrent Tasks**: 
   - `DA_ACI_parallel`: `DA` and `ACI` are placed in a `StrictPartialOrder` with no edges, allowing concurrent execution.
   - `QA_SA_parallel`: Similarly, `QA` and `SA` are concurrent.
3. **Loop Structure**: 
   - `loop_BNC_DR` uses the `LOOP` operator to model the repeated execution of `BNC` followed by optional `D&R`.
4. **Exclusive Choice**: 
   - `xor_CD_MD` uses the `XOR` operator to choose between `CD` or `MD`.
5. **Main Workflow**: 
   - The `root` partial order sequences all steps: `SR → CS → DA_ACI_parallel → loop_BNC_DR → xor_CD_MD → QA_SA_parallel → GLA`.
   - Edges enforce dependencies (e.g., `QA_SA_parallel` must complete before `GLA` starts).

This model accurately captures the process flow, concurrency, and control structures described in the scenario.
