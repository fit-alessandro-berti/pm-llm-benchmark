We are given two logs: Log A and Log B.
 Goal: Merge them into a single event log by matching events that are the same (using order_id and timestamps within a tolerance) and combining their attributes.

 Steps:
 1. We note that both logs have events for the same order (Order#1234).
 2. We will try to match events from Log A and Log B by:
    - Using the same order_id (which they all share in this case).
    - Comparing timestamps: if the timestamps are within 2 seconds, we consider them the same event.

 3. Event name mapping (since the event names are different):
    - We can create a mapping based on the context and the timing.

    Log A events and their timestamps:
      Order Received: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
      Order Validated: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
      Payment Processed: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
      Item Shipped: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
      Item Delivered: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z

    Log B events and their timestamps:
      OrderReceived: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z -> within 2 seconds of 10:00:00? (difference: 2 seconds) -> matches Order Received
      OrderValidation: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z -> within 1 second of 10:01:30 -> matches Order Validated
      PaymentCheck: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z -> within 5 seconds of 10:02:00? (difference: 5 seconds) -> but note: tolerance is 2 seconds? Actually, the requirement says "small timestamp tolerance (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds)". So 5 seconds is beyond 2 seconds -> does not match? However, let's check the event names: PaymentCheck vs Payment Processed. They seem related. But note the requirement: we must use the tolerance. Since 5 seconds is beyond 2 seconds, we cannot match by time. However, we might consider the sequence? But note: Log A has Payment Processed at 10:02:00 and then Log B has PaymentCheck at 10:02:05. They are close but beyond the tolerance. We must leave them separate? But wait, the requirement says "if you cannot confidently match two events, leave them separate". So we leave Payment Processed (Log A) and PaymentCheck (Log B) as separate events.

      However, let's look at the entire sequence. We have:
        Log A: ... -> Payment Processed -> Item Shipped
        Log B: ... -> PaymentCheck -> Quality Check -> Shipping

      The next event in Log A after Payment Processed is Item Shipped at 10:05:00. In Log B, after PaymentCheck we have Quality Check at 10:03:00 and then Shipping at 10:05:02. The Shipping event in Log B is within 2 seconds of Item Shipped in Log A (10:05:00 vs 10:05:02 -> difference 2 seconds -> matches). So we can match Shipping and Item Shipped.

      But what about the Payment events? They are only 5 seconds apart. The requirement says "use a small timestamp tolerance (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds)". We set 2 seconds as the tolerance? Then 5 seconds is too much. Therefore, we cannot match Payment Processed and PaymentCheck.

      However, note that the requirement says "slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds". We might consider extending the tolerance? But the example explicitly says "less than 2 seconds". So we stick to 2 seconds.

 4. Now, what about the event "Quality Check" in Log B? There is no corresponding event in Log A. So we include it as a separate event.

 5. Similarly, the event "Item Delivered" in Log A has no corresponding event in Log B.

 6. We also note that Log B has an event "OrderReceived" at 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z and Log A has "Order Received" at 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z. The difference is 2 seconds -> within tolerance? Actually, 2 seconds is exactly 2 seconds? The requirement says "less than 2 seconds". So 2 seconds is not less than 2 seconds? We have to be careful: 2 seconds is 2.0 seconds, which is not less than 2.0? So it's equal? The requirement says "differ by less than 2 seconds". Therefore, 2 seconds is not included? 

    Let me check: 
        Log A: 10:00:00
        Log B: 09:59:58 -> difference is 2 seconds (from 09:59:58 to 10:00:00 is 2 seconds).

    Since the requirement says "less than 2 seconds", we cannot match them? But wait, the requirement says "if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds". So 2 seconds is not less than 2? Therefore, we cannot match? 

    However, note that the requirement says "slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds" and we are allowed to use a tolerance. We must be consistent. Since the requirement example says "less than 2 seconds", we must interpret that strictly.

    But let me recalculate: 
        Time difference = |t1 - t2| = |10:00:00 - 09:59:58| = 2 seconds -> not less than 2 -> so not matched.

    However, this would break the matching for the first event. We must reconsider? 

    Alternatively, note that the requirement says "a small timestamp tolerance (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds)". The word "e.g." means that 2 seconds is an example. We might use a tolerance of 2 seconds inclusive? But the example says "less than 2 seconds". 

    Since the requirement is ambiguous, I will use a tolerance of 2 seconds inclusive (i.e., <= 2 seconds). Why? Because 2 seconds is very small and in practice, two events that are 2 seconds apart might be considered the same in a business process that has delays. Also, note that Log B's event for OrderReceived has a note: "Event captured at warehouse system", meaning it might be the same event but recorded by a different system with a slight clock skew.

    Therefore, I will consider events within 2 seconds (inclusive) as matching.

    So:
        OrderReceived (Log B) and Order Received (Log A): difference = 2 seconds -> match.

    Similarly, OrderValidation (Log B) at 10:01:29 and Order Validated (Log A) at 10:01:30: difference = 1 second -> match.

    PaymentCheck (Log B) at 10:02:05 and Payment Processed (Log A) at 10:02:00: difference = 5 seconds -> no match.

    Shipping (Log B) at 10:05:02 and Item Shipped (Log A) at 10:05:00: difference = 2 seconds -> match.

 7. Now, we have:
    - Order Received: matched -> merge
    - Order Validated: matched -> merge
    - Payment Processed (Log A) and PaymentCheck (Log B) are separate because 5 seconds > 2 seconds.
    - Then we have an extra event in Log B: Quality Check at 10:03:00.
    - Then we have Item Shipped: matched -> merge.
    - Then we have an event in Log A: Item Delivered at 10:20:00 -> no match in Log B.

 8. How to merge?
    For matched events, we combine the attributes. We have:
        Log A: timestamp, event_type, order_id
        Log B: timestamp, event_name, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes

    We will create a merged event that has:
        - We need to choose a primary timestamp? The requirement says: "If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both." 
        - Since Log A is the primary timeline, we might use Log A's timestamp as the primary? But note: Log A's timestamps may reflect the time events are received, not when they started. Log B might be more accurate? However, we don't have that information. So we can include both timestamps? 

        Let me decide: we will include both timestamps and mark them with the system. We can have:
            timestamp_A: from Log A
            timestamp_B: from Log B
        And then for ordering, we can use the average? Or we can choose one? The requirement says "present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)".

        We choose Log A's timestamp as the primary for ordering? Because Log A is considered the primary timeline. But note: for events that are only in Log B, we don't have Log A timestamp. Similarly, for events only in Log A, we don't have Log B timestamp.

        Alternatively, we can define a primary timestamp for each event:
            For matched events: use Log A's timestamp? Or use the earlier one? Or the later one? 
        Since Log A is primary, we'll use Log A's timestamp for matched events? But note: the event "OrderReceived" in Log B is 2 seconds earlier. We might want to use the actual occurrence time? But we don't know.

        Let me propose: 
            We will create a field called "timestamp" that will be the primary timestamp for ordering. For matched events, we will use the Log A timestamp (since Log A is primary). For events only in Log A, we use Log A timestamp. For events only in Log B, we use Log B timestamp.

        But then note: the event "OrderReceived" in Log B happened at 09:59:58, but we are going to use 10:00:00 (from Log A) for ordering? That would put it at 10:00:00, which is the same as the Log A event. That's acceptable because they are the same event.

        However, for events that are not matched, we must use their own timestamp.

        Alternatively, we can use the earliest timestamp? But the requirement says Log A is primary. So I think using Log A's timestamp for matched events is acceptable.

        We'll also store the Log B timestamp as an attribute.

        Similarly, for event names: we can use the event_type from Log A as the primary event type? And also include the event_name from Log B? Or we can create a unified event type? 

        Since the requirement says "merge them into a single record", we can choose one event name? Or we can have both? 

        I propose to have:
            event_type: we'll use the Log A event_type for matched events? But note: for events only in Log B, we don't have Log A event_type. So we can have:
                For matched events: 
                    event_type: from Log A (since it's primary) 
                    event_name: from Log B (as an additional attribute)
                For events only in Log A: event_type from Log A.
                For events only in Log B: event_name from Log B (and we can call it event_type?).

        To have a consistent field, we can create a field "event_type" that is the primary event type, and then have an optional "alternate_event_type" or "event_name" for the other system? 

        Alternatively, we can have:
            For every event, we have:
                - event_type: a unified name? But we don't have a mapping for all. So we can leave the original names and just note the source.

        I think we can do:

            For merged events: 
                event_type: Log A's event_type (since Log A is primary) 
                event_name: Log B's event_name (as an additional attribute)

            For events only in Log A:
                event_type: Log A's event_type
                event_name: null

            For events only in Log B:
                event_type: null   -> but we don't want null? We can have:
                event_type: Log B's event_name   OR we can have a separate field?

        Alternatively, we can have two fields: 
            primary_event_type: for events from Log A (and for merged events, we take Log A's event_type) 
            secondary_event_type: for events from Log B (and for merged events, we take Log B's event_name)

        But then for events only in Log A, we don't have secondary_event_type? And for events only in Log B, we don't have primary_event_type? 

        Another idea: we can have one field called "event_type" and then a field "source" to indicate which log the event came from? But for merged events, we have two sources? 

        We can do:

            For each event, we will have:
                - timestamp: the primary timestamp (for ordering) 
                - event_type: a string representing the event type. For merged events, we can use the Log A event_type? Or we can use a unified name? 
                - ... other attributes ...

        But note: the requirement says "include all attributes from both logs". So we can have:

            For merged events:
                timestamp_A: from Log A
                timestamp_B: from Log B
                event_type_A: from Log A
                event_type_B: from Log B
                ... plus all other attributes from both logs.

            Then we define a primary timestamp for ordering? We'll use timestamp_A for merged events? And for Log A only events, we use their timestamp? For Log B only events, we use their timestamp? 

        However, the output should be a single event log. We can have:

            event_record = {
                "order_id": ...,
                "primary_timestamp": ... ,   # the one we use for ordering
                "timestamp_A": ... ,          # if available
                "timestamp_B": ... ,          # if available
                "event_type": ... ,           # we can use Log A's event_type if available, else Log B's event_name? 
                "event_name": ... ,           # Log B's event_name, if available
                "user_id": ... ,              # from Log B, if available
                "resource_id": ... ,          # from Log B, if available
                "notes": ... ,                # from Log B, if available
                "source": "merged" or "Log A" or "Log B"
            }

        But note: the event_type from Log A and event_name from Log B are both present for merged events. We don't want to lose either.

        Alternatively, we can have:

            event_record = {
                "order_id": ...,
                "timestamp": ... ,   # primary timestamp for ordering (for merged events: Log A's timestamp? for Log A only: Log A, for Log B only: Log B)
                "timestamp_A": ... , # present if the event is in Log A
                "timestamp_B": ... , # present if the event is in Log B
                "event_type_A": ... , # present if in Log A
                "event_type_B": ... , # present if in Log B (which is the event_name in Log B)
                "user_id": ... , 
                "resource_id": ... ,
                "notes": ... 
            }

        Then the event_type_A and event_type_B are the event types from the respective logs.

        But then how do we know the event type for the merged record? We can say that if both are present, then we have both. And if only one is present, then we have only that one.

        This way we don't lose any information.

 9. Let's design the merged event structure:

    Fields:
        - order_id (from either log, they are the same for matched events)
        - primary_timestamp: the timestamp we use for ordering the entire log. We define:
            For events that are in Log A (whether matched or not): use Log A's timestamp.
            For events that are only in Log B: use Log B's timestamp.
        - timestamp_A: present if the event is in Log A (for matched events and Log A only events)
        - timestamp_B: present if the event is in Log B (for matched events and Log B only events)
        - event_type_A: the event_type from Log A (if available)
        - event_type_B: the event_name from Log B (if available) [note: Log B's event name is in the field event_name]
        - user_id: from Log B (if available)
        - resource_id: from Log B (if available)
        - notes: from Log B (if available)

    Additionally, we can have a field "source" that indicates if the event is merged, from Log A only, or from Log B only? But we can derive that from the presence of timestamp_A and timestamp_B.

 10. Now, let's list the events in chronological order by primary_timestamp.

     We have:

        Event 1 (matched):
            Log A: Order Received at 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
            Log B: OrderReceived at 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z -> but primary_timestamp will be 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (from Log A)

        Event 2 (matched):
            Log A: Order Validated at 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
            Log B: OrderValidation at 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:01:30Z

        Event 3 (Log A only): 
            Payment Processed at 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:02:00Z

        Event 4 (Log B only):
            PaymentCheck at 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:02:05Z

        Event 5 (Log B only):
            Quality Check at 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:03:00Z

        Event 6 (matched):
            Log A: Item Shipped at 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
            Log B: Shipping at 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:05:00Z

        Event 7 (Log A only):
            Item Delivered at 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z -> primary_timestamp: 10:20:00Z

     Now, note the ordering by primary_timestamp:

        10:00:00 -> Event 1
        10:01:30 -> Event 2
        10:02:00 -> Event 3
        10:02:05 -> Event 4
        10:03:00 -> Event 5
        10:05:00 -> Event 6
        10:20:00 -> Event 7

     But wait: the Log B event PaymentCheck is at 10:02:05, which is after the Log A event Payment Processed at 10:02:00? So that ordering is correct.

 11. Now, let's build the merged log:

     Event 1 (merged):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z   [from Log A]
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z
        event_type_A: "Order Received"
        event_type_B: "OrderReceived"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"

     Event 2 (merged):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z
        event_type_A: "Order Validated"
        event_type_B: "OrderValidation"
        user_id: "u12"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Cross-check inventory"

     Event 3 (Log A only):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
        timestamp_B: null (or omit if we don't have it? We can represent as null or not include the field? We'll include the field and set to null for clarity)
        event_type_A: "Payment Processed"
        event_type_B: null
        user_id: null
        resource_id: null
        notes: null

     Event 4 (Log B only):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
        timestamp_A: null
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
        event_type_A: null
        event_type_B: "PaymentCheck"
        user_id: "u12"
        resource_id: "r99"
        notes: "Payment gateway delay"

     Event 5 (Log B only):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
        timestamp_A: null
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
        event_type_A: null
        event_type_B: "Quality Check"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r11"
        notes: "Random inspection"

     Event 6 (merged):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z
        event_type_A: "Item Shipped"
        event_type_B: "Shipping"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Package handed to courier"

     Event 7 (Log A only):
        order_id: Order#1234
        primary_timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
        timestamp_B: null
        event_type_A: "Item Delivered"
        event_type_B: null
        user_id: null
        resource_id: null
        notes: null

 12. We must document the reasoning:

     Matching decisions:
        - Order Received (Log A) and OrderReceived (Log B): matched because order_id matches and timestamps are within 2 seconds (difference=2 seconds, which we consider within tolerance).
        - Order Validated (Log A) and OrderValidation (Log B): matched (difference=1 second).
        - Payment Processed (Log A) and PaymentCheck (Log B): not matched because the time difference is 5 seconds (>2 seconds).
        - Item Shipped (Log A) and Shipping (Log B): matched (difference=2 seconds).
        - Item Delivered (Log A) has no match in Log B.
        - Log B events PaymentCheck and Quality Check have no match in Log A.

     Attribute merging: 
        For matched events, we include all attributes from both logs. We store both timestamps and both event types (as event_type_A and event_type_B). We also include the additional attributes from Log B (user_id, resource_id, notes).

     For events that are not matched, we include the event from the respective log and set the missing attributes to null.

     Ordering: 
        We order by the primary_timestamp, which is:
            For events present in Log A: the Log A timestamp (even if matched, we use Log A's timestamp for ordering).
            For events only in Log B: the Log B timestamp.

     This ordering ensures that the events are in chronological order as per the primary timeline (Log A) and the Log B events that are not matched are placed at their own timestamp.

 13. Final output format:

     We can output as a table or list of events with the following fields:

        primary_timestamp, order_id, event_type_A, event_type_B, timestamp_A, timestamp_B, user_id, resource_id, notes

     But note: the primary_timestamp is redundant because for events in Log A, it equals timestamp_A, and for events only in Log B, it equals timestamp_B. However, we included it for clarity in ordering? Actually, we don't need to store it separately if we are going to use one of the timestamps for ordering. We can just use the primary_timestamp as the display timestamp? 

     Alternatively, we can omit primary_timestamp and just use:
        - For events that have timestamp_A: use timestamp_A for ordering and display? 
        - For events that don't have timestamp_A: use timestamp_B.

     But then we have two different fields. We can define:

        display_timestamp = timestamp_A if available, else timestamp_B

     And then order by display_timestamp.

     However, in the merged events, we have both timestamps. We want to use timestamp_A for ordering? So we can do:

        display_timestamp = 
            if event has timestamp_A: use timestamp_A
            else: use timestamp_B

     Then we don't need to store an extra field.

     But note: we are including both timestamp_A and timestamp_B. So we can compute the display_timestamp from the data.

     Therefore, we can omit the primary_timestamp field and just order by:
        coalesce(timestamp_A, timestamp_B)

     However, to be explicit, we can include the primary_timestamp as the coalesce of timestamp_A and timestamp_B? 

     I think we can skip the primary_timestamp field and just use the coalesce for ordering. In the output, we can show both timestamps.

     But the requirement says "present events in chronological order (based on a chosen primary timestamp)". We have defined the primary timestamp as Log A's timestamp for events that are in Log A (whether matched or not) and Log B's timestamp for events only in Log B.

     So we can compute the primary timestamp as:
        primary_ts = timestamp_A if timestamp_A is not null else timestamp_B

     And then order by primary_ts.

     In the output, we can list the events with the following fields:

        primary_ts, order_id, event_type_A, event_type_B, timestamp_A, timestamp_B, user_id, resource_id, notes

     But note: the primary_ts is redundant because it's either timestamp_A or timestamp_B. We can avoid duplicating and just order by coalesce(timestamp_A, timestamp_B). However, for clarity, we can include it? 

     Alternatively, we can just list the events and note that the ordering is by the primary timestamp which is defined as above.

     I think we can output without a separate primary_ts field. We will order the events by:

        coalesce(timestamp_A, timestamp_B)

     And then in the output table, we show both timestamp_A and timestamp_B.

 14. Let's write the merged log in chronological order:

     Event 1: 
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: "Order Received"
        event_type_B: "OrderReceived"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"

     Event 2:
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: "Order Validated"
        event_type_B: "OrderValidation"
        user_id: "u12"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Cross-check inventory"

     Event 3:
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
        timestamp_B: null
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: "Payment Processed"
        event_type_B: null
        user_id: null
        resource_id: null
        notes: null

     Event 4:
        timestamp_A: null
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: null
        event_type_B: "PaymentCheck"
        user_id: "u12"
        resource_id: "r99"
        notes: "Payment gateway delay"

     Event 5:
        timestamp_A: null
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: null
        event_type_B: "Quality Check"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r11"
        notes: "Random inspection"

     Event 6:
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
        timestamp_B: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: "Item Shipped"
        event_type_B: "Shipping"
        user_id: "u45"
        resource_id: "r10"
        notes: "Package handed to courier"

     Event 7:
        timestamp_A: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z
        timestamp_B: null
        order_id: Order#1234
        event_type_A: "Item Delivered"
        event_type_B: null
        user_id: null
        resource_id: null
        notes: null

     And we order by: 
        coalesce(timestamp_A, timestamp_B) 

     The coalesce function returns the first non-null value. So:

        Event 1: 10:00:00 (from timestamp_A)
        Event 2: 10:01:30 (from timestamp_A)
        Event 3: 10:02:00 (from timestamp_A)
        Event 4: 10:02:05 (from timestamp_B)
        Event 5: 10:03:00 (from timestamp_B)
        Event 6: 10:05:00 (from timestamp_A)
        Event 7: 10:20:00 (from timestamp_A)

     This matches the order we described.

 15. We can output in a table format.

 Let's write the merged log:

### Merged Event Log

Below is the integrated event log combining **Log A** and **Log B** for `Order#1234`. Events are ordered chronologically by `primary_timestamp` (derived from Log A where available, otherwise Log B). Attributes from both logs are merged where events match; unmatched events are included as-is.

| primary_timestamp       | order_id   | event_type_A      | event_type_B      | timestamp_A (Log A) | timestamp_B (Log B) | user_id | resource_id | notes                              |

### Reasoning and Decisions

#### 1. **Event Matching Strategy**
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: Events were matched if their timestamps differed by **2 seconds** (inclusive) and shared the same `order_id`. This tolerance accounts for system clock offsets while ensuring alignment.
- **Event Name Mapping**: Semantic alignment was used to pair similar events:
  - `Order Received` (Log A)  `OrderReceived` (Log B)
  - `Order Validated` (Log A)  `OrderValidation` (Log B)
  - `Item Shipped` (Log A)  `Shipping` (Log B)
- **Primary Timestamp**: For merged events, Log A's timestamp was prioritized as the `primary_timestamp` (since Log A is the "primary timeline" per requirements). Log B's timestamp is retained as `timestamp_B`.

#### 2. **Matched Events**
- **Order Received (Log A) + OrderReceived (Log B)**  
  - Timestamps: `10:00:00Z` vs. `09:59:58Z` (2s difference  **match**).  
  - Reasoning: Within tolerance; same order step.
- **Order Validated (Log A) + OrderValidation (Log B)**  
  - Timestamps: `10:01:30Z` vs. `10:01:29Z` (1s difference  **match**).  
- **Item Shipped (Log A) + Shipping (Log B)**  
  - Timestamps: `10:05:00Z` vs. `10:05:02Z` (2s difference  **match**).  

#### 3. **Unmatched Events**
- **Payment Processed (Log A)**  
  - No match: Log B's `PaymentCheck` occurs at `10:02:05Z` (5s after Log A's `10:02:00Z`).  
  - Reasoning: Exceeds 2s tolerance; potentially distinct steps (e.g., initiation vs. completion).
- **PaymentCheck (Log B)**  
  - No match: Log A has no event within 2s of `10:02:05Z`.
- **Quality Check (Log B)**  
  - No match: Log A has no corresponding event (unique to System B).
- **Item Delivered (Log A)**  
  - No match: Log B lacks a delivery event.

#### 4. **Attribute Handling**
- **Merged Events**: All attributes from both logs are included (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B enrich Log A's minimal data).
- **Unmatched Events**: Attributes are preserved as-is. Missing values (e.g., `user_id` for Log A-only events) are denoted as `—`.

#### 5. **Chronological Order**
- Events are sorted by `primary_timestamp` (Log A timestamp for merged/Log A events; Log B timestamp for Log B-only events).

#### Key Insights
- Log B adds valuable context (e.g., `user_id`, `notes`), revealing workflow details (e.g., payment delays, quality checks).
- Log A's "Item Delivered" event lacks a counterpart in Log B, suggesting potential gaps in System B's tracking.
- The 5s offset between `Payment Processed` (Log A) and `PaymentCheck` (Log B) implies asynchronous processing steps.
