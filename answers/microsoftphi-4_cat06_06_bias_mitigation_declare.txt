To mitigate bias in the loan application process, particularly concerning decisions influenced by sensitive attributes, we'll introduce new DECLARE constraints that ensure fairness and consistency. Here’s how the updated model looks, with step-by-step explanations for each constraint:

### Updated Model

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Bias-Mitigating Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority / Reject_Minority with ManualReview:** These constraints ensure that any approval or rejection decisions concerning minority applicants are always accompanied by a manual review. This helps ensure that decisions are scrutinized and are not automatically made based on potentially sensitive data, thus preventing biased automated decisions.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck:** This constraint mandates that after checking an applicant’s race (a sensitive attribute), a bias mitigation check must occur. It ensures that sensitive demographic information triggers an additional verification layer before subsequent decision-making activities.

3. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck to Approve / Reject:** These constraints ensure that any decision to approve or reject a loan application can only occur after a bias mitigation check has been performed. This adds a safeguard ensuring that decisions are informed by supplementary checks, reducing the likelihood of bias-driven outcomes.

4. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace to Reject:** This constraint prevents a direct succession from accessing sensitive attributes (like checking race) to rejecting an application. This reduces the chances of automatic rejections unfairly linked to an applicant’s sensitive attributes without further review.

By integrating these constraints into the model, we aim to create a loan application review process that imposes necessary checks and balances, ensuring fair and unbiased decisions. The additional steps enforced through DECLARE constraints promote transparency and mitigate undue influence from sensitive attributes.
