To address the task effectively, we need to follow a structured approach using SQL in DuckDB. The goal is to filter out cases with more than six events from the `event_log` table and return only the events belonging to cases that have six or fewer events. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Group Events by `case_id`:** First, we need to group the events in the `event_log` table by their corresponding `case_id`. This allows us to count the number of events associated with each case.

2. **Count Events per Case:** Within each grouped set of events for a particular `case_id`, we'll count how many events belong to that case. This is crucial for determining which cases exceed the threshold of six events.

3. **Filter Cases Based on Event Count:** After counting the events per case, we apply a filter condition to exclude any cases where the event count exceeds six. This step ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are considered further in our query.

4. **Select Events from Filtered Cases:** Finally, we retrieve all events from those cases that passed our filtering criteria. Since we're interested in keeping the full set of events for these cases, a simple join between our original `event_log` table and our filtered list of eligible `case_id`s will suffice.

Here's how the SQL query would look:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        case_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **CTE (Common Table Expression) `case_counts`:** This part of the query calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counting the rows (`COUNT(*)`). The result is aliased as `event_count`.

- **CTE `filtered_cases`:** Here, we filter out cases from `case_counts` where the event count exceeds six. This leaves us with a list of `case_id`s that belong to cases having six or fewer events.

- **Final SELECT Statement:** We join back to the original `event_log` table (`el`) and specifically target rows where the `case_id` is in our list of filtered cases (`fc`). This ensures we only return events from cases with six or fewer activities, maintaining the integrity and completeness of each case's event set as per the requirement.

This approach efficiently isolates the desired subset of data while leveraging DuckDB's powerful SQL capabilities for grouping, filtering, and joining operations.
