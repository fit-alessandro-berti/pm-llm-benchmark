1. The high frequency of "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" followed by "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" indicates a recurring issue with approvals from the administration. This back-and-forth process results in delays and impacts performance.

2. The performance of the process significantly drops when a "Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" occurs. This suggests there may be miscommunication or lack of alignment between the employee and supervisor, leading to rejections and delays in the approval process.

3. Instances where the declaration is rejected multiple times by different parties (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE") indicate a lack of clear criteria or guidelines for approval, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in decision-making.

4. On the other hand, processes with fewer approval steps and straightforward approval paths (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR") tend to have higher performance metrics, indicating that streamlined processes lead to better outcomes.

5. The frequency of "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" without further action suggests a high number of unfinished or abandoned declarations, which can contribute to inefficiencies and lower overall performance of the process.

6. The performance drop in instances where the declaration is rejected by a missing entity (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING") indicates a lack of clarity or accountability in the approval hierarchy, leading to delays and potential bottlenecks in the process.
