This is a business process flow diagram showing multiple order processing workflows. The visualization displays five different item types at the top, each initiating their own process path:

**Starting Points (Item Types):**
- **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects) - green path
- **ReturnOrderItem** (0.6M objects) - red path  
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects) - purple path
- **SalesOrderItem** (8.5M objects) - orange path
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M objects) - blue path

**Key Features:**
- Each workflow is color-coded to match its item type
- Process steps are shown in rounded rectangles with activity names and overall volumes (e.g., "Create Order - Overall: 8.5M")
- Timing information is displayed on the connecting arrows (in milliseconds)
- The flows show various business activities including:
  - Order creation and approval
  - Stock checking
  - Payment processing
  - Goods packing and shipping
  - Invoice creation
  - Return processing

**Process Complexity:**
The diagram illustrates how different paths can merge and diverge - for example, multiple item types feed into common processes like "Approve Payment" (1.5M overall) and "Create Invoice" (2.0M overall). The visualization effectively shows both the sequence of activities and the performance metrics (time and volume) for what appears to be an order-to-cash or procurement process system.
