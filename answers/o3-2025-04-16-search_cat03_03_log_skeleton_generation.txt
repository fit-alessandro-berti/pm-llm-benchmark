The dictionary captures:

• a linear “happy-path” (Receive Order  …  Record Payment) through  
  `directly_follows`, `always_before`, and `always_after` constraints;  
• per-case cardinalities for each activity (`activ_freq`);  
• empty sets for `equivalence` and `never_together` because the narrative  
  did not specify twin-occurrence or mutual-exclusion behaviour.
