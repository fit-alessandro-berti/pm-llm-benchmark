This analysis separates deviations into strict normative violations (Part 1) and recommended desiderata failures (Part 2).

## 1. Normative Process Behavior Violations (Strict Rules)

Only Case 2 exhibits violations of the strict, required rules governing the process flow.

| Case ID | Violating Activity/Sequence | Normative Constraint Violated | Severity |
| :------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------- |
| **2**   | Risk Assessment (08:20) before Credit Check (09:00) | **Ordering Rule Violation:** Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. | Severe |
| **2**   | Finalize Documentation (10:00) after Loan Decision (Rejected) | **Decision Logic Violation:** Finalizing documentation is forbidden after a rejection. | Severe |

### Justifications for Normative Violations:

**Case 2:**
This case exhibits two critical failures:
1.  **Incorrect Precedence:** The process performed the **Risk Assessment** before the mandatory **Credit Check**. This violates the core sequence rule and means the risk assessment was conducted without the necessary prerequisite data.
2.  **Contradictory Action:** The loan was **Rejected**, yet the process subsequently executed **Finalize Documentation**. The strict rules state that if a loan is rejected, the case should close *without* finalizing documentation. This suggests a serious misconfiguration or manual override that ignored the rejection outcome.

**Case 1 & Case 3:**
These cases adhere perfectly to the required sequence and decision logic. While Case 3 had timing issues (covered below), the structure of its mandatory steps was correct.

## 2. Desiderata Failures (Recommended but Not Strict)

Cases 1 and 3 failed to meet one or more recommended best practices, but these failures do not break the formal process structure.

| Case ID | Desideratum Violated | Observation/Reason | Severity |
| :------ | :------------------- | :----------------- | :------- |
| **1**   | Follow-up Call       | No record of a Follow-up Call. | Minor |
| **3**   | Credit Check Timing  | CC occurred ~50 hours after Application Received (Target: $\le 24$ hrs). | Minor |
| **3**   | Information Timing   | Inform Applicant occurred >51 hours after Loan Decision (Target: $\le 48$ hrs). | Minor |
| **3**   | Follow-up Call       | No record of a Follow-up Call. | Minor |

### Interpretation and Justification for Desiderata Deviations:

**Case 3:**
Case 3 represents suboptimal performance concerning efficiency and communication timeliness:
1.  **Slow Initial Response:** The 50-hour delay for the Credit Check indicates significant lag time between the start of the process and the first analytical step.
2.  **Delayed Communication:** The delay of over two days in informing the applicant (IA at 15:00 on Day 5, LD at 12:00 on Day 3) means the applicant was kept waiting longer than the ideal 48-hour window after the decision was finalized internally.
3.  **Justification:** These failures are *not* severe process violations, as the hard sequence (CC $\rightarrow$ RA $\rightarrow$ LD) was followed. The observed behavior suggests potential resource bottlenecks or high workload during that period, slowing down the recommended performance standards.

**Case 1 & 2:**
The absence of a Follow-up Call in Case 1 and Case 2 is a failure to meet the optional recommendation to ensure alignment before closing. Since this step is not mandatory, its absence is merely a deviation from the ideal best practice.

## 3. Summary of Observed Behaviors

| Case ID | Normative Violations? (Hard Rules) | Desiderata Violations? (Soft Rules) | Overall Assessment |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **1**   | No                                 | Yes (No Follow-up Call)             | Compliant & High Quality |
| **2**   | Yes (Order Swap & Illegal Action)  | No specific timing check applicable | Failed Process Control |
| **3**   | No                                 | Yes (Timing delays & No Follow-up Call) | Structurally Correct but Inefficient |
