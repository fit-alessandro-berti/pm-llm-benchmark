Sure, let's create the two POWL models based on the description provided. We'll start with the model that includes potential unfairness, and then we will create the model without that unfairness.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching where one branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other branch leads to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity that gives a subtle advantage if the applicant is affiliated with a known local group.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop structure for data completeness check
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR structure for the cultural fit check
CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the main process model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
root.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitXOR)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, ensuring no special community-based branch exists.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop structure for data completeness check
DataLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the main process model
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, DataLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataLoop)
root.order.add_edge(DataLoop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Model with Potential Unfairness:**
   - The process includes an XOR branching after the "SkillAssessment" activity.
   - One branch leads to "CulturalFitCheck," and the other leads to "CommunityAffiliationCheck," which can introduce bias.

2. **Model Without Unfairness:**
   - The process does not include the XOR branching.
   - All applicants go through the "CulturalFitCheck" without any community-based advantages.

These models ensure that the workflows are represented accurately and highlight where potential bias can be introduced and how it can be removed.
