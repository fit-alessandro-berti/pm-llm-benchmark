To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we need to introduce constraints that ensure fairness and consistency in decision-making. Below is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to address potential biases based on sensitive attributes such as `ApplicantAge`, `ApplicantGender`, and `ApplicantRace`.

### Updated `declare_model` Dictionary

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - **Existence:** Ensures that `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` activities are part of the process, which can help in reviewing decisions involving sensitive attributes.
   - **Coexistence:** Ensures that `ManualReview` always coexists with decision steps involving sensitive demographics (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`). This ensures that decisions for sensitive groups are always reviewed manually.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - **Response:** Ensures that after checking sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` is performed. This helps in mitigating immediate biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.

3. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **Succession:** Ensures that decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) are only made after a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that decisions are made after considering potential biases.

4. **Non-Succession Constraints:**
   - **Non-Succession:** Prevents direct succession from sensitive attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`) to a `Reject` decision. This helps in avoiding immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

These constraints collectively ensure that the loan application process is fair and that decisions are not influenced by sensitive attributes without proper checks and reviews.
