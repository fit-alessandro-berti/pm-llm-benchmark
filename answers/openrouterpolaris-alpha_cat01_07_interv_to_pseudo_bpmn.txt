Below is a BPMN-style textual process model that can be directly converted into a diagram. I’ll use pools/lanes, tasks, gateways, and artifacts in a consistent, implementation-ready way. Where interviews diverge or are incomplete, I note it explicitly.

1. PARTICIPANTS (POOLS/LANES)

- Pool: Organization
  - Lane: Supplier
  - Lane: Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk - Mary)
  - Lane: Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor - Rita)
  - Lane: Purchasing (Dan / Purchasing Dept)
  - Lane: Department Manager (Manager - Carlos / relevant manager)
  - Lane: Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM - Karen)
  - Lane: Accounting System (System) [for notifications / workflow]

2. ARTIFACTS (DATA OBJECTS)

- Incoming Invoice (may be with or without PO number)
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Goods/Services Receipt Confirmation
- Invoice-PO Match Result (Matched / Discrepancy)
- Discrepancy Details (e.g., pricing, quantity, missing items, missing PO)
- Corrected Invoice (from Supplier)
- Manager Approval Decision (Approved / Rejected / On Hold)
- Payment Schedule Entry

3. MAIN PROCESS FLOW (STANDARD CASE)

Start Event: "Invoice Received from Supplier"

3.1 Invoice Receipt and Initial Check (AP Clerk)

1. Task (AP Clerk): "Receive Invoice"
   - Input: Incoming Invoice (typically via email).

2. Task (AP Clerk): "Check for PO Number on Invoice"

3. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "PO Number Present?"
   - If YES  proceed to Step 4.
   - If NO  go to 3.2 (No / Missing PO Path).

4. Task (AP Clerk): "Log Invoice in Accounting System"
   - Output: Invoice recorded with referenced PO.

5. Task (AP Clerk): "Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation"
   - Mechanism: Email or System workflow to Purchasing.

3.2 Receipt / Fulfillment Confirmation (Purchasing)

6. Task (Purchasing): "Verify Goods/Services Against PO and Delivery"
   - Checks: quantities, prices, delivery charges, receipt of goods/services.
   - Input: Invoice, PO, (if available) delivery/receipt info.

7. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Invoice Details Consistent with PO and Receipt?"
   - If YES  Step 8.
   - If NO  go to 4.1 (Discrepancy Handling).

8. Task (Purchasing): "Send Confirmation to AP"
   - Output: Confirmation that goods/services received and invoice consistent.

9. Task (AP Clerk): "Perform 3-Way/2-Way Match in System"
   - Compare: Invoice vs PO (and receipt confirmation).
   - Note: In practice, this may be partially redundant with Step 6 but is explicitly mentioned by Mary as a system-based match.

10. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Successful Match?"
    - If YES  Step 11.
    - If NO  go to 4.1 (Discrepancy Handling).

3.3 Manager Approval

11. Intermediate Event (System): "Trigger Manager Approval Request"
    - Task (System): "Send Approval Notification to Department Manager"
    - Condition: Triggered only after:
      - Goods/services confirmed; AND
      - Invoice matches PO (per Mary and Carlos).

12. Task (Manager): "Review Invoice, PO, and Confirmation"

13. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Manager Approval Decision"
    - If APPROVED  Step 14.
    - If REJECTED or ON HOLD  go to 4.2 (Manager Rejection / Hold).

14. Task (AP Clerk): "Schedule Invoice for Payment"
    - Input: Manager Approval Decision = Approved.
    - Output: Payment Schedule Entry.

End Event: "Invoice Scheduled for Payment"

4. EXCEPTIONS AND VARIATIONS

4.1 Discrepancy Handling (Pricing/Quantity/Extra Units/Other Mismatch)

(Triggered from:
- Step 7 = NO (Purchasing finds mismatch), or
- Step 10 = NO (AP match fails).)

A. Task (AP Clerk): "Notify Purchasing of Discrepancy"
   - Or: respond to Purchasing notification to hold invoice.
   - Data: Discrepancy Details.

B. Task (Purchasing): "Investigate Discrepancy"
   - Actions (may include):
     - Contact Supplier directly; OR
     - Request AP Clerk to hold invoice until corrected; OR
     - Consult SRM for contract/terms verification (see 4.3).
   - Output: Resolution Proposal (e.g., corrected invoice requested, confirmation of correct price, etc.).

C. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Can Discrepancy Be Resolved Easily?"
   - If YES:
     - Task (Supplier, possibly via SRM): "Issue Corrected Invoice or Confirm Correct Terms"
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Update/Relog Invoice as Needed and Repeat Matching"
       - Then return to Step 9 (Perform Match)  follow standard flow.
   - If NO:
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Escalate Case to AP Supervisor"
       - Move to 4.1.D.

D. Task (AP Supervisor): "Coordinate Resolution of Escalated Discrepancy"
   - Actions may include:
     - Contact Supplier (directly).
     - Coordinate with Purchasing.
     - Coordinate with SRM.
     - Consult department heads.
   - Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Final Resolution Outcome?"
     - If "Invoice Accepted with Adjustments / Corrected Invoice Received":
       - Task (AP Clerk): "Update Invoice Record"
       - Then go to Step 9 (Perform Match)  normal flow continues.
     - If "Invoice to Be Rejected":
       - Task (AP Supervisor or AP Clerk): "Notify Supplier of Rejection"
       - End Event: "Invoice Rejected – Process Terminated"

Note: Interviews indicate that unresolved or complex discrepancies are not approved; they must be cleared before manager approval.

4.2 Manager Rejection / Hold

(Triggered from Step 13 if Manager does NOT approve.)

A. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "Manager Action Type"
   - If REJECT:
     - Task (Manager): "Record Rejection Reason in System"
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Notify Supplier and/or Relevant Department"
     - End Event: "Invoice Rejected – Process Terminated"
   - If REQUEST HOLD / INVESTIGATION:
     - Task (Manager): "Request Hold / Further Investigation (to AP Clerk)"
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Investigate or Route to AP Supervisor / Purchasing / SRM as Needed"
       - This flows into discrepancy resolution steps (4.1 B–D).
       - After resolution, process returns to:
         - Step 11 (Trigger Manager Approval Request again) or
         - Directly Step 12 (Manager Review), depending on system capability.

4.3 Missing PO Number (No-PO or Unclear-PO Scenarios)

(Triggered from Step 3 if PO Number Present = NO, or when Purchasing flags missing PO.)

A. Task (AP Clerk): "Request PO Information from Supplier"
   - Output: Request for correct PO or clarifying details.

B. Exclusive Gateway (XOR): "PO Information Received from Supplier?"
   - If YES:
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Update Invoice with PO Number and Log in System"
     - Then proceed to Step 5 (Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation).
   - If NO (no valid PO provided or delay/issue):
     - Task (AP Clerk): "Escalate to AP Supervisor"
       - Move to 4.3.C.

C. Task (AP Supervisor): "Determine Handling of No-PO Invoice"
   - Options:
     - Work with department heads to:
       - Task: "Create Retrospective PO" (if legitimate service delivered).
         - Then:
           - Task (AP Clerk): "Link Invoice to Retrospective PO and Log"
           - Proceed to Step 5 (Forward to Purchasing).
     - OR decide invoice should be rejected:
       - Task (AP Supervisor or AP Clerk): "Notify Supplier of Rejection"
       - End Event: "Invoice Rejected – Missing/Invalid PO"

Note: Purchasing Officer (Dan) states: "We never approve anything without a confirmed PO reference." This is modeled as a rule enforced via this branch.

4.4 Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM) Involvement

- Trigger: Any discrepancy related to:
  - Missing PO where supplier clarification is needed.
  - Pricing not aligned with contract.
  - Repeated supplier issues.

A. Task (AP Clerk / Purchasing / AP Supervisor): "Request SRM Assistance"

B. Task (SRM): "Validate Terms Against Supplier Contract and Contact Supplier if Needed"
   - Determine correct PO / pricing / terms.
   - Output: Clarified Terms / Instruction (to AP / Purchasing / AP Supervisor).

C. Sequence:
   - After SRM provides clarification, control returns to discrepancy resolution flow (4.1 B–D or 4.3 C), then back to normal flow (Step 9 onward).

5. SYSTEM BEHAVIOR (CLARIFICATION)

- System stores:
  - Logged invoices.
  - PO references.
  - Match results.
  - Approval/rejection statuses.
- System sends:
  - Manager approval notification after match and receipt confirmation (Step 11).
- Ambiguity/Assumption:
  - Whether Purchasing confirmation is recorded in system or via email is not fully specified; model assumes either is acceptable as long as confirmation exists before manager approval.
  - After Manager approval, invoice returns (logically or system-routed) to AP for payment scheduling (Steps 14 and End).

6. KEY DECISION / GATEWAY SUMMARY

- G1: PO Number Present?
- G2: Invoice Consistent with PO and Receipt? (Purchasing)
- G3: Successful System Match? (AP)
- G4: Discrepancy Easily Resolved or Requires Escalation?
- G5: Outcome of Escalated Discrepancy? (Accept / Reject)
- G6: Manager Approval Decision? (Approve / Reject / Hold)
- G7: PO Info Received for No-PO Invoice?
- G8: No-PO Handling Outcome? (Retrospective PO & proceed / Reject)

If you’d like, next I can express this in a compact, pseudo-BPMN notation (e.g., as a linear list of nodes with IDs and flows) ready for direct import or drawing.
