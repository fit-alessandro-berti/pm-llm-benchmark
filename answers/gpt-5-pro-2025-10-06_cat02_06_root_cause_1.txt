Here’s what stands out from the log.

1) Which cases are significantly longer
- Typical/fast baseline (from Receive to Close): 
  - Case 101: 2h 15m
  - Case 103: 1h 20m
- Outliers:
  - Case 102: 25h 10m
  - Case 104: 24h 10m
  - Case 105: 49h 5m

2) Where the time is lost (key waits per outlier)
- Case 102 (25h 10m)
  - Assign  Escalate: 2h 30m
  - Escalate  Investigate: 2h 30m
  - Investigate  Resolve: 19h (overnight)
- Case 104 (24h 10m)
  - Assign  Investigate: 3h 30m
  - Investigate  Resolve: 19h (overnight)
- Case 105 (49h 5m)
  - Investigate (L1)  Escalate: 50m (rework loop starts)
  - Escalate  Investigate (L2): 28h (very long L2 pickup)
  - Investigate  Resolve: 19h (overnight)

3) Likely root causes and how they drive cycle time
- Slow Level-2 pickup after escalation
  - Cases 102 and 105 both wait hours to a full day after escalation before L2 starts “Investigate.” Each handoff adds queue time; in Case 105 it’s the single biggest driver (28h).
- Overnight/shift-boundary delays after “Investigate”
  - In all long cases, Investigate finishes in the afternoon and Resolve happens around 09:00 next day (~19h gap). This looks like a staffing/coverage or scheduling constraint (workday cutoff, change window, or customer availability).
- Delays before the first investigation
  - Case 104 waits 3h 30m from Assign to Investigate (vs 15–40m in fast cases). This suggests L1 queueing/backlog or prioritization issues.
- Rework loop on escalated tickets
  - Case 105 has two “Investigate Issue” activities (L1 then L2), adding handoff delay plus duplicate effort.
- Triage variability (minor contributor compared to the above)
  - Receive  Triage ranges from 5m to 40m; notable in Case 104 but small relative to day-long waits.

4) Recommendations to reduce cycle time
- Tighten escalation handling
  - Target Escalate  L2 Investigate within 1 hour (SLA). Add live handoffs or paging for L2. Provide cross-site/on-call coverage to avoid day-boundary waits.
- Start investigations earlier and avoid end-of-day carryover
  - Set an SLA for Assign  first Investigate (e.g., 60m). Auto-flag tickets after midday that risk crossing the end-of-day and prioritize them to start before cut-off.
- Reduce rework/late escalations
  - Strengthen L1 triage and playbooks to identify likely L2 issues upfront; encourage faster escalate decisions when criteria are met. Provide rapid consultation channels (L1–L2 swarming) to avoid “investigate-then-escalate” loops.
- Capacity and scheduling
  - Balance L1/L2 staffing to handle afternoon peaks; consider extended hours or follow-the-sun support so Investigate can lead to same-day Resolve.
- Instrument and monitor the right metrics
  - Time to first Investigate (Receive  Investigate)
  - Escalation pickup time (Escalate  L2 Investigate)
  - Post-investigation lag (Investigate  Resolve), especially those crossing end-of-day
  - Auto-alert when any of the above breach thresholds

In short: the outliers (102, 104, 105) are driven by escalation handoff delays, long pre-investigation waits, and consistent overnight gaps between Investigate and Resolve. Addressing L2 pickup speed, preventing late starts, and improving triage/escalation quality should materially reduce end-to-end cycle times.
