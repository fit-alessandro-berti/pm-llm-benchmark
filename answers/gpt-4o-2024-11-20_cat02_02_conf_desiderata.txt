### **Analysis**

---

### **1. Normative Rule Violations (Severe Issues)**
Cases that breach the **strict sequence of activities** or violate any of the **ordering rules** represent normative violations. These are **serious issues** and are **not allowed** in the process.

#### **Case 1**
- **No Violations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  The sequential process was followed correctly:  
  - `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`.  
  There are no steps skipped, out of sequence, or contradictory actions (e.g., documentation was only finalized after loan approval).

#### **Case 2**
- **Violations Detected:**  
  1. **Risk Assessment Occurred Before Credit Check.**  
     - This violates the normative rule: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."  
   
  2. **Finalize Documentation Performed After Loan Rejection.**  
     - This violates the normative rule: "If the loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."

- **Explanation:**  
  This process completely ignored the mandatory ordering by performing **Risk Assessment** prematurely (without conducting a preceding **Credit Check**) and went on to improperly finalize documentation despite the loan being rejected.

#### **Case 3**
- **No Violations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  The activities respected the normative rules—steps were followed in the correct order, and no contradictory actions occurred. The delays in Credit Check and informing the applicant are **only desiderata issues** and do not constitute normative violations.

### **2. Desiderata Deviation (Suboptimal Behavior)**
Violating desiderata conditions such as timing recommendations or skipping a follow-up call does not represent a serious issue but signifies **opportunities for improvement** within the process.

#### **Case 1**
- **No Deviations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  - The **Credit Check** occurred promptly (within 24 hours of receiving the application).  
  - The **Inform Applicant** step happened quickly (within 48 hours of the loan decision).  
  - Following the rules, the case was promptly closed.  

#### **Case 2**
- **No Deviations.**
- **Explanation:**  
  Timing-wise, all activities were conducted promptly within the desirable timeframes. While it suffered from **normative violations**, there were no **desideratum-specific delays** or missed steps like a Follow-up Call.

#### **Case 3**
- **Deviations Detected:**  
  1. **Credit Check occurred after 24 hours (Late).**  
     - Ideally, the **Credit Check** should be performed within 24 hours of receiving the application (occurred 2 days later instead).  
     
  2. **Inform Applicant occurred after 48 hours of the Loan Decision (Late).**  
     - Informing the applicant ideally should occur within 48 hours of the loan decision (took around 4 days instead).  
     
  3. **No Follow-up Call was performed.**  
     - While this is recommended, it is not a strict requirement and does not invalidate the process.

- **Explanation:**  
  All these issues represent slightly suboptimal behavior. However, the process still adhered to normative rules, and these deviations do not indicate serious process failures.

### **3. Suggested Interpretations and Justifications**

#### **Case 1 Explanation:**
- A **well-executed case** with strict compliance to rules and good adherence to timing recommendations.  
- Likely reflects an efficient and properly functioning system.

#### **Case 2 Explanation:**
- This case suffers from significant **violations of normative rules**, indicating incorrect process execution.  
- The premature **Risk Assessment** might have resulted from miscommunication or incorrect information flow.  
- The improper **documentation finalization** after rejection suggests an **oversight or misunderstanding of rules**.  
- Recommendation: Conduct team training or establish stricter automated controls to flag violations.

#### **Case 3 Explanation:**
- While the process respected all normative rules, some timing desiderata were not met.  
- The **late Credit Check** could suggest workload issues or prioritization delays (e.g., resource constraints).  
- The **delay in informing the applicant** might point to further inefficiencies or procedural bottlenecks.  
- The missing **Follow-up Call** might be due to oversight or deeming it unnecessary in practice.  
- Recommendation: Investigate procedural timelines and resource allocation to improve efficiency.

| 2       | **Yes**                        | **No**                                                  | Two serious rule violations.              |
| 3       | **No**                         | **Yes** (late Credit Check, late Inform Applicant, no follow-up call) | Timing delays and missed best practices. |

### **Conclusion**
- **Case 1** demonstrates **ideal execution**.  
- **Case 2** poses **severe normative compliance risks** that need corrective measures.  
- **Case 3** follows the rules but highlights **opportunities for improvement** in process efficiency and adherence to suggested best practices.
