Okay, I need to construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process described. Let me break down the steps and figure out how to model each part.

First, the process starts when a customer files an Insurance Claim (C). So, I'll need a place to represent the start, maybe called "start". The initial marking will have a token here.

Next, the first activity is Claim Registration (CR). So, I'll create a transition for CR. After CR, the process moves to Document Verification (DV). So, after the CR transition, there should be a place for DV.

After DV, there's a possibility of re-submitting documents, which is Re-Document Submission (RDS). So, if documents are incomplete, the process loops back. I'll need a place after DV that can either go to RDS or proceed to Fraud Check (FC). Wait, no—after DV, if documents are incomplete, the process goes to RDS, and then back to DV again. So, the transition for DV should have an output place that leads to either RDS or FC. But wait, the problem says after DV, if incomplete, RDS happens before continuing. So, the flow is DV  RDS  DV again, until documents are complete, then proceed to FC.

Similarly, after FC, if there are doubts, an In-depth Investigation (II) is performed, which can happen multiple times. So, FC leads to a place that can go to II or proceed to CA. So, after FC, if issues, go to II, then back to FC for rechecking.

So, I'll model each activity as a transition, with places in between to represent the states.

Let me list the transitions:

- C (Insurance Claim) - but wait, the first step is Claim Registration (CR), so maybe C is just the start event, so the transition CR comes after the start place.

So transitions are: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Wait, but the process is: after C, CR happens. So the start place is "start", which is the initial state. The first transition is CR, which takes the token from start to a place, say "after_CR".

Then, after_CR leads to DV transition. So:

start -> CR -> after_CR -> DV -> after_DV.

But after_DV, there's a decision: if documents incomplete, go to RDS, else proceed to FC.

Wait, in Petri nets, transitions are active components, places are passive. So, the structure would be:

- Transition CR: takes token from start, produces token in after_CR.

- Transition DV: takes token from after_CR, produces token in after_DV.

Now, after_DV can have two possible paths: one leading to RDS (if documents incomplete), and another leading directly to FC (if documents are complete). So, after_DV is a place that is the input to both RDS and FC transitions? Or perhaps, after_DV is connected to a transition that decides, but since in Petri nets, transitions are not decision points, we need to model the choice with appropriate arcs.

Wait, no, in Petri nets, transitions can have multiple outgoing arcs, but each arc has a condition based on the state. So, perhaps after_DV is connected to RDS and FC transitions. But that might not capture the loop correctly.

Alternatively, after_DV, we can have a transition that represents the decision: if incomplete, go to RDS, else proceed. But in the given problem, it's possible that RDS can happen multiple times. So, after DV, if RDS is needed, the token goes to RDS, which then loops back to DV. Otherwise, it proceeds to FC.

So, the structure would be:

after_DV place has two outgoing arcs: one to RDS transition, and another to FC transition. But wait, transitions consume tokens from their input places. So, if after_DV has a token, it can enable either RDS or FC. But that might not be correct because the choice is based on some condition (incomplete documents or not). Since Petri nets don't have guards, we can model the possibility by having both transitions. So, the token can be consumed by either transition, but in the context of the process, only one should be taken based on the condition. But in the Petri net model, both possibilities are allowed.

So, I'll proceed by connecting after_DV to both RDS and FC transitions. Thus, after_DV is an input to both. Then, RDS transition would produce a token back to DV's input place, creating a loop. So, RDS would have an outgoing arc to the place before DV, which is after_CR? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the process after DV is:

- If documents incomplete: RDS happens, then back to DV.

So, after_DV is a place. From there, if RDS is executed, then it should go back to the state before DV, which is after_CR. Wait, no, because after DV, if RDS is done, the documents are resubmitted, and then DV is done again. So, the flow is:

DV  RDS  DV.

So, after_DV is connected to RDS, which produces a token to a place that leads back to DV. So, RDS transition's output is the same as the input to DV, which is after_CR.

Wait, perhaps after_DV is connected to RDS, and RDS's output is a place that is the input to DV. So, after_DV  RDS  after_RDS, which is the same as after_CR.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, after_DV can have an arc to RDS, and RDS's output is a place that connects back to the input of DV, which is after_CR.

Wait, the place after_CR is the input to DV. So, if RDS's output is after_CR, then when RDS is executed, it puts a token back into after_CR, allowing DV to be executed again.

Yes, that makes sense. So:

- after_DV is a place.

- It has an outgoing arc to RDS transition.

- RDS transition has an outgoing arc to after_CR.

So, when RDS is executed, the token from after_DV is consumed, and a token is placed in after_CR, which is the input to DV. Thus, DV can be re-executed.

Similarly, after_DV also has an outgoing arc to FC transition, which when executed, consumes the token and produces one in after_FC.

So, after_DV can either go to RDS (looping back) or FC (proceeding).

Similarly, after FC, there's a possibility of II. So, after_FC is a place that can lead to II or CA.

So, after_FC has two outgoing arcs: one to II transition and one to CA transition.

When II is executed, it should loop back to FC. So, II's output is after_FC? No, because after II, the process goes back to FC. So, II's output should be the input to FC, which is after_FC.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

- FC transition is executed when there's a token in after_DV (if documents are complete) or after II.

Wait, no. The process is: after DV, if documents are complete, go to FC. Then, after FC, if fraud is suspected, go to II, which then loops back to FC.

So, after_FC is a place that can either go to II or CA.

So, after_FC has two outgoing arcs: one to II transition and one to CA transition.

II transition's output is back to the input of FC, which is after_DV? Or wait, FC's input is after_DV, but II's output should be the input to FC again. So, II's output is after_FC.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

- FC transition takes a token from after_DV (if documents are complete) or from after_II.

Wait, no. Let me structure it step by step.

The process flow is:

start  CR  after_CR  DV  after_DV.

After_DV can go to RDS or FC.

If RDS: after_DV  RDS  after_RDS (which is after_CR, allowing DV again).

If FC: after_DV  FC  after_FC.

After_FC can go to II or CA.

If II: after_FC  II  after_II (which is after_FC, allowing FC again).

If CA: proceed.

Wait, that doesn't loop correctly. Because after II, we need to go back to FC, not stay in after_FC.

So, perhaps after_FC is connected to II, and II's output is back to after_DV? No, because after FC, if II is done, the process should re-examine FC.

Wait, I think the correct structure is:

- FC transition: input is after_DV, output is after_FC.

- II transition: input is after_FC, output is after_DV? No, that would create a loop between FC and II, but that's not correct because after II, the process should go back to FC, not DV.

Wait, no. The process after FC is: if fraud check raises doubts, perform II, then go back to FC. So, FC  II  FC.

So, FC's output is after_FC, which is connected to II. II's output is back to after_FC? That can't be because that would create a loop where II can be executed multiple times, but after_FC is the same place.

Alternatively, after_FC is connected to II, and II's output is the same as FC's input, which is after_DV. But that would mean that after II, the process goes back to after_DV, which is the state after DV, which is correct because after II, the claim goes back to FC.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The process after FC is:

- If FC finds issues, perform II, then re-do FC.

So, the flow is FC  II  FC.

Thus, FC's output is after_FC, which is connected to II. II's output is the input to FC, which is after_DV. So, after II, the token goes back to after_DV, which then can trigger FC again.

But wait, after_DV is a place that can trigger either FC or RDS. So, if II's output is after_DV, then after II, the process is back to after_DV, which could again choose between FC or RDS. But in the scenario, after II, the process should go back to FC, not RDS. So, this approach might not capture that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I need to model it differently. Maybe after_FC, the token can either go to II or CA. So, after_FC is connected to both II and CA transitions.

When II is executed, it should produce a token that allows FC to be executed again. So, II's output is a place that leads to FC. But FC's input is after_DV, so perhaps II's output is after_DV.

Wait, that would mean that after II, the process is back to after_DV, which can then go to FC again. But in that case, after_DV could also go to RDS, which might not be intended because after FC, the process is in a state where it's dealing with fraud, not documents.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should structure the net so that after FC, the token is in after_FC, which can go to II or CA. If II is taken, then II's output is back to after_FC, allowing FC to be re-executed. But that would mean that after_FC is both the input and output of II, which might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after_FC is connected to II, and II's output is a new place, say after_II, which then connects back to FC. So, II  after_II  FC. But FC's input is after_DV, so after_II would need to connect to after_DV. Wait, that might not make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a pattern. This seems like a subprocess where after FC, if certain conditions are met, II is performed, which can be done multiple times before proceeding. So, this is a loop between FC and II.

In Petri nets, a loop can be modeled by having the transition II output to the same place that feeds into FC. So, perhaps after_FC is connected to II, and II's output is a place that feeds into FC. But FC's input is after_DV, so II's output must be after_DV.

Wait, that would mean that after II, the token goes back to after_DV, which is the state after DV. So, after II, the process is back to after_DV, which can then go to FC again. That seems correct because after II, the claim is re-examined in FC.

So, the structure would be:

- after_DV  FC  after_FC.

- after_FC  II  after_DV.

This way, after II, the token is back in after_DV, allowing FC to be re-executed.

But wait, after_DV can also lead to RDS, which is a separate loop. So, in after_DV, if RDS is taken, it loops back to after_CR, which leads to DV again. If FC is taken, it can loop through II and back to after_DV, which then can go to FC again or RDS again.

This seems correct because after II, the process is back to after_DV, which can choose between FC or RDS, but in the scenario, after II, it should go back to FC. However, in the Petri net, both options are possible, but the process logic would determine which is taken based on conditions. Since the Petri net is just modeling the possible flows, it's acceptable to have both options.

So, moving on. After FC, whether through II looping or not, eventually, the process proceeds to CA. So, after_FC can also go to CA.

So, after_FC has two outgoing arcs: to II and to CA.

When CA is executed, it produces a token in after_CA.

Then, after_CA leads to AP if the amount is high, else proceeds to P.

Wait, the problem says: Approval (AP) is needed if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So, after CA, if the amount is high, go to AP, else go directly to P.

So, similar to previous steps, after_CA can have two outgoing arcs: one to AP and one to P.

But wait, in the scenario, after CA is assessment, then approval if needed, then payment.

So, perhaps the flow is:

CA  after_CA.

after_CA can go to AP or directly to P.

If AP is taken, then after_AP leads to P.

So:

after_CA  AP  after_AP  P.

after_CA can also directly go to P if no approval needed.

Wait, but the problem says approval is needed only if the amount surpasses a threshold. So, perhaps after_CA, the process can choose between AP and P, but in reality, it's conditional.

But in the Petri net, we can model both possibilities, so after_CA is connected to both AP and P.

But that might not capture the correct sequence because P should come after AP if approval is needed. So, perhaps after_CA is connected to AP, and after_AP is connected to P. Additionally, after_CA can be connected directly to P, bypassing AP.

So, the structure is:

after_CA  AP  after_AP  P.

and

after_CA  P.

But that would mean that P can be executed before AP, which is incorrect. Because AP should only happen if the amount is high, and P comes after AP or directly after CA if no approval is needed.

Wait, perhaps the correct flow is:

after_CA  (AP if needed)  after_AP  P.

So, if approval is needed, CA  AP  P.

If not, CA  P.

So, in the Petri net:

- after_CA is a place that can enable AP or P.

But wait, that's not correct because P should only come after AP if approval is needed. So, perhaps after_CA is connected to AP, and after_AP is connected to P. Additionally, after_CA is connected directly to P, but that would allow P to be executed without AP, which is correct when approval is not needed.

So, yes, that's acceptable.

Then, after P is executed, the token goes to after_P, which leads to N (Notification).

So, after_P  N  after_N  CL.

CL is the closure, which is the final step.

So, putting it all together:

Places:

- start

- after_CR

- after_DV

- after_RDS (same as after_CR)

- after_FC

- after_CA

- after_AP

- after_P

- after_N

- after_CL (which is the final place)

Wait, but the final marking is when the claim is closed, so the final place is after_CL.

But let's see:

- The initial marking is a token in start.

- The final marking is a token in after_CL.

So, the transitions and places would be:

Transitions:

1. CR: start  after_CR

2. DV: after_CR  after_DV

3. RDS: after_DV  after_CR

4. FC: after_DV  after_FC

5. II: after_FC  after_DV

6. CA: after_FC  after_CA

7. AP: after_CA  after_AP

8. P: after_CA  after_P and after_AP  after_P

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

After CA is after_CA.

From after_CA, if approval needed, go to AP, then to P.

If not, go directly to P.

So, transitions:

- AP: after_CA  after_AP

- P: after_AP  after_P and after_CA  after_P

Wait, that's not correct because P can be reached from both after_CA and after_AP. So, in the Petri net, P would have two input places: after_CA and after_AP. So, P is a transition that can be triggered from either place.

But in reality, P should come after AP, which comes after CA if needed.

So, in the net:

- after_CA  AP  after_AP  P  after_P  N  after_N  CL  after_CL.

And also, after_CA  P  after_P.

This way, if approval is needed, the path is CA  AP  P. If not, CA  P.

But in the net, P would have two input places: after_CA and after_AP. So, when a token is in after_CA, P can fire, producing a token in after_P. Similarly, when a token is in after_AP, P can fire.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the transitions are:

- CR

- DV

- RDS

- FC

- II

- CA

- AP

- P

- N

- CL

The places are:

- start

- after_CR

- after_DV

- after_FC

- after_CA

- after_AP

- after_P

- after_N

- after_CL

Additionally, after_RDS is the same as after_CR because RDS leads back to DV, which is after_CR.

Wait, no. RDS transition's output is after_CR, which is the same place that DV's input comes from. So, RDS: after_DV  after_CR.

Yes.

Similarly, II transition's output is after_DV, which is the input to FC.

Wait, no. II: after_FC  after_DV.

Yes.

So, the places are:

start, after_CR, after_DV, after_FC, after_CA, after_AP, after_P, after_N, after_CL.

Now, let's outline the arcs:

- CR: start  after_CR

- DV: after_CR  after_DV

- RDS: after_DV  after_CR

- FC: after_DV  after_FC

- II: after_FC  after_DV

- CA: after_FC  after_CA

- AP: after_CA  after_AP

- P: after_CA  after_P

- P: after_AP  after_P

- N: after_P  after_N

- CL: after_N  after_CL

Yes, that should cover all the transitions and places.

Now, the initial marking (im) is a token in start.

The final marking (fm) is a token in after_CL.

So, in the code, I'll create all the places and transitions, set up the arcs as described.

Let me write the code step by step.

First, import the necessary modules.

Then, create the PetriNet object.

Add all the places: start, after_CR, after_DV, after_FC, after_CA, after_AP, after_P, after_N, after_CL.

Add all the transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Then, create the arcs using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to.

Set the initial marking im with a token in start.

Set the final marking fm with a token in after_CL.

Wait, but in the example provided in the prompt, the final step was to remove the sink place and delete it from fm. So, in our case, we need to ensure that the final place is part of the net and included in fm.

But in our case, after_CL is the final place, so it should be added to the net and included in fm.

So, the code would look like this:

Import the necessary modules.

Create the net.

Add places: start, after_CR, etc.

Add transitions: CR, DV, etc.

Add arcs as per the structure.

Set initial and final markings.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the code accordingly.
</think>

To model the insurance claim management process as an accepting Petri net, we define places to represent states between activities and transitions for each activity. The Petri net includes loops for re-document submission and in-depth investigation. The initial marking starts with a token in the "start" place, and the final marking is a token in the "closed" place.
