Below is a compact, “plain-English” walk-through of the loan-approval life-cycle that satisfies every rule encoded in the DECLARE model, together with an explanation of why each rule exists and what could go wrong if it were broken.

----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Application intake (init + existence)  
   • Activity executed: Receive Application  
   • Why required? Nothing can happen until the bank has a formal request in its system; it also creates the case identifier that all later events are tied to.  
   • Forbidden sibling: Proceed Without Compliance must never appear at any point in the trace (absence).  Doing so would constitute a regulatory breach.

2. Initial risk triage (response, exactly_one, chainprecedence)  
   • Activity executed: Preliminary Credit Check (must occur exactly once).  
   • Constraint logic  
     – The response rule says every application is eventually followed by this credit check.  
     – The exactly_one rule blocks redundant or conflicting checks.  
     – The chain-precedence rule (Authorize Contract Terms must be immediately preceded by this credit check) locks the two together so that the “green-light” produced by the check cannot be re-used for a later, unrelated contract.  
   • Motivation: credit checks are mandated by lending regulation (fair-lending, anti-fraud, capital-adequacy).

3. Collect supporting evidence (succession, coexistence, altsuccession)  
   • Activity executed: Gather Additional Documents  
   • Constraint logic  
     – The succession rule obliges the bank to ask for documents only after the applicant has passed the basic credit gate.  
     – The coexistence rule means that, if extra documents are gathered, the case must also reach Authorize Contract Terms, guaranteeing the effort was not wasted.  
     – The alt-succession rule forces a Quality Assurance Review somewhere after the documents are in, ensuring that what was collected is complete and authentic.  
   • Motivation: prevents unnecessary KYC overhead and guarantees that QA sees everything it needs.

4. Quality gate (precedence, chainsuccession, responded_existence)  
   • Activity executed: Quality Assurance Review  
   • Constraint logic  
     – Precedence says QA must happen before the final authorization, so defects are caught early.  
     – Chain-succession forces Assemble Loan Offer Package to occur immediately after QA; nothing else can sneak in and tamper with what QA already checked.  
     – Responded-existence ensures that if the offer package is ever assembled, QA has indeed occurred in the same case.  
   • Motivation: internal controls, four-eyes principles, auditability.

5. Build the customer-facing offer (chainresponse)  
   • Activity executed: Assemble Loan Offer Package  
   • Constraint logic – Chain-response forces Transfer Funds to follow next; once the binding package is produced, disbursement must be the very next operational step.  
   • Motivation: eliminates “limbo” states where a signed offer sits unchanged in the system (a fraud risk and a customer-experience problem).

6. Disbursement of the loan (altresponse, non-coexistence)  
   • Activity executed: Transfer Funds  
   • Constraint logic  
     – Alt-response says every funds transfer must be followed (eventually) by Notify Customer, guaranteeing transparency.  
     – Non-coexistence with Receive Application blocks anyone from trying to pay out money in the very same trace where an application has not yet been created (i.e., no “instant disbursement” without a case).  
   • Motivation: prevents accidental or malicious payouts, satisfies money-laundering rules that insist the customer be told about any movement of funds.

7. Customer communication (altprecedence, nonsuccession, nonchainsuccession)  
   • Activity executed: Notify Customer  
   • Constraint logic  
     – Alt-precedence says that a notification is always preceded at some point by a funds transfer—no premature e-mails promising money that has not yet left the bank.  
     – Nonsuccession blocks any credit check after the customer has been notified; the decision is final.  
     – Non-chain-succession prevents Notify Customer from being the very next step after Authorize Contract Terms, ensuring the additional QA  Assemble  Funds pathway is honoured first.  
   • Motivation: clear, correct, and irreversible customer messaging (consumer-protection and reputation).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Real-world consequences of violating key constraints

• Skipping the Preliminary Credit Check (violating existence/response/chain-precedence) risks lending to ineligible or fraudulent applicants, triggering capital-adequacy breaches and heavy fines.

• Performing Transfer Funds before QA or before the Offer Package exists (violating chain-succession / chain-response) could mean the bank pays out on terms that were never double-checked, leading to financial loss or litigation.

• Not notifying the customer (breaking alt-response) violates consumer-protection statutes and undermines trust.

• Executing Proceed Without Compliance, the forbidden activity, would constitute a wilful disregard of statutory rules. In practice this could lead to license revocation, criminal penalties for managers, and reputational collapse.

• If Notify Customer were followed by a late Preliminary Credit Check (breaking nonsuccession), the customer could receive a “loan approved” message only to find it reversed later—an obvious PR disaster.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Why the rules make operational sense

1. Risk management: Early, single-shot credit checks plus QA gates keep bad loans out.  
2. Regulatory compliance: The model enforces KYC, AML, and fair-lending checkpoints.  
3. Fraud prevention: Immediate sequencing (chains) leaves no loophole where data can be changed after it is validated.  
4. Customer experience: The alt-precedence/alt-response pair guarantees that the customer is informed promptly, but only after money is actually on its way.  
5. Efficiency: Coexistence and succession rules avoid wasted work—activities that start must always lead somewhere useful (e.g., gathering documents always leads to authorization).

In short, the DECLARE model encodes a “safety net” of temporal, cardinality, and mutual-exclusion constraints that steer every loan case from first contact to final payout without skipping gates, looping indefinitely, or violating compliance law.
