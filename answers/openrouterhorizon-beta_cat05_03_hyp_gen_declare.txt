Anomalies in the DECLARE model
1) Contradiction between responded_existence(E  A) and the intended flow:
- Responded existence on E with target A means: if E occurs, A must occur somewhere in the trace (order not enforced). This allows E to happen before A, which violates the intended sequence R  A  E  P  N  C.
- If the intended logic is “E only after A,” the correct constraint should be precedence(E  A) or response(A  E), not responded existence.

2) Contradiction between noncoexistence(E, C) and precedence(C  R) plus existence(C):
- Existence(C) forces C to occur in every trace.
- Noncoexistence(E, C) forbids E and C from appearing together.
- Therefore, any trace containing E would violate noncoexistence because C is mandatory. This effectively bans E in any valid trace, which contradicts the intended flow (E is a core step).

3) Init(R) with precedence(C  R) is compatible but incomplete:
- Init enforces R as first event; precedence(C  R) then adds that R must precede C. While not contradictory, it is redundant given init(R) and does not secure the rest of the sequence.

4) Missing obligations for P and N:
- No existence or response/precedence constraints ensuring P and N occur after E, and before C. This allows traces like R  A  C, which undermines the intended process.

5) Weakening of assignment-evaluation order:
- As noted in (1), responded_existence(E  A) allows evaluation without a prior assignment, which is business-incoherent for claims requiring an adjuster.

6) Lack of resource-role coupling:
- No constraints link E/P to adjusters with appropriate specialization or to the same adjuster who was assigned, enabling inconsistent resources to perform key activities.

Hypotheses for why these anomalies exist
1) Misinterpretation of “response” variants:
- The modeler might have intended “if A then eventually E” or “E after A,” but chose responded_existence(E  A), which only enforces co-occurrence, not order.

2) Incremental policy changes:
- A rule to disallow closing after evaluation (noncoexistence E–C) could have been a temporary compliance guard that remained after adding existence(C), creating a conflict.

3) Data-driven mining artifacts:
- Automated discovery from noisy/incomplete logs might infer noncoexistence(E, C) due to missing E events in traces that did close, or due to mislabeled activities.

4) Performance pressure:
- To shorten cycle time, constraints around P and N might have been relaxed or omitted, inadvertently enabling direct closures without evaluation or approval.

5) Naming and activity mapping inconsistency:
- E might be split across multiple granular activities in logs; if only some were mapped to E, noncoexistence(E, C) could arise spuriously.

SQL-based verification strategies
Note: Adjust column/table names as needed; all queries are in PostgreSQL.

A) Claims closed without evaluation (detects missing E before C)
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claim_events e_c
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e_c.claim_id
WHERE e_c.activity = 'C'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e_e
  WHERE e_e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e_e.activity = 'E'
);

B) Traces where E and C coexist (violates noncoexistence(E, C))
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0;

C) Evaluation without assignment (violates intended order; exposes E  A responded_existence weakness)
-- Claims with E but no A at all
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') = 0;

D) Evaluation occurring before assignment (order violation)
SELECT DISTINCT e_e.claim_id
FROM claim_events e_e
JOIN claim_events e_a
  ON e_a.claim_id = e_e.claim_id
WHERE e_e.activity = 'E'
  AND e_a.activity = 'A'
  AND e_e.timestamp < e_a.timestamp;

E) Closures that occur before evaluation or approval (sequence undermined)
-- C before E
SELECT DISTINCT c1.claim_id
FROM claim_events c1
JOIN claim_events c2
  ON c2.claim_id = c1.claim_id
WHERE c1.activity = 'C'
  AND c2.activity = 'E'
  AND c1.timestamp < c2.timestamp;

-- C before P
SELECT DISTINCT c1.claim_id
FROM claim_events c1
JOIN claim_events c2
  ON c2.claim_id = c1.claim_id
WHERE c1.activity = 'C'
  AND c2.activity = 'P'
  AND c1.timestamp < c2.timestamp;

F) Missing approval or notification before closure
-- C without P
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') = 0;

-- C without N
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') = 0;

G) Violations of init(R): first event is not R
WITH first_events AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) AS first_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
labeled AS (
  SELECT fe.claim_id,
         ce.activity AS first_activity
  FROM first_events fe
  JOIN claim_events ce
    ON ce.claim_id = fe.claim_id
   AND ce.timestamp = fe.first_ts
)
SELECT claim_id, first_activity
FROM labeled
WHERE first_activity <> 'R';

H) Enforce and test full intended order R  A  E  P  N  C
-- Any out-of-order pairs
WITH pairs AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.activity, ce.timestamp
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('R','A','E','P','N','C')
),
violations AS (
  SELECT p1.claim_id, p1.activity AS act1, p2.activity AS act2
  FROM pairs p1
  JOIN pairs p2
    ON p1.claim_id = p2.claim_id
  WHERE (p1.activity, p2.activity) IN (('A','R'),('E','A'),('P','E'),('N','P'),('C','N'))
    AND p1.timestamp < p2.timestamp
)
SELECT DISTINCT claim_id, act1, act2
FROM violations;

I) Check that evaluation is performed by an adjuster and matches specialization
Assumptions: claim_type maps to specialization ('home_insurance''home', 'auto_insurance''auto'), and resource in claim_events matches adjusters.name.

-- Evaluation done by a valid adjuster in correct specialization
WITH evals AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.timestamp, ce.resource
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
),
assigned AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.timestamp AS assign_ts, ce.resource AS assigned_resource
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
),
claim_info AS (
  SELECT c.claim_id,
         c.claim_type,
         CASE
           WHEN c.claim_type = 'home_insurance' THEN 'home'
           WHEN c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance' THEN 'auto'
           ELSE NULL
         END AS required_spec
  FROM claims c
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.resource AS evaluator, a.assigned_resource, adj.specialization, ci.required_spec
FROM evals e
LEFT JOIN assigned a
  ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters adj
  ON adj.name = e.resource
LEFT JOIN claim_info ci
  ON ci.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE adj.adjuster_id IS NULL                    -- evaluation by non-adjuster
   OR adj.specialization <> ci.required_spec     -- wrong specialization
   OR a.assigned_resource IS NULL                -- no assignment exists
   OR e.timestamp < a.assign_ts;                 -- evaluation before assignment

J) Check that the same assigned adjuster performs evaluation (if required)
WITH assigned AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id,
         ce.resource AS assigned_resource,
         MIN(ce.timestamp) AS assign_ts
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'A'
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id, ce.resource
),
evals AS (
  SELECT ce.claim_id,
         ce.resource AS evaluator,
         ce.timestamp AS eval_ts
  FROM claim_events ce
  WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
)
SELECT e.claim_id, a.assigned_resource, e.evaluator
FROM evals e
LEFT JOIN assigned a
  ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id
WHERE a.assigned_resource IS NULL
   OR e.evaluator <> a.assigned_resource
   OR e.eval_ts < a.assign_ts;

K) Frequency of traces with no E at all (indicates noncoexistence pressure or process skipping)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) AS total_claims,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS claims_with_E,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.claim_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS claims_without_E
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce
  ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 AND ce.activity = 'E';

L) Time-to-close without key steps (operational pressure indicator)
SELECT c.claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_R,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_A,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_E,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_P,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_N,
       MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS ts_C,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END)
                        - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) / 3600 AS hours_R_to_C
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) = 1
ORDER BY hours_R_to_C ASC;

Use these checks to quantify the extent of each anomaly and to inform model corrections:
- Replace responded_existence(E  A) with precedence(E  A) or response(A  E).
- Remove noncoexistence(E, C) and enforce ordering constraints ensuring E precedes C via P and N.
- Add existence constraints for A, E, P, N, and ordering: precedence(A  R), precedence(E  A), precedence(P  E), precedence(N  P), precedence(C  N).
