## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

To create a cohesive event log suitable for process mining, I would:

- **Define the Case ID**: Use “Vehicle-Day” (e.g., `V12-20241205`) as the primary case identifier to track end-to-end vehicle operations per day. Secondary case IDs (e.g., “Package ID”) can be used for package-level analysis where needed.
  
- **Event Alignment**: Map events from different sources onto a unified timeline:
  - GPS events  “Travel Segments,” “Idle Time,” “Traffic Slowdown,” “Unscheduled Stop.”
  - Scanner events  “Arrive Customer,” “Delivery Success,” “Delivery Failed,” “Depart Customer.”
  - Dispatch events  “Route Assigned,” “Planned Sequence,” “Time Window Assigned.”
  - Maintenance logs  “Maintenance Start/End,” “Breakdown During Shift.”

- **Timestamp Harmonization**: Ensure all timestamps are synchronized to UTC or local time zone. Handle missing or inconsistent timestamps via interpolation or exclusion based on confidence thresholds.

- **Attribute Enrichment**: Add derived attributes:
  - *Travel Distance* (from GPS coordinates using Haversine formula).
  - *Dwell Time* (time between “Arrive Customer” and “Depart Customer”).
  - *Deviation Flag* (whether actual stop matches planned sequence).
  - *Traffic Index* (based on speed < 10 km/h for >5 minutes).

- **Challenges**:
  - **Data Silos & Schema Mismatch**: GPS logs may lack package context; scanner logs lack location. Requires joining on Vehicle ID + Timestamp ± tolerance window.
  - **Missing Events**: Scanner not used? GPS dropout? Apply imputation (e.g., infer “Depart Customer” if next GPS move detected) or flag as data quality issue.
  - **Granularity Mismatch**: GPS every 30s vs. scanner events per stop. Aggregate GPS into “segments” between scanner events.
  - **Case Overlap**: Multiple packages handled simultaneously? Use hierarchical event logs or flatten by prioritizing vehicle-level flow.

### Process Discovery

- Apply **Heuristic Miner** or **Inductive Miner** to discover the actual end-to-end process model from the integrated log. The model will reveal:
  - Common paths: e.g., `Depart Depot  Travel  Arrive Customer  Deliver  Depart  ...  Arrive Depot`.
  - Variants: e.g., loops for failed deliveries, detours for breakdowns, or skipped stops.
  - Parallelism: e.g., driver making phone calls while en route (if inferred from idle GPS + no scanner activity).

- Visualize using **Petri nets** or **BPMN diagrams** annotated with frequency and performance metrics (e.g., average time per transition).

### Conformance Checking

- Compare discovered model against the *planned route* (from dispatch system) using **alignment-based conformance checking**.

- Key deviations to detect:
  - **Sequence Deviations**: Driver visits Stop 3 before Stop 2 despite plan.
  - **Unplanned Activities**: “Unscheduled Stop” (e.g., breakdown, coffee break) not in dispatch plan.
  - **Missing Activities**: Planned stop never scanned — potential skip or data loss.
  - **Timing Violations**: Actual arrival at customer > 15 mins outside planned time window.
  - **Extra Loops**: Multiple “Delivery Failed  Return Depot” cycles for same package.

- Output: **Deviation Heatmap** showing which routes/days/drivers deviate most, and **fitness score** per route (0–1 scale).

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Calculation from Event Log | Relevance |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | (# Deliveries within customer time window) / Total Deliveries | Core customer satisfaction metric |
| **Avg. Time per Delivery Stop** | Avg(“Depart Customer” - “Arrive Customer”) across all stops | Measures service efficiency |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | Total Travel Time / Total Service Time per route | High ratio = inefficient routing or low density |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/package** | (Fuel Est. from GPS speed/idle time) / Total km or / # packages | Direct cost driver; proxy via engine-on time × avg. fuel rate |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Time vehicle moving or servicing) / (Shift End - Shift Start) | Measures asset productivity |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration** | #/Duration of “Low Speed Detected” or speed < 10 km/h for >5 min | Identifies congestion hotspots |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | # “Delivery Failed” / Total Delivery Attempts | Drives re-delivery costs and delays |

*Fuel proxy*: Use GPS idle time + distance traveled × vehicle-specific fuel curve (if unavailable, use industry avg. L/100km).

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

- **Performance Analysis with Enhanced Process Maps**: Overlay KPIs (avg. duration, frequency) on discovered process model. Highlight transitions with high avg. duration (e.g., “Travel Segment AB” takes 45 mins avg. vs. 20 min planned).

- **Bottleneck Analysis by Dimension**:
  - **Route/Region**: Cluster stops by geo-fence; compare KPIs per zone. Urban cores may show high dwell + traffic.
  - **Time of Day**: Slice data by hour; identify PM rush hour spikes in travel time.
  - **Driver**: Compare avg. dwell time, route adherence, idle time across drivers.
  - **Vehicle Type**: Older vans may have more “Unscheduled Stop” events or lower avg. speed.
  - **Activity Type**: “Finding Parking” inferred from GPS circling + delay before “Arrive Customer” scan.

- **Quantify Impact**:
  - Use **bottleneck analysis algorithms** (e.g., token-based replay) to calculate “waiting time” at each activity.
  - Run **what-if simulation**: If dwell time reduced by 2 mins per stop, total route time drops by X mins  Y% more routes/day possible.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Beyond surface delays, process mining enables deep root cause analysis:

### Potential Root Causes & Validation Techniques

- **Suboptimal Route Planning**:
  - *Validation*: Compare planned vs. actual travel time per segment. Use **variant analysis** — do routes planned by System A consistently underperform vs. System B?
  - *Insight*: Static routes ignore real-time traffic; discovered variants show frequent detours around “known” congested zones.

- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations**:
  - *Validation*: Correlate planned travel time with actual (from GPS). Plot error distribution. Use **decision mining** to find factors (weather? day of week?) that predict high error.

- **Traffic Congestion Patterns**:
  - *Validation*: Map “Low Speed Detected” events geospatially and temporally. Overlay with city traffic data if available. Use **clustering** (DBSCAN) to identify recurring congestion hotspots.

- **High Service Time Variability**:
  - *Validation*: Analyze dwell time distribution per customer type (residential vs. commercial), package size, or building type (apartment vs. house). Use **decision trees** to find drivers or locations with outlier dwell times.

- **Vehicle Breakdowns During Shift**:
  - *Validation*: Filter cases with “Unscheduled Stop  Maintenance”. Correlate with vehicle age, mileage (from maintenance logs), or prior idle/engine stress events.

- **Driver Behavior Differences**:
  - *Validation*: **Variant comparison** between top 10% and bottom 10% drivers by on-time rate. Do high performers take different routes? Have shorter dwell? Less idle time?

- **Failed Deliveries Impact**:
  - *Validation*: Trace “Delivery Failed” events to re-delivery cases. Calculate cost of re-attempts (fuel, labor, delay propagation). Use **sequence mining** to see if failures cluster at certain times (e.g., lunch hours) or locations.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Engine Integration

- **Targets**: Late deliveries due to traffic; high fuel costs from inefficient paths.
- **Root Cause**: Static routes ignore real-time conditions; discovered variants show reactive detours.
- **Process Mining Support**: 
  - Use traffic delay heatmaps and travel time deviation analysis to train routing engine.
  - Identify “frequent detour corridors” to pre-emptively avoid in dynamic plans.
- **Implementation**: Integrate GPS real-time feed + historical bottleneck data into dispatch system. Re-optimize routes every 30 mins.
- **Expected Impact**:
  -  On-Time Delivery Rate by 15–25%.
  -  Fuel per km by 8–12%.
  -  Avg. Travel Time by 10–20 mins per route.

### Strategy 2: Customer Time Window Optimization & Proactive Communication

- **Targets**: High failed delivery rate; re-delivery costs.
- **Root Cause**: Customers not home; rigid/unrealistic time windows.
- **Process Mining Support**:
  - Analyze “Delivery Failed” events: cluster by time of day, customer type, neighborhood.
  - Use dwell time before failure to infer “waiting too long” vs. “no answer.”
  - Correlate with customer-provided time windows — are 9–11 AM slots failing more than 4–6 PM?
- **Implementation**:
  - Offer customers dynamic 2-hour windows based on route progress (via SMS/app).
  - Incentivize flexible windows (“Choose ‘Anytime After 2 PM’ for 10% discount”).
  - Auto-reschedule failed deliveries to next optimal route (not next day).
- **Expected Impact**:
  -  Failed Delivery Rate by 30–50%.
  -  Re-delivery operational cost by 20%.
  -  Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance & Driver-Specific Coaching

- **Targets**: Unscheduled stops; vehicle downtime; inconsistent driver performance.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance; skill/behavior gaps among drivers.
- **Process Mining Support**:
  - Use vehicle event logs to find patterns preceding breakdowns (e.g., frequent idle + high RPM  engine stress).
  - Cluster drivers by performance KPIs; identify “training candidates” with long dwell, high idle, or frequent sequence violations.
  - Map “Unscheduled Stop” events to maintenance history — flag vehicles with >2 stops/month.
- **Implementation**:
  - Build predictive model: Trigger maintenance if vehicle shows “stress pattern” (idle + speed fluctuation + old age).
  - Launch driver coaching: Use process variant comparison to show top performers’ routes/dwell techniques. Gamify efficiency metrics.
- **Expected Impact**:
  -  Unscheduled Stops by 40–60%.
  -  Vehicle Utilization Rate by 10–15%.
  -  Avg. Dwell Time by 15% via coaching.

## 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### Accounting for Constraints

- **Driver Hours**: Optimization algorithms must respect legal shift limits (e.g., 10 hrs max). Use process mining to identify routes consistently causing overtime (e.g., >8.5 hrs) and rebalance.
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Discovered variants showing “return to depot mid-route” may indicate overload. Use package volume/weight logs to enforce capacity-aware routing.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Dynamic routing must prioritize hard windows (e.g., “9–10 AM only”) and soft windows. Use conformance checking to flag violations.

### Continuous Monitoring Plan

Deploy a **Process Mining Dashboard** with:

- **Real-Time KPI Tracking**:
  - Daily On-Time %, Avg. Dwell, Fuel Efficiency, Failed Delivery Rate.
  - Alerts if KPIs drop below threshold (e.g., on-time < 85%).

- **Process Conformance Views**:
  - Live alignment score per active route.
  - Map of deviations (sequence, timing) updated hourly.

- **Bottleneck Radar**:
  - Top 5 slowest segments today.
  - Driver ranking by efficiency (updated daily).

- **Root Cause Drill-Down**:
  - Click any KPI to see contributing cases, variants, or drivers.
  - “Why did Route V12 fail?”  Show traffic events, dwell outliers, maintenance flags.

- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Monthly “Process Health Report” comparing pre/post-optimization KPIs.
  - Quarterly variant re-discovery to detect new inefficiencies (e.g., new traffic patterns, driver turnover effects).

This closed-loop system ensures optimizations are measurable, adaptive, and sustainable — turning process mining from a diagnostic tool into an operational nerve center for Speedy Parcels.
