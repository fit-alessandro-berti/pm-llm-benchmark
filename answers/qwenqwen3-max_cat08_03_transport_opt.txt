# Process Mining Analysis and Optimization Strategy for Speedy Parcels

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration
To create a unified event log suitable for process mining, I would:

- **Standardize timestamps**: Convert all timestamps to a common timezone and granularity (e.g., seconds).
- **Define case semantics**: Use a composite key like `VehicleID-Date` as the case ID to represent a complete vehicle-day operation. For package-level analysis, create secondary case IDs like `PackageID`.
- **Harmonize activity names**: Map disparate event types (e.g., “Depart Depot” from GPS, “Route Assigned” from dispatch) into a consistent activity taxonomy (e.g., “Start Shift,” “Depart Depot,” “Arrive Customer,” “Delivery Attempt,” “Return to Depot”).
- **Enrich events with contextual attributes**: Attach vehicle type, driver ID, route ID, traffic zone, weather (if available), and planned vs. actual stop sequence.
- **Handle missing data**: Use interpolation for short GPS gaps; flag or exclude cases with critical missing scanner events (e.g., no “Arrive Customer” but “Delivery Success” exists).

**Key Challenges**:
- **Temporal misalignment**: Scanner events may lag GPS due to manual input; reconcile using spatial proximity and time windows.
- **Event granularity mismatch**: GPS logs every 30s, while scanner logs are sparse; aggregate GPS into meaningful states (e.g., “en route,” “idle,” “stopped”).
- **Case fragmentation**: Failed deliveries may span multiple days; decide whether to model re-deliveries as separate cases or linked sub-processes.
- **Noise**: GPS drift in urban canyons may falsely indicate stops; apply spatial clustering and dwell-time thresholds to validate stops.

### Process Discovery
Using algorithms like **Inductive Miner** or **Heuristic Miner**, I would:
- Discover the end-to-end process model showing common paths: `Start Shift  Depart Depot  [Travel  Arrive Customer  (Delivery Success | Delivery Failed)  Depart Customer]*  Return to Depot  End Shift`.
- Highlight **deviations**: unscheduled maintenance stops, detours, repeated visits to the same area, or early/late depot returns.
- Use **directly-follows graphs** colored by frequency or performance (e.g., average duration per transition) to visualize bottlenecks.
- Segment models by driver, vehicle type, or zone to uncover performance heterogeneity.

### Conformance Checking
I would compare the discovered process against the **planned route sequence** from the dispatch system:
- **Sequence deviations**: Did the driver follow the planned stop order? Use token-based replay or alignments to quantify deviations (e.g., “skipped Stop 3, visited Stop 7 early”).
- **Unplanned activities**: Detect stops not in the dispatch plan (e.g., unscheduled maintenance, personal detours).
- **Timing deviations**: Compare actual vs. planned arrival/departure times at each stop; flag delays exceeding thresholds (e.g., >15 mins late).
- **Structural gaps**: Identify missing planned stops (e.g., package never scanned) or extra unplanned stops.

Key deviation types to monitor:
- **Rerouting**: Skipping clusters of stops due to traffic.
- **Stop inflation**: Adding non-delivery stops (e.g., breaks, refueling).
- **Time window violations**: Arriving outside customer-requested windows.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
From the integrated event log, I would calculate:

| KPI | Calculation | Relevance |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries completed within customer time window | Core customer satisfaction metric |
| **Avg. Time per Stop** | (Depart Customer – Arrive Customer) averaged across stops | Measures service efficiency |
| **Travel Time / Service Time Ratio** | Total driving time ÷ total dwell time | Indicates route vs. customer-side inefficiency |
| **Fuel Consumption per Package** | Estimated fuel (from speed/idle time) ÷ # delivered packages | Direct cost driver |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Time moving + time at stops) ÷ total shift time | Asset efficiency |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | # of “Low Speed” or “Idle in Transit” events per route | Identifies congestion hotspots |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | # failed attempts ÷ total delivery attempts | Drives re-delivery costs |

*Fuel estimation*: Derive from GPS speed profiles and idle durations using standard consumption models (e.g., higher consumption at low speeds/idle).

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques
- **Performance Spectrum**: Visualize travel segments colored by duration or speed to spot recurrent slow zones (e.g., between 50.79N–50.75N every weekday 9–11 AM).
- **Dwell Time Analysis**: Compare service times across customers; flag outliers (e.g., >10 mins) possibly due to parking difficulty or complex access.
- **Variant Analysis**: Cluster routes into performance-based variants (e.g., “high-efficiency,” “traffic-impacted,” “failure-prone”) and correlate with contextual factors (driver, vehicle age, area density).
- **Queue Mining**: Identify if delays cascade (e.g., late start  late at Stop 1  increasingly late thereafter).
- **Resource-Centric Views**: Compare driver-specific KPIs to isolate skill/behavior impacts.

**Quantifying Impact**:
- Use **throughput time decomposition** to attribute total route delay to specific causes (e.g., 40% from traffic, 30% from long dwell times).
- Apply **regression or decision trees** to model KPIs (e.g., total route time) against predictors (traffic events, # failed deliveries, driver ID).

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Beyond symptoms, process mining can reveal systemic root causes:

- **Suboptimal Static Routing**: If conformance shows frequent reordering of stops, the dispatcher’s static plan ignores real-world constraints (e.g., one-way streets, parking scarcity). *Validation*: High deviation rates in dense urban zones vs. suburbs.
  
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimates**: If planned vs. actual travel times consistently diverge, especially during peak hours, the routing engine uses outdated traffic models. *Validation*: Correlate delay magnitude with historical traffic patterns from GPS speed data.

- **Service Time Variability**: Long/unpredictable dwell times suggest poor customer preparation or access issues. *Validation*: Analyze dwell time distribution; if 20% of stops take >8 mins, investigate those locations/packages.

- **Vehicle Reliability Issues**: Unscheduled stops due to breakdowns increase route time and fuel use. *Validation*: Cross-reference “Unscheduled Stop” events with maintenance logs; check if older vehicles have higher failure rates mid-route.

- **Driver Behavior Differences**: Some drivers may take longer breaks, idle excessively, or inefficiently sequence stops. *Validation*: Compare KPIs across drivers on similar routes; use variant analysis to isolate behavioral patterns.

- **Failed Delivery Cascade**: High failed delivery rates force re-runs, increasing costs. *Validation*: Track re-delivery cases; analyze if failures cluster by time window (e.g., 9–5 PM deliveries fail more when recipients are at work).

**Process Mining Techniques for Validation**:
- **Enhanced Directly-Follows Graphs**: Overlay traffic events or maintenance stops to see their causal impact on delays.
- **Decision Mining**: Model choices (e.g., “attempt redelivery today vs. tomorrow”) and their outcomes.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Identify if certain driver-vehicle pairs consistently underperform.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Dynamic, Traffic-Aware Routing with Real-Time Re-optimization
- **Targets**: Late deliveries, excessive fuel use from idling in traffic.
- **Root Cause**: Static routes ignore real-time congestion.
- **Process Mining Support**: Performance spectrum and traffic delay analysis identify recurrent congestion hotspots and time windows. Conformance checking shows frequent detours.
- **Implementation**: Integrate live traffic APIs into the dispatch system; use historical GPS-derived travel time distributions (not averages) for stochastic routing. Allow mid-route re-sequencing if delays exceed thresholds.
- **Expected Impact**:  On-Time Delivery Rate (+10–15%),  Fuel per Package (–8%),  Avg. Route Time.

### Strategy 2: Delivery Time Window Optimization & Proactive Customer Communication
- **Targets**: High failed delivery rate, re-delivery costs.
- **Root Cause**: Rigid or poorly communicated time windows lead to missed deliveries.
- **Process Mining Support**: Failed delivery analysis shows concentration in certain windows (e.g., 10 AM–2 PM). Correlate with customer type (residential vs. commercial).
- **Implementation**: Use historical success/failure data to recommend optimal time windows per customer (e.g., “85% success if delivered after 5 PM”). Send SMS alerts 30 mins before arrival; allow real-time rescheduling via app.
- **Expected Impact**:  Failed Delivery Rate (–25%),  Re-delivery Costs,  Customer Satisfaction.

### Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling Based on Usage Patterns
- **Targets**: Unscheduled breakdowns, vehicle downtime, fuel inefficiency from poor engine performance.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance disrupts routes; aging vehicles consume more fuel.
- **Process Mining Support**: Link “Unscheduled Stop” events with vehicle age, idle time, and harsh driving patterns (e.g., frequent hard braking from GPS). Identify vehicles with rising anomaly rates.
- **Implementation**: Build a predictive model using vehicle event logs (idle duration, speed volatility, warning lights) to forecast failures. Schedule maintenance during off-days based on actual usage, not just mileage.
- **Expected Impact**:  Unscheduled Stops (–40%),  Vehicle Utilization,  Fuel Consumption (well-maintained engines are 5–10% more efficient).

## 5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring

### Accounting for Constraints
- **Driver Hours**: All routing optimizations must respect legal driving hour limits; use shift start/end events to enforce hard constraints in the optimizer.
- **Vehicle Capacity**: Ensure dynamic re-routing doesn’t overload vans; integrate real-time package count from scanner events.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Optimization strategies (e.g., time window refinement) must preserve or tighten windows only with customer consent; use historical compliance data to guide adjustments.

### Continuous Monitoring Plan
Deploy a **process mining dashboard** with:

- **Real-Time Conformance View**: Live alignment scores showing deviation from planned routes.
- **KPI Trend Charts**: On-time rate, fuel/package, failed delivery rate by day/week, segmented by zone/driver.
- **Bottleneck Heatmap**: Geographic visualization of delay hotspots updated daily.
- **Alert System**: Trigger notifications for:
  - Routes exceeding 20% overtime.
  - Vehicles with >2 unscheduled stops/week.
  - Drivers with dwell times >2 above mean.

**Feedback Loop**:
- Run monthly **variant analysis** to detect emerging inefficiency patterns.
- Conduct **A/B testing**: Pilot new routing logic on a subset of vehicles; compare KPIs against control group using process mining.
- Update predictive models quarterly with new event data to maintain accuracy.

This closed-loop, data-driven approach ensures that Speedy Parcels not only fixes current inefficiencies but also builds adaptive capabilities to sustain performance amid changing urban dynamics.
