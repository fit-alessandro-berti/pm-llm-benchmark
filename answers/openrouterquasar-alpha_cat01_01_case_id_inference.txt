Let's analyze the events, extract distinctive patient features, sequence patterns, and group accordingly.

### Step 1: Identify Distinct Patients by Registration Events

| Event | Age | Gender | Dept       | Likely Identifier                                       |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | 45    | M       | ER          | Patient #1: 45M, ER, private insurance                   |
| 2      | 62    | F       | ER          | Patient #2: 62F, ER, public insurance                    |
| 3      | 28    | M       | Surgery     | Patient #3: 28M, Surgery, private insurance (scheduled)  |

### Step 2: Map Events to Patients

Using age, gender, department and hints from activity:

---

#### Patient #1: 45M ER (private insurance) — suspected fracture based on info

- **Event 1:** Register patient, ER  
- **Event 4:** Initial triage (age 45 M, ER)  
- **Event 7:** X-ray imaging (left leg, age 45 M)  
- **Event 12:** Doctor consult (diagnosis=hairline fracture, ER, age 45 M)  
- **Event 15:** Discharged, ER, age 45 M  

---

#### Patient #2: 62F ER (public insurance) — lab tests, minor infection

- **Event 2:** Register patient, ER  
- **Event 5:** Initial triage, ER, age 62 F  
- **Event 8:** Lab test requested, ER, age 62 F  
- **Event 10:** Lab test completed, Laboratory, age 62 F  
- **Event 11:** Doctor consult (diagnosis=minor infection, ER, age 62 F)  
- **Event 14:** Prescription created (antibiotics), ER, 62 F  
- **Event 17:** Discharged, ER, 62 F  

---

#### Patient #3: 28M Surgery (private insurance, scheduled surgery)

- **Event 3:** Register patient, Surgery  
- **Event 6:** Doctor consultation, Surgery, pre-op consent (age 28 M, scheduled_knee_surgery)  
- **Event 9:** Surgery preparation, Surgery, age 28 M  
- **Event 13:** Surgery performed, Surgery, age 28 M  
- **Event 16:** Recovery room, Surgery, age 28 M  
- **Event 18:** Discharged, Surgery (physiotherapy followup), age 28 M

### Step 3: Present Case Groupings

| **Case A (ER, 45 M, private insurance)** | **Case B (ER, 62 F, public insurance)** | **Case C (Surgery, 28 M, private insurance)**                            |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Event 1 (Register)                     | Event 2 (Register)                     | Event 3 (Register)                                                      |
| Event 4 (Initial triage)               | Event 5 (Initial triage)               | Event 6 (Consultation pre-surgery)                                      |
| Event 7 (X-ray)                        | Event 8 (Lab requested)                | Event 9 (Surgery preparation)                                           |
| Event 12 (Consultation, diagnosis)     | Event 10 (Lab completed)               | Event 13 (Surgery performed)                                            |
| Event 15 (Discharge)                   | Event 11 (Consultation, diagnosis)     | Event 16 (Recovery room)                                                |
|                                         | Event 14 (Prescription)                | Event 18 (Discharge)                                                    |
|                                         | Event 17 (Discharge)                   |                                                                         |

# **Final OUTPUT**

### **Case groupings:**

| **Case**                       | **Events**                                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

This mapping best respects the event attributes, order, and process flows.
