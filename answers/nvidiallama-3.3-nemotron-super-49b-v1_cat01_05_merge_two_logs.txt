### Merged Event Log with Rationale

#### **Merging Strategy Summary**

- **Timestamp Tolerance for Matching:** ±2 seconds
- **Primary Timestamp Source for Ordered Output:** System A (when merged, otherwise, the available timestamp)
- **Attribute Integration:** Combine all attributes from both logs for matched events, prioritizing System A's event type/naming if differing.
- **Naming Convention for Merged Events:** Standardize based on System A's event types for consistency when directly matchable, otherwise, append "(System B)" to the event name for uniqueness.

#### **Merged Event Log**

| **Timestamp (Primary)** | **Event Type** | **Order ID** | **User ID** | **Resource ID** | **Notes** | **Origin** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Event captured at warehouse system | **B** (No A Match) |
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | Order Received (Merged) | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | - | **A & B** *(Aligned, A's Timestamp)* |
| **Correction to Above Row for Clarity** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 |  | **A & B** *(Aligned, using A's time)* |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z | Order Validation (Merged) | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Cross-check inventory | **A & B** *(A's Timestamp Used)* |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed | Order#1234 |  |  |  | **A** (No Direct B Match, see below) |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z | Payment Check | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Payment gateway delay | **B** (Considered Different due to Event Type & Time) |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | Random inspection | **B** (No A Match) |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Item Shipped (Merged) | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 | Package handed to courier | **A & B** *(A's Timestamp)* |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | Item Delivered | Order#1234 |  |  |  | **A** (No B Match) |

#### **Detailed Rationale for Each Match/Non-Match Decision**

1. **Order Received**
   - **Log A:** 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z
   - **Log B:** 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z
   - **Decision:** Aligned (Timestamp difference within tolerance). **Merged** with System A's timestamp as primary.
   - **Rationale:** Despite the slight offset, the events clearly match in context. System A's timestamp is used for consistency in the primary log.

2. **Order Validated/OrderValidation**
   - **Log A:** 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z
   - **Log B:** 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z
   - **Decision:** Merged
   - **Rationale:** Event names are essentially the same in intent, and the timestamp difference is negligible.

3. **Payment Processed vs. Payment Check**
   - **Log A:** 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z
   - **Log B:** 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z
   - **Decision:** Kept Separate
   - **Rationale:** While close in time, the event names suggest different activities (one implies completion, the other a check), and the attributes in Log B ("Payment gateway delay") support this distinction.

4. **Quality Check**
   - **Log B Only**
   - **Decision:** Included as-is
   - **Rationale:** No matching event in Log A, provides additional insight into the process.

5. **Item Shipped/Shipping**
   - **Log A:** 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z
   - **Log B:** 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z
   - **Decision:** Merged
   - **Rationale:** Essentially the same event with a negligible timestamp difference.

6. **Item Delivered**
   - **Log A Only**
   - **Decision:** Included as-is
   - **Rationale:** No matching event in Log B, marks the end of the tracked process in Log A.

#### **Challenges and Future Enhancements**

- **Naming Conventions:** Standardizing event names across systems would greatly simplify merging.
- **Timestamp Synchronization:** Ensuring both systems' clocks are perfectly synced would reduce merging complexities.
- **Attribute Alignment:** Pre-defining a unified attribute set across systems would enhance merging efficiency and reduce post-hoc integration challenges.

#### **Updated Merged Event Log for Readability**

Given the initial merge table had an error in presentation for the first two rows (implying a non-merged and then a merged version of the same event), here's the **Corrected and Simplified Merged Event Log** focusing on the final, intended output:

| **Timestamp** | **Event Type** | **Order ID** | **User ID** | **Resource ID** | **Notes** | **Origin** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | Order Received | Order#1234 | u45 | r10 |  | **A & B** |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z | Order Validated | Order#1234 | u12 | r10 | Cross-check inventory | **A & B** |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Payment Processed | Order#1234 |  |  |  | **A** |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z | Payment Check | Order#1234 | u12 | r99 | Payment gateway delay | **B** |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check | Order#1234 | u45 | r11 | Random inspection | **B** |
