To infer the case groupings from the given hospital process events, we need to look for patterns in the attributes that indicate a single case, such as the same patient being involved in multiple related activities across different departments and resources. Let's analyze the events:

1. The first two events are about registering patients, but since they are in different departments (ER and Surgery) and involve patients of different genders and ages, they likely belong to different cases.
2. Event 3 also registers a patient in the Surgery department, which suggests a separate case from the first two.
3. The next two events (4 and 5) are initial triages for the patients from the first two registration events. Since these quadrants of events are close in time and involve different patients from the earlier events, they are likely separate cases.
4. Events 6, 7, and 9 are related to one patient (age 28) in the Surgery department, indicating they belong to the same case (a single surgery and recovery).
5. Events 8, 12, 14, and 18 are related to another patient (age 62) in the ER department, with lab work and prescriptions in both the ER and ER-related departments (Laboratory, Pharmacy), suggesting they belong to the same case (including a minor infection and recovery).

Based on this analysis, we can infer the following case groupings:

**Case 1:**
- Event 1: Register patient (ER, patient age 45)
- Event 2: Register patient (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, patient age 45)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 13: Doctor consultation (ER, patient age 45)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, patient age 45)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, patient age 28)

**Case 2:**
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, patient age 28)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, patient age 28)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, patient age 28)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, patient age 28)
- Event 10: Lab test requested (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, patient age 62)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (Surgery, patient age 28)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, patient age 28)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, patient age 28)

The remaining events that do not fit into the above cases, either because they are registration events with patients of different cases or because they are unrelated to the described patient journeys, need not be grouped separately. If there were absolutely all grouped events, we might have an additional case, but in this case, we have clear groups based on the patient journeys and sequence of related events.

Please note that there may be some interpretation involved, as real-world hospital case management can have more complexity and nuances than seen here. But based on the given sequence, these would be the inferred case groupings.
