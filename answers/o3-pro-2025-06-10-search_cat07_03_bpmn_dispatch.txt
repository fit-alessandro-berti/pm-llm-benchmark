The picture is a BPMN (Business-Process-Model-and-Notation) diagram that shows, step by step, how a computer-hardware store prepares an outbound parcel.  
The notation uses three horizontal swim-lanes to indicate who is responsible for each activity:

1. Logistics (top lane)  
2. “Dispatch of goods / Computer hardware shop / Secretary” (middle lane – i.e., the office staff who organise shipping)  
3. Warehouse (bottom lane – the people who physically handle the goods)

High-level flow (left-to-right)

1. Start event Ship goods” (white circle) in the middle lane.  
2. Parallel gateway (diamond with a “+”) immediately afterwards, which allows the paperwork/administrative branch (middle & top lanes) to run in parallel with the physical-handling branch (bottom lane).

Administrative branch (middle & top lanes)

3. Task: Clarify shipment method (uses the data object “Order details”).  
4. Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
   • “No” path  task “Check if insurance is required” (uses data store “Customer information”).  
   • “Yes” path  task “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  task “Select logistic company and place order”.

5. From “Check if insurance is required” an exclusive gateway asks “If insurance necessary”:  
   • “Yes”  task “Insure parcel”.  
   • In both cases the flow continues to task “Write package label”.

6. Both administrative sub-flows reconverge in an exclusive gateway, then flow into a parallel gateway (diamond with “+”) that waits for the warehouse branch to finish before it proceeds to:  
   • Task “Fill out shipment paperwork”  task “Move package to pickup area”  End event Shipment prepared”.

Warehouse branch (bottom lane)

7. Task: “Package goods”.  
8. Attached to that task is an intermediate timer event labelled “48 hours”. If packaging is not finished within two days, an exception flow triggers the task “Notify customer about delay”, then rejoins the main flow.

9. When packaging is completed, the flow merges in an exclusive gateway, joins the parallel gateway mentioned above, and the process finishes as soon as both administrative and warehouse work are complete.

Key elements and notation used

• Start and end events (white circles).  
• Tasks (rounded rectangles) for work steps such as “Package goods”, “Write package label”, etc.  
• Parallel gateways (plus sign) to split and synchronise concurrent work.  
• Exclusive gateways (X) for either-or decisions (“Special handling?”, “If insurance necessary”).  
• A data object (“Order details”) and a data store (“Customer information”) feeding their respective tasks.  
• A boundary timer event (clock symbol) attached to “Package goods” to handle delays.  

Overall, the diagram shows a coordinated process in which office staff take care of shipping options, insurance, labelling and paperwork while the warehouse packs the items; both streams must finish before the parcel is moved to the pickup area and the shipment is declared ready.
