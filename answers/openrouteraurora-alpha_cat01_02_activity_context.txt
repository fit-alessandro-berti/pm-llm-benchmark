**1.  Activities that repeat inside a single case**

| Activity (original) | How many times it appears in a case? | What changes between the occurrences? |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Verify Documents** | 2 (C001, C003) | – First occurrence is the *initial* verification of the documents that were supplied with the request. <br>– Second occurrence happens **after** something else (extra documents or an account adjustment) and is a *reverification* / “checkagain”. |
| **Call Customer** | 2 (C002, C003) | – The purpose of the call differs: <br>1.Missingdocuments request (C001) <br>2.Clarifying a discrepancy (C002) <br>3.Confirming that an adjustment was applied (C002) <br>4.Recalling a walkin customer who stepped out (C003). |

All other activities appear only once per case, so they keep their original name.

**2.  Renaming scheme (contextaware names)**  

| Original activity | New name (example) | Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Verify Documents – first occurrence | **Verify Docs – Initial** | The first check of the documents that came with the request. |
| Verify Documents – second occurrence | **Verify Docs – Recheck** | A second check after additional information or an internal adjustment. |
| Call Customer – request missing docs | **Call – Request Missing Docs** | The agent calls because the original submission lacked required documents. |
| Call Customer – clarify discrepancy | **Call – Clarify Discrepancy** | The call is used to resolve an inconsistency discovered in the account. |
| Call Customer – confirm adjustments | **Call – Confirm Adjustments** | The followup call verifies that the changes made after the previous call are accepted. |
| Call Customer – recall walkin | **Call – Recall Customer** | The officer calls the customer back after they have stepped out of the branch. |

The naming keeps the verbobject pattern (e.g., *Verify Docs*, *Call*) and appends a short qualifier that captures the **contextual cue** (initial vs. recheck, missingdocs vs. clarifydiscrepancy, etc.).

**4.  Brief justification of the new names**

| New activity name | Contextual clues used |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Verify Docs – Initial** | Appears right after *Initiate Request*; the “Additional Context” column mentions a firsttime check (“Agent checks identity documents”, “Physical verification of ID”). |
| **Verify Docs – Recheck** | Occurs **after** a later step (submission of extra docs or an account adjustment) and the context explicitly says “Agent rechecks documents” / “Reverify docs after account adjustment”. |
| **Call – Request Missing Docs** | The call follows a failed verification and the context states “agent calls to request missing docs”. |
| **Call – Clarify Discrepancy** | The call is triggered by “account discrepancy” and the purpose is to clarify it. |
| **Call – Confirm Adjustments** | This call comes after an internal “Adjust Account” step; the context says “Followup call to confirm adjustments made”. |
| **Call – Recall Customer** | In the branch scenario the customer “stepped out” and the officer “calls to have them return”. |

These qualifiers turn a generic activity label into a **selfexplanatory** step, which is essential for downstream process mining (e.g., discovering distinct variants, measuring cycle times per subtype, or building a more accurate process model).
