This complex manufacturing process can be modeled entirely as a sequence of mandatory steps, incorporating two distinct loop structures and one exclusive choice (optional step).

We first define the elementary transitions and the complex sub-models using the POWL operators.

### 1. Define Activities and Silent Transitions

*   OR = Transition (label='OR')
*   MS = Transition (label='MS')
*   QS = Transition (label='QS')
*   AS = Transition (label='AS')
*   IQC = Transition (label='IQC')
*   TST = Transition (label='TST')
*   RT = Transition (label='RT')
*   PK = Transition (label='PK')
*   LB = Transition (label='LB')
*   DP = Transition (label='DP')
*   D = Transition (label='D')
*   $\tau$ = SilentTransition (representing a skip/empty action)

### 2. Define Complex Sub-Models

Based on the analysis of the event log, there are two distinct loop structures and one choice structure.

**A. Assembly Rework Loop ($L_{AQC}$):**
The process includes AS activities potentially followed by IQC, which leads back to AS (e.g., Case 3: AS, IQC, AS, IQC, AS...). This fits the `*(A, B)` loop structure where $A=AS$ (mandatory entry/re-entry) and $B=IQC$ (the step allowing re-entry).
$$L_{AQC} = \text{*} ( AS, IQC )$$

**B. Testing Rework Loop ($L_{TST}$):**
The process includes TST, which may be followed by RT, leading back to TST (e.g., Case 5: TST, RT, TST, RT, TST). This fits the `*(A, B)` loop structure where $A=TST$ and $B=RT$.
$$L_{TST} = \text{*} ( TST, RT )$$

**C. Optional Labeling ($LB_{opt}$):**
Labeling (LB) is observed as optional (e.g., skipped in Case 2).
$$LB_{opt} = \text{X} ( LB, \tau )$$

### 3. Define the Root Strict Partial Order (ROOT PO)

The entire process follows a strict sequential order among its major stages (OR $\rightarrow$ MS $\rightarrow$ QS $\rightarrow L_{AQC} \rightarrow L_{TST} \rightarrow PK \rightarrow LB_{opt} \rightarrow DP \rightarrow D$). Since no concurrency is observed between these stages, they are chained sequentially within the StrictPartialOrder model.

$$
\text{ROOT} = \text{PO}(
$$
$$
\text{nodes} = \{ OR, MS, QS, L_{AQC}, L_{TST}, PK, LB_{opt}, DP, D \},
$$
$$
\text{order} = \{
$$
$$
OR \rightarrow MS,
$$
$$
MS \rightarrow QS,
$$
$$
QS \rightarrow L_{AQC},
$$
$$
L_{AQC} \rightarrow L_{TST},
$$
$$
L_{TST} \rightarrow PK,
$$
$$
PK \rightarrow LB_{opt},
$$
$$
LB_{opt} \rightarrow DP,
$$
$$
DP \rightarrow D
$$
$$
\}
$$
$$
)
$$

### Final POWL Model (Condensed Notation)

$$
\text{ROOT} = \text{PO}(\text{nodes}=\{OR, MS, QS, *(AS, IQC), *(TST, RT), PK, X(LB, \tau), DP, D\},
$$
$$
\text{order}=\{
$$
$$
OR \rightarrow MS, MS \rightarrow QS, QS \rightarrow *(AS, IQC), *(AS, IQC) \rightarrow *(TST, RT),
$$
$$
*(TST, RT) \rightarrow PK, PK \rightarrow X(LB, \tau), X(LB, \tau) \rightarrow DP, DP \rightarrow D
$$
$$
\}
)
