### **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)**

#### **Case 1: No Violations**
- **Sequence:** Follows the strict order perfectly:
  `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`.
- **No contradictions:** Documentation is only finalized after approval, and the case is closed correctly.
- **Conclusion:** **Compliant with all normative rules.**

---

#### **Case 2: Multiple Violations**
1. **Ordering Violation (Critical):**
   - **Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs before Credit Check (09:00).**
   - **Violation:** Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment (strict rule).
   - **Impact:** The process skips a mandatory step in the wrong order, which is a **serious normative violation**.

2. **Contradictory Action (Critical):**
   - **Finalize Documentation (10:00) occurs after Loan Decision (Rejected).**
   - **Violation:** Documentation should **never** be finalized if the loan is rejected (strict rule).
   - **Impact:** This is a **direct violation** of the normative constraints, as it contradicts the decision logic.

3. **Closing Without Proper Precedents (Minor but Related):**
   - The case is closed (10:30) after an invalid step (Finalize Documentation), but the **primary issue is the earlier violations**.
   - **Not a standalone violation**, but the sequence is broken.

- **Conclusion:** **Case 2 violates two critical normative rules** (ordering and contradictory action). The process is fundamentally flawed and should be corrected.

---

#### **Case 3: No Normative Violations**
- **Sequence:** Follows the strict order:
  `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`.
- **No contradictions:** Documentation is only finalized after approval, and the case is closed correctly.
- **Conclusion:** **Compliant with all normative rules**, despite timing delays.

### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Recommended but Non-Strict)**

#### **Case 1: No Desiderata Violations**
- **Credit Check (09:30):** Completed **30 minutes** after application (well within 24 hours).
- **Inform Applicant (13:00):** Completed **2 hours** after decision (well within 48 hours).
- **Follow-up Call:** Not mentioned, but **not required** (desideratum).
- **Conclusion:** **Fully complies with all desiderata.**

---

#### **Case 2: No Desiderata Violations (Irrelevant for Violations)**
- Since Case 2 already violates normative rules, desiderata are **not applicable** for this case.
- **Conclusion:** **No meaningful desiderata assessment** (focus is on fixing the normative issues).

---

#### **Case 3: Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Not Critical)**
1. **Timing Violation (Credit Check):**
   - **Credit Check (10:00 on Jan 14):** Happens **4 days after application (Jan 12 09:00).**
   - **Desideratum:** Preferred within **24 hours**.
   - **Impact:** **Suboptimal delay**, but not a normative violation.

2. **Timing Violation (Inform Applicant):**
   - **Inform Applicant (15:00 on Jan 16):** Happens **2 days after decision (Jan 14 12:00).**
   - **Desideratum:** Preferred within **48 hours**.
   - **Impact:** **Significant delay**, but not a normative violation.

3. **Missing Follow-up Call:**
   - **No Follow-up Call recorded.**
   - **Desideratum:** Encouraged but not required.
   - **Impact:** **Missed opportunity for alignment**, but not a violation.

- **Conclusion:** **Case 3 fails to meet two timing desiderata** (credit check and applicant notification delays) and misses a recommended follow-up call. These are **suboptimal but not critical** issues.

### **3. Interpretations/Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

#### **Case 2: Why Did the Process Violate Normative Rules?**
Possible explanations (though not excuses):
- **Human Error:** An employee may have mistakenly performed Risk Assessment before Credit Check (e.g., due to oversight or miscommunication).
- **System Bug:** The workflow tool might have allowed out-of-order steps if not properly configured.
- **Workaround Attempt:** Someone may have tried to "skip" steps (e.g., assuming creditworthiness without a check), leading to contradictions later.
- **No Justification:** The most likely scenario is **a fundamental breakdown in process adherence**, requiring immediate correction.

#### **Case 3: Why Were Desiderata Ignored?**
Possible explanations (non-critical but worth addressing):
- **Resource Constraints:** Delays in Credit Check/Risk Assessment may stem from high workload or backlog (e.g., manual review bottlenecks).
- **Applicant Availability:** Informing the applicant later could be due to scheduling conflicts (e.g., applicant not reachable within 48 hours).
- **Follow-up Call Neglected:** Low priority in a high-volume system, or the case was closed before follow-up was scheduled.
- **Process Optimization:** If delays are systematic, they may indicate inefficiencies (e.g., slow credit bureaus) that could be improved.

#### **General Observations:**
- **Normative violations (Case 2) are unacceptable** and require process fixes (e.g., stricter workflow enforcement, training, or system updates).
- **Desiderata violations (Case 3) are opportunities for improvement** (e.g., automating reminders for timing, adding follow-up call prompts).
- **Case 1 is the gold standard**—adhering to both normative rules and desiderata ensures efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### **Summary Table of Findings**

| Case | Normative Violations               | Desiderata Violations                     | Status               |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | None                                | None                                      | **Perfect Compliance** |
| 2    |  Risk Assessment before Credit Check <br>  Finalize Documentation after Rejection | N/A (normative violations override) | **Critical Failure** |
| 3    | None                                |  Credit Check delay (>24h) <br>  Inform Applicant delay (>48h) <br>  No Follow-up Call | **Suboptimal but Compliant** |

### **Recommendations for Improvement**
1. **For Case 2:**
   - **Immediate Corrective Action:** Reprocess the case by following the strict sequence (Credit Check  Risk Assessment  ...).
   - **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate why the workflow was bypassed (training, system design, or oversight).
   - **Prevent Future Violations:** Enforce strict ordering in the process tool (e.g., disable "Risk Assessment" until "Credit Check" is complete).

2. **For Case 3:**
   - **Address Timing Delays:**
     - Automate reminders for Credit Check/Risk Assessment deadlines.
     - Use workflow alerts for applicant notification within 48 hours.
   - **Encourage Follow-up Calls:**
     - Add a default "Follow-up Call" step before closing approved cases.
     - Provide incentives for employees to complete follow-ups (e.g., performance metrics).

3. **For All Cases:**
   - **Audit Process Adherence:** Regularly check event logs for normative violations.
   - **Document Desiderata:** Clearly communicate timing goals to staff to reduce delays.
   - **Balance Strictness and Flexibility:** Ensure normative rules are enforced while allowing room for desiderata improvements.
