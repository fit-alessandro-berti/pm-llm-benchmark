### Justification of Naming Choices

1. **Verify Initial Documents**:
   - The first instance of "Verify Documents" occurs immediately after the customer initiates the request. This step involves checking the initial set of documents submitted by the customer.
   - The second instance occurs after the customer has uploaded additional documents, implying that these documents were verified in the context of updated information.

2. **Contact Customer**:
   - This activity is used consistently where an agent reaches out to the customer, whether it's for additional information or follow-up.
   - In the case of C003, the contact was because the customer had stepped out, while in C002, it was to clarify discrepancies.

3. **Submit Additional Docs**:
   - This activity specifically refers to the customer uploading additional documents as requested by the agent.
   - It is distinct from the initial document submission.

4. **Update Account Internally**:
   - This activity reflects internal changes made to the customer's account based on the conversation with the customer.
   - It distinguishes between the actual update action and other activities like verifying documents.

5. **Verify Updated Docs**:
   - This activity is used when the documents are checked again after the customer has submitted additional information.
   - It is a re-verification step to ensure all required documents are complete and accurate.

6. **Final Approval**:
   - This term is used consistently to denote the final step of approving the request after all necessary verifications and updates have been completed.
   - It signifies the culmination of the process.

By renaming the activities as shown, the event log becomes more descriptive and easier to understand, reducing ambiguity and making the workflow clearer.
