## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities and transitions
A = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
B = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
C = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
D = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
E = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
F = SilentTransition()  # Representing a loop back to SkillAssessment
G = SilentTransition()  # Representing a loop back to CulturalFitCheck
H = SilentTransition()  # Representing a loop for implicit advantage in CommunityAffiliationCheck

# Loop and XOR structures
loop_skill = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, F])
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[B, C])

# Main workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_skill])
root.order.add_edge(loop_skill)
root.extend(StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[xor_cultural]))
root.order.add_edge(loop_skill, xor_cultural)
```

In this model, after the `SkillAssessment`, there's an XOR choice between a standard cultural fit evaluation (`CulturalFitCheck`) and a community-based assessment (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`). The latter gives a subtle advantage to those affiliated with local groups. This structure inherently introduces potential bias in the hiring process.

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities and transitions
A = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
B = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
C = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
D = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop structure
loop_skill = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A])

# Cultural fit assessment only
cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[B])

# Main workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_skill])
root.order.add_edge(loop_skill)
root.extend(StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural]))
root.order.add_edge(loop_skill, cultural)
```

Here, the model ensures fairness by removing the community-based advantage branch (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`). All applicants undergo the same skill assessment and then progress through the standardized cultural fit evaluation process. This eliminates the potential source of bias introduced in the first model.
