### **Analysis of Deviations from the Normative Process**

Based on the normative process description, we can identify the following **valid sequences** for order handling:

1. **Sufficient Inventory (Happy Path):**
   `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

2. **Insufficient Inventory (Cancellation Path):**
   `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`

Any deviation from these sequences (or logical inconsistencies within them) constitutes a violation. Below is the analysis of each case in the event log:

---

### **Case 1**
**Sequence:**
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

**Evaluation:**
- Follows the **happy path** exactly.
- No violations detected.

**Conclusion:**  **Compliant**

---

### **Case 2**
**Sequence:**
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

**Violations:**
1. **`Package items` before `Authorize payment`**
   - The normative process states that **payment must be authorized before packaging** ("Authorize payment should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging").
   - Packaging items before payment authorization is a **logical inconsistency** (e.g., what if payment fails later?).

**Conclusion:**  **Non-compliant**

---

### **Case 3**
**Sequence:**
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

**Violations:**
1. **`Ship order` after `Cancel order`**
   - The normative process explicitly states that **shipping should never occur after cancellation** ("Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation").
   - Once an order is canceled, no further fulfillment activities (packaging, shipping) should take place.

2. **`Authorize payment` before `Cancel order`**
   - While not explicitly forbidden, this is **illogical** because payment authorization should only happen if the order is proceeding to fulfillment.
   - If the order is canceled, payment authorization should not occur (or should be reversed).

**Conclusion:**  **Non-compliant**

---

### **Case 4**
**Sequence:**
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`

**Evaluation:**
- Follows the **cancellation path** exactly.
- No violations detected.

**Conclusion:**  **Compliant**

---

### **Case 5**
**Sequence:**
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

**Violations:**
1. **Missing `Package items` before `Ship order`**
   - The normative process states that **items must be packaged before shipping** ("Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping").
   - Shipping without packaging is a **process violation** (e.g., items may not be properly prepared for transit).

**Conclusion:**  **Non-compliant**

### **Summary of Violations**

| **Case ID** | **Compliant?** | **Violations** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1           |  Yes          | None           |
| 2           |  No           | Packaging before payment authorization |
| 3           |  No           | Shipping after cancellation; payment authorized before cancellation |
| 4           |  Yes          | None           |
| 5           |  No           | Shipping without packaging |

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Payment Authorization Must Precede Packaging**
   - Case 2 violates this by packaging before authorizing payment.

2. **No Shipping After Cancellation**
   - Case 3 violates this by shipping after canceling the order.

3. **Packaging is Mandatory Before Shipping**
   - Case 5 violates this by shipping without packaging.

4. **Cancellation Path Must Not Include Fulfillment Activities**
   - Case 3 also violates this by authorizing payment before cancellation (though this is more of a logical inconsistency than a strict process violation).

The normative process is **strict about the order of activities**, particularly around payment, packaging, and shipping. Any deviation from these constraints is considered a violation.
