The two logs differ only in that Group B candidates who belong to the “LocalBusinessLeadersClub” receive an explicit +5 “Association Boost” to their CulturalFit score, whereas no such adjustment is ever applied in Group A.  That single policy difference has a measurable impact on who gets hired:

  • In Group A (protected group), two candidates had a raw CulturalFit of 65 (P001, P003) and were hired; one candidate (P002) had a raw 60 and was not hired.  
  • In Group B (unprotected group), U002 had a raw 60 (no association) and was not hired—exactly paralleling P002.  But U001 (raw 60) and U003 (raw 58), by virtue of their association, had their CulturalFit raised to 65 and 63 respectively—and both were hired.  

Key observations  
1.  **Unearned advantage.**  U001 and U003 both received a mechanical +5 boost that those same rawscore candidates in Group A (and U002 in Group B) never did.  
2.  **Disparate outcomes at equal ability levels.**  Two candidates with identical raw CulturalFit=60 (P002 vs. U001) have opposite hire/nohire outcomes solely because of the boost.  
3.  **Relaxed hiring threshold.**  U003 is hired with an adjusted score of 63—below the 65 that non-affiliated and protected candidates needed to clear.  

All of this points unambiguously to bias in Group B’s process.  By privileging members of the LocalBusinessLeadersClub, the system:

  • Violates *treatment parity* (it treats otherwise-identical applicants differently),  
  • Undermines *opportunity fairness* (it penalizes equally or more qualified candidates who lack that affiliation), and  
  • Risks *compound disadvantage* for protected-group members if the association itself is harder for them to join.  

From an equity standpoint, any score adjustment should reflect genuine job-related criteria.  A blanket cultural-fit boost for a particular professional club introduces artificial preference, skews hiring toward an unprotected subgroup, and compromises both the integrity of the selection system and legal/regulatory fair-hiring obligations.  

To restore fairness one could:

  1. Remove all affiliation-based score adjustments.  
  2. Audit decisions to ensure that hiring correlates only with valid, consistent predictors of job performance.  
  3. Establish clear, pre-committed thresholds or rank-order rules that apply equally to every candidate.  

Without those safeguards, Group B’s process plainly exhibits disparate treatment bias—and erodes trust, diversity, and legal compliance in recruitment.
