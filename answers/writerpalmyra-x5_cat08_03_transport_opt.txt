Absolutely. As a Process Mining Consultant specializing in logistics and transport optimization, I’ll walk you through a comprehensive, data-driven approach to diagnose and transform Speedy Parcels’ delivery operations. Using the rich, multi-source event data collected over six months, we can uncover hidden inefficiencies, quantify root causes, and implement targeted improvements that directly impact on-time delivery and operational costs.

Let’s dive in.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

To conduct effective process mining, the first critical step is **integrating heterogeneous data sources into a unified event log**, where each row represents a timestamped event linked to a business process instance—here, a *vehicle-day case* (e.g., `V12-20241205`).

**Integration Strategy:**

- **Common Key (Case ID):** Use the structured `Vehicle ID + Date` format as the Case ID to unify GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance events.
- **Event Enrichment:**
  - Merge GPS points with nearby scanner events using spatial and temporal proximity (e.g., “Arrive Customer” should align with GPS location and low speed).
  - Enrich scanner events with planned time window data from the dispatch system.
  - Link maintenance events to the vehicle-day case; flag unscheduled repairs as process deviations.
- **Temporal Alignment:** Ensure timestamps across systems are synchronized (UTC or local with offset), and interpolate missing GPS pings if needed.
- **Activity Labeling:** Normalize event types into a consistent activity taxonomy (e.g., “Depart Depot”, “Delivery Success”, “Unexpected Idle”).

**Challenges:**
- **Temporal drift** between systems (scanner vs. GPS clocks).
- **Spatial mismatch** (scanner location approximated by GPS).
- **Event fragmentation**—e.g., multiple GPS idling records during one failed delivery.
- **Missing events**, like skipped scanner scans.

These issues require **cleansing rules** (e.g., gap-based segmentation, outlier filtering) and **imputation strategies** (e.g., infer “Arrive Customer” from GPS slowdown + next scan).

#### **Process Discovery: Mapping the Actual Flow**

Using **alpha miner, Heuristic miner, or Inductive miner algorithms**, we generate a **process model** visualizing actual behavior. Given the complexity of last-mile delivery, the discovered process will likely show multiple variants with loops (re-attempts), merges (traffic delays), and sub-processes (breakdowns, re-routing).

**Output:** A process map showing:
- Standard delivery segments (Depart  Arrive  Deliver  Depart).
- Detours via maintenance or traffic delays.
- Repeated attempts for failed deliveries.
- Idle periods between stops.

This reveals **real-world routing logic**, which may differ drastically from planned sequences—especially if dynamic rerouting occurs.

#### **Conformance Checking: Actual vs. Planned**

We align the discovered process and execution log with the **planned route model** from the dispatch system (a linear sequence of 35 stops in order, with expected durations).

**Techniques:**
- **Token-based replay** or **alignment-based conformance** to measure deviation cost.
- Compare planned stop order vs. actual executed sequence.

**Key Deviations to Flag:**
- **Sequence violations:** Stop 10 visited before Stop 3  likely indicates suboptimal routing.
- **Unplanned stops:** Maintenance events or extended idling (from GPS) not in the plan.
- **Late arrivals:** Actual “Arrive Customer” time exceeds planned window.
- **Excessive duration:** Total time per stop much higher than estimated (e.g., 15 mins vs. 5-min plan).
- **Missing activities:** No scan recorded for a package, despite GPS presence.

This conformance analysis **quantifies routing fidelity** and exposes systemic issues like route instability, underestimation of stop duration, or poor adherence.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

To diagnose inefficiencies, we define and compute key KPIs directly from the event log. These KPIs bridge operational data to business outcomes.

#### **Relevant KPIs and Calculation Methods**

| KPI | Formula | Data Source |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | % of deliveries where `Arrive Customer`  requested time window | Scanner + Dispatch |
| **Avg. Stop Duration** | Avg. (`Depart Customer` – `Arrive Customer`) | Scanner |
| **Service Time / Travel Time Ratio** | Total service time / Total travel time per vehicle-day | Scanner + GPS |
| **Fuel Consumption per km** | Estimated from engine load/speed profiles (via GPS) or OBD-II data | GPS + Fuel Logs |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (% of shift time vehicle is moving or servicing) | GPS + Driver Logs |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency** | Count of “Low Speed Detected” events >10 mins in congestion zones | GPS |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | % of attempted deliveries with “Delivery Failed” | Scanner |

#### **Bottleneck Identification via Process Mining**

Using **performance mining** and **variant analysis**, we localize pain points.

**Techniques & Insights:**
- **Heatmaps on Process Models:** Overlay average durations on transitions. Long wait times between “Depart Customer” and next “Arrive”  traffic or poor sequencing.
- **Variant Clustering:** Group vehicle-days by process path. Identify high-duration variants (e.g., those with unscheduled stops).
- **Rooted Bottleneck Analysis:** Use **social, organizational, or location mining** to answer:
  - Are delays clustered around specific **routes** (e.g., downtown on Friday mornings)?
  - Do certain **drivers** have longer stop times or higher failure rates?
  - Are specific **vehicles** frequently in maintenance?
  - Are **traffic slowdowns** recurring in the same GPS corridors?

**Example Finding:**  
A 45-minute delay between Stop 12 and 13 on Route R4 every Tuesday 10–11 AM  GPS shows consistent low speeds  mapped to chronic bottleneck at Riverbridge intersection.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Beyond symptom detection, we use process mining to **investigate underlying causes** of delays and costs.

#### **Potential Root Causes and Diagnostic Approaches**

1. **Suboptimal Static Routing**
   - *Evidence:* High sequence deviation, especially in mixed urban-suburban zones.
   - *Method:* Compare planned vs. actual paths. Use **route similarity metrics** (e.g., DTW) to show inefficiency.
   - *Validation:* Vehicles on dynamically adjusted routes (inferred from GPS loops) finish earlier  suggests rigidity of current planning.

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimation**
   - *Evidence:* Planned leg durations too short; persistent late arrivals.
   - *Method:* Compute **expected vs. actual travel time per route segment** using historical GPS traces.
   - *Root Cause:* Dispatch system uses straight-line distances or constant speeds, not real-world traffic.

3. **Traffic Congestion Patterns**
   - *Evidence:* Recurring “Low Speed Detected” clusters.
   - *Method:* **Spatiotemporal clustering** of GPS slowdowns. Overlay with city traffic data.
   - *Insight:* 68% of delays in Zone A occur 7:30–9:00 AM on weekdays.

4. **High Service Time Variability**
   - *Evidence:* Avg. 3 min stop, but 25% exceed 10 min.
   - *Method:* **Dwell time analysis**. Correlate long stops with:
     - Apartment buildings (hard to park/access).
     - Failed delivery follow-ups.
     - Elderly or business customers.
   - *Root Cause:* Poor customer-level service time prediction.

5. **Vehicle Breakdowns During Shifts**
   - *Evidence:* Unscheduled stop events linked to maintenance log entries.
   - *Method:* **Correlate vehicle age, mileage, and engine warnings** with downtime.
   - *Insight:* 70% of breakdowns occur in vehicles >5 years old with >200k km.

6. **Driver Behavior Differences**
   - *Method:* **Driver performance benchmarking**:
     - On-time rate.
     - Avg. stop duration.
     - Idle time %.
   - *Insight:* Top 2 drivers have 95% on-time rate; bottom 2 are at 62% — difference not explained by route difficulty.

7. **Failed Delivery Attempts**
   - *Impact:* Triggers re-delivery (extra km, fuel, labor).
   - *Root Cause Analysis:* 
     - High “Customer Not Home” in afternoon residential zones.
     - Correlate with time windows (e.g., 9–5 when people work).
     - Scanner logs show no delivery window confirmation.

  - Dwell time analysis: repeated same-day visits for re-attempts.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Predict failed delivery risk** per package using ML model trained on:
    - Customer type (residential/commercial).
    - Historical success rate at address.
    - Time of day.
    - Driver arrival time vs. window.
  - **Automatically trigger SMS/email** 1 hour before expected arrival: “Your driver is nearby. Can we reschedule to tonight?”
  - Allow **customer self-rescheduling** via link to alternate window.
  - Route engine adjusts in real-time.
- **Expected KPI Impact:**
  - -30% failed delivery attempts.
  - +25% first-time delivery success.
  - Immediate fuel and labor savings from avoided re-runs.

### **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

#### **Respecting Operational Realities**

Optimizations must work *within* real-world limits:

- **Driver Hours:** Any new routing respects legal/contracted shift lengths. Use logs (`Start/End Shift`, breaks) to enforce max 10-hour duty.
- **Vehicle Capacity:** Dispatch system integrates package volume/weight with vehicle limits—no overloading.
- **Time Windows:** Customer commitments preserved. Dynamic routing prioritizes time-sensitive stops.
- **Maintenance Scheduling:** Avoid dispatching vehicles flagged in logs for recurring issues.

All strategies use **predictive constraints**—e.g., rerouting only if new path completes within shift limits.

#### **Continuous Monitoring & Feedback Loop**

Process mining isn’t a one-time project. We establish **ongoing operational intelligence**.

**Dashboard Components:**

1. **Real-Time Process Conformance Monitor:**
   - Live alerts for major deviations (e.g., vehicle idle >30 mins, missed time window).
2. **KPI Trend Dashboard:**
   - Weekly trends in on-time rate, failed deliveries, fuel use.
   - Driver performance leaderboard (with privacy).
3. **Bottleneck Heatmap:**
   - Geographic overlay of delay hotspots (from GPS).
4. **Variant Explorer:**
   - Auto-detect new process variants (e.g., new failure pattern).
5. **Predictive Maintenance Feed:**
   - Vehicles flagged for service based on usage analytics (engine stress, mileage, fault codes).

**Feedback Loop:**

- Monthly **process mining review** with operations team.
- A/B test new routing logic on small fleet subset.
- Update models quarterly with new data to adapt to seasonal changes.
