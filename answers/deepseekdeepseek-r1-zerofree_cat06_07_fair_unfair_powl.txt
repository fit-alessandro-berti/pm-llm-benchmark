To solve this, we need to design two POWL models based on the described hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. 

First, let us identify the main activities described in the process:
1. `ReceiveApplication` (where resumes and questionnaires are submitted).
2. `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck` (automated system scans resumes for key qualifications and checks for missing information).
3. `SkillAssessment` (online skill test for domain-specific knowledge).
4. `CulturalFitCheck` (standard cultural fit assessment).
5. `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (a branch where applicants who indicate membership in the "Global Business Leaders Club" or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation).
6. `ManagerialReview` (hiring manager examines borderline candidates).
7. `FinalDecision` (final decision made to either hire or reject the candidate).

Based on the process description, the steps are ordered as follows:
1. `ReceiveApplication` is followed by `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck`. If there is missing information, the process loops back to `RequestMoreInfo` until the resume is complete.
2. After `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck`, the `SkillAssessment` occurs where a score threshold determines if an applicant proceeds or is disqualified.
3. After `SkillAssessment`, there is an XOR choice where either a `CulturalFitCheck` is performed (standard path) or a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` is performed if the applicant is part of a specific local group ("Global Business Leaders Club" or local resident), which provides an implicit score adjustment.
4. After the XOR branch (either `CulturalFitCheck` or `CommunityAffiliationCheck`), the `ManagerialReview` follows where the hiring manager makes a final review.
5. Finally, the `FinalDecision` is made based on the `ManagerialReview`.

#### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

1. `ReceiveApplication` and `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck` are part of a "loop" process where if data is missing, the system loops back to request more information until all necessary data is provided.
2. After `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck`, the next part is `SkillAssessment`, which checks if the applicant meets a score threshold.
3. After `SkillAssessment`, there is an XOR branch where:
   - If the applicant is part of the "Global Business Leaders Club" or is a local resident, `CommunityAffiliationCheck` is performed (which provides a "cultural fit score uplift").
   - If the applicant is not part of the "Global Business Leaders Club" or is not a local resident, `CulturalFitCheck` is performed.
  4. Both `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` lead to `ManagerialReview` where the hiring manager makes a review.
  5. `ManagerialReview` leads to `FinalDecision`.

Let us define the POWL model for this "unfair" process:

#### POWL model with potential unfairness:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
Skip = SilentTransition()

# Part 1: Loop for data completeness check (until resume is complete)
ResumeCheckLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Part 2: After resume check, skill assessment follows
# Sequential order from ReceiveApplication to ResumeCheckLoop to SkillAssessment
Order1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, ResumeCheckLoop, SkillAssessment])
Order1.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, ResumeCheckLoop)
Order1.order.add_edge(ResumeCheckLoop, SkillAssessment)

# Part 3: After SkillAssessment, there is an XOR branch where either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck is performed
# (This is where the potential unfairness is introduced)
XorBranch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Part 4: After the XOR branch, ManagerialReview follows, which leads to FinalDecision
# Another order for the part after SkillAssessment until FinalDecision
Order2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SkillAssessment, XorBranch, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
Order2.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorBranch)
Order2.order.add_edge(XorBranch, ManagerialReview)
Order2.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Combine the two main parts into an overall order where Order1 leads to Order2
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Order1, Order2])
root.order.add_edge(Order1, Order2)

```

#### POWL Model Without Unfairness

For the second model, the "unfair" XOR branch should be removed so that all applicants go through the same `CulturalFitCheck` process.
1. `ReceiveApplication` and `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck` remain in a loop until all necessary data is provided.
2. `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck` is followed by `SkillAssessment`.
3. After `SkillAssessment`, all applicants go through `CulturalFitCheck`.
4. After `CulturalFitCheck`, `ManagerialReview` is performed.
5. Finally, `FinalDecision` is made based on `ManagerialReview`.

#### POWL model without unfairness:
```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
Skip = SilentTransition()

# Part 1: Loop for data completeness check (until resume is complete)
ResumeCheckLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Part 2: After resume check, skill assessment follows, which leads to a cultural fit check for all applicants
Order1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, ResumeCheckLoop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
Order1.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, ResumeCheckLoop)
Order1.order.add_edge(ResumeCheckLoop, SkillAssessment)
Order1.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
Order1.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
Order1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The root node is the main order itself in this case.
root = Order1
```

These two POWL models reflect the hiring process described in the question where the first one includes a potential unfairness due to a special branch for some applicants based on local affiliations, while the second one makes all applicants follow the same `CulturalFitCheck` process.

Order1.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# The root node is the main order itself in this case.
root_without_unfairness = Order1

# To visualize the models, you can use the following functions (requires graphviz and pm4py visualization capabilities):
# pm4py.view_powl(root_with_unfairness, format="png")
# pm4py.view_powl(root_without_unfairness, format="png")
```

This reasoning process provides two POWL models as required: one with a potential source of unfairness due to a branch that handles candidates differently based on their community affiliations, and another one where all candidates follow a single path through the `CulturalFitCheck` activity, thus avoiding the potential unfairness.
