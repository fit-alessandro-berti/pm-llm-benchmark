Here is a process tree that captures the described hospital process.

### Process tree (using `->`, `X`, `+`, `*`, and `tau`)

```text
PT =
->(
  'A',                      # Arrival
  'RG',                     # Registration
  'IA',                     # Intake Assessment
  'TI',                     # Triage Interview
  'TC',                     # Triage Classification

  X('CE', 'FBP'),           # Initial diagnostic: ECG vs Blood Panel

  X(                        # Normal vs abnormal result after initial test
    tau,                    # Normal: no loop at all
    *(

        X(                  #   Re-diagnostic test (RDT): ECG-type vs Blood-type
          ->('RDT', 'FCE'), #     RDT + Follow-up ECG

### How this matches the description (briefly)

- `->('A','RG','IA','TI','TC', ...)`  
  Arrival  Registration  Intake Assessment  Triage Interview  Triage Classification.

- `X('CE','FBP')`  
  Exclusive choice: initial diagnostic is either Comprehensive ECG or Full Blood Panel.

- `X(tau, *(...))`  
  Models the “abnormal results loop” as optional:
  - `tau` branch = initial test is normal  skip the loop.
  - `*( Body , tau )` branch = abnormal  execute one or more iterations of:
    `SC`  (`TM` or `SPT`)  re-diagnostic test:
    - RDT with either follow-up ECG (`->('RDT','FCE')`) or follow-up blood analysis (`->('RDT','FBA')`).
    The loop can repeat arbitrarily many times.

- `+('AI','NC')`  
  Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling in true concurrency (both must occur, in any order/overlap).

- `->('FAS','DDI', +('BL','ICP','MRF'))`  
  After imaging/counseling, the patient gets follow-up scheduling and discharge instructions, then a final parallel block for Billing, Insurance Claims Processing, and Medical Records Finalization. After all three parallel activities are done, the process ends.
