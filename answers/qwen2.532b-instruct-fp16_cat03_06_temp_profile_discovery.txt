Certainly! A temporal profile aims to represent the typical sequence of events and their timing within a process. Given your data, we can create a timeline that captures how often each step occurs in relation to other steps.

Let's summarize the major steps involved:

1. **Create Fine**
2. **Send Fine**
3. **Insert Fine Notification**
4. **Payment** (This may occur at multiple stages)
5. **Add penalty** (Usually after non-payment or an appeal process)
6. **Appeal to Judge** 
7. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**
8. **Send Appeal to Prefecture**
9. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture**
10. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender**
11. **Send for Credit Collection**

Based on the frequencies and performances, let's create a simplified temporal profile:

### Temporal Profile

**Step 1: Create Fine**
- **Frequency:** Occurs in all sequences.
  
**Step 2: Send Fine**
- **Frequency:** Occurs in almost all sequences after "Create Fine".

**Step 3: Insert Fine Notification**
- **Frequency:** Often follows the sending of a fine.

**Step 4: Payment**
- **Frequency:** Can occur immediately or at different stages. Commonly seen right after the notification.
  
**Step 5: Add penalty**
- **Frequency:** Follows non-payment and sometimes an appeal process.
 
**Step 6: Appeal Processes (Appeal to Judge, Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture)**
- **Frequency:** Typically occurs after receiving a fine but can also follow the addition of penalties.

### Simplified Timeline

1. **Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification**: These are initial steps that almost always occur together.
2. **Payment**: If paid here, the process ends quickly.
3. **Add Penalty** (if not paid):
   - **Option 1:** Further payments may be made.
   - **Option 2:** Appeal to Judge or Prefecture:
     a. Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender
4. **Appeal Outcome**:
   - If unsuccessful, penalties and possibly sending for credit collection.
5. **Final Payment**: Usually follows after the appeal process or penalty addition if not resolved earlier.

### Visual Representation

```
1. Create Fine
2. Send Fine
3. Insert Fine Notification
      -> (a) Payment: Process ends here.
          (b) Add Penalty:
               * Further Payments and/or Appeals:
                  i. Appeal to Judge: Process may end with payments.
                  ii. Appeal to Prefecture:
                        - Insert Date Appeal
                        - Send Appeal
                        - Receive Result
                        - Notify Offender
                        - Payment if successful appeal, otherwise additional penalties and possibly sending for credit collection.
```

### Temporal Performance Insights

- The process is most efficient when payment occurs immediately after the notification (e.g., 20 times with performance around 12-36M).
- Adding penalties often leads to further delays and higher costs (e.g., performances above 45M).
- Appeals can add significant time, especially if followed by additional penalties or credit collection processes.

This profile helps identify common paths and potential bottlenecks in the fine management process.
