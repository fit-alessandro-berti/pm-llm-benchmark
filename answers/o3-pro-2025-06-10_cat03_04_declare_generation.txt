Here is a possible DECLARE model (conforming to the data-structure that pm4py expects) for the product design and launch process that you described.  
All confidences are set to 1.0 and every rule is assumed to be fully supported (support = 1.0).

```python
declare_model = {
    # ------------- unary constraints -------------
    # At least one occurrence
    'existence': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'AG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
    },

    # Never happens (none in this scenario)
    'absence': {},

    # Happens exactly once
    'exactly_one': {
        'FL': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },

    # Must be the first activity of every trace
    'init': {
        'IG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },

    # ------------- binary constraints -------------
    # If A occurs, B must also occur (order is irrelevant)
    'responded_existence': {
        'PC': {'LT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Building a prototype implies it will be tested in the lab
        'LT': {'UT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Lab testing implies some user testing will also be done
    },

    # A and B always co-exist in the same case
    'coexistence': {
        'TFC': {'CE': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},  # Technical feasibility check always co-exists with cost evaluation
    },

    # If A occurs, B must eventually follow
    'response': {
        'IG': {'DD': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Idea Generation  (eventually) Design Draft
        'DD': {'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},  # Design Draft  Technical Feasibility Check
        'AG': {'MP': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Approval Gate  Marketing Plan
    },

    # B can happen only if A happened some time before
    'precedence': {
        'AG': {'UT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Approval Gate is allowed only if User Testing has taken place
    },

    # A response + precedence combined (both directions must hold)
    'succession': {
        'PC': {'LT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Prototype Creation  Laboratory Testing
        'LT': {'UT': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # Lab Testing  User Testing
    },

    # Alternative-response / alternative-precedence / alternative-succession
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},

    # Immediate-next (chain) variants
    'chainresponse': {
        'DD': {'TFC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},  # DD is immediately followed by TFC
        'TFC': {'CE':  {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}, # TFC is immediately followed by CE
    },

    'chainprecedence': {
        'LT': {'PC': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # LT must be immediately preceded by PC
    },

    'chainsuccession': {
        'UT': {'AG': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},   # UT must be immediately followed by AG
    },

    # Negative constraints (none needed for this example)
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

Explanation of the most relevant rules:

• init(IG): Every product case always starts with Idea Generation.  
• existence(AG), existence(FL): Approval Gate and the Final Launch must both occur in every case.  
• exactly_one(FL): The product is launched exactly once.  
• response(IG, DD) + response(DD, TFC): After ideas are generated, they must be drafted, and every draft must lead to a technical feasibility check.  
• chainresponse(DD, TFC) + chainresponse(TFC, CE): DD is immediately followed by TFC, and right after TFC the Cost Evaluation is performed.  
• responded_existence(PC, LT): If a prototype is created, laboratory testing is mandatory somewhere in the case.  
• succession(PC, LT): The combination of response(PC, LT) and precedence(LT, PC) enforces that the pair Prototype Creation  Laboratory Testing always occurs in that order and both exist if either exists.  
• chainprecedence(LT, PC): Laboratory testing cannot happen without being right after a prototype creation.  
• chainsuccession(UT, AG): Immediately after user testing, the Approval Gate has to be passed.
