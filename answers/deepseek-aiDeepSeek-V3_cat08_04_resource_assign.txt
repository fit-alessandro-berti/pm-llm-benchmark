### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

**Performance Metrics and Behavior Analysis:**
- **Workload Distribution:** Measure the number of tickets assigned and resolved per agent and tier over time to identify imbalances.
- **Activity Processing Times:** Analyze the average time spent per activity (e.g., ticket creation, assignment, resolution) by agent and tier.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate for L1:** Calculate the percentage of tickets resolved at the L1 tier without escalation.
- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:** Track how often agents handle tickets requiring specific skills and compare this to their documented skill sets.

**Process Mining Techniques:**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Map interactions between agents and tickets to identify common patterns and deviations.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Analyze handovers and escalations to understand the flow of tickets between agents and tiers.
- **Role Discovery:** Identify roles based on the types of tickets and activities agents perform, comparing them to the intended assignment logic.
- **Skill Utilization:** Assess how often specialized skills are used and whether they match the required skills for tickets.

**Comparison to Intended Logic:**
- Compare actual assignment patterns to the intended logic (e.g., round-robin and manual escalations) to identify discrepancies and inefficiencies.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

**Pinpointing Problems:**
- **Skill Availability Bottlenecks:** Identify periods where tickets required specific skills but were delayed due to lack of available agents.
- **Reassignment Delays:** Quantify the average delay introduced by reassignments and escalations.
- **Incorrect Initial Assignments:** Track cases where L1 agents or dispatchers made suboptimal initial assignments leading to escalations.
- **Underperforming/Overloaded Agents:** Identify agents/teams with unusually high or low workload and resolution times.
- **SLA Breaches Correlation:** Analyze correlations between resource assignment patterns and SLA breaches.

**Impact Quantification:**
- Measure the average delay per reassignment and the percentage of SLA breaches linked to skill mismatches.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

**Potential Root Causes:**
- **Deficient Assignment Rules:** Current rules may not consider skills or workload adequately.
- **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:** Agent skill profiles may be incomplete or outdated.
- **Poor Ticket Categorization:** Initial categorization or skill requirement identification may be inaccurate.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Dispatchers may lack real-time insights into agent workload and availability.
- **Insufficient L1 Training:** L1 agents may lack the training or empowerment to resolve more issues, leading to excessive escalations.

**Techniques for Analysis:**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare cases with smooth assignments to those with frequent reassignments to identify contributing factors.
- **Decision Mining:** Use decision mining to identify the factors leading to poor assignment decisions.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

**Strategy 1: Skill-Based Routing**
- **Issue Addressed:** Mismatch between agent skills and ticket requirements.
- **Insights Leveraged:** Skill utilization analysis and role discovery.
- **Data Required:** Updated agent skill profiles and ticket skill requirements.
- **Expected Benefits:** Reduced resolution time and fewer reassignments.

**Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm**
- **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution.
- **Insights Leveraged:** Workload distribution analysis and activity processing times.
- **Data Required:** Real-time workload and availability data.
- **Expected Benefits:** Improved SLA compliance and balanced workload.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment**
- **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial assignments.
- **Insights Leveraged:** Ticket categorization and skill requirement analysis.
- **Data Required:** Historical ticket characteristics and resolution data.
- **Expected Benefits:** Better initial assignments and reduced escalations.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

**Business Process Simulation:**
- Use mined process models and resource characteristics to simulate the impact of proposed strategies before implementation.

**Monitoring Plan:**
- **Key KPIs:** Track first-call resolution rate, average resolution time, SLA compliance rate, and reassignment frequency.
- **Process Views:** Monitor resource interaction maps and workload distribution dashboards continuously.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Simulate Proposed Strategies:** Use business process simulation to evaluate potential impacts.
2. **Pilot Testing:** Implement strategies on a small scale to validate effectiveness.
3. **Full Implementation:** Roll out strategies across the entire service desk.
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Use process mining dashboards to monitor key KPIs and adjust strategies as needed.
