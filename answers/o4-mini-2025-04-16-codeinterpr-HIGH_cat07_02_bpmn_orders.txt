This is a BPMN “swim-lane” process model showing an end-to-end order-fulfillment flow through four departments—Sales, Production, Procurement and Warehouse—using standard BPMN elements (tasks, gateways, events, message flows, a data store and a subprocess). Here’s a walkthrough of what you see:

 1. Swimlanes  
    – Sales (top)  
    – Production  
    – Procurement  
    – Warehouse (bottom)  

 2. Sales lane  
    • A timer start event (“Monday morning”) kicks off “Check order for completeness.”  
    • Next an exclusive gateway “Check if customer is already in the database.”  
        – If no, the “Add customer to the database” task runs (with the cylinder icon beside it).  
        – Both paths then re-join.  
    • “Send order details” (this task emits a message flow)  
    • “Draft invoice” (end event)  

 3. Message flows from Sales “Send order details”  
    • Into Production’s message start event (“Order details arrive”)  
    • Into Procurement’s message start event (“Order details arrive”)  

 4. Production lane  
    • Upon receipt of order details, “Plan production.”  
    • A gateway evaluates material condition:  
        – If materials are OK, proceed to “Manufacture product”  emits an intermediate “Product complete” message event.  
        – If materials are faulty, a dashed message flow goes out to Procurement.  

 5. Procurement lane  
    • On order-details arrival, a reusable subprocess “Material Compensation Subprocess” handles re-ordering or returning bad material.  
    • After that subprocess, the normal flow continues into “Check materials.”  
    • An exclusive gateway then either:  
        – Loops back to “Material Compensation” if still defective, or  
        – Goes to an end event “Order cancellation” if no viable material can be obtained.  

 6. Back in Production (resuming from Procurement’s OK materials), manufacturing completes and fires “Product complete.”  

 7. Warehouse lane  
    • Receives “Product complete” (message start event)  
    • “Send product” task  emits “Product sent” intermediate event  

 8. Final feedback to Sales  
    • The “Product sent” message flow returns to Sales (feeding into the “Draft invoice” activity).  

Visually you’ll also notice:  
  - Timer icon for the Monday-morning trigger  
  - Envelope icons on message events and tasks to show inter-department messages  
  - Cylinder (database) icon on the “Add customer” task  
  - Subprocess boundary with its own internal flow  
  - Dashed lines = message flows between lanes; solid lines = “normal” sequence flow  

In short, it’s a classic BPMN depiction of an order-to-cash process, coordinating checks, databases, inter-department messages, a materials-replenishment subprocess and final delivery.
