This pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a workflow for processing customer requests, which can either be **Standard** or **Custom**. The process includes tasks for validation, feasibility checks, approvals, and confirmation, with built-in logic for handling rework and conditional decision-making. Here's a breakdown:

### **1. Start Event:**

The workflow starts when a request is received from the customer.

### **2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request":**

The primary goal here is to capture information regarding the customer’s request, setting the stage for validity and type evaluation.

- **Purpose**: Ensures the request is accepted and documented accurately for further processing.

### **3. Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type":**

This decision gateway evaluates whether the request type is **Standard** or **Custom**. The choice determines the subsequent path.

- **Purpose**: Diverts the workflow into one of two distinct paths based on the nature of the request.

### **Path for Standard Request:**

#### Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation":

This step involves verifying the compliance of the request against predefined standards.

- **Purpose**: Ensures that all standard requests meet the minimum criteria before proceeding with further checks.

#### Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks":

Here, two parallel tasks are initiated.

- **Purpose**: Allows credit and inventory checks to occur simultaneously to optimize processing time.

#### Task C1: "Credit Check":

Ensures the customer’s financial viability to proceed with the request.

- **Purpose**: Validates that the request is financially sound.

#### Task C2: "Inventory Check":

Verifies that the necessary inventory or resources are available to meet the request.

- **Purpose**: Ensures resource availability before finalizing delivery timelines.

#### Join (All Parallel Checks Completed):

Ensures that both parallel tasks (C1 and C2) are completed before moving to the next step.

- **Purpose**: Synchronizes the workflow after parallel checks, preventing further steps until all checks are validated.

#### Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date":

Uses the results of the above checks to compute the expected delivery timeline.

- **Purpose**: Provides a realistic commitment date to the customer, based on credit and inventory availability.

### **Path for Custom Request:**

#### Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis":

This task assesses the technical or business feasibility of a custom request.

- **Purpose**: Evaluates the possibility of fulfilling a customized requirement.

#### Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?":

This decision point determines whether customization is possible.

- **Yes**: Leads to task E1 for quotation preparation.
- **No**: Leads to task E2, where a rejection notice is sent to the customer.

#### Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation":

Generates a quote for the customer, considering the special requirements.

- **Purpose**: Prepares a customized offer for the customer.

#### Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice":

Notifies the customer if the request cannot be customized due to feasibility issues.

- **Purpose**: Ends the workflow for infeasible requests.

### **Path Convergence:**

After completing either the **Standard** or **Custom Path**, the workflow converges at the next decision gateway to check for approval.

### **4. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?":**

This decision point assesses if the request requires management approval before proceeding.

- **If Yes**: Leads to Task F for manager approval.
- **If No**: Directly moves to generating the final invoice (Task G).

#### Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval":

Submits the request to a manager for review and decision.

- **Purpose**: Ensures that higher authority validation is obtained for sensitive requests.

#### Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?":

Determines the next action based on whether the manager approves or rejects the request.

- **If Yes**: Task G, "Generate Final Invoice," is executed.
- **If No**: Task H, "Re-evaluate Conditions," is triggered to loop the workflow back to previous steps for adjustment.

#### Task G: "Generate Final Invoice":

Prepares and issues the invoice for the approved request.

- **Purpose**: Solidifies the commitment to fulfill the request by sending the customer a formal invoice.

#### Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions":

In case of rejection after approval, this step involves revisiting the feasibility, validation, or quotation steps for recalibration.

- **Purpose**: Allows rework to address the issues flagged during approval.

### **Re-Loop to Prior Steps:**

- For **Custom Requests**, the loop goes back to Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation," where the quotation is adjusted and re-evaluated.
- For **Standard Requests**, the process loops back to Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date," to re-examine resource or credit considerations.

### **5. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer":**

This final task sends confirmation of the processed request to the customer, marking the end of the workflow.

- **Purpose**: Completes the communication loop, ensuring the customer is informed of the final status or next steps.

### **End Event:**

Marks the end of the process, indicating the workflow is complete.

### **Key Differences Based on Request Type:**

- **Standard Requests** follow a linear path with checks, while **Custom Requests** involve a feasibility assessment and possible rejection or quotation steps.
- **Approval-Needed Scenarios** introduce additional managerial decision-making and potential for loopbacks for rework.

### **Conditions for Approvals or Rework:**

- Approvals are triggered based on business rules or thresholds (e.g., high value or complexity).
- Rework occurs if approval is denied or conditions change after initial processing.

This workflow balances requests of different types and ensures checks and balances at every decision point.
