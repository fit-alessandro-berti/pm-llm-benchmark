This visualization consists of three main parts illustrating a workflow and data channels related to lab tests and their management:

1. **Procedural Workflow (a):**
   - **Left Diagram (Two Proclet Classes Connected):**
     This part shows a detailed process flow involving two proclet classes (likely small, modular processes or units) connected through channels for lab test management.
     - **Order Entry:** Initiated by a doctor, where a lab order is entered.
     - **Take Blood Sample:** Performed by a lab assistant.
     - **Order System Interaction:** The order system processes the entry.
     - **Perform Test:** The lab performs the actual test, which involves chemical analysis.
     - **Make Report:** Generates a report from the test results.
     - **Receive Result:** The results are received and judged.
     - **Do Tests Again:** If needed, additional tests are performed again.
     - **Send Report:** Final report is sent out after finishing the test.

     Channels (intermediate steps) include:
     - Between the order system and performing the test.
     - Between the results and judging them.
     - Between receiving updated results and sending the final report.

   - **Flow of Lab Visits and Tests:**
     Lab visits and tests are iteratively managed through these steps, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one.

2. **Class Diagram (b):**
   - **Relationships:**
     - This diagram shows the class relationships between "Lab visit" and "Lab test."
     - A "Lab visit" requires one or more "Lab tests" (1..* multiplicity).

3. **Tabular Example of Performative Data (c):**
   - **Example Entry:**
     This table provides a snapshot of a specific moment in the workflow:
     - **Time:** 11:00
     - **Channel:** Order system
     - **Sender:** Lab visit to John
     - **Receivers:** HGB test for John
     - **Action:** Create
     - **Content:** The message "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
     - **Scope:** Private
     - **Direction:** OUT (indicating the message is sent out)

   This table captures the specifics of a message sent through the channel at a particular time, detailing who sends it, who receives it, and the nature of the message.

**Summary:**
The overall visualization depicts a structured workflow for lab test management, detailing how lab visits and tests are ordered, performed, and reported. It uses procedural steps, class relationships, and a performative table to show interactions between different roles (doctors and lab assistants) and systems (order system, HIS - Hospital Information System). The channels between these steps ensure that the data and processes flow correctly through the lab test lifecycle.
