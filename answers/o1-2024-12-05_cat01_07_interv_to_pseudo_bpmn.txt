Below is a structured, textual BPMN-like description of the invoice approval and payment process, as interpreted from the interviews. Each section notes tasks, roles, decisions, and potential exceptions.

### Main Flow

**Start Event:**  
- **Event:** Invoice received from Supplier  
- **Trigger:** Supplier sends invoice (usually via email)

**Task 1:** Check for valid PO number  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** AP Clerk reviews invoice to see if it references a valid PO.  
- **Decision Gateway:** Does the invoice have a valid PO?

  - **Yes (PO Present):** Proceed to Task 2  
  - **No (PO Missing):** Perform Task 1a

**Task 1a (Exception Handling):** Request missing PO from Supplier  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** AP Clerk returns the invoice to the Supplier, requesting a valid PO number.  
- **Flow:** Once supplier provides a corrected invoice with PO, re-enter the process at Task 1.

**Task 2:** Log invoice into accounting system  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** AP Clerk records the invoice details in the system once a valid PO is confirmed.

**Task 3:** Forward invoice to Purchasing for confirmation  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** AP Clerk sends the logged invoice (with PO) to the Purchasing Officer to confirm that goods/services were received as ordered.

**Task 4:** Verify invoice against PO  
- **Performer:** Purchasing Officer  
- **Description:** The Purchasing Officer compares invoice line items (quantities, prices, terms) to the PO.  
- **Decision Gateway:** Are invoice details fully consistent with the PO?

  - **Yes (Fully Matches):** Move to Task 5  
  - **No (Discrepancy Found):** Move to Discrepancy Resolution Sub-Process

**Discrepancy Resolution Sub-Process:**  
- **Entry Condition:** A mismatch between invoice and PO (incorrect pricing, missing items, extra units, unclear terms).  
- **Steps:**
  1. **Initial Clarification (Informal):**  
     - **Performer:** Purchasing Officer or AP Clerk  
     - **Action:** Attempt to clarify discrepancy via direct communication with the Supplier (e.g., request corrected invoice or additional information).  
  2. **Escalation (If Unresolved):**  
     - **Performer:** AP Clerk escalates to AP Supervisor  
     - **Action:** AP Supervisor may contact Supplier directly or coordinate with internal departments.  
  3. **Supplier Relationship Manager Involvement (If Needed):**  
     - **Performer:** SRM (Karen)  
     - **Action:** SRM engages with Supplier to resolve pricing/term issues based on contracts.  
  4. **Outcome:**  
     - If resolved: Discrepancy is corrected (e.g., a new invoice is issued or terms clarified) and process returns to Task 4 for confirmation.  
     - If not resolved: Invoice may be rejected. AP Supervisor decides whether to proceed with a retroactive PO or to formally reject the invoice.

**Back to Main Flow after Resolution:** Once Purchasing Officer reconfirms that the invoice details now match the PO (following resolution), proceed to Task 5.

**Task 5:** Confirm receipt to Accounts Payable  
- **Performer:** Purchasing Officer  
- **Description:** Sends an email or system confirmation to AP indicating that the invoice is correct and goods/services are confirmed as received.

**Task 6:** Match invoice line items in accounting system  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** AP Clerk finalizes the match in the system now that confirmation is received.  
- **Decision Gateway:** Are all matches and confirmation steps completed satisfactorily?

  - **Yes (All Good):** Proceed to Task 7  
  - **No (Additional Issues):** Return to Discrepancy Resolution Sub-Process

**Task 7:** Request Manager Approval  
- **Performer:** System-triggered action on behalf of AP Clerk  
- **Description:** The system sends an approval request to the Department Manager once invoice and PO are fully matched and confirmed.

**Task 8:** Manager Reviews and Approves/Rejects Invoice  
- **Performer:** Department Manager  
- **Description:** Manager checks invoice details, PO, and confirmations.  
- **Decision Gateway:** Does the Manager approve the invoice?

  - **Yes (Approved):** Proceed to Task 9  
  - **No (Rejected or On-Hold):** Manager asks AP Clerk to hold and investigate further. This may involve returning to Discrepancy Resolution or contacting Purchasing/Supplier. After resolution, approval is requested again.

**Task 9:** Schedule Payment  
- **Performer:** AP Clerk  
- **Description:** Once approved, AP Clerk schedules the invoice for payment in the next payment run.

**End Event:** Payment completed and disbursed to Supplier.

### Notable Exceptions and Variations

1. **Missing PO Initially:**  
   - The invoice is returned to the Supplier. The process does not continue until a valid PO is provided.

2. **Discrepancies Detected (Pricing, Quantities, Missing Items):**  
   - The process enters a resolution loop involving AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, AP Supervisor, and possibly SRM.  
   - Once resolved, normal flow resumes at the confirmation step.

3. **Manager Rejection:**  
   - If Manager finds a suspicious issue (e.g., unexpected items, large variance from budget), the invoice is put on hold and investigated. The process loops back into discrepancy resolution until fully resolved.

4. **Retroactive PO Creation (Rare Cases):**  
   - If a service was contracted informally without a PO, AP Supervisor may coordinate the creation of a retrospective PO or reject the invoice altogether.
