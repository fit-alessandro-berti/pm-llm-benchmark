Based on the provided flow, it seems like we are dealing with a complex workflow for processing declarations or requests, likely in a financial context such as expense reports or purchase orders, within an organization. Here's how the process can be broken down:

1. **Declaration Initiation**:
   - A declaration is initiated by an employee.
   - It may initially go through different states depending on who first reviews it (e.g., pre-approver, administration).

2. **Approval Paths**:
   - The declaration could be approved by the pre-approver, then proceed to final approval by a supervisor or go directly to administrative approval.
   - If the administration approves it, there are further steps to budget owner approval and finally supervisor approval.

3. **Rejection Handling**:
   - Rejections can occur at multiple points in the process (e.g., from the pre-approver, administrator, budget owner, supervisor).
   - After a rejection, the declaration might go back to being submitted by the employee for corrections or be marked as rejected permanently.

4. **Final Approval and Payment**:
   - Once all necessary approvals are obtained, the declaration can reach a final approved state.
   - From here, it transitions into requesting payment, which is then handled (processed) by the organization's financial department.

5. **Special Cases**:
   - There are special cases where declarations might be marked as rejected due to missing information or other specific conditions, causing the process to loop back or terminate.
   
### Process Overview:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
2. **[Approval Path]**
    - Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
    - OR
    - Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION 
        - -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER or SUPERVISOR (if rejected, loop back)
        - OR
        - -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR

3. **Final Approvals Lead to Payment Request**
   - Once the declaration is finally approved:
      - It leads to requesting payment.
      - Payment Handled (indicating that the payment process has been completed).

4. **Rejection and Corrections Loop**
    - If any step results in a rejection, there's often an option for the employee to correct or resubmit the declaration.

### Key Points:
- The process involves multiple levels of approval.
- There are several points at which the declaration can be rejected or corrected by the employee.
- Once finalized, it moves into a payment request phase.
- Performance metrics (frequency and performance) indicate the efficiency and time taken to move through each stage.

This workflow is clearly designed to ensure that all declarations go through rigorous checks before final approval and subsequent payments are processed.
