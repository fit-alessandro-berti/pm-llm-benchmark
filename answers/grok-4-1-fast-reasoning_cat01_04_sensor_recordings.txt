### Labeled Activities from Event Log Analysis

I analyzed the event log by examining temporal sequences, sensor correlations, and abrupt changes in readings to identify **5 distinct phases** (patterns) corresponding to manufacturing activities. These phases show clear transitions based on sensor behaviors:

- **Tool position** progressively advances (0  20 mm) during active phases, then resets, indicating a linear process workflow.
- **Vibration** spikes during high-mechanical-stress activities (e.g., cutting, welding).
- **Temperature** rises with friction/heat-intensive operations and drops during cooldowns.
- **Material flow** is steady during material-processing steps but absent in heat-only steps.
- **Pressure** increases for clamping/stabilization.
- **Energy** correlates with activity intensity.

The sequence repeats a full cycle (Idle  Active phases  Idle), typical of an assembly line process on Machine M1. Below are the grouped events, assigned labels, and rationales.

#### 1. **Idle/Standby** (Events 1-3, 13-15)
   - **Pattern**: Temp ~20-21°C (ambient), Pressure 1 bar, Vibration 0 Hz, Material Flow 0 units/s, Tool Position 0 mm, Energy ~0.40-0.50 kWh.
   - **Rationale**: All sensors at baseline/idle levels with minimal energy draw and no tool movement or flow. This represents machine readiness or post-cycle reset, common before/after operations. Repeated at start and end confirms cycle boundaries.

#### 2. **Cutting Metal** (Events 4-6)
   - **Pattern**: Temp rising rapidly (50-58°C), Pressure 1-1.5 bar (slight increase), Vibration high (30-38 Hz), Material Flow steady at 5 units/s, Tool Position advancing (5-10 mm), Energy increasing (2.0-3.0 kWh).
   - **Rationale**: Sudden vibration surge and steady material flow indicate abrasive cutting (friction generates heat/vibration), with tool feed-in. Temp rise from metal friction and moderate energy match cutting tools (e.g., saw or mill). Transitions from idle as first active phase.

#### 3. **Assembling Parts** (Events 7-8)
   - **Pattern**: Temp stable at 40°C, Pressure elevated to 2 bar, Vibration moderate/low (10 Hz), Material Flow reduced (2 units/s), Tool Position stable at 15 mm, Energy stable at 2.0 kWh.
   - **Rationale**: Post-cutting stabilization with higher pressure (likely clamping parts for assembly), lower vibration/flow (less abrasion, more positioning), and steady tool/energy. Fits part joining/insertion after cutting, bridging to heat-intensive step.

#### 4. **Welding** (Event 9)
   - **Pattern**: Temp spike to 80°C, Pressure 2 bar, Vibration peak (50 Hz), Material Flow 0 units/s, Tool Position stable at 15 mm, Energy peak (5.0 kWh).
   - **Rationale**: Extreme temp/energy with no flow but high vibration suggests arc/plasma welding (electrical arc melts metal, causes vibration hum). Highest intensity readings post-assembly confirm heat-fusion step; short duration typical for spot welds.

#### 5. **Quality Inspection** (Events 10-12)
   - **Pattern**: Temp dropping (30-25°C), Pressure 1 bar, Vibration very low (1-5 Hz), Material Flow minimal (0-1 units/s), Tool Position advancing slightly (15-20 mm), Energy low-moderate (1.0-1.6 kWh).
   - **Rationale**: Cooldown phase with minimal activity, low vibration (no mechanical stress), and slight tool/flow for scanning/probing. Low energy and stabilizing temp post-weld align with non-destructive inspection (e.g., visual/sensor check) before reset. Tool to 20 mm may indicate final positioning for approval.

### Process Flow Summary
**Idle/Standby**  **Cutting Metal**  **Assembling Parts**  **Welding**  **Quality Inspection**  **Idle/Standby**.  
This derives a classic manufacturing process model via process mining (e.g., similar to Heuristics Miner output: sequential phases with sensor-based traces). No loops or parallels; one clean cycle. Patterns are robustly distinct (e.g., vibration >30 Hz uniquely flags cutting/welding). If more logs were available, alpha algorithm could refine further.
