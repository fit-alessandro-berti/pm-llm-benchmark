Below are the two POWL models based on the hiring process description for GlobalTeq Solutions, reflecting the workflow with and without potential unfairness.

---

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**  
This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment, where applicants with local community affiliations receive a subtle advantage.  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # For loop if data is incomplete
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Standard path
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased path
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (if missing info, request more details)
loop_data_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR branch after skill assessment: either standard cultural fit or biased community check
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR, 
    children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Partial order for the main workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_check,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_cultural_fit,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check)
root.order.add_edge(loop_data_check, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit)
root.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

#### **Explanation of Potential Unfairness**:  
- The `XOR` operator after `SkillAssessment` splits the process into two paths:  
  - One path (`CulturalFitCheck`) is a standard evaluation.  
  - The other path (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`) gives an implicit advantage to applicants with local community ties.  
- This branching introduces bias, as some applicants are treated differently based on affiliations rather than merit.

---

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**  
This model removes the biased XOR branch and ensures all applicants undergo the same `CulturalFitCheck`.  

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (same as above)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # For loop if data is incomplete
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Only this path exists now
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness (unchanged)
loop_data_check = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# No XOR branch; only CulturalFitCheck is used
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_check,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,  # Single path for all applicants
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define the order of execution (same as before, but without XOR)
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_check)
root.order.add_edge(loop_data_check, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)  # No branching here
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

#### **Explanation of Fairness**:  
- The `XOR` operator is removed, and all applicants now follow the same `CulturalFitCheck` path.  
- The workflow is now purely merit-based, with no implicit advantages for certain affiliations.

### **Key Differences**:  
1. **With Unfairness**:  
   - Explicit `XOR` branching after `SkillAssessment`.  
   - Two possible paths for cultural evaluation, one of which is biased.  

2. **Without Unfairness**:  
   - No `XOR` branching; single path for cultural fit assessment.  
   - All applicants treated equally, removing potential bias.  

These models adhere to the POWL specification while illustrating how subtle biases can be introduced or removed in a hiring process.
