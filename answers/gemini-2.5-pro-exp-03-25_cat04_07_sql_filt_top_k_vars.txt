Okay, here is the DuckDB SQL query that addresses the requirements outlined in the prompt.

This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the logic into sequential, understandable steps:

1.  `CaseVariants`: Determines the ordered activity sequence (variant) for each `case_id`.
2.  `VariantCounts`: Counts the occurrences (frequency) of each unique variant.
3.  `TopKVariantSequences`: Identifies the sequences of the top K most frequent variants.
4.  `TopKCaseIDs`: Selects the `case_id`s that correspond to the top K variants identified in the previous step.
5.  The final `SELECT` statement retrieves all original event log entries whose `case_id` is present in the `TopKCaseIDs` list.

```sql
-- Define the value for K (e.g., top 10 variants)
-- In a real application, K might be a parameter. For this example, we'll use 10.
DEFINE K = 10;

-- CTE 1: Determine the sequence of activities (variant) for each case_id
WITH CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        -- Concatenate activities into a single string, ordered by timestamp
        string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

-- CTE 2: Count the frequency of each unique variant
VariantCounts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency
    FROM
        CaseVariants
    GROUP BY
        variant_sequence
),

-- CTE 3: Identify the sequences corresponding to the top K variants by frequency
TopKVariantSequences AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence
    FROM
        VariantCounts
    ORDER BY
        frequency DESC
    LIMIT K -- Use the defined K value
),

-- CTE 4: Get the case_ids that belong to these top K variants
TopKCaseIDs AS (
    SELECT
        cv.case_id
    FROM
        CaseVariants cv
    -- Join CaseVariants with TopKVariantSequences to filter cases
    INNER JOIN
        TopKVariantSequences tkvs ON cv.variant_sequence = tkvs.variant_sequence
    -- Alternative using WHERE IN:
    -- WHERE cv.variant_sequence IN (SELECT variant_sequence FROM TopKVariantSequences)
)

-- Final Step: Select all original events from the event_log
-- for only those cases identified in TopKCaseIDs
SELECT
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM TopKCaseIDs)
ORDER BY
    el.case_id, -- Optional: Order the final output for readability
    el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`CaseVariants`**: Uses `string_agg` ordered by `timestamp` within each `case_id` group to create a textual representation of the process variant.
2.  **`VariantCounts`**: Groups the results from `CaseVariants` by the generated `variant_sequence` and counts how many cases (`COUNT(case_id)`) follow each sequence.
3.  **`TopKVariantSequences`**: Orders the variants by their `frequency` in descending order and uses `LIMIT K` (set to 10 in this example) to select only the most frequent variant sequences.
4.  **`TopKCaseIDs`**: Filters the `CaseVariants` CTE to keep only those rows where the `variant_sequence` matches one of the sequences found in `TopKVariantSequences`. This effectively creates a list of `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants.
5.  **Final `SELECT`**: Retrieves all columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) from the original `event_log` table, filtering using `WHERE el.case_id IN (...)` to include only events whose `case_id` is in the `TopKCaseIDs` list. The optional `ORDER BY` clause makes the output easier to inspect.

This query fulfills all the requirements of the prompt using standard SQL features supported by DuckDB. Remember to replace `DEFINE K = 10;` with the desired value for K or handle parameterization appropriately in your specific DuckDB environment/client if needed. The `DEFINE` statement might require specific client support; if it doesn't work, simply replace `K` in the `LIMIT` clause with the desired number directly (e.g., `LIMIT 10`).
