After analyzing the process variants of both the protected and unprotected groups, I've identified some key differences:

1. **Loan approval rates**: The unprotected group has a significantly higher loan approval rate (1656 out of 2709, or 61%) compared to the protected group (31 out of 960, or 3.2%). This suggests that the unprotected group is more likely to receive a loan.
2. **Application rejection rates**: The protected group has a higher application rejection rate (960 out of 960, or 100% of the first process variant) compared to the unprotected group (664 out of 2709, or 24.5%). This indicates that the protected group is more likely to have their application rejected.
3. **Request for co-signer**: The unprotected group is more likely to have a process variant that includes a request for a co-signer (335 out of 2709, or 12.4%) compared to the protected group (138 out of 960, or 14.4%). However, the unprotected group is more likely to have a co-signer request followed by a loan approval (183 out of 2709, or 6.8%) compared to the protected group (26 out of 960, or 2.7%).
4. **Assessment of collateral**: The unprotected group is more likely to have a process variant that includes an assessment of collateral (297 out of 2709, or 11%) compared to the protected group (84 out of 960, or 8.8%). However, the unprotected group is more likely to have an assessment of collateral followed by a loan approval (188 out of 2709, or 6.9%) compared to the protected group (15 out of 960, or 1.6%).
5. **Performance (execution time)**: The protected group has longer execution times for most process variants, indicating that the loan application process may be slower for this group.
6. **Skipped examination**: The unprotected group has a process variant that includes a skipped examination (332 out of 2709, or 12.3%), which is not present in the protected group. This could indicate that the unprotected group is more likely to have a streamlined application process.
7. **Multiple visits to assess collateral**: The protected group has more process variants that include multiple visits to assess collateral, which may indicate a more rigorous assessment process for this group.

These differences suggest that the loan application process may be more stringent for the protected group, with higher rejection rates, longer execution times, and more rigorous assessments. In contrast, the unprotected group appears to have a more streamlined process with higher approval rates and fewer hurdles.
