To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we will consolidate data from the provided tables. The `order_id` will serve as the `Case ID`. Events will be derived from key timestamps and linked to relevant actors and attributes.

**Assumptions Made:**
1.  **Item Picking Granularity**: For "Item Picked" events, a separate event is generated for each unique `item_id` picked within an order, as `item_picking_date` and `picker_id` are specific to each line item. This provides a more granular view of the picking process.
2.  **Resource for Payment Received**: Since no specific human actor is provided in the `Payments` table for who receives the payment, "System" is used as the `Resource/Actor`, implying an automated process or an unrecorded actor.
3.  **Other Attributes Format**: Relevant details from each table are concatenated into a single "Other Attributes" string for simplicity, as requested, allowing for easy expansion into separate columns if needed for detailed analysis.
4.  **Incomplete Processes**: If an order does not have corresponding entries in subsequent tables (e.g., Delivery, Invoice, Payments), it will naturally appear incomplete in the event log, reflecting the actual state of the data. Order 1004 is an example where no delivery, invoice or payment events are present.

The events are sorted chronologically by `Timestamp` within each `Case ID`.
