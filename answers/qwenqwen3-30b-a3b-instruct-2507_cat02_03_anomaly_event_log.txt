After analyzing the event log for the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, several **anomalous sequences** are identified that deviate from standard P2P best practices. Below is a detailed breakdown of the anomalies, their implications, and why they are problematic.

---

###  **Standard P2P Process Flow (Best Practice):**
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods/Services**  
5. **Receive Vendor Invoice**  
6. **Match Invoice to PO (Three-Way Match)**  
7. **Release Payment**  
8. **Close Case**

> The **critical control** is the **three-way match**: ensuring the PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice all match before payment is released. This prevents overpayment, fraud, and errors.

##  **Anomaly 1: Case 1002 – Payment Before Requisition Approval**

### Sequence:
- 2024-02-01 08:30: Create Purchase Requisition  
- 2024-02-01 08:40: **Issue Purchase Order**  
- 2024-02-03 07:00: Vendor Invoice Received  
- 2024-02-03 07:15: **Release Payment**  
- 2024-02-03 08:00: Approve Purchase Requisition  

### Problem:
- The **Purchase Order is issued before the requisition is approved**.
- **Payment is released before requisition approval** (which would have validated the need and budget).
- **Approval occurs after payment**, which undermines internal controls.

### Why It's Problematic:
- **Bypasses governance**: The purchase was authorized without proper approval, potentially leading to unauthorized spending.
- **Budget risks**: No assurance that funds were available or the purchase was justified.
- **Fraud risk**: Could enable fictitious or unnecessary purchases.
- **Audit failure**: Contradicts basic segregation of duties and approval workflows.

>  **Best Practice**: Approval must precede PO issuance and payment.

##  **Anomaly 2: Case 1002 – Goods Received Before PO Issuance**

### Sequence:
- 2024-02-01 08:30: Create Purchase Requisition  
- 2024-02-01 08:40: Issue Purchase Order  
- 2024-02-03 07:00: Vendor Invoice Received  
- 2024-02-03 07:15: Release Payment  
- 2024-02-03 08:00: Approve Requisition  
- 2024-02-04 09:00: **Receive Goods**

### Problem:
- **Goods were received *after* payment was released**, but **before the PO was even issued**? Wait — actually, PO was issued *before* goods receipt.

Wait — let’s re-check:

- PO issued: **2024-02-01 08:40**  
- Goods received: **2024-02-04 09:00**   After PO issuance.

So **this is not a problem**.

But **payment was released on 2024-02-03 07:15**, **before** goods were received (04/02/2024).  
And **before** invoice was even received (03/02/2024)? Wait — invoice was received **on the same day as payment**.

Wait — **Invoice received: 2024-02-03 07:00**, **Payment released: 07:15**  so invoice came *just before* payment.

But **goods were received on 2024-02-04 09:00**, **after** payment.

###  So the real anomaly is:

> **Payment released before goods were received**, and **before the three-way match** could be performed.

Even though the invoice was received before payment, **goods were not received yet**, so **no three-way match was possible**.

### Why It's Problematic:
- **Payment made before goods were received**  risk of paying for goods not delivered.
- **No physical receipt** to validate delivery  potential fraud (e.g., fake invoice or vendor overcharge).
- **No compliance with internal controls** requiring receipt before payment.
- **Cannot perform three-way match** (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) until all three are present.

>  Best Practice: Payment should only occur **after** goods are received and all three documents match.

##  **Anomaly 3: Case 1003 – Payment Released Before Invoice Received**

### Sequence:
- 2024-02-02 09:00: Create Purchase Requisition  
- 2024-02-02 09:10: Approve Requisition  
- 2024-02-02 10:00: Issue PO  
- 2024-02-08 11:00: **Release Payment**  
- 2024-02-09 12:00: **Vendor Invoice Received**  
- 2024-02-10 13:00: Receive Goods  
- 2024-02-11 14:00: Match Invoice to PO

### Problem:
- **Payment released on 2024-02-08** — **7 days before invoice was even received**.
- **Invoice not received until 2024-02-09**  after payment.
- **Goods received on 2024-02-10**  after payment.
- **Match performed on 2024-02-11**  after payment.

### Why It's Problematic:
- **Payment made without an invoice**  no basis for payment amount.
- **No three-way match possible** — invoice and goods were not received at time of payment.
- **High risk of fraud**: Paying before any evidence of purchase exists.
- **Cannot verify accuracy** of amount, quantity, or delivery.
- **Audit red flag**: This violates core P2P control principles.

>  Best Practice: Payment must follow invoice receipt and three-way match.

##  **Anomaly 4: Case 1004 – Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issuance**

### Sequence:
- 2024-02-05 10:00: Create Purchase Requisition  
- 2024-02-05 10:15: Approve Purchase Requisition  
- 2024-02-06 09:00: **Receive Goods**  
- 2024-02-06 09:15: **Issue Purchase Order**  
- 2024-02-07 08:00: Vendor Invoice Received  
- 2024-02-07 08:30: Match Invoice to PO  
- 2024-02-07 09:00: Release Payment

### Problem:
- **Goods were received *before* the Purchase Order was issued**.
- PO was issued **after** goods receipt.

### Why It's Problematic:
- **No PO exists at time of receipt**  no baseline for quantity, price, or terms.
- **Cannot validate delivery against PO**  risk of receiving unauthorized or incorrect goods.
- **No control over pricing or specifications** — vendor could have delivered more or different items.
- **Fraud risk**: Vendor may have delivered goods without a formal agreement, potentially leading to overbilling or ghost purchases.
- **Audit failure**: Violates the principle that PO must precede goods receipt.

>  Best Practice: Goods should only be received **after** PO is issued and confirmed.

##  Summary of Anomalies:

| Case ID | Anomaly | Why It's Problematic |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **1002** | Payment released before requisition approval | Bypasses budget and approval controls; high fraud risk |
| **1002** | Payment released before goods received | Cannot perform three-way match; risk of paying for undelivered goods |
| **1003** | Payment released before invoice received | No invoice to justify payment amount; severe control failure |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issuance | No PO to validate delivery; undermines purchase integrity |

---

##  Recommendations:

1. **Enforce strict process sequencing** in the P2P system (e.g., via workflow automation).
2. **Block payment releases** unless:
   - Purchase Requisition is approved
   - PO is issued
   - Goods are received
   - Invoice is received
   - Three-way match is completed
3. **Implement system-level controls** to prevent backward steps (e.g., cannot release payment before invoice).
4. **Conduct audits** on cases where payment precedes receipt or invoice.
5. **Train procurement and finance teams** on P2P best practices and internal controls.

---

##  Conclusion:

The event log reveals **four clear anomalies** that violate fundamental P2P process controls. These deviations expose the organization to **financial risk, fraud, overpayment, and audit failures**. Correcting these issues requires both **systemic controls** and **process discipline** to ensure that the P2P cycle follows the correct sequence: **Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close**.

>  **Bottom Line**: The P2P process must be **sequential, auditable, and governed** — and these cases show it is not always followed.
