### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps and Rationale**

Based on the provided event log and the logical sequence of activities, the following high-level process steps have been identified. These groupings are based on **temporal proximity**, **resource type**, **purpose**, and **functional relationship** between events.

---

## **1. Material Preparation**

### **Grouped Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

### **Rationale:**
These events represent the initial phase of the manufacturing process where the raw material is prepared for further processing. The sequence begins with retrieving the material, verifying it via a barcode scan, placing it on the worktable, aligning it for precision, and preheating it for subsequent operations. These are all preparatory steps that must be completed before the actual assembly or welding can begin.

### **Rationale Justification:**
- All events occur in a **sequential and time-ordered** fashion.
- They are **performed by the same or related resources** (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1).
- They form a **coherent and necessary phase** in the process flow.

## **2. Welding Assembly**

### **Grouped Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

### **Rationale:**
These events represent the **core assembly activity** where the metal sheet is welded at specific points. The operator picks up a welding tool and performs spot welding on designated corners. This is a **critical manufacturing step** that directly contributes to the structural integrity of the product.

### **Rationale Justification:**
- The events are **performed by the same resource** (Operator B).
- They are **temporally close** and **functionally related**.
- They are **part of a specific manufacturing task** (welding).

---

## **3. Quality Assurance & Inspection**

### **Grouped Events:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

### **Rationale:**
These events represent the **quality control phase**, where the integrity of the weld is tested using a sensor, and a visual inspection is performed by an operator. This ensures that the product meets the required standards before proceeding to the next stage.

### **Rationale Justification:**
- These are **distinct quality checks** that occur **after the welding**.
- They are **performed by different resources** (Quality Sensor #1, Operator C), but both contribute to the same goal: **ensuring product quality**.

---

## **4. Surface Treatment & Finishing**

### **Grouped Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

### **Rationale:**
These events represent the **surface finishing** stage, where a protective coating is applied and then dried. This step is crucial for **corrosion resistance** and **aesthetic finish**.

### **Rationale Justification:**
- The events are **logically related** (coating followed by drying).
- They are **performed by related resources** (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2).
- They occur **after welding** and **before final inspection**, indicating a **distinct process phase**.

---

## **5. Final Inspection**

### **Grouped Events:**
- Visual check

### **Rationale:**
While the "Visual check" is also part of the Quality Assurance step, in this context, it is considered a **final confirmation** of the product's compliance with standards before it is deemed complete. It is often the **last step** in the process.

### **Rationale Justification:**
- The visual check is a **final verification** step.
- It is **performed by a different operator** (Operator C) and may occur **after all other steps**.
- It is **distinct from the earlier quality checks** in terms of **timing and purpose**.

| **Material Preparation**     | Preparation of raw materials for manufacturing.                             | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
| **Welding Assembly**         | Execution of spot welding at designated corners.                             | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                             |
| **Quality Assurance & Inspection** | Verification of weld integrity and visual inspection.                       | Measure weld integrity, Visual check                                           |
| **Surface Treatment & Finishing** | Application and drying of protective coating.                               | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                          |
| **Final Inspection**         | Final verification of product quality.                                      | Visual check                                                                   |

## **Summary**

This grouping provides a clear, structured view of the manufacturing process, making it easier to understand and analyze the workflow. Each high-level activity represents a **distinct phase** of the process, and the groupings are based on **temporal, functional, and resource-based criteria**.

This approach allows for better **process mining**, **performance analysis**, and **process improvement** by abstracting the granular events into meaningful stages.
