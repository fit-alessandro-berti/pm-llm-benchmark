### **High-Level Process Steps and Grouping Rationale**

Below is the structured representation of the proposed high-level activities, along with a detailed rationale for how the low-level events were grouped. Each high-level activity represents a coherent stage in the manufacturing process.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**
**Grouped Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events are logically grouped because they represent the initial phase of preparing the raw material for processing. The sequence begins with retrieving the raw material, verifying it via barcode scanning, positioning it correctly on the work table, aligning it using robotic assistance, and preheating it to prepare it for subsequent operations. These steps are foundational and occur before any actual assembly or modification begins.

**Name:**  
"Material Preparation"

### **2. Assembly**
**Grouped Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
This group includes all actions related to assembling components of the product. The operator picks up the welding tool and performs spot welding on two corners of the metal sheet. These events are tightly coupled, as they involve the same resource (Operator B) and the same tool (Welding Tool W-12), and they represent the physical joining of parts.

**Name:**  
"Assembly"

### **3. Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity Check**
**Grouped Events:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
After the welding operation, the quality of the weld is assessed using a specialized sensor. This step ensures that the welded joints meet the required standards. It is distinct from other quality checks (e.g., visual inspection) and focuses specifically on the structural integrity of the weld.

**Name:**  
"Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity Check"

### **4. Finishing**
**Grouped Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These events involve applying a protective layer to the product and then drying it to ensure proper adhesion and durability. Both actions are part of the finishing process, which enhances the product's appearance and resistance to environmental factors. They are performed sequentially and are closely related in purpose.

**Name:**  
"Finishing"

---

### **5. Final Inspection**
**Grouped Events:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
The final step in the process is a visual inspection conducted by an operator to verify that the product meets all visible quality criteria. This step is distinct from earlier quality checks (e.g., weld integrity) and serves as the last checkpoint before the product is considered complete.

**Name:**  
"Final Inspection"

### **Structured Representation of High-Level Activities**

| **High-Level Activity**               | **Low-Level Events**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**              | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
| **Assembly**                          | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                                      |
| **Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity Check** | Measure weld integrity                                                                                 |
| **Finishing**                         | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                                  |
| **Final Inspection**                  | Visual check                                                                                            |

### **Summary of Grouping Logic**
1. **Temporal Proximity:** Events that occur close together in time were grouped if they logically belong to the same phase.
2. **Resource Similarity:** Events performed by the same resource or resource type (e.g., Operator A, Robot Arm #2) were grouped when they contributed to the same high-level goal.
3. **Logical Flow:** Events were grouped based on their role in the overall workflow (e.g., preparation, assembly, quality checks).
4. **Distinct Purpose:** Each high-level activity has a clear and distinct purpose within the manufacturing process.

By aggregating the low-level events into these high-level activities, the manufacturing process becomes easier to understand and analyze at a glance. This structure also facilitates process optimization, monitoring, and communication across teams.

**Final Answer:**
The high-level activities are:
1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Assurance - Weld Integrity Check**
4. **Finishing**
5. **Final Inspection**
