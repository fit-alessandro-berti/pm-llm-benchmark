**Activities:**
- Reach out to suppliers for missing PO numbers
- Request revised invoices
- Check contracts for correct pricing
- Facilitate issue resolution
**Note:** No direct system access for approvals

### Exception Handling (Supervisor Level)

**Responsible:** AP Supervisor (Rita)
**Activities:**
- Handle invoices without PO (informal service contracts)
- Coordinate between departments
- Create retrospective POs
- Decide on invoice rejections
- Ensure process continuity

## Key Artifacts/Data Objects
- **Invoice** (Email format, contains PO reference)
- **Purchase Order** (System record)
- **Receipt Confirmation** (From purchasing)
- **Approval Notification** (System-generated)
- **Payment Schedule** (Output)

## Process Variations/Notes
- **Uncertainty noted:** Some conflicting accounts exist regarding exact timing of manager notifications and whether some steps are system-automated vs. manual
- **Exception frequency:** Manager rejections occur approximately monthly; supervisor escalations are relatively infrequent
- **Missing PO handling:** Can result in retrospective PO creation or invoice rejection depending on circumstances
- **Supplier relationship involvement:** Triggered by discrepancies rather than being part of standard flow

This model consolidates the various perspectives while noting areas of uncertainty and providing a logical flow that could be converted to a visual BPMN diagram.
