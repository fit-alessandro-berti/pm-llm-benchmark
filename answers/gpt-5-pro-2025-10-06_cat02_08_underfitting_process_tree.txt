1) Example of an allowed-but-invalid trace:
[Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order]

2) Why this is problematic:
- The model’s PARALLEL node lets Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, and Ship_Order occur in any order, so the above permutation fits the model.
- Domain-wise, this violates the natural precedence: payment must be authorized before fulfillment, and items must be packaged before shipping. Shipping before both payment authorization and packaging is unacceptable in an Order-to-Cash process.

Note: The model also permits [Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order] (double-close) because Close_Order appears both inside the cancel branch and again at the root, which is also invalid domain-wise.
