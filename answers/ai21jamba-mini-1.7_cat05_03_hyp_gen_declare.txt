### Anomalies in the DECLARE Model

1. **Contradictory Rules:**
	- The `responded_existence` rule specifies that an evaluation step (`E`) must always follow an assignment step (`A`). However, the `precedence` rule suggests that a claim can be closed (`C`) directly after receiving it (`R`), bypassing any evaluation step. This directly contradicts the precedence implied by the `responded_existence` rule.
2. **Violation of Business Logic:**
	- The model specifies that a claim must be closed (`C`), but it does not enforce that it must pass through all intermediate steps (evaluation and approval). This allows scenarios where claims are closed prematurely, which may not align with the intended business process.
3. **Redundancy in Constraints:**
	- The `noncoexistence` rule stating that an evaluation step (`E`) cannot coexist with a closure step (`C`) is implied by the chronological ordering already defined in the `responded_existence` and `precedence` rules. This redundancy adds complexity without providing additional insights.
4. **Ambiguity in Activity Scope:**
	- The `responded_existence` rule references only `assigned` adjustment (`A`), without clarifying whether this rule applies universally or under specific conditions such as adjuster specialization or regional constraints.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:**
	- The conflicting rules might stem from an incomplete understanding of the end-to-end claim process during the model's design phase. For instance, the pressure to accelerate claims might lead to relaxing constraints like skipping evaluations.
2. **Inconsistent Policy Updates:**
	- The model appears to integrate rules designed for different policy iterations. For example, the `precedence` rule might reflect an older process where claims were closed prematurely, while the `responded_existence` rule reflects a newer policy enforcing sequential steps.
3. **Technical or Data Limitations:**
	- Incomplete or erroneous training data used to derive DECLARE constraints might have introduced contradictions. If the source dataset has anomalies or missing entries, it could lead to generalized yet conflicting rules.
4. **Operational Expediency:**
	- Rules allowing closure without evaluation might be artifacts of operational pressure, enabling adjusters to bypass rigorous checks under certain conditions.

### Verification Strategies with SQL

1. **Check for Claims Closed Without Evaluation:**
	- Query to identify claims (`claims.claim_id`) closed (`claim_events.activity = 'C'`) without any preceding evaluation (`claim_events.activity = 'E'`):sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claims
WHERE claim_id IN (
    SELECT claim_id
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'C'
)
AND claim_id NOT IN (
    SELECT claim_id
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'E'
);
```
2. **Identify Traces Where Evaluation and Closing Coexist:**
	- Query to find claims where evaluation (`E`) and closure (`C`) steps occur sequentially for the same claim, potentially violating chronological constraints:sql

```sql
SELECT c1.claim_id, c1.submission_date, c2.timestamp AS close_timestamp
FROM claim_events c1
JOIN claim_events c2
  ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
 AND c1.activity = 'E'
 AND c2.activity = 'C'
 AND c1.timestamp < c2.timestamp;
```
3. **Verify Adjuster Assignment Consistency:**
	- Query to ensure that every evaluation step (`E`) corresponds to an assigned adjuster (`resource` in `claim_events` column):sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'E'
  AND resource NOT LIKE '%adjuster%'
  AND resource NOT LIKE 'System%';
```
4. **Detect Skipped Steps in Claim Handling:**
	- Identify claims where intermediate steps are skipped (e.g., claims closed directly after being received):sql

```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('C', 'R')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(activity) = 1;
```

These queries can help identify discrepancies between the model’s intended logic and actual process execution.
