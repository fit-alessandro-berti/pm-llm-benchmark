Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to understand the event log and figure out the resolution times for each case. The user wants to know which cases are taking longer than average, then find out why that's happening. 

So, the first step is to calculate the total resolution time for each case. Each case starts with "Receive Ticket" and ends with "Close Ticket". Let me go through each case one by one.

Starting with Case 101: 
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00
- Close: 2024-03-01 10:15
Time difference is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is 2.25 hours.

Case 102:
- Receive: 08:05
- Close: 09:15 next day? Wait, the close is on 2024-03-02 09:15. So from 08:05 on day 1 to 09:15 on day 2. That's 24 hours minus 08:05 to 08:05 (which is 24 hours) but wait, no. Wait, the first day is March 1st. The close is March 2nd at 9:15. So the time between 8:05 on March 1st and 9:15 on March 2nd. That's 24 hours minus 8:05 (from 8:05 to 8:05 next day is 24h) but since the close is 9:15, that's 24h - 8:05 + 9:15? Wait, maybe better to convert timestamps to minutes or seconds to calculate the exact duration.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the time between the first and last event for each case.

Let me do that.

For Case 102: The receive is 2024-03-01 08:05, close is 2024-03-02 09:15.

The duration is from 8:05 on March 1 to 9:15 on March 2. Let's calculate that. From 8:05 to 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes. Then from 00:00 on March 2 to 9:15 is 9h15m. Total is 15h55m + 9h15m = 25h10m. So that's 25 hours and 10 minutes.

Case 103: 
Receive: 08:10, close: 09:30 same day. So 1h20m.

Case 104: Receive: 08:20, close: 08:30 next day? Wait, no. Wait, the close is 2024-03-02 08:30. So from 08:20 on March 1 to 08:30 on March 2. That's 24 hours minus 08:20 to 08:30? Wait, no. From 8:20 on March 1 to 8:20 on March 2 is 24 hours. Then add 10 minutes to reach 8:30. So total 24h10m.

Case 105: Receive 08:25, close 09:30 on March 3rd. Wait, the close is 2024-03-03 09:30. So from 08:25 on March 1 to 09:30 on March 3. Let's compute that. From 8:25 on March 1 to 8:25 on March 3 is 48 hours. Then from 8:25 to 9:30 is 1h5m. So total 49h5m. Wait, that seems way too long. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check again.

Case 105's close is on March 3rd at 09:30. The receive is on March 1st at 08:25. So from March 1st 08:25 to March 2nd 08:25 is 24h. Then from March 2nd 08:25 to March 3rd 09:30 is 25h5m. So total is 24h + 25h5m = 49h5m. That's 49 hours and 5 minutes. That's way longer than the others. So that's a significant delay.

So the resolution times are:

Case 101: 2h15m

Case 102: 25h10m

Case 103: 1h20m

Case 104: 24h10m

Case 105: 49h5m

Wait, that seems like Case 105 is way longer. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the first case is 101, which is 2h15m. Then 102 is 25h10m. 103 is 1h20m. 104 is 24h10m. 105 is 49h5m. So the average would be (2.25 + 25.166 + 1.333 + 24.166 + 49.083) / 5. Let's compute that.

But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the duration for case 105. Let me check the timestamps again.

Case 105:

Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25

Close: 2024-03-03 09:30

So the time between March 1 08:25 and March 3 09:30. Let's calculate:

From March 1 08:25 to March 3 08:25 is 2 days = 48 hours.

Then from March 3 08:25 to March 3 09:30 is 1h5m. So total is 48h + 1h5m = 49h5m. So that's correct.

So the case 105 is taking 49 hours, which is way longer than the others. So that's the case that's significantly longer.

Wait, but case 102 is 25h10m, which is also longer than the average. So maybe there are two cases with long durations. But the question says "cases that take significantly longer than average". So I need to check which ones are longer.

But maybe I should calculate the exact durations in minutes or hours to compare. Let me convert each case's duration into hours.

Case 101: 2h15m = 2.25 hours.

Case 102: 25h10m = 25.1667 hours.

Case 103: 1h20m = 1.333 hours.

Case 104: 24h10m = 24.1667 hours.

Case 105: 49h5m = 49.0833 hours.

So the average would be (2.25 + 25.1667 + 1.333 + 24.1667 + 49.0833) / 5. Let's calculate that.

Adding them up:

2.25 + 25.1667 = 27.4167

+1.333 = 28.75

+24.1667 = 52.9167

+49.0833 = 102 hours.

Average is 102 / 5 = 20.4 hours. So 20.4 hours is the average. So cases 102 (25.1667) and 105 (49.0833) are longer than average.

But wait, case 105 is way longer. So these two cases are the ones that are significantly longer.

So the first task is to identify those cases. So cases 102 and 105.

Now, the second part is to determine the root causes. Let's look at the activities for these cases.

Case 102:

- Receive: 08:05
- Triage: 08:30 (35 minutes after receive)
- Assign to Level-1 Agent: 09:00 (1h after receive)
- Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 11:30 (3h30m after receive)
- Investigate: 14:00 (6h55m after receive)
- Resolve: 09:00 next day (25h10m total)
- Close: 09:15 next day.

So the problem here is that the case was escalated to Level-2 Agent. The escalations might be causing delays. Also, between the assignment to Level-1 and the escalation, there's a time between 09:00 and 11:30 (2h30m). Then after escalation, the investigation is done at 14:00 (which is 5h55m after receive). Then resolve is at 9:00 next day. So the time between escalation and resolve is 14:00 on day 1 to 9:00 on day 2, which is 19h. So that's a long time. But why?

Wait, maybe the escalation to Level-2 Agent is taking longer. Let's check the activities for case 102. The steps after assignment are: escalate to Level-2, then investigate. But maybe the investigation after escalation takes longer. Wait, after escalation, the next event is "Investigate Issue" at 14:00. But the case is resolved at 9:00 next day. So that's a long time between escalation and resolution. Maybe the Level-2 agent is slower, or there's a bottleneck there.

Case 105:

- Receive: 08:25
- Triage: 08:35 (10 minutes after receive)
- Assign to Level-1: 09:00 (35 minutes after receive)
- Investigate: 09:10 (45 minutes after receive)
- Escalate to Level-2: 10:00 (1h35m after receive)
- Investigate again: 2024-03-02 14:00 (that's two days later)
- Resolve: 09:00 March 3rd (that's 3 days and 10 hours after receive)
- Close: 09:30 March 3rd.

So the problem here is that after escalation to Level-2, the investigation takes a long time. The first investigation is at 09:10, then after escalation (at 10:00), the next investigation is on March 2nd at 14:00. That's a gap of 24 hours between the first investigation and the second. Then resolve is on March 3rd. So that's a long time between the escalation and the resolution.

So the root causes for these cases are:

For case 102: Escalation to Level-2 Agent, which takes time. Then the time between escalation and resolution is long. Also, the time between assignment to Level-1 and escalation is 2h30m. But maybe that's part of the process, but the main issue is that the escalation leads to a delay.

For case 105: The escalation to Level-2 Agent is done, but then the investigation after escalation is delayed. The first investigation is done quickly, then after escalation, the next investigation is on the next day. That's a gap of 24 hours. Then after that, resolve is on the third day. So maybe the Level-2 team is not handling the investigation quickly, or there's a delay in communication or processing.

So the key factors are the presence of escalations, and the time between escalations and resolution. Also, in case 105, the escalation happens after the first investigation, which might be a problem. Maybe the system is not handling the escalation correctly, or the Level-2 team is taking longer to process the ticket.

Another thing: in case 105, the first investigation is done in 45 minutes after receive (09:10), then the escalation occurs at 10:00. Then the next investigation is on day 2 at 14:00. So that's a gap of 24 hours between the first investigation and the second. Then resolve is on day 3. So that's a long time between the escalation and the resolution.

So the root causes are:

1. Escalations to Level-2 Agent are causing delays. The time between escalation and resolution is longer than normal.

2. In case 105, the escalation occurs after the first investigation, which might be a problem. Maybe the Level-2 team is not handling the ticket quickly, leading to delays.

3. In case 102, after escalation, the investigation is done at 14:00, but the resolution is the next day. Maybe the Level-2 team is taking longer to resolve the issue.

So the factors that could be causing the delays are:

- Escalations to Level-2 Agent, which may take longer to process.

- The time between the escalation and the resolution is longer than expected.

- In case 105, the escalation is done after the first investigation, which might not be the optimal process. Maybe the escalation should be done before the investigation, but in this case, it's done after, leading to a longer time.

Additionally, in case 102, the time between assignment to Level-1 and escalation is 2h30m. But that's part of the process. However, in case 105, the time between assignment and escalation is only 45 minutes (from 09:00 to 10:00). So maybe that's not the issue.

Wait, case 105's assignment is at 09:00, then investigation at 09:10 (10 minutes after assignment). Then escalation at 10:00 (50 minutes after assignment). Then the next investigation is on March 2nd at 14:00. That's 24 hours after the first investigation. So that's a long time. So the problem is that after escalation, the investigation is delayed. So the escalation is causing a delay in processing.

So the main root causes are:

- Escalation to Level-2 Agent is leading to longer processing times.

- The time between the escalation and the resolution is longer than the average.

- In some cases, the escalation is done too late (e.g., case 105) leading to more waiting time before investigation.

So the recommendations would be to check the efficiency of the Level-2 team, ensure that escalations are handled promptly, and maybe adjust the process to escalate earlier if needed. Also, check if the escalation is being handled in a timely manner.

Another thing to note: in case 105, the investigation after escalation is done on the next day, but the resolve is on the third day. That's a 24-hour gap between the first investigation and the second, but that's part of the process. However, the resolution is delayed because the Level-2 team is taking longer to resolve the issue.

So, in conclusion, the cases with longer resolution times are 102 and 105. The root causes are the presence of escalations to Level-2, which are taking longer to process, and the time between escalation and resolution is longer than expected. In case 105, the escalation is done after the initial investigation, which may not be the optimal process, leading to a longer time before resolution.

### **Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Times**

#### **1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
- **Case 102**: Total resolution time **25 hours 10 minutes** (from 08:05 on March 1 to 09:15 on March 2).
- **Case 105**: Total resolution time **49 hours 5 minutes** (from 08:25 on March 1 to 09:30 on March 3).

**Average resolution time** across all cases is approximately **20.4 hours**, making Cases 102 and 105 significantly longer than average.

---

#### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**

**Case 102:**
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent**: The ticket is escalated to Level-2 at 11:30 (3h30m after receive), which is a critical delay. This escalation likely introduces bottlenecks in processing time.
- **Delayed Resolution**: After escalation, the investigation is completed at 14:00 (5h55m after receive), but resolution occurs 9:00 on March 2 (25h10m total). This suggests the Level-2 team is taking longer to resolve the issue.

**Case 105:**
- **Escalation after Initial Investigation**: The ticket is escalated to Level-2 at 10:00 (1h35m after receive), but the next investigation occurs 24 hours later (March 2 at 14:00). This indicates a gap in communication or processing between the Level-1 and Level-2 teams.
- **Extended Resolution Time**: The Level-2 team takes 3 days (from March 1 to March 3) to resolve the ticket, far exceeding the average time for similar cases.

**Common Factors:**
- **Escalation Delays**: Both cases involve escalations to Level-2, which are time-consuming and may indicate inefficiencies in the specialized team.
- **Inefficient Communication**: The gap between escalation and resolution (e.g., 24 hours in Case 105) suggests delays in information exchange or processing by the Level-2 team.
- **Process Bottlenecks**: Escalations to specialized teams may not be handled promptly, leading to prolonged resolution times.

#### **3. Recommendations to Address Performance Issues**

1. **Optimize Escalation Process**:
   - Ensure escalations to Level-2 are triggered promptly and do not require waiting for the initial investigation to complete.
   - Implement automated triggers or real-time monitoring to reduce delays in escalation.

2. **Improve Coordination Between Teams**:
   - Streamline communication between Level-1 and Level-2 teams to minimize gaps in processing.
   - Use tools like shared dashboards or task queues to track ticket status and dependencies.

3. **Monitor and Train Level-2 Team**:
   - Identify inefficiencies in the Level-2 team's workflow and provide training or resources to speed up resolution times.
   - Set clear SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for escalation teams to ensure timely processing.

4. **Analyze and Reduce Unnecessary Delays**:
   - Review the timeline for each case to identify non-essential waiting periods (e.g., between assignment and escalation).
   - Consider automating repetitive steps or reassigning tasks to reduce manual delays.

5. **Track and Improve Resolution Times**:
   - Use metrics to monitor the average time between escalation and resolution for Level-2 teams.
   - Compare these metrics to industry benchmarks to identify areas for improvement.

---

### **Conclusion**
Cases 102 and 105 are outliers due to escalations to Level-2 teams, which are causing significant delays in resolution. The root causes include inefficient communication, prolonged processing by specialized teams, and delays in escalation triggers. Addressing these issues through process optimization, team coordination, and training can reduce cycle times and improve overall support efficiency.
