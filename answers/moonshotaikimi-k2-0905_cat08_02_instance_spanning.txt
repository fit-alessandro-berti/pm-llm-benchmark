1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Process-mining tooling  
   • Import log into an object-centric/BPMN-extended tool (Celonis, Apromore, PM4Py) that keeps “Activity-Instance-IDs” and “Resource-IDs” – this allows us to see exactly which order and which physical object (station, staff) are occupied at every second.  
   • Build one “event-log” per attribute that travels across cases:  
   – Cold-Packing: only events where RequiresColdPacking=TRUE.  
   – Shipping batch: generate a synthetic “Batch” object; attach the Start Batch / Complete Batch events when the last required order reaches the required state.  
   – Hazardous-Material (HM): all events with HazardousMaterial=TRUE.  
   • Create interval logs with lifecycle STARTCOMPLETE and merge them so we can apply “overlap joins” and queue analysis.

B. Discovered views & visual KPI diagnostics  
   1. Cold-packing queue  
      – Resource occupancy chart for the five C-stations (as % of warehouse opening hours).  
      – Queue-length dashboard (number of orders with status=Packing, RequiresColdPacking=TRUE, no COMPLETE yet).  
      – KPI: “Cold-Pack waiting seconds” = (timestamp 1st START on C-station) – (timestamp COMPLETE of preceding QC) for each order.  
   2. Batching delay  
      – For each destination-region, look at the time between an order having both QC-COMPLETE and Packing-COMPLETE and the synthetic event “Batch-N-Complete”.  
      – KPI: “Batch-waiting seconds” = (Batch-N-Complete – Order ready-for-label). Plot by region and daily volume.  
   3. Express impact on standard flow  
      – Build a “priority pre-emption” classifier: if a Standard order is START but the same resource has START again within X minutes for an Express order, flag it “Pre-empted”.  
      – KPI: extra Standard duration = (Standard COMPLETE – pre-emption-COMPLETE – normal expected duration).  
   4. Hazardous material slot  
      – Sliding 1-second window table counting active START-without-COMPLETE Packing OR QC events that have HazardousMaterial=TRUE.  
      – KPI: “Over-slot seconds” = seconds in which count>10; “HM blocking ratio” = (#orders that could not enter Packing-QC) / total HM arrivals per day.

C. Decomposing waiting time  
   • Use the “queueing interval merge” technique: EVERY second of an order lifetime is tagged:  
   – “Busy” when resource is attached to that same order-ID;  
   – “Resource-wait” when order-ID has COMPLETE previous activity, but resource still busy somewhere else;  
   – “Batch-wait” when order is ready (QC-complete) but Batch-complete is later;  
   – “Synchronisation-wait” when order is HM and global count has reached 10;  
   – “Unavailable-wait” when Cold station is full;  
   – “Priority-wait” when order yields to Express.  
   The sum per category gives the between-instance waiting; “Busy” duration is the within-instance processing time (including rework).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Analysing Constraint Interactions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Interaction matrix (simplified)

Cold-pack  Express: Express orders jump the cold-station queue  increases mean wait for Standard cold orders AND raises risk that Express batch is small  more frequent partial dispatches to West region.

Cold-pack  Hazardous: Cold station occupation time is “invisible” for HM counter, yet a hazardous order can also require cold packing; when both limits are close to saturation the system experiences simultaneous blocking on two unrelated counts, giving very long tails.

Batching  Hazardous: If 8 HM orders headed to “South” all finish QC within minutes, South batch cannot close until 2 more HM orders leave Packing/QC (otherwise total HM>10). This artificially widens the batch window for non-HM South orders as well.

Express  Batching: Express normally skips batch (or enters a 1-order batch). Overuse of Express during peak shifts therefore fragments region volumes  more, smaller batches  higher transport cost and paradoxically longer batch-wait for standards.

Interaction results investigated via process-mining:  
   • Overlay HM-active count on cold-station occupancy timeline  find hours with double scarcity.  
   • Piled actors diagram: see how many Express orders have path “PackingQCShipping Label” that is shorter than the batch window of the region they belong to.

3. Constraint-Aware Optimisation Strategies
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Strategy 1 – Dynamic Cold-Pack Planner (addresses Cold-Pack & partly Express)  
   Change: turn the 5 cold stations into a single logical pool scheduled by a real-time “expected-queue” algorithm fed by the mined distribution of cold-pack durations.  
   Scheduler assigns a 15-minute time-slot to every order the moment QC-START occurs; Express gets a 5-minute safety lead but only if queue  1, otherwise Express still has to take next free slot (prevents starvation).  
   Leverages data:  
   – Historical mean/variance of cold-pack duration by order-type, hour-of-day;  
   – Forecast of new cold-pack arrivals derived from picking-completed events.  
   Expected outcome: 15-25 % reduction in cold-pack waiting
