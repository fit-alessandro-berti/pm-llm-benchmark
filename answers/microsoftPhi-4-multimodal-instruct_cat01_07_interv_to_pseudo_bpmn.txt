**BPMN-Like Process Model Description: Invoice Approval Process**

**1. Activities/Tasks:**

- **Receive Invoice (InvoiceReceived)**
- **Check PO-based Invoice Association (CheckPOAssociation)**
- **Log Into Accounting System (LogIntoAccounting)**
- **Forward to Purchasing Department (ForwardToPurchasing)**
- **Compare Invoice and PO (LineItemComparison)**
- **Send Department Manager for Approval (SendManagerApprovalRequest)**

- **Schedule Payment (SchedulePayment)**
- **Department Manager Reject/Approve (RejectorManager/ApproverManager)**
- **Contact Supplier (ContactSupplier)**

**2. Sequence Flow:**

1. Receive Invoice  2. Check PO Association 
   - If only PO: Log Into Accounting  3. Forward to Purchasing Department  4. Line Item Comparison
     - Discrepancy (Check): Store For Discrepancy  5. Employee Contact/Supplier Action (depending on source)
       - Discrepancy resolved: Proceed to Original flow
       - Not resolved: Recommence Step 4
   - Else No PO: Return to Sender (Unable to process) 
3. Post-Resolution: Line Item Comparison  4. Send Manager Approval Request  6. Department Manager’s Decision
   - Approve: Proceed to Scheduling Payment  7. Schedule Payment
   - Reject/Re-approve: Resolve discrepancies, reassess at Step 3 (Await resolution before next attempt)
4. Post-Manager Approval: Department Manager's Decision  8. Close Resolution

**3. Gateways/Decision Points:**

- **IF No Valid PO: Return to Sender? (No PO detected, end processing)**
- **IF Discrepancy Detected: Store For Discrepancy? (yes)**
- **IF Discrepancy Resolved: Proceed to send Manager Approval Request? (yes)**
- **IF Manager Rejects or revisits: Await resolution before next attempt? (yes)**
- **IF Manager Approves: Proceed to Schedule Payment? (yes)**
- **Extraneous Variations: May transfer to Contact Supplier (Resolution Not Accomplished within department processes)  Contact Supplier or Create Retrospective PO (based on additional conditions)**

**4. Roles/Participants:**

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Receive and Initial Check for PO Association
- **Accounting System and Purchasing Department:** Log into Account, Forwarding, Comparing Line Items
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Sends Approval Request, Approves/Rejects invoices
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Contact Supplier, Community Coordination (External Coordination roles)

**5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

- **Invoice: Invoice Received, Invoice Details (Receipts of Input Documents)**
- **Purchase Order: PO Count Details, Pricing, Charges (Transactional Outputs/Indicators for Line Item Comparison)**

**6. Exceptions/Variations:**

- **No PO Number Found:** Return the Invoice to Sender
- **Discrepancy Detected and Unresolvable:** Escalate to Supervisor or Redirect to Supplier Relationship Manager
- **Department Manager Reject/Re-approve:** Recheck or Nullify completely (Court within system)
- **Supplier Issue Unresolved:** Retrospective PO Creation or Further Department Inquiry (within external role)

The flow may not be consistent across every interview; in some cases, steps can occur consecutively or might hold variations where backward and forward paths are completed before reaching the end.

**Handle Ambiguities or Conflicts Continually and Through Review Cycles:**

- Document confirmations and disputes among interviewees for finalization
- Recognize that combined narratives warrant cross-verification before final consensus is established
