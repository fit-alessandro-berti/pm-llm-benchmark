Sure, I'd be happy to help describe the process underlying this data. Based on the process variants provided, it appears that the data represents a workflow for processing declarations or requests, likely in a corporate or organizational setting. The process involves several stages and roles, including employees, administrators, supervisors, pre-approvers, budget owners, and missing (which might refer to missing information or documentation). Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Declaration Submission:** The process starts with an employee submitting a declaration or request. This could be a payment request, a proposal, or any other type of submission that requires approval. The employee's submission is represented by the "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" event.

2. **Initial Review:** After submission, the declaration goes through an initial review by different roles, depending on the process variant. This could be an administrator, a pre-approver, or even the supervisor. The review can result in approval (e.g., "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION") or rejection (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION").

3. **Secondary Review:** If the declaration is approved in the initial review, it might go through a secondary review by other roles, such as a budget owner or a supervisor. Again, this review can result in approval or rejection.

4. **Final Approval:** If the declaration passes all reviews, it reaches the final approval stage, typically handled by a supervisor. This stage is represented by the "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" event.

5. **Payment Request and Handling:** Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is made, and the payment is handled. This stage is represented by the "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" events.

6. **Rejection and Resubmission:** If the declaration is rejected at any stage, it can be resubmitted by the employee after addressing the reasons for rejection. The resubmission process can repeat until the declaration is approved or abandoned.

The process variants provided show different combinations of these stages and roles, indicating that the workflow can be flexible and adaptive to various scenarios. The frequency and performance metrics associated with each variant might represent the number of occurrences and the time taken to complete the process, respectively.

In summary, the underlying process appears to be a multi-stage approval workflow for declarations or requests, involving various roles and stages, with
