Okay, let's break down what this process data is telling us.  It seems to be about a declaration process, likely within a company, where employees submit declarations that go through an approval workflow. Here's a description of the process, highlighting key aspects and common patterns:

**Core Process Flow (Ideal Path):**

The most frequent and fastest paths suggest an ideal flow that looks like this:

1.  **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:**  The process begins with an employee initiating a declaration.
2.  **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION:** The declaration is reviewed and initially approved by the administration department.
3.  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR:** The declaration receives final approval from the employee's supervisor.
4. **Request Payment:** A request for payment is triggered.
5. **Payment Handled:** The payment is processed.

**Variations and Key Actors:**

*   **Employee:** Starts the process by submitting the declaration and is involved in resubmitting after rejections.
*   **Administration:** Plays a key role in the initial approval. There is also a possibility of rejection from this role.
*   **Supervisor:** Responsible for the final approval, but also has the option to reject.
*   **Budget Owner:**  A more complex part of the workflow, where declarations are sometimes routed for approval in certain cases.
*   **Pre-Approver:** Sometimes included in the approval flow before the Supervisor.
*   **Missing:** Sometimes there are rejections from a "missing" entity, this requires further exploration of who the missing entity is.

**Key Observations and Points of Analysis:**

*   **Straight-Through Processing:** The most common path (and fastest) involves the straight-forward approval by administration and supervisor (no budget owner or pre-approver).
*   **Budget Owner Involvement:** The process is sometimes branched to include a budget owner. The process with the budget owner seems to be the second most prevalent, suggesting a significant amount of declarations need to be routed to a budget owner.
*   **Pre-Approver Inclusion:**  The pre-approver also is a branch, that only routes a small portion of the processes.
*   **Rejections and Loops:** There are many instances where the declaration is rejected, either by administration, supervisor, budget owner, or pre-approver, leading to a loop where the employee must resubmit. These are the most time-consuming paths.
*  **"Missing" Entity:** There is an entity labelled "Missing", which also rejects declarations, which requires further investigation to identify who it is.
* **Performance:** The rejections create significant delays, which is reflected in the performance metrics of the various paths, as the more rejections, the more it delays the process.
*   **"Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE":** There are a number of instances where the employee saves the declaration, but doesn't submit. This doesn't move forward in the process.
*   **Varied Complexity:** The number of rejections is highly variable, some declarations require multiple iterations with multiple different entities rejecting and requiring resubmission of the declaration. This is likely due to declarations being filled out incorrectly, or issues arising in the declarations themselves.
*   **Payment Initiation:** The process concludes with a request for payment, followed by payment handling. The payment handling is always the final step, suggesting it's the end of the process.
* **Administration Bottleneck:** From the number of rejections and resubmissions of declarations, there seems to be a potential bottleneck with administration. The high number of rejections suggests there is either a lack of understanding of what's required from declarations, or there are not enough employees within administration to facilitate these declarations in a timely manner.

**In Summary:**

The declaration process is a multi-stage workflow, which generally follows an ideal process, which consists of an initial submission by the employee, review and approval from administration, final approval from the supervisor, and then payment. However, there are a number of branches to the process, which include routing to budget owners or pre-approvers. The process has several opportunities for rejections, that force the employee to resubmit the declaration, this significantly impacts the time taken for these declarations to be processed. The rejections seem to be coming mostly from administration, which suggests a potential bottleneck in this area. Additionally, there is a "missing" entity that also rejects the declarations, that needs further exploration.

**Further Questions and Considerations:**

*   **Why are declarations being rejected so often?** What are the common reasons for rejections from administration, supervisor, budget owner, and pre-approver?
*   **Who is the "Missing" entity?** This entity requires investigation to ensure the rejections can be tracked and understood.
*   **Why is a pre-approver involved in some cases?** What determines if this role is needed?
*   **Are there variations in processing time for different types of declarations?**
*   **Can the process be optimized to reduce the number of rejections and loops?** Can this be done through training, or changing the way that the declarations are submitted?
*   **Can a "draft" function be implemented to reduce the number of saved declarations?**

This detailed description and the questions should provide a solid understanding of the data and help you analyze the process further. Let me know if you have any other questions!
