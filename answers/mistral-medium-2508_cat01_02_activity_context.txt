### **Justification for Renaming Choices**

1. **`Initiate Request`  Distinct Names by Channel**
   - **`Submit Initial Request`** (C001, C002): Online submission via portal.
   - **`Initiate In-Branch Request`** (C003): Walk-in at a physical branch.
   *Rationale*: The channel (web vs. branch) changes the nature of initiation, so the names reflect this.

2. **`Verify Documents`  Context-Specific Verification**
   - **`Initial Document Verification`**: First check of documents (e.g., ID).
   - **`Final Document Verification`** (C001): Re-check after missing docs are submitted.
   - **`In-Person Document Verification`** (C003): Physical verification at a branch.
   - **`Reverify Documents Post-Adjustment`** (C003): Verification after an account correction.
   *Rationale*: The purpose of verification changes (initial vs. follow-up) and the method (digital vs. in-person) varies.

3. **`Call Customer`  Purpose-Driven Naming**
   - **`Request Missing Documents`** (C001): Call to ask for additional docs.
   - **`Clarify Account Discrepancy`** (C002): Call to resolve an account issue.
   - **`Confirm Adjustments with Customer`** (C002): Follow-up to validate changes.
   - **`Recall Customer to Branch`** (C003): Call to bring the customer back after they left.
   *Rationale*: The reason for the call (missing docs, clarification, confirmation, or recall) is critical to the process flow.

4. **`Adjust Account`  Clarify the Action**
   - **`Process Account Adjustment`** (C002): Internal fix after a discrepancy is clarified.
   - **`Process Account Correction`** (C003): Internal fix due to missing information.
   *Rationale*: "Adjustment" vs. "Correction" subtly distinguishes between proactive changes (C002) and reactive fixes (C003).

5. **`Approve Request`  Consistent Final Step**
   - **`Grant Final Approval`**: Uniform naming for the approval step across all cases, as the context (final sign-off) is identical.

### **Key Improvements**
- **Disambiguation**: Recurring activities (e.g., "Verify Documents") now reflect their **stage** (initial/final), **method** (digital/in-person), or **trigger** (post-adjustment).
- **Intent Clarity**: Calls to customers are labeled by **purpose** (request docs, clarify, confirm, recall).
- **Channel Awareness**: Distinguishes between **online**, **branch**, and **back-office** actions.
- **Process Flow**: Names now implicitly show the sequence (e.g., "Initial"  "Final" verification).

This revision ensures that analysts or process miners can immediately understand the **role** of each activity without relying on additional context.
