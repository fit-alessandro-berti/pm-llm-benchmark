The complexity of Precision Parts Inc.'s environment—high variability, sequence-dependent setups, and frequent disruptions—renders simple dispatching rules ineffective. A comprehensive, data-driven approach using advanced process mining techniques is essential to diagnose the root causes of poor performance and engineer resilient, high-performing scheduling strategies.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining leverages the detailed MES event logs to move beyond surface-level statistics, reconstructing the ground-truth execution pathways and timings of every job.

### Reconstructing the Actual Flow

The job (Case ID) serves as the **Case Identifier**. Task status changes (e.g., Queue Entry, Setup Start, Task End) are the **Activities**. The **Timestamp** establishes the temporal order. **Resource ID** (Machine ID) provides the resource perspective.

1.  **Trace Alignment and Replay:** We align the observed sequences of events (traces) against the designed routing models for each job type. Trace replay is used to visualize the flow, allowing us to see where jobs deviate from standard paths (e.g., jobs rerouted due to machine breakdown) or where parallel activities occur.
2.  **Process Discovery:** Algorithms like the Alpha Miner or Heuristic Miner are used to generate detailed process maps that visually represent the actual transitions between operations, highlighting common paths, rework loops, and common skipping/alternatives (e.g., using MILL-02 instead of MILL-03).

### Quantifying Performance with Specific Process Mining Techniques

| Metric/Dimension | Process Mining Technique/View | Data Extraction/Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, Makespan** | Performance Analysis (Timing Perspective) | Calculate total duration from `Job Released` to `Job Completed`. Identify the distribution (mean, standard deviation, P95) of lead times to quantify predictability. Makespan is the duration between the first and last event in the entire log period. |
| **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times)** | Resource Perspective/Timing Analysis | Duration between `Queue Entry (Activity X)` and `Setup Start (Activity X)`. Analyze queue time variability at key work centers (bottlenecks). |
| **Resource Utilization** | Resource Performance Analysis | Calculate Active Time (Task Start to Task End, Setup Start to Setup End) vs. Total Available Time. Break down non-productive time into: *Setup Time*, *Idle Time* (waiting for work), and *Breakdown Time* (from Resource events). |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST)** | Dependency Miner / Log Enrichment | For a machine (Resource ID), link the `Task End` event of the previous job ($J_{i-1}$) to the `Setup Start/End` event of the current job ($J_i$). Group setup durations based on the transition (e.g., $J_{i-1}$ requiring large tooling $\rightarrow$ $J_i$ requiring fine polishing). This creates the empirical **Setup Time Matrix**. |
| **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness** | Case Performance Analysis (Timing & Outcome) | Compare `Task End (Final Inspection)` timestamp against `Order Due Date`. Calculate Mean Absolute Tardiness (MAT), Tardy Ratio, and analyze the distribution of slack/delay (e.g., how often jobs are late by 1 day vs. 5 days). |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | Event Overlay / Filtering | Filter traces containing `Breakdown Start` or `Priority Change` events. Compare the average lead time of affected traces vs. unaffected traces. Analyze **Disruption Recovery Time** (time taken for the machine's queue length to return to the pre-disruption average). |

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

By analyzing the quantified metrics, we can pinpoint specific inefficiencies stemming from the existing local dispatching rules.

### Key Pathologies and Supporting Process Mining Evidence

1.  **Unmanaged Bottleneck Resources:**
    * **Evidence:** Resources (e.g., CNC-01, GRIND-05) exhibit utilization consistently above 95%, combined with queue times that represent >60% of the total cycle time for jobs passing through them. Process maps show disproportionate WIP accumulation before these resources.
    * **Pathology:** Local dispatching rules treat all machines equally, leading to uncontrolled backlog at critical choke points, which dictate the overall system throughput (Makespan).

2.  **Ineffective Prioritization (Misallocation of Scarce Capacity):**
    * **Evidence:** Variant Analysis comparing traces of `High Priority` jobs vs. `Low Priority` jobs shows that the high-priority jobs often have comparable or even longer queue times. Furthermore, jobs with imminent due dates (low Critical Ratio) are frequently skipped in favor of shorter, easier jobs (reflecting an inherent Shortest Processing Time bias) only to be rushed later, increasing downstream variability.
    * **Pathology:** Local rules fail to look ahead or incorporate global urgency, meaning expensive bottleneck time is wasted on low-value/low-priority work while critical orders accrue penalties.

3.  **Significant Setup Time Overhead due to Suboptimal Sequencing:**
    * **Evidence:** The **Setup Time Matrix** derived in Section 1 shows that certain job transitions (e.g., heavy material removal followed by high-precision finishing) consistently incur 3x the average setup time. Trace analysis reveals that dispatching rules often sequence jobs based purely on arrival or due date, ignoring the significant cost penalties of these specific transitions, leading to total setup time consuming up to 30% of total machine capacity on critical resources.
    * **Pathology:** Lack of sequence awareness in the scheduling decision causes unnecessary non-productive time, artificially reducing effective capacity.

4.  **Starvation and WIP Bullwhip Effect:**
    * **Evidence:** Resources immediately downstream of a primary bottleneck (e.g., an Inspection station after CNC-01) exhibit high *Idle Time* metrics, indicating they are waiting for jobs, even while the overall system WIP is high. This variability in job arrival rate downstream causes a "bullwhip effect" where buffers violently swell and contract.
    * **Pathology:** Upstream bottlenecks, combined with a reactive scheduling system, fail to smooth the flow, leading to unbalanced line utilization and excessive variability.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

The pathologies identified are symptoms of deeper root causes related to the scheduling system's design and data handling.

### Diagnosing Root Causes

| Root Cause Category | Specific Issue | How Process Mining Confirms/Differentiates |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scheduling Logic Limitations** | **Lack of Global Optimization:** Rules are local (FCFS, EDD) and ignore downstream queues, upstream bottlenecks, and system-wide constraints (SDST). | PM reveals that local optimization (e.g., prioritizing jobs that arrive first at MILL-03) leads to global sub-optimization (causing a large delay at the next operation, GRIND-05). |
| **Data Fidelity and Predictive Gaps** | **Inaccurate Duration Estimates:** Planned durations are static and often highly inaccurate. | PM comparison of **Task Duration (Planned)** vs. **Task Duration (Actual)** shows high variance (Coefficient of Variation > 0.5) for specific activity-resource combinations, indicating that the baseline input data for scheduling is unreliable. |
| **Handling of Complexity** | **Ineffective Sequence Management:** Current rules do not account for SDST. | The high cost found in the empirical Setup Time Matrix proves that sequencing is currently suboptimal and does not minimize transitions. |
| **Disruption Management** | **Reactive, Slow Recovery:** No mechanism to dynamically re-prioritize and smooth flow after sudden events. | PM analysis of "Disruption Recovery Time" shows that resource queues take excessive time (e.g., 4+ hours) to normalize after a 30-minute breakdown, illustrating the schedule's fragility and inability to quickly re-optimize. |

### Differentiating Logic vs. Capacity

Process mining is crucial for this distinction:

*   **Capacity Issue:** If utilization is consistently near 100% on a resource, and there is no evidence of poor sequencing (setup times are minimal/optimized), the constraint is purely physical (capacity limitation).
*   **Scheduling Logic Issue:** If utilization is moderate (e.g., 70-80%), but queue times are high and volatile, lead times are unpredictable, and the setup time matrix shows high costs, the issue is inefficient time utilization—poor sequencing, erratic flow, and ineffective prioritization. *In Precision Parts Inc.'s case, the strong evidence of high SDST costs and high queue variability points strongly toward scheduling logic deficiencies.*

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

The new strategies must be dynamic, holistic, and integrate the SDST and variability data derived from the logs.

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Factor Weighted Dispatching (DMWD)

*   **Core Logic:** Replace static single-factor rules with a dynamic priority index that combines criticality, remaining work content, and the immediate cost of setup time. The index is recalculated when a new job arrives, a task finishes, or a significant disruption occurs.
*   **Formula Example (Dynamic Priority Index - DPI):**
    $$DPI_{Job} = W_1 \times (\frac{1}{\text{Critical Ratio}}) + W_2 \times (\frac{\text{Queue Length}_{Downstream}}{\text{Max Queue}_{Downstream}}) - W_3 \times (\text{Estimated Setup Time}_{Transition})$$
    *(Jobs with the highest DPI are selected next.)*
*   **Process Mining Insight Utilization:**
    1.  **Criticality (W1):** Based on tardiness analysis (Section 1), determine the necessary weight for time-based factors.
    2.  **Downstream Load (W2):** PM identifies key downstream bottlenecks. This factor forces the upstream process to smooth flow towards the constraint.
    3.  **Setup Time Cost (W3):** The precise cost of $Setup Time_{Transition}$ is pulled directly from the empirical SDST matrix derived from historical logs. This penalizes costly transitions and favors jobs that minimize immediate non-productive time.
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Poor prioritization, Starvation (by considering downstream load).
*   **Expected Impact:** Reduced average queue times, immediate drop in setup overhead at high-cost resources, and smoother flow, leading to lower WIP and improved adherence for high-priority jobs.

### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Dynamic Time Buffers (PS-DTB)

*   **Core Logic:** Adopt a risk-aware scheduling approach (like Critical Chain Project Management principles). Instead of relying on static planned durations, use the probabilistic distribution of task times mined from the logs (P50 or P80) for scheduling. Insert calculated time buffers only at strategic points (e.g., before bottlenecks and the final assembly stage) whose size is dynamically adjusted based on predicted upstream variability.
*   **Process Mining Insight Utilization:**
    1.  **Realistic Durations:** PM provides the empirical task duration distributions (e.g., P95 for Lathing 02 on alloy X) stratified by complexity or operator, creating robust input for scheduling algorithms.
    2.  **Buffer Sizing:** PM determines the historical variability (standard deviation/variance) for job routes and individual activity times. Buffers are sized proportionally to this measured uncertainty. For resources with historically high breakdown frequency (as mined from Resource events), the assigned buffer is automatically increased.
    3.  **Proactive Alerts:** By simulating the schedule against the P80 timelines, the system can predict, days in advance, when a buffer is eroding dangerously fast, allowing time for resource reallocation (expediting) before tardiness occurs.
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Unpredictable lead times, Impact of Disruptions, Inaccurate Duration Estimates.
*   **Expected Impact:** Drastically improved lead time predictability (tighter distribution), reduced tardiness (due to early intervention), and higher schedule robustness against inherent process variability.

### Strategy 3: Setup-Optimized Batching for Bottlenecks (SOBB)

*   **Core Logic:** This strategy focuses intensely on the few high-cost bottleneck machines identified (e.g., specialized CNC Mill). Instead of scheduling jobs individually by arrival, jobs are grouped (batched) within a short look-ahead horizon (e.g., 8-12 hours) based on shared setup requirements (tooling, material, fixture type). An optimization algorithm (e.g., a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem) is then applied *within the batch* to sequence the jobs to minimize the total setup time for that batch using the precise cost data.
*   **Process Mining Insight Utilization:**
    1.  **Identify Optimization Target:** PM identifies the top 3 machines responsible for the highest setup time overhead.
    2.  **The Setup Matrix:** The sequence-dependent setup cost matrix (Section 1) is the direct objective function for the optimization algorithm. The algorithm seeks the path through the batched jobs that yields the lowest transition cost sum.
    3.  **Batch Definition:** PM provides insights into which job characteristics historically correlated with large setup times, informing the optimal criteria for batch grouping (e.g., if a change in fixture type is the driver, jobs requiring the same fixture are grouped).
*   **Pathologies Addressed:** Suboptimal Sequencing, Inefficient Resource Utilization (Setup Time).
*   **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in non-productive time (up to 20-30% saving on setup hours for targeted machines), increasing effective capacity (throughput) without capital expenditure, and thus relieving bottleneck pressure.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### Simulation and Evaluation

To validate the proposed advanced strategies without risking shop floor performance, **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)** is essential.

1.  **Parameterization:** The DES model is populated entirely by data derived from process mining:
    *   **Process Model:** The discovered process map defines the flow, routings, and resource assignments.
    *   **Resource Model:** Capacity (number of machines, operators) and availability (breakdown frequencies and MTTR derived from Resource event logs).
    *   **Activity Timing:** Task duration probability distributions (P50, P95) for every activity-resource combination.
    *   **Job Arrival:** Inter-arrival time distribution of jobs based on historical job release events.
    *   **SDST Model:** The derived Setup Time Matrix is coded directly into the machine transition logic.
2.  **Testing Scenarios:**
    *   **Baseline Comparison:** Simulate the current FCFS/EDD rules using historical inputs.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Simulate periods of 20% higher job volume (High Load) and 50% increased breakdown frequency (Frequent Disruptions).
    *   **Volatility Testing:** Simulate a scenario with high variability in due dates and frequent `Priority Change` events (Hot Jobs).
3.  **Evaluation:** Compare the performance of Strategy 1, 2, and 3 against the Baseline across these scenarios, focusing on the key KPIs:
    *   Reduction in Mean Absolute Tardiness (MAT).
    *   Reduction in Average Work-in-Progress (WIP).
    *   Increase in overall Makespan (throughput).
    *   Change in Resource Utilization (specifically the ratio of productive time vs. setup/idle time).

### Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation

Scheduling is a dynamic control problem; the effectiveness of any strategy will degrade over time (process drift). A continuous process mining loop ensures the strategies remain optimal.

1.  **KPI Tracking Dashboard:** Establish real-time dashboards tracking key operational KPIs (e.g., average daily MAT, average queue length at CNC-01, actual setup time deviation).
2.  **Automated Process Conformance Checking:** Continuously align the current day's execution traces against the optimized scheduling model (e.g., the planned optimal sequence from SOBB). If actual execution deviates by more than a predefined threshold (e.g., 3 standard deviations in sequencing order or time buffers), a **drift alert** is generated.
3.  **Model Recalibration:**
    *   If task duration distributions or breakdown rates show a sustained shift (e.g., actual processing times are consistently 10% faster due to a new tool), the system automatically triggers a re-mining of the relevant time distribution data and recalculates the PS-DTB buffers.
    *   If the cost profile of the Setup Time Matrix changes (e.g., new materials change setup time costs), the SOBB strategy’s objective function is automatically updated using the latest mined data.

This feedback loop ensures that the scheduling strategies remain *adaptive* and *data-driven*, managing the inherent variability and complexity of the Precision Parts Inc. job shop.
