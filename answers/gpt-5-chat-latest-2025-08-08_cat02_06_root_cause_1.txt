Alright — let's go step-by-step, analyzing the given event log for the **Customer Support Ticket Resolution** process.

## **Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case**

We measure **total resolution time** from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket**.

| Case ID | Start Time               | End Time                 | Total Duration      |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00          | 2024-03-01 10:15          | **2h 15m**          |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05          | 2024-03-02 09:15          | **1d 1h 10m**       |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10          | 2024-03-01 09:30          | **1h 20m**          |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20          | 2024-03-02 08:30          | **1d 0h 10m**       |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25          | 2024-03-03 09:30          | **2d 1h 5m**        |

## **Step 2: Identifying Long-Resolution Cases**

Most tickets (101, 103) close in **~1 to 2 hours** — these are “fast” resolutions.

**Significantly longer:**  
- **Case 102:** ~25 hours  
- **Case 104:** ~24 hours  
- **Case 105:** ~49 hours (worst performer)

---

## **Step 3: Look for Patterns / Root Causes**

Let's check **activity timelines** for delays.

---

### **Case 102** — Slow due to escalation & delayed investigation
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent at 11:30** but investigation only begins at **14:00** (2.5 hours later)
- Then from **14:00 on Day 1** to **09:00 on Day 2** before resolution (overnight wait)
- **Cause:**  
  - *Escalation to Level-2*
  - Delay in starting investigation after escalation  
  - Large overnight gap before resolution

---

### **Case 104** — Slow due to delayed investigation start
- Ticket assigned at **09:30**, but investigation only starts at **13:00** (**3.5-hour delay**)
- Then a big gap from **13:00 on Day 1** to **08:00 on Day 2** before resolution (overnight wait)
- **Cause:**  
  - *No escalation*, but long queuing before investigation begins
  - Overnight delay in resolution

---

### **Case 105** — Worst delay, multiple waiting periods
- Investigate at **09:10 Day 1**  
- Escalate to Level-2 at **10:00 Day 1**, but next investigation **only at 14:00 Day 2** (**~28-hour gap!**)
- Resolve next morning (**~19 more hours after second investigation start**)
- **Cause:**  
  - *Escalation to Level-2*
  - Extremely long gap before Level-2 investigation begins (possibly backlog or coordination delay)
  - Additional overnight delay before resolution

---

## **Step 4: Root Cause Analysis**

From the patterns:

**Key Delay Factors:**
1. **Escalations to Level-2 Agent**  
   - Every case involving escalation (**102 and 105**) is significantly longer than non-escalated cases (except 104).
   - Level-2 work seems to have longer queues before investigation begins.

2. **Long waiting time before investigation starts**  
   - Even without escalation (Case 104), there's a **queue delay** of hours before investigation.

3. **Overnight waits delaying resolution**  
   - If investigation or escalation occurs late in the day, resolution is often postponed until the next morning, introducing large idle times.

4. **Bottleneck at specialized team**  
   - Large delays before Level-2 "Investigate Issue" in escalated tickets suggest resource constraints.

---

## **Step 5: Why These Factors Increase Cycle Time**

- **Escalations add handoffs**, which often require ticket re-prioritization and reallocation in the Level-2 queue. Without proper SLA, these wait times balloon.
- **Long investigation wait before starting work** indicates priority/training issues or insufficient staffing at Level-1.
- **Overnight delays** indicate work cutoffs — if an investigation is not started early, it gets pushed to the next day.
- **Specialized skill dependencies** cause tickets that require certain expertise to sit idle until a capable agent is free.

---

## **Step 6: Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**

**1. Improve Level-2 resource availability**  
   - Either increase staffing or set up an SLA for escalations (e.g., investigate within 4 hours of escalation time).

**2. Reduce delay between ticket assignment and investigation**  
   - Activity shows idle time before starting investigation. Better workload balancing and prioritization rules could help.

**3. Introduce staggered shifts or partial night staffing**  
   - To avoid overnight delays, have agents available later in the day to complete investigations and resolutions without pushing them to the next morning.

**4. Pre-investigation assessment before escalation**  
   - Ensure sufficient details are gathered early so Level-2 can work without further info requests, reducing handoff time.

**5. Monitor queue times for each step**  
   - Implement dashboards tracking time in each step. Highlight cases exceeding SLA so supervisors can intervene early.

### **Summary Table: Prolonged Cases and Factors**

| Case ID | Duration      | Escalation? | Key Delays                                           |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 102     | 25h 10m       | Yes         | Delay before investigation, overnight wait         |
| 104     | 24h 10m       | No          | Long wait before investigation, overnight wait     |
| 105     | 49h 5m        | Yes         | Long gap before Level-2 investigation, overnight   |

 If you’d like, I can **visualize this as a process timeline** showing where delays occur in each case — would you like me to prepare that diagram? It might make the bottlenecks much clearer.
