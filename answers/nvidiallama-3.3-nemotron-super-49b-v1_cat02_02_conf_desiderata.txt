**Task 1: Violations of Normative Rules**

* **Case 2**
	+ **Violation 1:** "Risk Assessment" performed before "Credit Check", violating the ordering rule that requires Credit Check before Risk Assessment.
	+ **Violation 2:** "Finalize Documentation" occurred after a "Loan Decision (Rejected)", which is explicitly not allowed.
	+ **Violation 3:** Although not explicitly listed in the "What is Not Allowed" section, performing a Credit Check after a Risk Assessment also implies a **Sequence Violation** as it disrupts the mandated sequence.

* **No other cases** directly violate the normative rules as described.

**Task 2: Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions**

* **Case 2**
	+ **Desideratum Violation:** Not directly applicable since the primary issues are normative violations. However, the overall process efficiency is compromised.
* **Case 3**
	+ **Desideratum Violation 1:** Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received.
	+ **Desideratum Violation 2:** Applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision.
	+ **Desideratum Violation 3:** No Follow-up Call was recorded before closing the case.

* **Suboptimal Behavior Explanation:**
	+ Delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant steps in Case 3, and the lack of a Follow-up Call, indicate inefficiencies and potential communication gaps, which, while not violating strict rules, detract from the desired process quality and applicant experience.

**Task 3: Suggested Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

### For Normative Violations (Case 2)

* **Violation 1 & 3 (Sequence/Risk Assessment before Credit Check):**
	+ **Possible Justification:** Human error or a misunderstanding of the process by the handling personnel. 
    + **Mitigation Suggestion:** Immediate re-training of staff on process adherence and implementing checks to prevent such reversals in the future.
* **Violation 2 (Finalize Documentation after Rejection):**
	+ **Possible Justification:** Misinterpretation of the rules regarding documentation finalization regardless of the decision outcome.
    + **Mitigation Suggestion:** Clarify policies and ensure that the system (if automated) or staff (if manual) are updated to reflect that finalization is only for approved loans.

### For Desiderata Violations (Case 3)

* **Delayed Credit Check:**
	+ **Possible Justification:** Unexpected backlog or temporary resource shortage.
    + **Mitigation Suggestion:** Review resource allocation to ensure timely processing of initial steps.
* **Delayed Inform Applicant:**
	+ **Possible Justification:** Similar to above, or awaiting additional information not captured in the log.
    + **Mitigation Suggestion:** Automate notification processes where possible to reduce delay, or allocate specific staff for timely communication.
* **No Follow-up Call:**
	+ **Possible Justification:** Oversight, or deemed unnecessary due to the straightforward nature of the case.
    + **Mitigation Suggestion:** Implement a reminder system for follow-up actions to enhance applicant experience and ensure alignment.
