**Brief Explanation and Logic:**

- **Case Identification:** Cases were identified based on distinct user tasks or work sessions, inferred from application switches, document openings, and the nature of interactions (e.g., composing an email versus editing a document). Cases include editing documents (DOC-XXX), handling emails (EMAIL-XXX), reviewing PDFs (PDF-XXX), and managing budgets (BUD-XXX).

- **Activity Naming:** Low-level actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," and "SWITCH" were translated into higher-level activities that better represent the process steps, such as "Open Document," "Edit Document Content," "Switch to Email Client," and "Insert Budget Reference." This translation aimed to provide a clearer understanding of the user's workflow.

- **Event Attributes:** Each event includes a unique **Case ID** to group related events, an **Activity Name** for process step identification, and the original **Timestamp**. Additional attributes were included where helpful for context, such as document names, email subjects, and specific changes made.

- **Coherent Narrative:** The event log narrates a user's work session, starting with document editing, switching to handling an email, reviewing a PDF, updating a budget spreadsheet, and finally returning to document editing before closing all tasks. This sequence reflects a typical workflow where a user manages multiple tasks in a cohesive work session.
