Sure! Here's an example of a DECLARE model based on the process variants you provided:
```python
from pm4py.objects.declare.dict import factory as declare_dict_factory
from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import factory as xes_importer

# Load the event log from the provided process variants
log = []
for variant in process_variants:
    trace = [activity for activity in variant['process']]
    log.append(trace)

# Create a DECLARE model based on the event log
declare_model = declare_dict_factory.apply()

# Set the initial activity to 'Create Fine'
declare_model['init'] = {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}

# Set the 'absence' constraints for activities that never occur in the event log
absence_constraints = {'Add penalty': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Appeal to Judge': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Payment': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0},
                        'Send for Credit Collection': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 0.0}}
declare_model['absence'] = absence_constraints

# Set the 'existence' constraints for activities that occur at least once in the event log
existence_constraints = {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                          'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
                          'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}
declare_model['existence'] = existence_constraints

# Set the 'exactly_one' constraints for activities that occur exactly once in each trace
exactly_one_constraints = {'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}
declare_model['exactly_one'] = exactly_one_constraints

# Set the 'responded_existence' constraints for activities that must be followed by another activity
# For example, if 'Insert Fine Notification' occurs, then 'Add penalty' must also occur in the same trace
responded_existence_constraints = {'Insert Fine Notification': {'Add penalty': {'support': 0.51, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['responded_existence'] = responded_existence_constraints

# Set the 'coexistence' constraints for activities that must occur together in the same trace
# For example, if 'Insert Fine Notification' occurs, then 'Send Fine' must also occur in the same trace
coexistence_constraints = {'Insert Fine Notification': {'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['coexistence'] = coexistence_constraints

# Set the 'response' constraints for activities that must be followed by another activity in the future
# For example, if 'Send Fine' occurs, then 'Insert Fine Notification' must also occur in the future of the trace
response_constraints = {'Send Fine': {'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 0.91, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['response'] = response_constraints

# Set the 'precedence' constraints for activities that must occur before another activity
# For example, if 'Add penalty' occurs, then 'Insert Fine Notification' must also occur in the past of the trace
precedence_constraints = {'Add penalty': {'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 0.51, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['precedence'] = precedence_constraints

# Set the 'succession' constraints for activities that must occur in a specific order
# For example, if 'Send Fine' occurs, then 'Insert Fine Notification' must also occur next in the trace
succession_constraints = {'Send Fine': {'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 0.91, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['succession'] = succession_constraints

# Set the 'altresponse' constraints for activities that must alternate with another activity
# For example, if 'Send Fine' occurs, then 'Insert Fine Notification' must also occur in the future of the trace,
# and then 'Send Fine' must occur again before 'Insert Fine Notification' occurs again
altresponse_constraints = {'Send Fine': {'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 0.52, 'confidence': 1.0}}}
declare_model['altresponse'] = altre
