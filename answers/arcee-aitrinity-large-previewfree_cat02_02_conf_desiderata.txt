Looking at the event log and comparing it against the strict normative rules and the recommended desiderata, I can identify several deviations:

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

**Case 2** has two serious violations of the strict sequence:
- **Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check**: The log shows Risk Assessment at 08:20, followed by Credit Check at 08:20. This violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
- **Finalize Documentation after rejection**: After the Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, the log shows Finalize Documentation at 10:00, followed by Close Case at 10:30. This violates the rule that Finalize Documentation should not occur after a rejection.

**Case 1** and **Case 3** both follow the normative sequence correctly, with no violations of the strict ordering rules.

**2. Desiderata Violations:**

**Case 3** has two violations of the recommended best practices:
- **Credit Check timing**: The Credit Check occurred on 2024-01-14 at 10:00, which is more than 24 hours after the Application Received on 2024-01-12 at 09:00. This violates the recommended timing for prompt credit checks.
- **Inform Applicant timing**: The Inform Applicant occurred on 2024-01-16 at 15:00, which is more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision on 2024-01-14 at 12:00. This violates the recommended timing for prompt applicant notification.
- **Missing Follow-up Call**: There is no Follow-up Call recorded before closing the case, which is a recommended best practice but not a strict requirement.

**Case 1** and **Case 2** both follow the recommended timing for Credit Check and Inform Applicant, and Case 1 also includes the Follow-up Call (though not explicitly recorded in the log, it appears to be implicitly followed).

**Interpretations and Justifications:**

- **Case 2**: The violations in Case 2 suggest a process deviation or error. The Risk Assessment before Credit Check could indicate that the credit check was overlooked or performed informally. The Finalize Documentation after rejection might be due to a misunderstanding of the process rules or an error in documentation handling. These are serious violations that need to be addressed to ensure compliance with the strict sequence.

- **Case 3**: The timing violations in Case 3 suggest that while the process is followed correctly, there are delays in certain activities. The Credit Check delay might be due to resource constraints or prioritization issues. The Inform Applicant delay could be due to administrative backlog or communication challenges. The missing Follow-up Call might be due to oversight or resource limitations. These are not severe violations but indicate areas for process improvement to meet the recommended best practices.

In summary, Case 2 has serious normative rule violations, while Case 3 has minor desiderata violations that are suboptimal but not critical.
