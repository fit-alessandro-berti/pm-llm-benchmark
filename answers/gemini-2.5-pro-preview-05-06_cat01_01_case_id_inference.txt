Okay, let's break down these events and infer the case groupings. The primary identifiers we'll use are `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department`, along with the logical flow of activities and timestamps.

**Heuristics for Grouping:**
1.  **Patient Demographics:** Events with the same `patient_age` and `patient_gender` are strong candidates for the same case.
2.  **Initial Event:** A "Register patient" event typically signifies the start of a new case.
3.  **Departmental Flow:** Patients usually follow a path (e.g., ER registration -> ER triage -> ER consult -> Radiology -> ER consult -> ER discharge).
4.  **Resource Continuity:** Sometimes the same resource (e.g., a specific doctor) handles multiple steps for the same patient.
5.  **Time Proximity:** Events for the same case should occur in a plausible time sequence.
6.  **Activity Logic:** Certain activities naturally follow others (e.g., "Lab test requested" before "Lab test completed").

Let's assign inferred Case IDs:

**Case 1: Patient (Age 45, Male, ER)**
