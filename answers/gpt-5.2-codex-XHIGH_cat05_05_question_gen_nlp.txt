1. How might the company balance the benefits of justintime replenishment with the risks of supplier disruptions or geopolitical events in key sourcing regions?  
2. What tradeoffs exist between using air freight for speed versus sea freight for cost and carbon footprint, and how could those tradeoffs be optimized by market?  
3. In what ways could variability in supplier lead times or quality metrics impact assembly scheduling and overall delivery performance?  
4. How can the manufacturer better integrate supplier performance data into demand planning and production scheduling to improve responsiveness?  
5. What strategies could reduce the complexity of managing multiple currencies, regulations, and customs requirements across global logistics networks?  
6. How might the company design contracts with suppliers to incentivize higher quality, shorter lead times, or more sustainable practices?  
7. What risks arise from having a single main assembly plant, and how could the company improve resilience against regional disruptions?  
8. How can data analytics and machine learning models be validated and governed to ensure forecasting accuracy and avoid unintended biases?  
9. What bottlenecks or hidden inefficiencies might exist in the assembly and qualitytesting stages, and how could they be uncovered?  
10. How could the company optimize inventory policies across fastmoving and slowmoving markets while minimizing both stockouts and excess inventory?  
11. What are the implications of stricter environmental regulations on packaging, logistics, and component sourcing, and how can the supply chain adapt proactively?  
12. How might warranty and aftersales support data feed back into R&D and supplier selection to improve product reliability?  
13. What lessons can be learned from product recall events, and how could traceability be improved to make recalls faster and less costly?  
14. How can the manufacturer collaborate with logistics partners to improve customs clearance efficiency and reduce transit delays?  
15. In what ways could automation or AI in the assembly plant enhance quality control without reducing workforce resilience or flexibility?  
16. How might demand shocks—such as viral social media interest or sudden economic downturns—be better anticipated and absorbed?  
17. What are the strategic implications of increasing localization in production or sourcing, and how would that affect cost, speed, and compliance?  
18. How can the company measure and reduce the carbon footprint of the endtoend supply chain while maintaining profitability?  
19. What communication or decisionmaking challenges arise from coordinating supply chain planners across multiple time zones, and how could collaboration be improved?  
20. How could the company design an earlywarning system to detect emerging risks in supplier regions (e.g., political instability, natural disasters, or labor issues)?
