Based on a careful analysis of the event log, the recurring activities carry distinct meanings depending on their position in the workflow and the specific triggers mentioned in the "Additional Context" and "Resource" columns.

### 1. Analysis of Recurring Activities

The primary activities requiring disambiguation are **"Verify Documents"** and **"Call Customer."**

*   **Verify Documents:**
    *   **Context A (Initial):** This occurs at the start of the process, immediately after the request is initiated. It represents the standard baseline check.
    *   **Context B (Follow-up):** This occurs after a "Call Customer" or "Submit Additional" event. It represents a re-evaluation of specific missing items or a verification of changes made to the account.
*   **Call Customer:**
    *   **Context A (Inquiry/Requirement):** This is used to prompt the customer for missing information or to clarify an existing discrepancy.
    *   **Context B (Notification/Instruction):** This is used to inform the customer that an action has been completed (confirmation) or to provide logistical instructions (return to branch).

### 3. Justification for Naming Changes

*   **Document Verification Disambiguation:** 
    *   **Initial Document Verification:** Used for the first instance of checking documents. This represents the "Happy Path" entry point for document handling.
    *   **Post-Submission/Adjustment Re-verification:** Renamed to indicate that this is a *re-work* or *loop-back* activity. It is triggered only after a correction has been made (either by the customer in C001 or internally in C003).

*   **Call Customer Disambiguation:** 
    *   **Request Missing Docs / Clarify Discrepancy:** These names were chosen because they represent "inbound" needs from the company to the customer to fix a stalling process.
    *   **Resolution Confirmation:** In C002, the second call is purely informative. It marks the transition from "Problem Solving" to "Closing," and renaming it avoids confusing it with the earlier problem-solving call.
    *   **Operational Logistics:** In C003, the call is not about the data or documents itself, but about the physical location of the customer. Renaming this allows process analysts to see it as an outlier compared to standard service calls.

*   **Resource Context:**
    *   In C003, "Physical" was added to the verification because it was performed by a **Branch Officer** rather than a **Back Office Agent**, highlighting the different risks and procedures associated with in-person vs. digital verification.
