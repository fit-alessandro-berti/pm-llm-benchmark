Alright, I've got this temporal profile model here, and it's showing some average time intervals between different activities in an insurance claim handling process. There are some pairs that look a bit off, and I need to figure out what might be causing these anomalies and how to verify them using SQL queries.

First, let's look at the model:

- 'R' to 'A': 1 hour average, 10 minutes STDEV. That seems reasonable; probably claims are assigned quickly after being received.

- 'R' to 'E': 1 day average, 8 hours STDEV. That also makes sense; evaluation might take some time after receiving the claim.

Now, 'R' to 'P': 90000 seconds is about 25 hours, with a STDEV of 1 hour. That's pretty tight. 25 hours seems long for approval after receiving the claim, and the low STDEV suggests that it's almost always around that time. That might be suspicious. Maybe there's a batch processing happening at specific times, or some automated system that kicks in after 25 hours. But in reality, approvals should vary based on the claim's complexity.

Next, 'A' to 'C': 2 hours average, 1 hour STDEV. That seems too quick. After assigning the adjuster, you'd expect more steps like evaluation and approval before closing the claim. Maybe some claims are being closed without going through all the necessary steps.

Then, 'E' to 'N': 5 minutes average, 1 minute STDEV. That seems too fast for notifying the customer after evaluating the claim. Maybe the notification is automated and happens instantly, but even so, 5 minutes seems unusually short.

'E' to 'C': 1 hour average, 50 minutes STDEV. That seems okay, assuming that after evaluation and notification, the claim is closed shortly afterward.

'P' to 'N': 7 days average, 2 days STDEV. That's a really long time between approval and notification. That doesn't make sense; why would there be such a delay? Maybe there's a backlog in notifications or some other issue causing this delay.

Finally, 'N' to 'C': 30 minutes average, 5 minutes STDEV. That seems reasonable; after notifying the customer, the claim is closed quickly.

So, the anomalies I see are:

1. 'R' to 'P': Long average time with low STDEV.

2. 'A' to 'C': Short average time, possibly skipping steps.

3. 'E' to 'N': Very short time, maybe too fast.

4. 'P' to 'N': Very long time, possibly indicating a bottleneck or delay.

Let's think about why these might be happening.

For 'R' to 'P':

- Maybe there's a fixed schedule for approvals, like once every 25 hours, and claims are queued until then.

- Perhaps there's a batch processing system that handles approvals in batches at specific times.

- It could also be due to resource constraints, with approvers only available at certain times.

For 'A' to 'C':

- Adjusters might be closing claims prematurely without completing all required steps.

- There could be a misconfiguration in the system where claims are automatically closed after assignment.

- Maybe some claims are simple and don't require further evaluation or approval, but that seems unlikely for most insurance claims.

For 'E' to 'N':

- The notification might be triggered automatically as soon as the evaluation is complete, hence the quick turnaround.

- Perhaps evaluations and notifications are handled by the same system, which processes them back-to-back.

- It could also indicate that notifications are being sent before the evaluation is fully reviewed by a human, possibly being automated.

For 'P' to 'N':

- There might be a delay in notifying the customer after approval due to backlog in the notification system.

- Maybe there are additional steps between approval and notification that are causing the delay, such as documentation review or payment processing.

- It's also possible that notifications are sent in batches, causing the long delay.

Now, to verify these hypotheses, I need to construct SQL queries on the `claim_events` table to analyze the timing between activities.

First, for 'R' to 'P':

I can calculate the time difference between 'R' and 'P' for each claim and see how many fall outside the expected range.

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_timestamp - receive_timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS receive_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    receive_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

Then, I can analyze the results to see if most claims have around 25 hours with little variation.

Similarly, for 'A' to 'C':

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_timestamp - assign_timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    assign_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND close_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

Check if the average time is indeed around 2 hours and see if there are claims that are closed quickly after assignment without intermediate steps.

For 'E' to 'N':

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - evaluate_timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS evaluate_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    evaluate_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

See if the average is indeed around 5 minutes and check for any patterns or outliers.

For 'P' to 'N':

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

Check if the average is around 7 days and look for any trends or correlations with other factors like adjuster, claim type, etc.

Additionally, I can join with the `adjusters` table to see if specific adjusters are associated with these anomalies.

For example, to check if certain adjusters are closing claims too quickly:

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    a.name,
    COUNT(*) AS quick_close Claims
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    ce.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - assign_timestamp)) < 7200 -- less than 2 hours
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 10; -- adjust threshold as needed
```

This would show adjusters who have closed multiple claims very quickly after assignment.

Similarly, for 'P' to 'N' long delays:

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    a.name AS adjuster,
    c.claim_type,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events
    GROUP BY
        claim_id
) sub
JOIN
    claims c ON sub.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) > 604800; -- more than 7 days
```

This query identifies claims where the time from approval to notification exceeds 7 days, along with the adjuster and claim type, to see if there are patterns.

I can also look at the distribution of these times to see if they follow a normal distribution or if there are multiple peaks, which might indicate different processing paths.

Additionally, checking for claims that are closed without going through all the expected activities could be insightful. For example, claims that go from 'A' to 'C' without 'E' and 'P'.

Query:

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
WHERE
    ce_e.claim_id IS NULL
    OR ce_p.claim_id IS NULL;
```

This would show claims that are missing evaluation or approval activities, which might explain the quick closure.

In summary, by analyzing the time differences between activities and correlating them with other attributes like adjuster and claim type, we can uncover potential issues in the claim handling process and identify areas that need further investigation.

**Final Solution**

To address the anomalies identified in the temporal profile model, we need to verify the timing discrepancies in the insurance claim handling process using SQL queries on the underlying database. The anomalies observed are:

1. **'R' to 'P' (Receive to Approve):** Long average time with low standard deviation.
2. **'A' to 'C' (Assign to Close):** Short average time, suggesting possible premature closure.
3. **'E' to 'N' (Evaluate to Notify):** Very short time, potentially indicating automated or rapid processing.
4. **'P' to 'N' (Approve to Notify):** Extremely long average delay, suggesting bottlenecks or backlogs.

### Approach

1. **Identify Anomalies:**
   - Calculate time differences between specific activities for each claim.
   - Compare these differences with the expected averages and standard deviations.

2. **Generate Hypotheses:**
   - Investigate potential reasons for the observed anomalies, such as batch processing, resource constraints, or misconfigurations.

3. **Propose Verification Methods:**
   - Use SQL queries to extract and analyze time intervals between activities.
   - Correlate anomalies with adjusters, claim types, or other factors to identify patterns.

    receive_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query calculates the time difference in seconds between 'Receive' and 'Approve' activities for each claim.
- It helps to verify if the average time is consistently around 25 hours with low variation.

#### Query 2: Time from 'A' to 'C'

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_timestamp - assign_timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    assign_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND close_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query calculates the time difference in seconds between 'Assign' and 'Close' activities.
- It helps to identify claims that are closed quickly after assignment, potentially bypassing necessary steps.

#### Query 3: Time from 'E' to 'N'

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - evaluate_timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS evaluate_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    evaluate_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query calculates the time difference in seconds between 'Evaluate' and 'Notify' activities.
- It verifies if the average time is around 5 minutes, suggesting potential automation or rapid processing.

#### Query 4: Time from 'P' to 'N'

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM (

        c.claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events ce
    JOIN
        claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id
) sub
WHERE
    approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query calculates the time difference in seconds between 'Approve' and 'Notify' activities.
- It helps to identify claims with excessively long delays between approval and notification.

#### Query 5: Adjusters with Quick Closures

```sql
SELECT
    a.name,
    COUNT(*) AS quick_close_claims
FROM
    claim_events ce
JOIN
    claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    ce.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - assign_timestamp)) < 7200 -- less than 2 hours
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 10; -- adjust threshold as needed
```

**Explanation:**
- This query identifies adjusters who have closed multiple claims quickly after assignment, potentially skipping necessary steps.

#### Query 6: Claims with Long Delays from 'P' to 'N'

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    a.name AS adjuster,
    c.claim_type,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
FROM (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_timestamp,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_timestamp
    FROM
        claim_events
    GROUP BY
        claim_id
) sub
JOIN
    claims c ON sub.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN
    adjusters a ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
WHERE
    approve_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND notify_timestamp IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_timestamp - approve_timestamp)) > 604800; -- more than 7 days
```

**Explanation:**
- This query identifies claims with approval to notification times exceeding 7 days, along with associated adjusters and claim types.

#### Query 7: Claims Missing Evaluation or Approval

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_id
FROM
    claims c
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN
    claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
WHERE
    ce_e.claim_id IS NULL
    OR ce_p.claim_id IS NULL;
```

**Explanation:**
- This query finds claims that do not have 'Evaluate' or 'Approve' activities, indicating potential incomplete processing.

### Conclusion

By executing these SQL queries, we can verify the anomalies observed in the temporal profile model and gain insights into the underlying issues in the claim handling process. The results can help in identifying specific claims, adjusters, or claim types that are contributing to these anomalies, thereby enabling targeted process improvements and mitigations.
