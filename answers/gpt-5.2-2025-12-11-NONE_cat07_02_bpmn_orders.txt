The visualization is a **BPMN-style process diagram** showing an end-to-end **order fulfillment workflow** split into four swimlanes (departments):

## Swimlanes / participants
- **Sales** (top lane)
- **Production**
- **Procurement**
- **Warehouse** (bottom lane)

## Main flow (high level)
1. **Sales (Monday morning trigger)**  
   - Starts when an order comes in.  
   - Tasks: **Check order for completeness**  **Check if customer is already in the database**.  
   - A decision gateway branches:
     - If the **customer is not in the database**, Sales **adds the customer to the database** (database/data store symbol shown).
     - If already present, it continues.
   - Sales then **sends order details** (message/event) and later **drafts an invoice**.

2. **Production**
   - Receives **order details** (message event “Order details arrive”).  
   - **Plan production**  **Manufacture product**.  
   - Ends with a “**Product complete**” event.

3. **Procurement**
   - Also receives **order details**.  
   - Contains a **Material Compensation Subprocess** with steps like **Order materials** and possible **Return material**.  
   - Then **Check materials**; if there’s a problem, an **order cancellation** outcome is shown.

4. **Warehouse**
   - Receives **Product complete** (message event).  
   - Task: **Send product**, ending with **Product sent**.

## Connections / notation cues
- **Solid arrows** show sequence within each lane.
- **Dashed message flows** connect lanes (e.g., *order details*, *product complete*, *product sent*).
- **Gateways (diamonds with X / plus)** indicate decisions or parallel synchronization.
- **Database symbol** represents customer data persistence.
- **Start/end events** mark process initiation and completion points.

Overall, it depicts how an order moves from Sales validation and customer setup, through Production and Procurement support, to Warehouse shipping, and finally invoicing.
