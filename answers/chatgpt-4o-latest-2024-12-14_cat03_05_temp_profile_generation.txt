Here is a Python dictionary that represents an estimated temporal profile for the described global supply chain process. This includes pairs of activities that are not necessarily consecutive but may occur in sequence over multiple steps. The values `(average_time, standard_deviation)` are estimated based on typical delays and variances in supply chain operations:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: 1 day average, 2-hour deviation
    ('SS', 'RC'): (259200, 43200),  # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: 3 days average, 12-hour deviation
    ('SS', 'QI'): (345600, 54000),  # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection: 4 days average, 15-hour deviation
    ('SS', 'CA'): (432000, 86400),  # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly: 5 days average, 24-hour deviation
    ('SS', 'PT'): (518400, 108000),  # Supplier Selection to Product Testing: 6 days average, 30-hour deviation
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 28800),  # Order Placement to Receive Components: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('OP', 'QI'): (259200, 36000),  # Order Placement to Quality Inspection: 3 days average, 10-hour deviation
    ('OP', 'CA'): (345600, 43200),  # Order Placement to Component Assembly: 4 days average, 12-hour deviation
    ('OP', 'PT'): (432000, 54000),  # Order Placement to Product Testing: 5 days average, 15-hour deviation
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),  # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('RC', 'CA'): (172800, 28800),  # Receive Components to Component Assembly: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('RC', 'PT'): (259200, 36000),  # Receive Components to Product Testing: 3 days average, 10-hour deviation
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 14400),  # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('QI', 'PT'): (172800, 28800),  # Quality Inspection to Product Testing: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 14400),  # Component Assembly to Product Testing: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('CA', 'PK'): (172800, 28800),  # Component Assembly to Packaging: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 14400),  # Product Testing to Packaging: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('PT', 'WS'): (172800, 28800),  # Product Testing to Warehouse Storage: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('PT', 'DT'): (259200, 36000),  # Product Testing to Distribution: 3 days average, 10-hour deviation
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 14400),  # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 28800),  # Packaging to Distribution: 2 days average, 8-hour deviation
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),  # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: 1 day average, 4-hour deviation
    ('DT', 'AS'): (259200, 43200),  # Distribution to After-Sales Support: 3 days average, 12-hour deviation
    ('SS', 'AS'): (604800, 86400),  # Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support: 7 days average, 24-hour deviation
    ('RC', 'AS'): (518400, 72000),  # Receive Components to After-Sales Support: 6 days average, 20-hour deviation
    ('QI', 'AS'): (432000, 54000),  # Quality Inspection to After-Sales Support: 5 days average, 15-hour deviation
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Temporal Estimates**: The `average_time` values reflect typical durations between activities based on supply chain complexity and dependencies. The `standard_deviation` values represent expected variability due to operational challenges like supplier delays, testing issues, or shipping bottlenecks.
2. **Complexity**: Pairs include direct transitions (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`) and transitions separated by multiple steps (e.g., `('SS', 'CA')`), reflecting the temporal profile's broader scope.
3. **Scalability**: The structure can accommodate additional activities or more refined estimates, making it adaptable for larger or more detailed processes.
