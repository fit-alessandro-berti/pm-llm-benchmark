Based on the provided process variants, I've identified some potential root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Rejection loops**: Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE) indicate a high likelihood of process inefficiencies. These loops can lead to increased processing time and decreased performance.

2. **Multiple approval paths**: The presence of multiple approval paths (e.g., Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER vs. Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR) may introduce variability and complexity, potentially affecting performance.

3. **Unnecessary steps**: The variant Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE with a frequency of 134 and performance of 0.000 might indicate an unnecessary step in the process, which could be optimized or removed.

4. ** Missing or incorrect information**: The presence of Declaration REJECTED by MISSING and Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION with high frequencies and performance values may suggest that missing or incorrect information is causing delays and rework in the process.

5. **Overly complex process flows**: Variants with many nodes and edges (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) may be prone to errors, delays, and performance issues.

6. **Performance bottlenecks**: The performance values for certain activities (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION with a performance value of 13805869.200) may indicate bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the process.

7. **Lack of standardization**: The presence of multiple approval roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR) and varying approval paths may suggest a lack of standardization in the process, leading to inefficiencies and performance issues.

To further investigate these potential root causes, I recommend analyzing the process data and metrics in more detail, such as:

* Activity duration and wait times
* Resource utilization and allocation
* Error rates and rework frequencies
* Process variant frequencies and distributions

By examining these metrics and data, you can gain a deeper understanding of the process performance issues and identify targeted improvements to address the root causes.
