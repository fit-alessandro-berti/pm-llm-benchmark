Based on the provided data, we can construct a temporal profile for the offender's process regarding fines, appeals and payments as follows:

1. **Fine Creation** (Initial Event)
   - A fine is created.
   
2. **Send Fine**
   - After the initial creation of the fine, it gets sent to the offender.

3. **Insert Fine Notification**
   - The offender receives a notification about the fine which serves as an alert for future actions such as payment or appeal.

4. **Payment (Initial Attempt)**
   - Some offenders choose to pay immediately after receiving the notification.
   
5. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture** (If initial Payment fails)
   - For those who wish to contest the fine, they insert a date when they will formally submit an appeal to the prefecture.

6. **Send Appeal to Prefecture**
   - The offender then sends their formal appeal to the prefecture.
   
7. **Add Penalty**
   - After receiving and processing the notification or initial payment attempts (or non-payment), penalties are added for non-compliance, delay in payment, etc.

8. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture** 
   - Offenders receive a response regarding their appeal after it is processed by the prefecture.
   
9. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender**
   - The result of the appeal is communicated back to the offender.

10. **Payment (After Processing)**
    - If the appeal is denied or not filed in time, offenders may then pay with increased penalties.

11. **Appeal to Judge** 
    - In cases where they are dissatisfied with the prefecture's decision, they may appeal to a judge.
    
12. **Send for Credit Collection**
    - When all else fails and if non-payment continues, steps such as sending to credit collection agencies can be initiated.

This profile illustrates that there are multiple pathways an offender might follow from receiving their fine notification until final resolution (either payment or complete legal process). Each step involves potential delays and actions by both the offenders and the regulatory body overseeing fines. The performance numbers suggest varying times for each phase depending on whether payments occur early, appeals are made, and how these processes play out through judicial systems.

Understanding such a profile helps in optimizing administrative processes, reducing processing time and penalties involved in non-compliance with regulations or law violations.
