1. Which cases take significantly longer?

Case ID – Total calendar throughput time  
2001 – 1 h 30 m  
2002 – 1 d 02 h ( 26 h)  
2003 – 2 d 00 h 20 m ( 48 h)  
2004 – 1 h 25 m  
2005 – 3 d 05 h 05 m ( 77 h)

 Cases 2002, 2003 and 2005 are the obvious slow-runners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What do the attributes tell us?

2.1 Complexity
• Low-complexity claims (2001, 2004) finish in < 2 h.  
• Medium complexity (2002) already multiplies the lead time (~ 17×).  
• High complexity (2003, 2005) multiplies it still further; the number of “Request Additional Documents” events grows with complexity.

        Complexity   Avg. # “Request Docs”       Avg. duration
        Low                     0                   1.4 h
        Medium                  1                   26 h
        High                 2–3               48–77 h

 Repeated document requests are the biggest direct driver of long duration and they occur almost exclusively in medium/high-complexity cases.

2.2 Region
Region A: one low (fast) and one high (slow) case  
Region B: one low (fast), one medium (slow), one high (slow)  
 Region alone does NOT explain the delays.

2.3 Resource
Adjusters  
• Adjuster_Mike handles one low (fast) and one high (slow) claim  not conclusive.  
• Adjuster_Lisa handles low (fast), medium (slow) and high (slow) claims  again complexity, not the person, dominates.

Managers  
• Manager_Ann signs off low/medium cases and all of them are finished as soon as the manager step is reached.  
• Manager_Bill signs off both high-complexity cases and they are delayed before his activity as well as afterwards.  
  Interpretation: Bill is only called for the hardest claims, so the manager label is a symptom of complexity, not its cause.

Finance clerks and CSRs show the same pattern: once the case is ready for them they close it quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Root-cause narrative

A. High or medium complexity  missing information  multiple document requests  multi-day wait for the customer to react.  
   • Each extra “Request Additional Documents” adds roughly 24 h of idle time.  

B. No evidence that a specific region or individual resource is slow; the attribute values only correlate with complexity (e.g., Manager_Bill is brought in for high-complexity work).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Recommendations

1. Prevent repeated document requests  
   a. Introduce an up-front completeness check or smart web-form that obliges the customer to attach all mandatory evidence before “Submit Claim” is accepted.  
   b. Provide a dynamic checklist to adjusters so that all missing items are requested in a single interaction.

2. Differentiate the process flow for complexity  
   a. Route high-complexity claims directly to a specialized “Complex Claims Cell” that is staffed with both adjusters and managers able to make holistic decisions, avoiding ping-pong.  
   b. Set a service-level target (e.g.,  48 h from Eval to Approve) and monitor it on a dashboard.

3. Resource-based mitigation  
   a. Cross-train additional managers to handle high-complexity approvals instead of relying exclusively on Manager_Bill.  
   b. Add an “assistant adjuster” role to prepare the documentation package while waiting for the customer, shortening the gap between the last document arrival and approval.

4. Continuous monitoring  
   a. Keep the “# of Request Additional Documents per case” as a leading KPI.  
   b. Trigger an alert if a case receives a second request; escalate or start a proactive customer call.

Implementing the above should remove most idle time introduced by incomplete data, shortening medium-complexity cases to < 1 day and high-complexity cases to roughly the same duration.
