# Description of the Visualization

This figure contains three related components illustrating a **proclet-based workflow system** for medical laboratory processes:

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels

This is the main diagram showing two parallel workflow processes:

### Left Side - "Lab Visit" Process:
- Involves **doctor** and **lab assistant** roles
- Sequence includes: Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  Judge results
- Decision point: "Everything fine" leads to completion, otherwise  "Do tests again"  Receive updated result  Send report

### Right Side - "Lab Test" Process:
- Involves **chemical analyst** role
- Sequence includes: Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test
- Alternative path: Perform test again  Provide updated report

### Communication Channels:
- **Order system**: Connects the two processes (shown with dashed lines)
- **HIS** (Hospital Information System): Another communication channel
- Cardinality notations (1,1 and 1,?) indicate relationship multiplicities

## (b) Class Diagram
A simple UML-style class diagram showing:
- **Lab visit** "requires" **Lab test**
- With cardinality 1..1 to 1..*

## (c) Example of a Performative
A table showing a message example:
| Time | Channel | Sender | Receivers | Action | Content | Scope | Direction |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| 11:00 | Order system | Lab visit - John | Lab test - HGB John | Create | Can you perform a HGB test for John? | Private | OUT |
