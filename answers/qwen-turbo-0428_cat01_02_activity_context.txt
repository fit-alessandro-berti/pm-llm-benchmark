### **Justification of Naming Choices**

1. **`Verify Documents` (Repeated in C001, C003):**  
   - **C001:** The first instance is **Initial Verification**, while the second is a **Post-Submission Recheck** (after the customer uploads missing documents).  
   - **C003:** The first is **Physical Verification** (manual check of ID), and the second is a **Post-Adjustment Recheck** (after internal account corrections).  
   - *Contextual Clues:* The additional context specifies the nature of the verification (e.g., "physical," "post-adjustment") and the stage in the process.

2. **`Call Customer` (Repeated in C002):**  
   - **C002:** The first call is for **Clarifying Discrepancies**, and the second is a **Follow-up to Confirm Adjustments**.  
   - *Contextual Clues:* The purpose of the call differs: initial clarification vs. post-action confirmation.

3. **`Call Customer` (C003):**  
   - Single occurrence, so no renaming needed. The context ("request return") is clear enough.

4. **`Adjust Account` (C002, C003):**  
   - Single occurrence in each case; no renaming required. The context ("internal correction") is specific enough.

### **Key Principles Applied**
- **Contextual Differentiation:** Activity names were modified to reflect the **purpose** (e.g., "Request Missing Docs," "Clarify Discrepancy") or **stage** (e.g., "Post-Submission," "Post-Adjustment").  
- **Clarity Over Repetition:** By adding descriptors, the renamed activities avoid ambiguity while preserving the original intent of the process.  
- **Consistency:** The naming convention uses a standardized structure (e.g., "Call Customer to [Purpose]") to ensure readability across cases.
