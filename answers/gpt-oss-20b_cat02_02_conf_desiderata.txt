We need to analyze the event logs for normative violations and desiderata violations. Provide explanation. Also suggest interpretations or justifications.

We have 3 cases.

Case 1: follows sequence correctly, no normative violation. Desiderata: credit check within 24h? It was at 09:30 same day, fine. Inform applicant within 48h? Decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00 (2h later) fine. Follow-up call optional; not present but not required.

Case 2: Normative violations:


- Risk Assessment before Credit Check violates ordering rule.
- Finalize Documentation after rejection violates rule that no finalization after rejection.
Also missing Inform Applicant before closing? Actually they didn't inform applicant; they did finalize doc then close case. So also missing Inform Applicant step after decision (but maybe not mandatory? It's part of sequence). So normative violation includes skipping Inform Applicant and finalizing doc incorrectly.
Desiderata: Not relevant because already normative violation.

Case3:

Normative compliance? Sequence correct: Application Received -> Credit Check -> Risk Assessment -> Loan Decision -> Inform Applicant -> Finalize Documentation -> Close Case. All steps present in order, no skipping or reversing. No contradictory actions.

Desiderata violations:


- Credit Check >24 hours after application (3 days). Violation of recommended time window.
- Inform Applicant >48 hours after decision (decision at 12:00 on Jan14, inform at 15:00 Jan16 = ~51 hours). Violation of recommended promptness.
- No Follow-up Call before closing case; optional but recommended.
Interpretations/justifications:

Case2 might be due to system error or manual override; risk assessment performed early due to urgent need; credit check delayed due to data retrieval issues; finalization done mistakenly by staff unaware of policy; could be a training issue or miscommunication.

Case3 might be due to backlog, high volume causing delays; credit check delayed because external data source slow; inform applicant delayed due to internal review or scheduling constraints; follow-up call omitted due to resource constraints or oversight.

Also mention that while these are deviations from best practice, they don't violate core process integrity except for case2 which does violate core rules and should be corrected immediately.

Let's craft answer accordingly with bullet points and explanation per case. Use LaTeX for any math if needed but none here maybe we can use some simple formulas like time differences but not necessary. But we can show calculations using LaTeX inline e.g., \(\Delta t = \text{...}\).

Let's produce answer with sections "Normative Violations", "Desiderata Violations", "Interpretations". Use tables maybe summarizing each case status.

Ok produce final answer accordingly.

**1️⃣ Normative‑rule compliance**

| Case | Violating activity / order | Why it breaks the norm |
|------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **1** | – | **No violation** – all steps appear in the mandated order and every required action is performed exactly once. |
| **2** | *Risk Assessment* occurs **before** *Credit Check*.<br>*Finalize Documentation* occurs **after** a *Rejected* decision.<br>*Inform Applicant* is missing entirely.| The process requires <br>• `Credit Check → Risk Assessment`<br>• `Loan Decision → Inform Applicant`<br>• If rejected → *no* documentation finalisation.<br>Thus the sequence is broken twice and an illegal action is taken (`Finalize Documentation` on a rejected file). |
| **3** | – | **No violation** – every step appears in the correct order and no contradictory actions are taken.|

### Summary
- **Cases violating normative rules:** only **Case 2**.
- All other cases respect the hard constraints laid out in Part 1.

## 2️⃣ Desideratum‑level deviations

| Case | Desired timing / activity | Actual timing / status | Deviation type |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **1** | Credit Check ≤ 24 h<br>Inform Applicant ≤ 48 h<br>Follow‑up Call before close | ✔️ Credit Check at 09:30 same day<br>✔️ Inform at 13:00 (< 48 h)<br>No follow‑up call (optional) | None critical – optional follow‑up omitted |
| **2** | Same as above (but already norm‑violated) | N/A – priority is correcting norm breaches first | — |
| **3** | Credit Check ≤ 24 h<br>Inform Applicant ≤ 48 h<br>Follow‑up Call before close | ❌ Credit Check on Jan 14 10:00 → >72 h after application<br>❌ Informing on Jan 16 15:00 → ≈51 h after decision<br>No follow‑up call recorded   | Timing recommendations violated + optional activity omitted |

### Interpretation & possible justifications

#### Case 2  
The most serious issue here is that the workflow was executed out of order:
- The *Risk Assessment* was carried out prematurely—perhaps because an urgent request from a senior manager demanded an early estimate while awaiting credit data.
- The *Credit Check*, though eventually performed, came too late for its intended purpose.
- The staff member who closed the file may have been unaware that a rejected loan must skip documentation finalisation, leading to an accidental “Finalize Documentation” step.
  
These errors likely stem from either:
1. A system glitch that allowed activities outside their permitted windows,
2. Inadequate training on the new process,
3. A manual override without proper checks in place.

Immediate remedial actions should include:
- Re‑training all personnel on the strict ordering rules,
- Adding workflow safeguards (e.g., disabling “Finalize Documentation” until approval status is confirmed),
- Auditing any other cases where similar shortcuts were taken.



#### Case 3  
All hard rules are respected here, so there’s no immediate risk of incorrect decisions being made downstream—but efficiency suffers:
- The three‑day lag between application receipt and credit check suggests either a backlog in external data feeds or internal bottlenecks (e.g., limited staffing during weekends).
- The ~51‑hour delay between loan decision and informing the applicant may reflect scheduling conflicts for communication teams or additional internal reviews triggered by unusual risk factors.
  
Possible explanations:
1. High workload during early January caused processing delays;
2. External credit bureau response times were slower than usual;
3. Internal policy may allow extended windows when certain high-risk criteria are flagged—though this would need explicit documentation elsewhere in governance documents.

To mitigate such delays without compromising quality:
– Implement automated reminders for pending activities,
– Allocate dedicated “follow‑up” resources during peak periods,
– Review whether extended windows can be formally justified under exceptional circumstances.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

1️⃣ Only **Case 2** breaches hard process constraints—this must be corrected immediately with retraining and workflow controls added where necessary.\n\n
2️⃣ Cases **1 & 3**, while compliant with core rules, show suboptimal performance relative to best practices:\n   • Case&nbsp;3 exceeds recommended time windows twice.\n   • Both cases omit an optional follow‑up call.\n\n
3️⃣ Suggested next steps:\n   - Enforce ordering checks via system logic.\n   - Add audit trails highlighting missed desiderata so managers can target training.\n   - Consider formalising acceptable exceptions for timing delays if business needs justify them.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you’d like sample audit reports or templates for tracking these metrics!
