To analyze the main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, I'll focus on key aspects such as process complexity, frequency of treatments, and overall treatment times. Here are the main differences I've identified:

1. Complexity of treatment:
   - Unprotected group: Has more complex process variants with multiple treatments and diagnoses. For example, there are variants with up to three rounds of diagnosis and treatment.
   - Protected group: Generally has simpler process variants with fewer steps.

2. Frequency of thorough examinations:
   - Unprotected group: Higher frequency of thorough examinations. The top two most frequent variants include thorough examinations.
   - Protected group: Lower frequency of thorough examinations. They appear less often in the top variants.

3. Expert examinations:
   - Unprotected group: More likely to receive expert examinations. The top variants often include expert examinations.
   - Protected group: Less likely to receive expert examinations. They appear less frequently in the top variants.

4. Treatment success rate:
   - Unprotected group: More variants explicitly mentioning "Treatment successful" in high-frequency processes.
   - Protected group: Fewer explicit mentions of "Treatment successful" in high-frequency processes.

5. Emergency Room (ER) vs. Front Desk (FD) registration:
   - Unprotected group: More balanced distribution between ER and FD registrations in top variants.
   - Protected group: Slight preference for ER registrations in top variants.

6. Treatment time:
   - Unprotected group: Generally longer treatment times, with more complex variants having performance times up to 639,982 time units.
   - Protected group: Generally shorter treatment times, with the longest variant at 480,019 time units.

7. Discharge patterns:
   - Unprotected group: Has a high-frequency "Discharge" variant without other steps, suggesting some patients may be discharged without treatment.
   - Protected group: No standalone "Discharge" variant, suggesting all patients go through some form of examination or treatment.

8. Unsuccessful treatments:
   - Unprotected group: More variants explicitly mentioning unsuccessful treatments followed by additional diagnosis and treatment.
   - Protected group: Fewer mentions of unsuccessful treatments in the process variants.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group generally receives more thorough and complex treatment processes, but also experiences more instances of unsuccessful treatments requiring additional care. The protected group seems to have simpler, shorter treatment processes, which could indicate either more efficient care or potentially less comprehensive treatment.

It's important to note that these observations are based on the process variants provided and would require further investigation to determine if these differences represent unfair treatment or are justified by medical necessity.
