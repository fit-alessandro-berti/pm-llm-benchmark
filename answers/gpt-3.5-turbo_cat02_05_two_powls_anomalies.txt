**Analysis and Identification of Anomalies:**

**POWL Model 1 Anomalies:**
1. In Model 1, the activity of conducting interviews (`Conduct_Interviews`) is placed after making the hiring decision (`Make_Hiring_Decision`). This is counterintuitive as typically, interviews are conducted before the final hiring decision is made. This deviation could lead to confusion and inefficiencies in the hiring process.
2. There is no direct link between the activities of screening candidates and conducting interviews. In a standard process, screening candidates would logically lead to conducting interviews. This missing link could result in a disjointed hiring process, potentially overlooking qualified candidates.
3. The onboarding of the new employee (`Onboard_Employee`) precedes adding the employee to the payroll system (`Add_to_Payroll`). While onboarding is an essential step before a new employee starts working, adding them to the payroll system should ideally be completed before or concurrently with onboarding to ensure timely payment.

**POWL Model 2 Anomalies:**
1. Model 2 introduces a loop structure for the onboarding activity (`Onboard_Employee`). Looping on the onboarding process implies that the employee might undergo onboarding multiple times, which is not standard practice in a Hire-to-Retire process. This anomaly could lead to confusion, wasted resources, and delays in the employee's full integration into the organization.
2. The use of an exclusive choice (XOR) operator for adding the employee to the payroll system introduces the possibility of skipping this crucial step. Payroll is an essential component of the hiring process, and skipping it could have severe financial and legal implications. This anomaly poses a significant risk to the integrity of the process.

**Justification:**
Between the two models, **POWL Model 1** aligns more closely with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. Despite its anomalies, Model 1 maintains a more logical flow of activities compared to Model 2. The deviations in Model 1, such as the order of conducting interviews and the missing link between screening and interviews, are less severe and can be rectified with minor adjustments to the process. On the other hand, Model 2's anomalies involving looping on onboarding and the potential skipping of payroll activities fundamentally undermine the integrity and efficiency of the hiring process. 

In summary, Model 1's anomalies, though suboptimal, are more manageable and align better with the standard logic of hiring new employees. Model 2's anomalies present more critical issues that could lead to significant operational and compliance challenges if implemented in a real-world scenario.
