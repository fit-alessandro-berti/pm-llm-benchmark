Based on the provided attributes, the following can be identified as sensitive attributes for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether an individual is a citizen or not, which can be a protected characteristic in many fairness contexts, such as loan approval or credit scoring.

2. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual, which is a protected characteristic in many fairness contexts.

3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether an individual speaks German or not. While language proficiency is not always a protected characteristic, it can be relevant in certain contexts, such as employment or education, where equal opportunities are expected.

These attributes can be used to analyze potential biases in the process, such as:

* Are citizens more likely to receive a loan than non-citizens?
* Are individuals of a certain gender more likely to experience delays or rejections in the loan application process?
* Are individuals who speak German more likely to have their loan applications approved than those who do not?

By analyzing these sensitive attributes, you can identify potential biases and take steps to mitigate them and ensure fairness in the process.
