After reviewing the attributes, I've identified the following three attributes as sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether a case (individual) is a citizen or not. Citizenship can be a protected characteristic, and decisions made based on this attribute could potentially lead to unfair treatment or bias against non-citizens.
2. `case:gender`: This attribute specifies the gender of the individual, which is another protected characteristic. Ensuring fairness with respect to gender is essential to prevent bias against individuals based on their gender.
3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether a case (individual) speaks German. While language proficiency might be a relevant factor in certain contexts, it can also be a proxy for nationality, ethnicity, or cultural background. As such, it's essential to monitor fairness with respect to this attribute to avoid any potential biases.

To ensure fairness in your process, you may want to examine the following:

* How do the frequencies and performance metrics differ across these sensitive attributes?
* Are there any significant disparities in the treatment or outcomes for individuals with different values for these attributes?
* Are there any correlations between these sensitive attributes and other attributes or process outcomes that could indicate potential biases?

By investigating these questions, you can better understand potential fairness issues in your process and take steps to mitigate them.
