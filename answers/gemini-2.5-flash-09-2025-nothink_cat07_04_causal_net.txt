This visualization presents a process model, likely a workflow or business process, represented as a directed graph, along with a legend explaining the types of routing constructs used.

**Main Process Model:**

The process flows from a starting point, activity **(a) register request**, through several intermediate activities, and concludes at **(z) end**. Activities are represented by rounded rectangles with a letter identifier and a descriptive label.

*   **Start:** **(a) register request**.
*   **Initial Split from (a):** Activity (a) splits into three potential subsequent activities:
    *   **(b) examine thoroughly**
    *   **(c) examine casually**
    *   **(d) check ticket**
    The visual representation around (a) suggests an **OR-split** or **XOR-split** due to the curved connections between the outgoing edges near the activity box, indicating a choice or conditional execution among the three paths.
*   **Activity Flow:**
    *   **(b) examine thoroughly** and **(c) examine casually** both flow into **(e) decide**.
    *   **(d) check ticket** can flow back to **(f) reinitiate request** or forward to **(e) decide**. The connections at (d) suggest an **XOR-split** or **OR-split**.
    *   **(f) reinitiate request** flows into **(d) check ticket**, creating a loop. It also flows back to **(c) examine casually** and potentially to **(b) examine thoroughly**. The connections at (f) suggest an **OR-split**.
*   **Join at (e):** Activity **(e) decide** acts as a synchronization or merge point, receiving input from (b), (c), (d), and potentially a path originating from (f) via (c) and (b). The curved connections near the input nodes of (e) suggest an **OR-join** or **XOR-join**.
*   **Split from (e):** Activity (e) splits into two outcomes:
    *   **(g) pay compensation**
    *   **(h) reject request**
    This appears to be an **XOR-split** (only one path is taken).
*   **End:** Both (g) and (h) flow into the final activity **(z) end**. This appears to be an **XOR-join** or **OR-join**.

**Legend (Bottom Right):**

A separate boxed section provides a legend defining six common workflow patterns, illustrating how transitions (edges and nodes) indicate logic for splitting and joining paths:

1.  **XOR-split:** One incoming path leads to a choice of exactly one outgoing path.
2.  **AND-split:** One incoming path leads to the simultaneous execution of all outgoing paths (parallelism).
3.  **OR-split:** One incoming path leads to the selection of one or more of the outgoing paths.
4.  **XOR-join:** Multiple incoming paths merge, and the first arriving token triggers the activity.
5.  **AND-join:** Multiple incoming paths merge, and the activity is triggered only when a token has arrived from all required incoming paths (synchronization).
6.  **OR-join:** Multiple incoming paths merge, where the logic allows for synchronization if multiple paths are active, or a simple merge if only one path is active.

The process model uses the specific notation shown in the legend, particularly the small black circles and curved lines, to denote these routing constructs at the input and output points of the activities.
