  - **Yes**  Get 3 offers  Select logistic company
  - **No**  Check if insurance is required (using *Customer Information* data store + *Order Details*)
    - **Inclusive Gateway** branches:
      - *Always*  Write package label
      - *If insurance necessary*  **Insure parcel** (Logistics lane)

**3. Path B – Warehouse Lane**
- **"Package goods"** with a **48-hour timer**
  - If delayed  **Notify customer about delay**
  - Rejoins via intermediate event

**4. Synchronization**

-  **Fill out Shipment Paperwork**
-  **Move package to pickup area**
-  **"Shipment prepared"** (End Event)
