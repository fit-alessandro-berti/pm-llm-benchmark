The diagram presents the flow of a process involving different states and actions for a user, likely related to an online platform or service. It starts with the 'user' initiating a 'register request,' followed by reaching a decision point that differentiates between 'casualty' and 'thoroughly' examined cases. For the 'casualty' path, the diagram leads directly to 'reject,' which loops back to the start. For the 'thoroughly' examined path, it moves to 'check ticket' and then to another decision point. From there, it can either 'reject request' and loop back or proceed to 'pay compensation' and finally reach the 'end.' Additionally, there's a 'renounce request' option that can lead directly to 'end.' The diamond-shaped symbols represent decision points, while the rectangular ones indicate actions. The overall concept seems to depict the decision-making process and pathways users might encounter during a registration or request handling process, emphasizing different outcomes based on thorough examination or rejection.
