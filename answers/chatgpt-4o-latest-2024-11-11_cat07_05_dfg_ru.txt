This visualization represents a process model in a Petri net or a Business Process Model (BPM) style using nodes and directed edges to illustrate sequential flow, decision points, and actions in a process. Below is the description of the elements and flow:

### **Nodes (Activities):**
1. **Circular Nodes**: Represent the start and end points of the process.
   - A black-filled circle marks the starting point.
   - A black-filled square marks the end point.
2. **Rectangular Nodes**: Represent activities or steps in the process.
   - "register request (6)"
   - "check ticket (9)"
   - "decide (9)"
   - "examine thoroughly (3)"
   - "examine casually (6)"
   - "reject request (3)"
   - "pay compensation (3)"
   - "reinitiate request (3)"
   - The numbers in parentheses indicate the frequency or magnitude of occurrences for each activity.

### **Directed Edges (Arrows):**
- Show the flow and transitions between activities or nodes.
- Numbers above arrows indicate the frequency of occurrence for transitions.

### **Process Flow:**
1. The process starts at the **black circle** (start node).
2. The process moves to the **"register request"** activity (frequency = 6).
3. Next is the **"check ticket"** activity (frequency = 9), which branches into several options:
   - Back to **"register request"** (frequency = 6).
   - To **"decide"** (frequency = 9).
4. After the **"decide"** activity, there are multiple potential outcomes:
   - **"examine thoroughly”** (frequency = 3).
   - **"examine casually"** (frequency = 6).
   - **"reject request"** (frequency = 3) and exit.
   - **"pay compensation"** (frequency = 3) and exit.
   - **"reinitiate request"** (frequency = 3).
5. From **"examine thoroughly"** or **"examine casually"**, the process may return to earlier steps like "check ticket.”

### **Ending the Process:**
- The process ends at the **black square**, reached via outcomes like "reject request" or "pay compensation."

This model captures variations and repetitions within the process lifecycle, emphasizing decision points and reconnecting loops.
