**Reasoning:**

1. **Matching and Merging:**
   - I aligned events based on "Order ID" and a 2-second timestamp tolerance for slight discrepancies. 
   - For each matched pair (e.g., "Order Received"), I selected the timestamp from the log with the earlier time stamp as the primary, combining attributes where applicable.

2. **Handling Missing Events:**
   - Events present in one log but not the other were included as separate entries, indicating their origin ("Log A" or "Log B").

3. **Timestamp Selection:**

   - Slight timestamp differences (e.g., 10:02:05Z vs 10:02:00Z) were resolved by prioritizing primary timestamps from Log A for consistency.
4. **Event Name Variations:**
   - I used the closest event name match in both logs, making minor adjustments if necessary (e.g., "OrderValidation" to "Order Validation").

5. **Attribute Integration:**

   - For merged events, I combined relevant attributes from both logs, providing a comprehensive view of each activity.

**Conflicts and Tolerances:** 

- A small timestamp tolerance was applied to account for potential system clocks synchronization issues and slight differences in recording times. Events with significant discrepancies were left separate to maintain accuracy.
