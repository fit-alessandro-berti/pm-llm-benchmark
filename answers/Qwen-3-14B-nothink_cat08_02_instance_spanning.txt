# **Optimization Strategy for E-Commerce Fulfillment Center Using Process Mining**

---

## **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

### **a. Process Mining Techniques for Constraint Identification**

To formally identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we would use **process mining techniques** such as:

- **Event Log Analysis**: Parse the event log to extract timestamps, activities, resources, and order attributes (e.g., Order Type, Destination Region, Resource Requirements).
- **Process Discovery**: Use tools like **Alpha Miner** or **Heuristics Miner** to discover the underlying process model, including the sequence of activities and resource usage.
- **Conformance Checking**: Compare actual process traces against the discovered model to detect deviations or bottlenecks.
- **Performance Analysis**: Use **discovery of performance metrics** (e.g., cycle time, waiting time, throughput) using **Process Mining tools like ProM or Disco**.

### **b. Metrics to Measure Impact of Constraints**

#### **1. Shared Cold-Packing Stations**
- **Metric**: **Average waiting time for cold-packing resource**.
- **Calculation**: For each order requiring cold-packing, measure the time between the **start of the Packing activity** and the **actual assignment of a cold-packing station**.
- **Differentiation**: Compare with the **duration of the Packing activity** to distinguish between **within-instance** (activity duration) and **between-instance** (resource contention) delays.

#### **2. Batched Shipping**
- **Metric**: **Average waiting time due to batch completion**.
- **Calculation**: For each order, calculate the time between **Completion of Shipping Label Generation** and the **actual shipping dispatch**. This should be compared to the time it takes to form a batch.
- **Differentiation**: Use **batch size and regional distribution** from the event log to identify whether delays are due to **batching logic** or **within-instance** processing.

#### **3. Priority Handling (Express Orders)**
- **Metric**: **Average delay caused to standard orders by express orders**.
- **Calculation**: For standard orders, measure the time between **start of Packing** and **actual completion of Packing**, and identify if this was interrupted or delayed by an **express order** using the same resource.
- **Differentiation**: Use **resource allocation logs** to determine whether the delay was due to **priority interruption** or **resource unavailability**.

#### **4. Hazardous Material Limits**
- **Metric**: **Throughput reduction due to hazardous material limits**.
- **Calculation**: Measure the number of hazardous orders that had to be **queued** or **delayed** due to the 10-order limit during Packing or Quality Check.
- **Differentiation**: Use **resource capacity logs** and **order attributes** to distinguish between **within-instance** delays (e.g., QC duration) and **between-instance** (regulatory) delays.

## **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

### **a. Interactions Between Constraints**

#### **1. Cold-Packing & Priority Handling**
- **Interaction**: Express orders requiring cold-packing may **interrupt** or **delay** standard orders that are also waiting for cold-packing stations.
- **Impact**: This could lead to **longer queues** for cold-packing and **increased waiting times** for standard orders, especially during peak hours.

#### **2. Batched Shipping & Hazardous Materials**
- **Interaction**: If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the **same region**, they may be **batched together**, but the **regulatory limit** of 10 hazardous orders in Packing or QC could **limit batch size** or **force smaller batches**.
- **Impact**: This may lead to **increased batch waiting times** or **reduced batch efficiency**.

#### **3. Priority Handling & Resource Contention**
- **Interaction**: Express orders may **pause** standard orders that are using the same **QC staff** or **packing station**, leading to **resource contention** and **increased delays** for standard orders.
- **Impact**: This could create **priority bias** and **reduce overall throughput** if not managed carefully.

### **b. Importance of Understanding Interactions**

Understanding these interactions is **crucial** for developing **constraint-aware optimization strategies**. For example:

- Without considering the **cold-packing and express order interaction**, a policy that prioritizes express orders might **worsen** the cold-packing queue for standard orders.
- Similarly, **batching logic** must be **aware of hazardous material limits** to avoid **overloading** the QC or Packing areas.

## **3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**

- **Constraint Addressed**: **Shared Cold-Packing Stations**
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Implement a **dynamic priority-based resource allocation system** for cold-packing stations.
  - Use **real-time data from the event log** to prioritize express orders that require cold-packing.
  - Allow **express orders** to **pre-allocate** cold-packing stations if their arrival time is known in advance (e.g., from order prediction models).
- **Leverage of Data**:
  - Use **historical data** to predict the **demand for cold-packing stations** during peak times.
  - Use **machine learning models** to **predict express order arrival times** and **resource contention**.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - **Reduced waiting time** for express orders.
  - **Improved cold-packing station utilization**.
  - **Minimized delays** for standard orders through **fair allocation**.

### **Strategy 2: Adaptive Batching with Hazardous Material Constraints**

- **Constraint Addressed**: **Batching for Shipping & Hazardous Material Limits**
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Develop a **dynamic batching algorithm** that:
    - **Groups orders by region**, as before.
    - **Checks the number of hazardous orders** in the batch and **limits the batch size** to **avoid exceeding the 10-order limit** in Packing or QC.
    - **Creates smaller batches** if necessary, or **splits batches** across time if hazardous orders are too numerous.
- **Leverage of Data**:
  - Use **regional order distribution** and **hazardous order frequency** from the event log to **optimize batch size and timing**.
  - Use **predictive analytics** to **forecast hazardous order volume** and **adjust batching dynamically**.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - **Improved delivery route optimization** without violating regulatory limits.
  - **Reduced waiting time** due to **batch completion**.
  - **Increased throughput** by **avoiding QC/Packing bottlenecks**.

### **Strategy 3: Priority-Dependent Scheduling with Regulatory Compliance**

- **Constraint Addressed**: **Priority Handling & Hazardous Material Limits**
- **Proposed Change**:
  - Implement a **priority-aware scheduling engine** that:
    - **Reserves QC and Packing resources** for express orders when available.
    - **Monitors the number of hazardous orders** in QC and Packing to **ensure compliance**.
    - **Routes hazardous orders** to **less congested times** or **dedicated lanes** if possible.
- **Leverage of Data**:
  - Use **resource utilization logs** and **order attributes** to **predict resource availability**.
  - Use **machine learning** to **predict QC/Packing load** and **schedule express orders accordingly**.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - **Faster processing of express orders** without violating regulatory limits.
  - **Better compliance** with hazardous material handling.
  - **Improved overall throughput** and **reduced delivery delays**.

## **4. Simulation and Validation**

### **a. Simulation Approach**

Before implementing any changes, a **discrete-event simulation (DES)** model should be built using the event log data. The model should include:

- **Resource constraints** (cold-packing stations, QC staff, packing stations).
- **Order attributes** (express, hazardous, region).
- **Batching logic** and **priority rules**.
- **Regulatory limits** on hazardous orders.

### **b. Key Aspects to Model**

- **Resource contention**: Simulate how **express orders** affect the **cold-packing queue** and **QC stations**.
- **Batching delays**: Model how **batch size and regional grouping** affect **shipping label generation delays**.
- **Hazardous material limits**: Ensure the model **respects the 10-order limit** in Packing and QC.
- **Priority interruptions**: Simulate how **express orders** can **pause standard orders** and **affect overall flow**.

### **c. Evaluation of Strategies in Simulation**

- Run the simulation with and without each proposed strategy.
- Compare **KPIs** such as:
  - **Average end-to-end time** per order.
  - **Throughput per hour**.
  - **Average waiting time per activity**.
  - **Resource utilization**.
- Use **sensitivity analysis** to test the impact of different parameters (e.g., number of cold-packing stations, batch size thresholds).

## **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**

### **a. Key Metrics for Monitoring**

- **Cold-Packing Station Utilization & Queue Length**.
- **Average Waiting Time for Cold-Packing**.
- **Batch Formation Time & Size**.
- **Hazardous Order Throughput**.
- **QC and Packing Throughput**.
- **Number of Express Orders Delaying Standard Orders**.
- **Resource Contention Rate** (e.g., how often a resource is paused due to priority).
- **Compliance with Hazardous Material Limits**.

### **b. Process Mining Dashboards**

- **Activity Duration vs. Waiting Time** (to distinguish within vs. between-instance delays).
- **Resource Utilization Heatmaps** (for cold-packing, QC, packing).
- **Batching KPIs** (batch size, batch formation time, regional distribution).
- **Priority Handling Impact** (how many standard orders were delayed by express orders).
- **Hazardous Order Compliance** (number of hazardous orders processed simultaneously vs. the 10-limit).

### **c. Tracking Constraint Management Effectiveness**

- **Queue Length for Cold-Packing Stations**: If reduced, it indicates **better resource allocation**.
- **Batch Formation Time**: If reduced, it indicates **more efficient batching logic**.
- **Hazardous Order Throughput**: If increased, it indicates **better compliance and process flow**.
- **Priority Interruption Rate**: If reduced, it indicates **more balanced resource scheduling**.
