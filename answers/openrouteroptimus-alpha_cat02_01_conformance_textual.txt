Let's analyze each case in light of the **normative process description**.

### **Summary of Normative Rules:**
- **Happy Path:**  
  *Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order*
- **Insufficient inventory:**  
  *Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order*
- **Constraints:**
    - "Receive order" must be first.
    - "Check inventory" must be next.
    - "Authorize payment" occurs **after** "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items".
    - "Package items" occurs **after** "Authorize payment" and **before** "Ship order."
    - "Ship order" only after packaging, **never after cancellation**.
    - "Cancel order" only possible after "Check inventory", and **must** skip all fulfillment activities (package/ship).
    - "Close order" must be last.

### **Case-by-Case Analysis:**

#### **Case 1**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |

| 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

- **Analysis:** 
  - Sequence matches the happy path exactly.
  - No violations.

#### **Case 2**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

- **Analysis:** 
  - "Package items" **occurs before** "Authorize payment".
  - Rule: **"Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order"**.
- **Violation(s):**
  - **Out-of-order:** Packaging is done **before** payment is authorized.
- **Explanation:**  
  - This violates the constraint that payment must be authorized before items are packaged (**from description: "Packaging should only occur after authorization and before shipping..."**).
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Violation:** Yes (packaging before payment authorization).

#### **Case 3**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

- **Analysis:**
  - After "Authorize payment", process branches to "Cancel order" (suggests insufficient inventory).
  - **Then**, the case proceeds to "Ship order".
  - Rule: **Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)...**
- **Violation(s):**
  - **Shipment after cancellation:** Fulfillment (shipping) occurs **after** cancellation.
- **Explanation:**  
  - This sequence is explicitly disallowed: "Ship order" **never** comes after "Cancel order".
  - Additionally, payment should not be authorized if inventory is insufficient (should skip directly to cancellation).
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Violation:** Yes (shipping after cancellation; inappropriate payment authorization).

#### **Case 4**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

- **Analysis:**
  - Follows the prescribed cancellation path *exactly*: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
- **Violation(s):**  
  - None.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Violation:** No.

#### **Case 5**
| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

- **Analysis:**
  - Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".
  - Rule: **"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped."**
- **Violation(s):**
  - **Skipping required step:** There is no packaging before shipping.
- **Explanation:**  
  - According to the rules, you cannot ship un-packaged items; "Package items" is required before "Ship order".
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Violation:** Yes (missing "Package items" before shipping).

## **Final List of Deviating Cases and Reasons**

**Cases that violate the normative process:**
- **Case 2:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". This violates the rule that items must be packaged only after payment authorization.
- **Case 3:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order". This violates the rule that no fulfillment activities (such as shipping) are allowed after cancellation. Additionally, "Authorize payment" should not occur if inventory is insufficient.
- **Case 5:** "Package items" is missing before "Ship order". This violates the rule that items must be packaged before shipping.

## **Direct Answers**

### **1. Which cases violate the normative process?**
- **Cases:** **2, 3, and 5**

### **2. Explanation of violations:**

- **Case 2:**
