Based on the provided directly follows graph and the corresponding frequencies and durations, some potential root causes for performance issues in the process are:

1. Long duration for "Pick Up Empty Container" and "Place in Stock" activities for the Container object type. These activities have durations of 368943.92 and 743380.51 seconds, respectively. Reducing the time taken for these activities could help improve overall process performance.
2. Frequent rescheduling of containers, as indicated by the high frequency of "Reschedule Container" events for the Container and Vehicle object types. Rescheduling activities can lead to delays and inefficiencies in the process. Investigating the reasons for these rescheduling events and addressing them could help improve performance.
3. High frequency of "Load Truck" events for the Truck object type, with relatively short durations. This suggests that the trucks may be spending a lot of time loading and unloading goods, which could be a bottleneck in the process. Optimizing the loading and unloading process could help improve truck utilization and reduce delays.
4. Long duration for "Book Vehicles" activity for the Vehicle object type. This activity has a duration of 295965.56 seconds, which is significantly longer than the durations of other activities for this object type. Investigating the reasons for this long duration and finding ways to reduce it could help improve overall process performance.
