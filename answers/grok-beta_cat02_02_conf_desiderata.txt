**1. Identification of Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case ID 2:**
  - **Violation:** The sequence of activities was not followed correctly. The "Risk Assessment" was performed before the "Credit Check." This directly violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.
  - **Explanation:** Performing the risk assessment without a credit check is a fundamental flaw in the process, as the risk assessment should be based on the creditworthiness of the applicant, which is determined by the credit check. This could lead to incorrect risk evaluation and potentially flawed loan decisions.

  - **Violation:** "Finalize Documentation" was executed after a loan rejection, which is not allowed according to the normative rules.
  - **Explanation:** Finalizing documentation after a rejection is unnecessary and goes against the process's logic, leading to unnecessary work and potential confusion or errors in the case management.

**2. Identification of Desiderata Violations:**

- **Case ID 1:**
  - **Deviation:** There is no violation of the strict rules, but the case follows the process perfectly within the recommended time frames.

- **Case ID 2:**
  - **Deviation:** While there's a clear violation of normative rules, the timing of the activities seems to have been done promptly, within the recommended time frames for informing the applicant and other actions.

- **Case ID 3:**
  - **Deviation:** The Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received, violating the desideratum for quick credit checks.
    - **Explanation:** This delay could lead to applicants waiting longer for a decision, possibly causing dissatisfaction or inconvenience, although it's not strictly against the rules.
  - **Deviation:** The applicant was informed of the decision more than 48 hours after the loan decision was made.
    - **Explanation:** This delay in informing the applicant might cause them to feel neglected or out of the loop, potentially impacting their trust in the lending institution.
  - **Deviation:** No Follow-up Call was made before closing the case.
    - **Explanation:** While not strictly required, the lack of follow-up can miss an opportunity for ensuring clarity and satisfaction from the applicant's side, especially after a loan approval.

**3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors:**

- **Case ID 2:** The observed behavior could be due to:
  - **Error in Process Execution:** Someone might have forgotten the correct sequence or there was a misunderstanding of the process.
  - **Systemic Issue:** Perhaps there was a glitch or misconfiguration in the workflow management system leading to out-of-order execution.
  - **Pressure or Rush:** The loan officer might have been under pressure to speed up the process, leading to cutting corners or mistakes.

- **Case ID 3:** The deviations might be explained by:
  - **Workload:** The credit check and subsequent actions might have been delayed due to a high volume of applications or staff shortages, leading to backlogs.
  - **Process Improvement:** The organization might be testing or implementing changes to their process, leading to deviations from the recommended practices.
  - **Operational Oversight:** The lack of a follow-up call could simply be an oversight or a deliberate choice to reduce operational costs or time, although this goes against best practices for customer relations.

**Suggestions:**
- **Training:** Ensure all staff are thoroughly trained on the correct sequence of the loan application process to avoid normative rule violations.
- **Automated Workflow:** Implement or refine automated systems that enforce the correct sequence of steps to prevent out-of-order activities.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring systems to alert when activities are not performed within the recommended time frames or when key steps like follow-up calls are missed.
- **Process Review:** Regularly review the process to ensure it aligns with both strict rules and recommended practices, making adjustments as necessary to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.
