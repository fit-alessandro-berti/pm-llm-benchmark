To determine which attributes are sensitive for fairness, we need to consider the potential for these attributes to introduce bias or unfair treatment based on certain personal characteristics. Here's an analysis of the provided attributes:

### Attributes and Their Potential Sensitivity:

1. **case:citizen**:
   - This attribute distinguishes between citizens and non-citizens.
   - **Sensitivity**: Potentially sensitive as it may introduce bias in processes that involve immigration status, citizenship rights, or government benefits.

2. **case:gender**:
   - This attribute categorizes individuals based on gender.
   - **Sensitivity**: High sensitivity, as gender-related biases particularly in rental processes, job applications, and more can lead to unfair treatment.

3. **case:german speaking**:
   - This attribute indicates whether individuals speak German.
   - **Sensitivity**: May be sensitive in communities where language proficiency impacts access to services. However, the label is relatively benign compared to race or gender.

4. **case:married**:
   - This attribute indicates marital status.
   - **Sensitivity**: Potentially sensitive, especially in rental processes, where marital status may influence eligibility or terms of the lease.

5. **activity**:
   - This attribute describes the activities performed.
   - **Sensitivity**: Not typically sensitive on its own but could be relevant if certain activities affect opportunities or rights.

6. **resource**:
   - This attribute identifies the person or entity involved in the process.
   - **Sensitivity**: Potentially sensitive if the resource identities involve protected characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, etc.

7. **start_timestamp** and **time**: 
   - These attributes record the start and duration times.
   - **Sensitivity**: Not directly sensitive, but indirectly could be if there are systemic biases in how time is managed.

8. **time:timestamp**:
   - This attribute is essentially the same as `start_timestamp` and `time`.
   - **Sensitivity**: Not directly sensitive, but could be if there are biases in recording and managing times.

### Summary:
- **High Sensitivity**: `case:gender`, `case:citizen`, `case:married`.
- **Medium Sensitivity**: `case:german speaking`, `resource`.
- **Low Sensitivity or Not Sensitive**: `activity`, `start_timestamp`, `time:timestamp`.

### Recommendations:
- **Monitor and Audit**: Monitor processes to ensure these sensitive attributes are not used in a discriminatory manner.
- **Anonymize**: Where possible, anonymize these attributes to protect against bias.
- **Training and Policies**: Implement training and policies to address and mitigate bias.

By focusing on these attributes, you can help ensure that the process is fair and unbiased.
