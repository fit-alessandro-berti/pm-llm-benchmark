Reading:  
1. Always start with Receive Application.  
2. Then Validate Form.  
3. Exclusive choice (XOR):  
   a. Straight-forward path: Assess Eligibility  Approval Decision  Send Confirmation  Archive Case.  
   b. Loop: as long as missing information is requested, iterate (AE  RMI) and re-validate (VF) after every iteration; when the loop is exited the straight-forward path is taken.
