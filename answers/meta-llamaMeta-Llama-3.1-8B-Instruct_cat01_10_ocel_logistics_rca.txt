To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, I'll analyze the data and identify potential bottlenecks. Here's my analysis:

**Highest frequency events**

The events with the highest frequency are:

1. "pick item" (5290) - items
2. "confirm order" (3528) - orders
3. "place order" (1915) - orders
4. "reorder item" (1078) - items
5. "pay order" (1236) - orders

These events are all related to core business activities, but they might be causing performance issues if they are consuming too many resources or taking too long to complete.

**Longest durations**

The events with the longest durations are:

1. "package delivered" -> "pay order" (duration: 452919.25) - items
	* This event has a long duration, which might indicate that the payment process is taking too long.
2. "package delivered" -> "payment reminder" (duration: 1127921.43) - items
	* This event has an extremely long duration, which might indicate that the payment reminder process is not optimized or is causing unnecessary delays.
3. "confirm order" -> "pay order" (duration: 528039.95) - orders
	* This event has a long duration, which might indicate that the payment process is taking too long.
4. "reorder item" -> "pick item" (duration: 564359.01) - items
	* This event has a long duration, which might indicate that the reordering process is taking too long.

**High frequency loops**

The events with high frequency loops are:

1. "pick item" -> "pick item" (frequency: 4545, objects: 7) - employees
2. "confirm order" -> "confirm order" (frequency: 1995, objects: 5) - employees
3. "pick item" -> "create package" (frequency: 5290, objects: 5290) - items
4. "create package" -> "send package" (frequency: 1122, objects: 7100) - packages

These loops might indicate that certain activities are being performed excessively or inefficiently, causing performance issues.

**Bottlenecks**

Based on the analysis, potential bottlenecks in the process are:

1. Payment process (events: "package delivered" -> "pay order",
