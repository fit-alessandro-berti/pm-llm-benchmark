1. Cases that deviate from the normative process  
   • Case 2  
   • Case 3  
   • Case 5  

2. Explanation of the violations  

Rule set distilled from the textual description  
A. The process always starts with “Receive order.”  
B. “Check inventory” must occur before anything else.  
C. Exactly two mutually-exclusive branches follow the inventory check.  
   Fulfilment branch (stock available):  
     Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
   Cancellation branch (stock unavailable):  
     Check  Cancel order  Close order  
D. Activity ordering constraints (always applicable):  
   1. Authorize payment may occur only after Check inventory and before Package items.  
   2. Package items may occur only after Authorize payment and before Ship order.  
   3. Ship order may occur only after Package items and must never occur after a Cancel order.  
   4. Close order must be the last activity; nothing may follow it.  

Case-by-case analysis  

Case 1  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
Conforms to the fulfilment branch. No violation.

Case 2  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: Package items is executed before Authorize payment, breaking Rule D-2 (“Package items should only occur after authorization”). Everything that follows is therefore out of sequence for the fulfilment branch.

Case 3  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
Two violations:  
1. After inventory is checked the case enters the cancellation branch, but Authorize payment appears beforehand. Per Rule C, payment should not be authorised in a cancellation scenario.  
2. Ship order occurs after a Cancel order, directly violating Rule D-3 (“Ship order should never occur after a cancellation”).  

Case 4  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
Matches the cancellation branch exactly. No violation.

Case 5  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: Package items is missing. Ship order is executed without prior packaging, violating Rule D-2 and Rule D-3 (“Ship order should only occur after Package items”).  

Summary  
• Case 2 breaks the ordering of Authorize payment and Package items.  
• Case 3 mixes the fulfilment and cancellation paths and ships after cancellation.  
• Case 5 skips the mandatory Package items step before shipping.  
Cases 1 and 4 follow the normative process correctly.
