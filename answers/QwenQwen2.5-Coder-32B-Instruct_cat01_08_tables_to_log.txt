To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we will integrate the data from the provided tables based on the instructions given. Our final event log will include the following columns: **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, **Timestamp**, **Resource/Actor**, and potentially other attributes.

Here’s the final event log structured in Markdown format:

```markdown
| Case ID | Activity Name            | Timestamp                | Resource/Actor  | Other Attributes                                 |

### Explanation:
1. **Order Created**: Extracted from `Orders` table, timestamp is `order_date`.
2. **Items Picked**: For each `item_id` under an order, the `item_picking_date` from `Order Lines` table.
3. **Order Dispatched** and **Order Arrived**: Extracted from `Delivery` table, timestamps are `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date`.
4. **Invoice Issued**: Extracted from `Invoice` table, timestamp is `invoice_issue_date`.
5. **Payment Received**: Extracted from `Payments` table, timestamp is `payment_date`.

### Additional Notes:
- Each event is timestamped according to the relevant field in the respective tables.
- The `Resource/Actor` column is populated using the `Resources` table to map IDs to names.
- When multiple picking actions occur, separate events are created.
- The assumption is that each delivery record corresponds to a complete or partial shipment, thus generating both dispatch and arrival events.

This structured event log should provide a comprehensive view of each order’s lifecycle from creation to payment for process mining purposes.
