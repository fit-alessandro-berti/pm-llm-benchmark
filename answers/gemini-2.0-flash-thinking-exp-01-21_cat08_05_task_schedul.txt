## Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc. using Process Mining

Here's a detailed approach to analyze Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling performance and develop advanced data-driven scheduling strategies using process mining, based on the provided MES event logs.

**1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics:**

To understand the *actual* flow of jobs and task execution, we will leverage process mining techniques on the MES event logs.  The core idea is to reconstruct process models and analyze performance metrics directly from the event data.

* **Reconstructing Job Flow and Task Execution:**
    * **Process Discovery:** We will use process discovery algorithms (like the Alpha algorithm, Heuristics Miner, or Directly-Follows Graph - DFG) on the event logs, focusing on the "Case ID (Job ID)" as the case identifier and "Activity/Task" as the activity. This will visually represent the typical sequences of tasks for different jobs, the frequency of each task transition, and common process variations.  We can filter the log by job type or customer to identify process patterns for specific segments.
    * **Process Map Visualization:** The discovered process models (DFGs or Petri Nets) will visually depict the flow of jobs through the shop floor. We can overlay performance metrics directly onto these maps to highlight bottlenecks and areas of inefficiency. For example, nodes representing work centers can be colored by average waiting time or resource utilization.

* **Quantifying Performance Metrics using Process Mining:**

    * **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions:**
        * **Metric Calculation:** Process mining tools can automatically calculate flow times (time from "Job Released" to the last "Task End" event for a job) and lead times (time from "Job Released" to "Order Due Date"). We can analyze the distribution of these metrics (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles) to understand the typical and worst-case scenarios. Makespan can be relevant if we are analyzing a specific batch of jobs or a time period.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  Tools offer built-in performance analysis features to calculate these metrics directly from the event log. We can filter and aggregate these metrics by job priority, customer, or due date proximity to understand performance variations across different job types.

    * **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times) at Each Work Center/Machine:**
        * **Metric Calculation:** For each "Queue Entry" event followed by a "Task Start" event for the same Job ID and Resource, we can calculate the waiting time as the time difference between "Task Start" and "Queue Entry".  We can then aggregate these waiting times for each work center (grouping by "Resource (Machine ID)") to get average, median, and percentile waiting times per machine.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  Process mining tools can calculate waiting times based on event timestamps and activity sequences. We can visualize queue times as histograms or boxplots per resource to identify workstations with consistently high waiting times.

    * **Resource (Machine and Operator) Utilization:**
        * **Metric Calculation:** For each resource, we can calculate:
            * **Productive Time:** Sum of "Task Duration (Actual)" for all tasks performed on that resource.
            * **Setup Time:** Sum of "Task Duration (Actual)" for all "Setup" tasks on that resource.
            * **Idle Time:** Total available time for the resource (within working hours) minus productive time and setup time.  Alternatively, we can analyze the gaps between consecutive "Task End" and "Task Start" events on the same resource.
            * **Utilization Rate:** (Productive Time + Setup Time) / Total Available Time * 100%.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  Resource utilization analysis is a standard feature in process mining. Tools can visualize resource utilization over time, identify periods of overload and starvation, and breakdown utilization into productive, setup, and idle components. We can also analyze operator utilization in a similar way, considering operator assignments to tasks.

    * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
        * **Analysis Approach:** We need to analyze consecutive tasks performed on the same machine.  For each "Setup Start" event, we look at the "Notes" column to identify the "Previous job" processed on the same machine.  We then extract the setup duration ("Task Duration (Actual)" for "Setup") and relate it to the transition from the previous job's last task to the current job's task on that machine.
        * **Quantification:**  We can create a matrix or table where rows and columns represent task types (or job characteristics if more detailed information is available about job types). Each cell in the matrix would contain the average setup time for transitioning from the task type in the row to the task type in the column on a specific machine. We can also analyze setup time distributions for different transitions.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  While not a standard feature, process mining tools can be extended with custom metrics. We can use event log filtering and aggregation capabilities to group events by machine and analyze consecutive tasks and their setup durations based on the "Notes" field and timestamps.

    * **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
        * **Metric Calculation:** For each job, we can calculate tardiness as max(0, Completion Time - Order Due Date), where Completion Time is the timestamp of the last "Task End" event for that job. We can analyze the distribution of tardiness, the percentage of tardy jobs, and the average tardiness for tardy jobs.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  Process mining tools can calculate conformance metrics, although direct due date conformance might require custom metric definition. We can use event log filtering and aggregation to calculate tardiness for each job and visualize tardiness distributions. We can also create process variants and analyze the characteristics of on-time vs. late job paths.

    * **Impact of Disruptions:**
        * **Analysis Approach:** Filter the event log for "Breakdown Start" and "Priority Change" events.  Analyze the time periods around these events. For breakdowns, examine the impact on machine utilization, queue lengths for downstream machines, and job flow times for jobs in process or waiting for the broken-down machine. For priority changes, analyze the impact on the schedules of jobs with changed priority and other jobs in the system.
        * **Quantification:**  We can compare KPIs (lead times, tardiness) before and after disruption events. We can also analyze the recovery time after breakdowns and the ripple effects of priority changes on the overall schedule.
        * **Process Mining Feature:**  Process mining tools can visualize timelines and resource Gantt charts. We can overlay disruption events on these charts to visually assess their impact on job progress and resource utilization. We can also use filtering and performance analysis to quantify the impact on specific KPIs.

**2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies:**

Based on the performance analysis, we can diagnose several potential scheduling pathologies:

* **Bottleneck Resources:**
    * **Evidence:** High utilization rates for specific machines (e.g., above 85-90%), long queue times at these machines, and potentially longer overall job flow times when jobs require processing on these machines.  Process maps will visually highlight these bottlenecks as congested nodes.
    * **Process Mining Technique:** Bottleneck analysis (resource utilization analysis, queue time analysis, performance spectrum analysis in process mining tools).

* **Poor Task Prioritization:**
    * **Evidence:** High tardiness for high-priority jobs or jobs with near due dates.  Analysis of tardiness metrics segmented by priority and due date proximity will reveal this.  Variant analysis comparing on-time and late jobs might show that late jobs were often lower priority at critical decision points.
    * **Process Mining Technique:** Variant analysis, performance analysis segmented by job priority and due date, conformance checking against ideal priority-based dispatching (if a target schedule exists).

* **Suboptimal Sequencing and High Setup Times:**
    * **Evidence:** High overall setup time contribution to total processing time, especially on bottleneck machines.  Analysis of sequence-dependent setup times will show if certain job transitions lead to significantly longer setups. Process maps might show frequent switching between different task types on bottleneck machines.
    * **Process Mining Technique:** Sequence-dependent setup time analysis (as described in point 1), resource utilization breakdown (setup vs. productive time), process map analysis to identify frequent task type switches.

* **Starvation of Downstream Resources:**
    * **Evidence:** Low utilization of downstream machines despite high WIP. This might occur if upstream bottlenecks prevent jobs from reaching downstream resources in a timely manner. Resource utilization analysis and Gantt charts will reveal this pattern.
    * **Process Mining Technique:** Resource utilization analysis, Gantt chart visualization, process map analysis to see flow bottlenecks upstream of starved resources.

* **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
    * **Evidence:** High variability in WIP levels over time, potentially correlated with scheduling decisions or disruptions.  Analyzing WIP levels (using queue length data over time, if available in the logs, or inferring from queue entry/exit events) and correlating it with schedule changes or disruptions can reveal this.
    * **Process Mining Technique:** WIP level analysis (if data available), time-series analysis of queue lengths, correlation analysis between WIP variability and scheduling events.

**3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness:**

Process mining helps pinpoint *where* inefficiencies occur and provides data to infer *why*. Potential root causes for the diagnosed pathologies include:

* **Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules:**  Process mining will likely show that simple rules like FCFS or EDD, applied locally, lead to suboptimal global performance.  The analysis will demonstrate that these rules don't account for sequence-dependent setups, downstream machine loads, or dynamic priorities effectively. The variability in flow times and tardiness despite using these rules highlights their inadequacy in a complex job shop.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:** High variability in KPIs, especially flow time and tardiness, even for similar job types.  Lack of correlation between simple dispatching rule criteria (e.g., EDD) and actual job priority in many cases.

* **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The current system likely lacks a holistic, real-time view.  Process mining, by reconstructing the actual process, highlights the consequences of this lack of visibility – decisions made at one work center without considering the impact on others.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:** Bottlenecks, starvation, and long waiting times indicating a lack of coordination across work centers.  Inconsistent resource utilization patterns.

* **Inaccurate Task Duration/Setup Time Estimations:**  If planned task durations deviate significantly from actual durations (as seen in the log), it indicates inaccurate estimations. This undermines any schedule based on these estimations.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:**  Analysis of "Task Duration (Planned)" vs. "Task Duration (Actual)" columns.  Large discrepancies and high variance in the ratio of actual to planned durations.

* **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups:** If setup times are significant and sequence-dependent, but the current dispatching rules don't consider this, it will lead to excessive overall setup time.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:** Sequence-dependent setup time analysis showing large variations in setup times based on job transitions.  High proportion of total time spent on setups, especially on bottleneck machines.

* **Poor Coordination Between Work Centers:**  Lack of coordination can lead to upstream bottlenecks causing starvation downstream and overall inefficient flow.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:**  Bottleneck analysis and starvation analysis showing imbalances in resource utilization and flow.  Process maps indicating disconnected or poorly synchronized process segments.

* **Inadequate Strategies for Disruptions:**  Frequent breakdowns and urgent jobs disrupt planned schedules. If there's no proactive or reactive strategy to mitigate these disruptions, performance will suffer.
    * **Process Mining Evidence:** Analysis of the impact of breakdown and priority change events on KPIs.  Lack of robustness in the schedule when disruptions occur, leading to significant delays and increased tardiness.

Process mining helps differentiate between scheduling logic and capacity limitations. If resources are consistently overloaded (high utilization across the board), capacity limitations might be the primary issue. However, if we see bottlenecks coupled with underutilized resources elsewhere, high waiting times, and significant variability, then poor scheduling logic is likely a major contributing factor, even if capacity is also a constraint.

**4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies:**

Based on the process mining insights, we can propose the following sophisticated scheduling strategies:

**Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules - "Predictive EDD with Sequence-Dependent Setup and Downstream Load Balancing"**

* **Core Logic:**  Move beyond simple static rules. For each machine, dynamically select the next job from its queue based on a weighted combination of factors:
    * **Earliest Due Date (EDD):** Prioritize jobs closer to their due dates.
    * **Remaining Processing Time (RPT):** Consider the total remaining processing time for a job (sum of durations of remaining tasks).
    * **Job Priority:** Incorporate the assigned order priority.
    * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time (SDST):** *Predict* the setup time for each job in the queue based on the *last job processed* on that machine, using historical setup time data mined from the logs (sequence-dependent setup matrix). Favor jobs with shorter predicted setup times when possible.
    * **Downstream Machine Load:** Consider the current queue lengths and utilization of downstream machines in the job's routing.  Avoid releasing jobs to bottleneck machines if their downstream resources are already congested.

* **Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    * **Weighting Factors:** Process mining analysis of tardiness patterns and correlations with EDD, RPT, priority can inform the relative weights assigned to each factor in the dispatching rule. For example, if EDD is strongly correlated with on-time delivery, it should have a higher weight.
    * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Matrix:**  The mined sequence-dependent setup time matrix is crucial for predicting setup times and incorporating SDST into the dispatching decision.
    * **Downstream Machine Load Estimation:**  Real-time queue length information from the MES (or predicted from historical flow rates) is needed for downstream load balancing. Process mining can help estimate typical queue lengths and flow rates to inform this factor.

* **Addressing Pathologies:**
    * **Reduces Tardiness:** By prioritizing EDD and job priority.
    * **Optimizes Setup Times:** By considering SDST, reducing overall setup time, especially on bottlenecks.
    * **Balances Workload:** By considering downstream load, mitigating starvation and improving flow.

* **Expected Impact:** Reduced tardiness, lower WIP, shorter lead times, improved resource utilization, and better responsiveness to customer due dates.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Task Duration Distributions and Bottleneck Prediction - "Proactive Bottleneck Avoidance and Buffer Management"**

* **Core Logic:**  Instead of reactive dispatching, develop a proactive, predictive schedule.
    * **Task Duration Prediction:**  For each task type and machine, learn the distribution of *actual* task durations from historical logs (using histograms, probability distributions). Consider factors like operator, job complexity (if logged), and machine condition to refine these distributions.
    * **Predictive Maintenance Integration (Optional):** If predictive maintenance data is available (or derivable from machine event logs), integrate it to predict potential machine breakdowns and factor them into the schedule.
    * **Simulation-Based Scheduling:** Use discrete-event simulation, parameterized with the learned task duration distributions, routing probabilities, and predicted breakdown probabilities, to generate and evaluate different schedules *before* execution.
    * **Bottleneck Prediction and Buffer Management:**  The simulation can identify potential bottlenecks proactively. Implement buffer management strategies (e.g., controlled release of jobs, WIP limits at bottleneck workstations) to prevent bottleneck congestion and smooth workflow.

* **Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    * **Task Duration Distributions:** Process mining is essential to derive the distributions of actual task durations for each task type and machine.
    * **Routing Probabilities:** Process discovery can reveal common job routings and probabilities of different task sequences.
    * **Breakdown Frequencies and Durations:**  Analysis of breakdown events in the log can provide statistical data for breakdown frequencies and durations, useful for simulation.
    * **Bottleneck Identification:** Process mining already identifies historical bottlenecks. Predictive scheduling uses this knowledge to proactively manage them.

* **Addressing Pathologies:**
    * **Reduces Unpredictable Lead Times:** By using probabilistic task durations and simulation, schedules become more realistic and lead time estimates more accurate.
    * **Mitigates Bottlenecks:** Proactive bottleneck prediction and buffer management prevent congestion and improve flow.
    * **Handles Disruptions Better:**  Integrating predictive maintenance allows for proactive schedule adjustments to account for potential breakdowns.

* **Expected Impact:** More predictable lead times, lower WIP, reduced bottleneck congestion, improved schedule robustness against disruptions, and better resource utilization.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Minimization through Intelligent Job Batching and Sequencing - "Batching for Setup Reduction at Bottleneck Machines"**

* **Core Logic:** Specifically target the reduction of sequence-dependent setup times on bottleneck machines.
    * **Job Batching:** Group similar jobs together based on task sequences and setup requirements. Process similar jobs in batches on bottleneck machines to minimize setups between jobs within a batch. Batch formation can be based on job characteristics, customer, or material type if these are factors influencing setup times.
    * **Optimized Sequencing within Batches:** Within each batch, sequence jobs to further minimize setup times based on the sequence-dependent setup matrix.  For example, if transitioning from task type A to B has a lower setup time than A to C, prioritize the A-B sequence.
    * **Bottleneck Machine Focus:** Apply batching and optimized sequencing primarily on bottleneck machines identified through process mining, as these have the greatest impact on overall throughput.

* **Process Mining Data/Insights:**
    * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Matrix:** This is the core data input for batching and sequencing decisions.
    * **Bottleneck Machine Identification:** Process mining identifies the machines where setup time optimization will have the biggest impact.
    * **Job Characteristics Analysis (Optional):** If job characteristics are logged or can be inferred, process mining can help identify job groupings that lead to reduced setup times.

* **Addressing Pathologies:**
    * **Reduces Setup Time Waste:** Directly targets the reduction of sequence-dependent setup times, especially on bottleneck machines.
    * **Improves Bottleneck Throughput:** By reducing setup time on bottlenecks, increases their effective capacity and overall throughput.
    * **Reduces Lead Times:** Faster processing through bottlenecks reduces overall lead times.

* **Expected Impact:** Significant reduction in setup time, increased throughput, especially at bottlenecks, shorter lead times, and improved resource utilization on bottleneck machines.

**5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement:**

* **Discrete-Event Simulation for Testing and Comparison:**
    * **Simulation Model Parameterization:** Build a discrete-event simulation model of the job shop, parameterized with data derived from process mining:
        * **Task Time Distributions:** Use the mined distributions for each task type and machine.
        * **Routing Probabilities:** Use the routing probabilities discovered through process mining.
        * **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Model:** Implement the mined SDST matrix in the simulation.
        * **Breakdown Frequencies and Durations:** Incorporate breakdown data if available.
        * **Job Arrival Patterns and Mix:**  Model the historical job arrival patterns and mix of job types.
    * **Scenario Testing:**  Test the current baseline dispatching rules and each of the proposed strategies in various scenarios:
        * **Normal Load:** Simulate typical job load conditions.
        * **High Load:** Simulate periods of peak demand to test strategy scalability.
        * **Frequent Disruptions:** Simulate scenarios with frequent machine breakdowns and urgent job arrivals to assess robustness.
        * **Varying Job Mix:** Test with different mixes of job types to see how strategies perform under varying demands.
    * **KPI Comparison:**  Compare the performance of each strategy across KPIs like tardiness, WIP, lead time, makespan, and resource utilization in each scenario.  Statistical analysis of simulation outputs will determine the most effective strategy and quantify its improvement potential.

* **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation:**
    * **Ongoing Process Mining:**  Continuously process mine new event logs from the MES after implementing a chosen strategy.
    * **KPI Tracking Dashboard:**  Establish a real-time KPI dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (tardiness, WIP, lead time, utilization).
    * **Drift Detection and Alerting:**  Implement statistical process control (SPC) or drift detection techniques to automatically identify deviations from expected performance levels.
    * **Adaptive Scheduling Logic:**  Based on detected drifts or new inefficiencies identified through ongoing process mining, periodically re-evaluate the scheduling strategy parameters (e.g., weights in dispatching rules, batching parameters) or even switch between strategies dynamically.  This creates a closed-loop continuous improvement cycle.
    * **Feedback Loop:**  Regularly review process mining insights and simulation results to refine the scheduling strategies and adapt them to evolving shop floor conditions and customer demands.

By combining process mining for deep understanding of the current state, data-driven strategy design, simulation for rigorous evaluation, and continuous monitoring for adaptation, Precision Parts Inc. can move from inefficient, reactive scheduling to a proactive, optimized, and responsive manufacturing operation, significantly improving their KPIs and customer satisfaction.
