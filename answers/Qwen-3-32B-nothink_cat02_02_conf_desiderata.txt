###  **Overview of the Task**

We are analyzing three loan application cases (Case IDs 1, 2, and 3) against two sets of criteria:

- **Normative Rules:** Strict, must-be-followed process constraints.
- **Desiderata:** Recommended best practices that are not strictly enforced but are desirable.

---

##  **1. Violations of Normative Rules**

---

### **Case ID 1:  No Violations**

- **Process Flow:**  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- **Outcome:** Approved  
- **Compliance:**  
   All normative rules are strictly followed.  
   No skipped steps or reversed order.  
   Finalize Documentation is done before closing for an approved case.  
   No documentation finalized for a rejected case (not applicable here).

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations.**

---

### **Case ID 2:  Violates Normative Rules**

- **Process Flow:**  
  Application Received  **Risk Assessment**  **Credit Check**  Loan Decision (Rejected)  **Finalize Documentation**  Close Case  
- **Outcome:** Rejected  
- **Violations:**
  1. **Ordering Violation:**  
     - **Risk Assessment** is performed **before** **Credit Check**, which is a **hard constraint violation**.  
     - **Normative Rule:** Credit Check must occur **before** Risk Assessment.
  2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
     - **Finalize Documentation** is performed **after a rejected loan decision**, which is **strictly prohibited**.  
     - **Normative Rule:** If rejected, do **not** finalize documentation before closing the case.

**Conclusion:** **This case violates two normative rules.**  
- It is a **serious violation** and must be corrected or reviewed.

---

### **Case ID 3:  No Violations of Normative Rules**

- **Process Flow:**  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- **Outcome:** Approved  
- **Compliance:**  
   All normative rules are followed.  
   Finalize Documentation is done before closing for an approved case.  
   No reversed steps or skipped activities.

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations.**

---

##  **2. Violations of Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

---

### **Case ID 1:  Meets Desiderata**

- **Timing of Credit Check:** Within 24 hours of application received.  
- **Timing of Inform Applicant:** Within 48 hours of loan decision.  
- **Follow-up Call:** Not performed, but **not required**.

**Conclusion:** **No desideratum violations.**

---

### **Case ID 2:  Violates Desiderata**

- **Timing of Credit Check:**  
  - Application received at **08:00**, but Credit Check is performed **after** Risk Assessment at **09:00**  **Credit Check is delayed** (no prior Credit Check at all).  
- **Timing of Inform Applicant:**  
  - Loan decision at **09:30**, but no "Inform Applicant" step recorded.  
- **Follow-up Call:** Not performed.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Serious desideratum violations**, especially the **missing Credit Check before Risk Assessment** (which is also a normative violation).  
- Violates best practice for prompt communication and follow-up.

---

### **Case ID 3:  Violates Desiderata**

- **Timing of Credit Check:**  
  - Application received at **09:00**, Credit Check at **10:00 (Jan 14)**  3 days later.  
  - **Desideratum:** Credit Check should ideally be within 24 hours.  
- **Timing of Inform Applicant:**  
  - Loan decision at **12:00 (Jan 14)**, Inform Applicant at **15:00 (Jan 16)**  2.5 days later.  
  - **Desideratum:** Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision.  
- **Follow-up Call:** Not performed.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Desideratum violations**, but **no normative issues**.  
- Suboptimal timing in key steps, and no follow-up.

---

##  **3. Interpretations and Justifications (Where Applicable)**

---

### **Case ID 2: Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**

- **Possible Interpretation:**  
  - A **process misconfiguration or human error** may have occurred.  
  - Possibly due to a **misunderstanding of the workflow**, or a **system bug** where the system allowed Risk Assessment to be initiated before Credit Check.  
- **Justification (if needed):**  
  - If this was a **one-off error** and the system is otherwise compliant, it may be acceptable to flag it for review and correction.  
  - However, **this is a serious violation** of the normative rule and should not be repeated.

---

### **Case ID 2: Finalize Documentation After Rejection**

- **Possible Interpretation:**  
  - **Documentation finalized automatically** by the system, without proper validation of the decision.  
  - Or, a **manual error** where the user finalized documents without checking the decision.  
- **Justification (if needed):**  
  - If it was an **unintended action**, it could be corrected by removing the "Finalize Documentation" step.  
  - However, **this is a critical violation** and should be investigated.

---

### **Case ID 3: Delayed Credit Check and Inform Applicant**

- **Possible Interpretation:**  
  - **High workload** or **resource constraints** may have caused the delays.  
  - Or, the **process was followed correctly**, but with **poor time management**.  
- **Justification (if needed):**  
  - If delays were due to **external factors** (e.g., credit bureau backlog), it may be understandable.  
  - However, the **desideratum** is still a **recommended best practice**, and **improvement is needed**.

---

### **Case ID 3: Missing Follow-up Call**

- **Possible Interpretation:**  
  - The **follow-up call is not mandatory**, and may not have been assigned or completed due to **resource constraints** or **low priority**.  
- **Justification (if needed):**  
  - Since it is a **desideratum**, it is **not critical**, but **adding it** would improve customer satisfaction and process alignment.

##  **Summary Table**

| Case ID | Normative Violations | Desideratum Violations | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| 1       |  None              |  None                | Fully compliant |
| 2       |  Yes (2 violations) |  Yes                 | Serious issues in both normative and desideratum |
| 3       |  None              |  Yes                 | Suboptimal timing and missing follow-up |

##  **Recommendations**

1. **Case 2:**  
   - Remove the **Risk Assessment** step until **Credit Check** is completed.  
   - Remove **Finalize Documentation** after rejection.  
   - Investigate system or training gaps to prevent future errors.

2. **Case 3:**  
   - Improve **timeliness** of Credit Check and notification.  
   - Add **Follow-up Call** as a **recommended activity** to improve customer experience.

3. **General Process Improvements:**  
   - Enforce **workflow constraints** via process automation (e.g., BPMN or workflow engines).  
   - Monitor **desideratum metrics** (e.g., time-to-credit-check, time-to-notify) to improve performance.  
   - Include **Follow-up Call** as a **soft recommendation** in the process.
