The visualization depicts a flowchart of a request processing procedure.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **Start:** The process begins.
2. **Register Request:** The request is formally registered.
3. **First Decision Point (XOR Gateway - marked with an "X"):**  A decision is made. Only one path is followed.
    * **Top Path:** Leads to another decision point (XOR Gateway).  This likely represents a check for some criteria.  If the criteria is met, the process moves to "Check Ticket." If not, it proceeds to the next decision point.
    * **Bottom Path:**  Skips the "Check Ticket" step and directly goes to the next decision point. This suggests a faster, simpler path for certain requests.
4. **Check Ticket:** This step likely involves verifying supporting documentation or information related to the request.
5. **Second Decision Point (XOR Gateway):**  Another decision, with only one path taken.
    * **Top Path:** "Examine Thoroughly."
    * **Bottom Path:** "Examine Casually."  This suggests different levels of scrutiny based on the request type or the result of the "Check Ticket" step.
6. **Third Decision Point (OR Gateway - marked with a "+"):**  The results of the examination ("Examine Thoroughly" or "Examine Casually") converge here. Both paths lead to this point.
7. **Decide:** A decision is made based on the examination results.
8. **Fourth Decision Point (XOR Gateway):** Based on the decision, one of three paths is taken:
    * **Top Path:** "Reject Request."
    * **Middle Path:** "Pay Compensation."
    * **Bottom Path:** "Reinitiate Request."
9. **Fifth Decision Point (XOR Gateway):** This gateway consolidates the "Reject Request" and "Pay Compensation" paths.  Both lead to the end.
10. **End:** The process concludes.

In summary, the flowchart outlines a request process with different levels of evaluation and multiple possible outcomes, including rejection, compensation, or reinitiation.  The XOR gateways ensure only one path is taken at each decision point, while the OR gateway merges paths coming from different examination levels.
