This visualization is composed of three parts—a process-level diagram (a), a class diagram (b), and an illustrative communication example (c)—all meant to show how two separate yet related proclet classes (modular process components) interact to complete a laboratory testing workflow.

**(a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Channels:**  
In the large diagram on the left, we see two distinct but related processes, each modeled as a *proclet class*:  
- **Lab visit proclet** (on the left side)  
- **Lab test proclet** (on the right side)

**What is a proclet?**  
A proclet is a modular, interacting process component, usually represented by a Petri-net-like structure. Each proclet encapsulates a piece of the overall process logic and can exchange messages with others via well-defined communication channels.

**Lab visit proclet:**  
This represents the workflow associated with a patient visiting the lab. It includes activities such as:  
1. **Order entry**: A lab assistant or doctor enters a test order.  
2. **Take blood sample**: The patient’s blood sample is taken.  
3. **Judge results**: The results received from the lab test are evaluated. If they are inconclusive or require re-checking, the process leads to “Do tests again.” If everything is fine, the final step is to send the report out.

**Lab test proclet:**  
This corresponds to the internal process that performs the actual laboratory tests and generates reports. It includes activities like:  
1. **Perform test**: A chemical analyst runs the requested test on the sample.  
2. **Make report**: The lab test results are documented in a report.  
3. **Perform test again** and **Provide updated report**: If the initial results are questioned, the test can be repeated and an updated report is provided. Eventually, the lab test process finishes.

**Communication Channels (the dotted lines):**  
Between the Lab visit and Lab test proclets, there are channels (shown as dashed lines connecting certain transitions) that represent the exchange of information (messages, reports, requests) back and forth. For example:  
- The Lab visit proclet sends a message requesting a particular test.  
- The Lab test proclet responds by providing test results back.  
These channels ensure that the two proclets coordinate their actions to complete the overall scenario: the Lab visit triggers tests, and the Lab test returns outcomes.

**Overall Flow:**  
1. The lab visit initiates the order.  
2. The order system sends a request to the lab test proclet.  
3. The lab test proclet performs the test and sends results back.  
4. If needed, results are judged, possibly triggering a re-test.  
5. Ultimately, results are confirmed and a final report is sent.

**(b) Class Diagram Containing the Two Proclet Classes:**  
The small diagram to the right shows a simplified class relationship:  
- **Lab visit** requires one or more **Lab tests**.

This indicates that the “Lab visit” proclet class logically depends on the existence of one or more “Lab test” instances. In other words, each patient visit typically results in at least one corresponding test being run.

**(c) Example of a Performative (Communication Message):**  
At the bottom, there's a table representing an example communication event (performative). This breaks down a single message into structured elements:  
- **Time:** When the message is sent (e.g., 11:00).  
- **Channel:** The communication channel used (e.g., “Order system”).  
- **Sender:** Which proclet instance sent the message (e.g., “Lab visit - HGB John” might mean the Lab visit process instance for patient John’s Hemoglobin test).  
- **Receivers:** Who the message is intended for (e.g., “Lab test – HGB John”).  
- **Action:** What the message is doing (e.g., “Create” a new lab test instance).  
- **Content:** The actual request or statement (e.g., “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”).  
- **Scope:** Whether this communication is private or public.  
- **Direction:** Whether the message is going out (OUT) or in (IN).

This table shows that the system’s communications are explicit and structured. By logging messages in such detail, it’s easy to trace how processes coordinate and how events unfold over time.

**In Summary:**  
The figure as a whole illustrates a business scenario (ordering and performing lab tests) decomposed into two modular and interacting processes (proclets). The first part (a) shows the dynamic behavior and message flow, (b) shows the conceptual relationship between the proclets, and (c) provides a concrete example of how one specific communication (performative) is represented. Together, these parts emphasize modular design, clear communication channels, and the structured interplay of multiple components working together to achieve the overall task.
