### 1) Detected “phases” (change-points) in the numeric log
Looking for abrupt shifts and sustained plateaus in the sensor vector (Temp, Pressure, Vibration, Flow, Tool Pos, Energy), the main change-points occur at events **4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13**. These boundaries split the trace into stable segments that likely correspond to distinct activities.

### 2) Inferred activities (grouping + labels)

| Phase | Events | Inferred activity label | Why this grouping stands out (sensor signature) |
|------:|:------:|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| A | 1–3 | **Idle / Standby (pre-cycle)** | Near-ambient **T=20–21°C**, **P=1 bar**, **Vib=0**, **Flow=0**, **Tool=0**; only low background energy (0.40–0.50 kWh)  machine powered but not working. |
| B | 4–6 | **Cutting / Machining** | Sudden jump to **high vibration (30–38 Hz)** + **high material flow (5 units/s)** + **tool position advancing (510 mm)** + rising **temperature (5058°C)** and **energy (2.03.0 kWh)**  classic “tool engaged + feed” behavior consistent with cutting/machining. |
| C | 7–8 | **Assembling / Press-fit / Clamping** | **Pressure increases to 2 bar** while **tool position holds at 15 mm** (no longer advancing), with **lower vibration (10 Hz)** and **reduced flow (2 units/s)**  suggests a hold/press/clamp action rather than material removal. Stable readings across two events indicate a sustained operation. |
| D | 9 | **Welding / Joining (high-heat step)** | Extreme spike: **T=80°C** and **Energy=5.0 kWh** with **very high vibration (50 Hz)**, while **material flow drops to 0** and **tool position remains fixed (15 mm)**  a short, intense, heat/energy-heavy operation consistent with welding/joining. |
| E | 10 | **Cooldown / Dwell / Transition** | Rapid drop to **T=30°C**, **Vib1**, **Flow=0**, **Energy=1.0 kWh** while tool position still **15 mm**  post-weld dwell/cool or transition before the next step. |
| F | 11–12 | **Quality Inspection (probe/scan) or Controlled Handling** | Low/stable **T=25°C**, **P=1 bar**, modest **Vib=5 Hz**, small **Flow=1 unit/s**, and a new **tool position at 20 mm** with moderate energy (1.5–1.6 kWh). This looks like a non-destructive step: reposition + light actuation consistent with inspection (e.g., probing/scanning) or controlled transfer while measuring. |
| G | 13–15 | **Reset to Home / Idle (post-cycle)** | Returns to baseline: **Tool back to 0**, **Vib=0**, **Flow=0**, low energy ~0.40–0.50  cycle complete and machine returns to standby. |

### 3) Resulting high-level process (discovered sequence)
**Idle/Standby  Cutting/Machining  Assembling/Clamping  Welding/Joining  Cooldown/Transition  Quality Inspection  Reset/Idle**

This ordering is supported by (a) material-feed + tool-advance during machining, (b) pressure-dominant hold during assembly/clamp, (c) a short, extreme energy/temperature spike typical of welding, followed by (d) cooldown and then (e) a low-intensity repositioned step consistent with inspection, ending with (f) homing/reset.
