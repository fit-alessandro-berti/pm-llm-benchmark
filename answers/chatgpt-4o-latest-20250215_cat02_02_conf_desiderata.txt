### **Analysis of Event Log Based on Normative Rules & Desiderata**

---

## **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules (Strict Violations)**  

### **üö® Case 2: Violates Normative Rules**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check** (Timestamp: 2024-01-11 08:20 vs. 2024-01-11 09:00)  
  - This violates the strict ordering rule: **Credit Check must happen before Risk Assessment.**
- **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection** (Timestamp: 2024-01-11 10:00)  
  - Since the loan was rejected (Decision at 09:30), **Finalizing Documentation should not occur**‚Äîthis is a clear violation.
  
**üö® Summary:**  
Case 2 **does not follow the correct sequence** and **performs an invalid action (finalizing documentation after rejection).** These are strict violations of the loan application process.

## **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Suboptimal but Not Critical)**  

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Case 3: Violates Desiderata (Best Practices)**
- **Credit Check took too long** (Received: 2024-01-12 09:00, Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00)  
  - Recommended to happen within **24 hours** but took **over two days**.  
- **Informing Applicant was delayed** (Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00, Inform: 2024-01-16 15:00)  
  - Ideally within **48 hours** but took **over two days**.  
- **No Follow-up Call before closing**  
  - While not required, it is encouraged.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Summary:**  
Case 3 follows all **strict rules** but **does not meet best practices** regarding timing and communication.

## **3. Justifications & Interpretations for Observed Behavior**  

### **Case 2 (Strict Violations)**
- **Possible Explanation:**  
  - Risk Assessment happening before Credit Check suggests a possible **process error or system misalignment.**  
  - Finalizing documentation after rejection may indicate **miscommunication** or an **improper workflow trigger** in the system.  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Ensure automated checks prevent Risk Assessment from occurring without a prior Credit Check.  
  - Implement a validation rule that blocks documentation finalization after rejection.

### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations)**
- **Possible Explanation:**  
  - **Delayed Credit Check & Informing Applicant** could be due to **weekends, workload delays, or external factors.**  
  - **No Follow-up Call** might indicate resource constraints or **low priority given to follow-ups.**  
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Establish alerts/reminders to complete time-sensitive tasks within recommended timeframes.  
  - Encourage follow-up calls as a quality assurance measure.

## **Final Summary**  

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | Notes |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1    | ‚úÖ **No Violations** | ‚úÖ **None** | Fully compliant |
| 2    | ‚ùå **Yes** (Ordering & Documentation Finalization Errors) | ‚ùå N/A | Strict process errors, must be fixed |
| 3    | ‚úÖ **No Violations** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yes** (Delays & No Follow-up Call) | Suboptimal, but not a rule-breaking issue |

üîπ **Case 2 must be corrected to comply with the normative rules.**  
üîπ **Case 3 can be improved for efficiency and user experience, but it does not strictly violate the process.**
