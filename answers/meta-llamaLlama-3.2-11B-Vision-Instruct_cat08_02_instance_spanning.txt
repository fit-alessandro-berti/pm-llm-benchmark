## Step 1: Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

To formally identify and quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we can utilize process mining techniques such as process discovery, conformance checking, and optimization. Here's how we would proceed:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** We would analyze the event log to find instances where orders are waiting for a cold-packing station due to it being occupied by another order. Metrics to measure the impact include:
  - **Waiting Time Due to Resource Contention:** Calculate the total time spent by orders waiting for a cold-packing station.
  - **Resource Utilization Rate:** Determine the average percentage of time the cold-packing stations are occupied.
- **Shipping Batches:** Identify batches of orders waiting for shipping label generation. Metrics include:
  - **Waiting Time for Batch Completion:** Measure the total time orders spend waiting for a batch to be completed.
  - **Batch Formation Frequency:** Determine how often batches are formed.
- **Priority Handling:** Analyze the impact of express orders on standard orders at shared resources. Metrics include:
  - **Delay to Standard Orders:** Measure the additional time standard orders experience due to express orders occupying shared resources.
  - **Resource Utilization Impact:** Calculate the decrease in resource utilization due to express orders.
- **Hazardous Material Limits:** Determine the average number of hazardous material orders in the packing or quality check activities simultaneously. Metrics include:
  - **Throughput Reduction Due to Limits:** Measure the reduction in throughput caused by not meeting the 10-orders limit.
  - **Average Time Spent Undergoing Packing/Quality Check:** Calculate the average time spent by hazardous material orders in these activities.

To differentiate waiting time caused by within-instance factors versus between-instance factors, we can use techniques such as:

- **Instance-level analysis:** Examine individual order instances to identify the cause of delays.
- **Cross-instance analysis:** Look for patterns and correlations between instances that are affected by the same instance-spanning constraints.

## Step 2: Analyzing Constraint Interactions

Understanding the interactions between different constraints is crucial for developing effective optimization strategies. Here are some potential interactions to consider:

- **Priority Handling and Shared Cold-Packing Stations:** When an express order needing cold-packing arrives, it may pause the processing of a standard order currently using the necessary resource. This can lead to delays for the standard order.
- **Shipping Batches and Hazardous Material Limits:** If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the same region and are batched together, they may exceed the regulatory limit, requiring additional resources or reorganization of the batch.
- **Resource Utilization and Batch Formation:** The formation of batches can be influenced by the resource utilization rate, as batches are formed when resources are not utilized at maximum capacity.

## Step 3: Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

Here are three distinct optimization strategies designed to mitigate the negative impacts of instance-spanning constraints:

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations

- **Constraint:** Shared cold-packing stations.
- **Change:** Implement a dynamic resource allocation policy that adjusts the allocation of cold-packing stations based on real-time demand.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use historical data to predict resource demand and optimize allocation.
- **Expected Outcome:** Reduced waiting time for orders and increased resource utilization.

### Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic

- **Constraint:** Shipping batches.
- **Change:** Implement a revised batching logic that dynamically forms batches based on historical data and real-time information.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use historical data to optimize batch sizes and formation triggers.
- **Expected Outcome:** Faster batch formation and reduced waiting time for orders.

### Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules

- **Constraint:** Priority handling and hazardous material limits.
- **Change:** Implement improved scheduling rules that consider priorities and regulatory limits when allocating resources.
- **Data/Analysis:** Use historical data to optimize scheduling rules and minimize delays.
- **Expected Outcome:** Reduced delays for standard orders and improved compliance with hazardous material limits.

## Step 4: Simulation and Validation

Before implementing changes, we can use simulation techniques to test the effectiveness of the proposed strategies and evaluate their impact on KPIs while respecting the instance-spanning constraints. Specifically, we would focus on:

- **Resource contention:** Simulate the impact of resource contention on waiting times and resource utilization.
- **Batching delays:** Simulate the impact of batching delays on throughput and waiting times.
- **Priority interruptions:** Simulate the impact of priority interruptions on delays and resource utilization.
- **Regulatory limits:** Simulate the impact of exceeding hazardous material limits on throughput and compliance.

## Step 5: Monitoring Post-Implementation

After implementing changes, we would set up key metrics and process mining dashboards to continuously monitor the process. Specifically, we would track:

- **Resource utilization:** Monitor the average percentage of time resources are occupied.
- **Waiting times:** Measure the average time orders spend waiting for resources or batches.
- **Throughput:** Monitor the number of orders processed per unit time.
- **Compliance:** Track the percentage of orders that comply with hazardous material limits.

The final answer is: $\boxed{There is no numerical answer to this problem, as it involves developing a comprehensive strategy to improve the order fulfillment process.}$
