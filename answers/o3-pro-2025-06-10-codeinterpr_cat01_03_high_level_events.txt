Proposed high-level view of the manufacturing process
======================================================

High-level step  | Low-level events that belong to it (ordered)                              | Why these events belong together / rule that detects them
---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Material Preparation | • Retrieve raw metal sheet  <br>• Scan barcode  <br>• Place metal sheet on table  <br>• Align metal sheet  <br>• Pre-heat metal sheet | • They all occur before any value-adding transformation (no welding yet). <br>• Activities are executed by the same work-cell (operator + positioning robot + heater). <br>• They happen within a tight time window (< 30 s) and are always triggered by the “Retrieve raw metal sheet” starter event. <br>Rule  From “Retrieve raw metal sheet” up to (and including) the first “Pre-heat metal sheet”.
2. Welding / Mechanical Joining | • Pick up welding tool  <br>• Weld corner A  <br>• Weld corner B | • All events are performed with the same tool (ToolID W-12) and resource type “Operator B”. <br>• They produce the welded joints; no other resource types intervene. <br>Rule  From “Pick up welding tool” until the last “Weld …” event that follows it, without an intervening QA sensor event.
3. In-process Weld Inspection | • Measure weld integrity | • Performed by a quality sensor immediately after welding and before any surface work. <br>• Distinct resource type “Quality Sensor” marks the boundary. <br>Rule  Every “Measure weld integrity” event is a single-event high-level step because it represents a discrete QA gate.
4. Surface Finishing | • Apply protective coating  <br>• Dry coating | • Both events manipulate the same surface treatment (coating + drying furnace). <br>• Resources are finishing units, not operators or sensors. <br>• Always follow immediately after a successful weld inspection. <br>Rule  Begins with “Apply protective coating” and ends with the subsequent “Dry coating”.
5. Final Visual Inspection | • Visual check | • Last gate before the part leaves the cell. <br>• Performed by a human inspector; no subsequent manufacturing events for the same CaseID. <br>Rule  A “Visual check” that is the last timestamp for a CaseID closes the case.

General rules you can automate for the full log
-----------------------------------------------

1. Identify the “starter” activity for each step (e.g., “Retrieve raw metal sheet”, “Pick up welding tool”, “Apply protective coating”, “Visual check”).  
2. Collect all subsequent events until a “boundary marker” appears:  
   • A marker is either (a) the starter of the next step or (b) a resource type that always starts another step (e.g., Quality Sensor  inspection).  
3. Apply a maximum inter-event gap threshold (e.g., 45 s). If the gap is larger, assume a new high-level step begins even if the marker is not explicit.  
4. Tag the resulting segment with the high-level name from the table above.

With these five aggregated activities the manufacturing trace is now concise, readable, and immediately reveals the true process flow:

Material Preparation  Welding / Mechanical Joining  In-process Weld Inspection  Surface Finishing  Final Visual Inspection

The same rules apply to every CaseID (see B2 in the sample); only timestamps change.
