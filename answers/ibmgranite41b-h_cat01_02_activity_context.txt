### Justification for Renaming Activities

1. **Request Initiation**  *Request Initiation*: This term clarifies that the activity is synonymous with starting a customer support request, whether initiated online or in-person.

2. **Document Verification (Original)**  *Document Verification* & *Recheck Document Verification*: The original name was too generic and did not specify if it's an initial verification step or rechecking after document upload. Renaming to these specific activities highlights the nature of each action distinctly.

3. **Contact with Customer**  *Contact with Customer*: This is a general activity indicating communication between support agents and customers, without implying any particular channel (e.g., phone call vs email). 

4. **Account Adjustment**  *Internal Account Adjustment* & *Follow-up on Internal Adjustments*: The original name did not differentiate whether the adjustment was made internally or after external customer interaction.

5. **Contact with Customer** (Revisit) - This activity now specifically denotes a follow-up, clarifying that it's an inquiry to confirm if account adjustments were successfully implemented.

6. **Request Approval**  *Final Request Approval*: The term "final" is added to emphasize the importance of this approval stage and highlight its distinct context from earlier verification steps.

This revised event log provides clear distinctions between actions based on their context, process flow within a case, or interaction type (online vs physical), enhancing understanding and facilitating more precise tracking.
