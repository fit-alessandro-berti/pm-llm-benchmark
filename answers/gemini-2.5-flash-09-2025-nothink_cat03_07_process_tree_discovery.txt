Based on the observed behavior in the event log, the process structure can be modeled as follows:

1.  The process starts with **Receive Application (RA)**.
2.  It is followed by **Validate Form (VF)**.
3.  Next is **Assess Eligibility (AE)**.
4.  After AE, there is an optional internal loop structure (The rework loop). In this loop, the process can transition to **Request Missing Info (RMI)** and then return to **Validate Form (VF)**. This loop can be executed zero or more times.
5.  After the loop (or if the loop was skipped), the process proceeds to **Approval Decision (AD)**.
6.  Finally, there is a sequence of **Send Confirmation (SC)** followed by **Archive Case (AC)**.

The corresponding process tree structure is:

$$
\rightarrow \left(
    \text{'RA'},
    \rightarrow \left(
        \text{'VF'},
        \rightarrow \left(
            \text{'AE'},
            \rightarrow \left(
                * \left(
                    \tau,
                    \rightarrow \left(
                        \text{'RMI'},
                        \text{'VF'}
                    \right)
                \right),
                \rightarrow \left(
                    \text{'AD'},
                    \rightarrow \left(
                        \text{'SC'},
                        \text{'AC'}
                    \right)
                \right)
            \right)
        \right)
    \right)
\right)
$$

### Explanation of the Structure:

1.  **Outer Sequence ($\rightarrow$)**: The entire process is a sequence of major stages.
2.  **RA $\rightarrow$ VF $\rightarrow$ AE**: These are the initial mandatory steps observed in every case.
3.  **The Loop Component ($*$)**:
    *   The loop structure is defined as $* ( A, B )$. Here, $A$ is the exit path and $B$ is the loop body that returns to $A$.
    *   $A = \tau$ (silent step/exit path): This allows the process to exit the loop immediately after AE (as seen in Case 2), or after any subsequent execution of the loop body.
    *   $B = \rightarrow ( \text{'RMI'}, \text{'VF'} )$: This is the loop body, representing the rework cycle: Request Missing Info, followed by another Validation Form.
4.  **Post-Loop Sequence ($\rightarrow$ after the loop)**:
    *   Once the loop is exited, the process executes **AD** (Approval Decision).
    *   This is followed by the final sequence: **SC** (Send Confirmation) $\rightarrow$ **AC** (Archive Case).
