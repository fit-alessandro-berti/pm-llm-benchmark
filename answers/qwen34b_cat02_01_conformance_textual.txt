Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to check each case in the event log against the normative process description and see if any of them deviate. Let's start by recalling the normative steps.

First, the process always starts with "Receive order". Then, "Check inventory" must come next. After that, if inventory is sufficient, the next steps are "Authorize payment", then "Package items", then "Ship order", and finally "Close order". If inventory isn't sufficient, after "Check inventory", it should go to "Cancel order" and then "Close order".

So the key constraints are the order of activities. Let me go through each case one by one.

Case 1:
- Receive order (correct)
- Check inventory (correct)
- Authorize payment (should be after check inventory, which is correct)
- Package items (after authorization, correct)
- Ship order (after packaging, correct)
- Close order (last step, correct)
So this case seems to follow the normal flow. But wait, according to the description, after "Ship order", it should be "Close order", which it is. So no violation here.

Case 2:
- Receive order (correct)
- Check inventory (correct)
- Package items (this is before "Authorize payment", which is supposed to be after check inventory. Wait, the correct sequence after check is authorize payment, then package. But here, they did package before authorize. That's a violation. Then authorize payment comes after packaging. Also, ship order comes after packaging, which is correct. But the order of authorize payment before packaging is wrong. So this case has a problem.

Case 3:
- Receive order, check inventory, authorize payment, cancel order, ship order, close order. Wait, after cancel order, they ship order. According to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after cancel, it should be close. But here, after cancel, they ship. That's a violation. Also, the order of activities is: after cancel, ship, then close. But the process says that once canceled, you can't proceed to ship. So this is wrong.

Case 4:
- Receive, check, cancel, close. That's correct. After check, cancel, then close. So that's okay.

Case 5:
- Receive, check, authorize, ship, close. The problem here is that after authorize payment, the next step is ship, but according to the norm, after authorize payment, you should package before shipping. So this case has authorize payment followed by ship, which is a violation. Because the correct sequence is authorize, then package, then ship. So this case is wrong.

So the cases that violate are 2, 3, and 5. Let me check again.

Case 2: After check, they did package before authorize. That's wrong. Then authorize comes after package. But the correct sequence is check, authorize, package, ship, close. So case 2 is wrong.

Case 3: After cancel, they ship. That's wrong. Because after cancel, the next step should be close, not ship.

Case 5: After authorize payment, they ship, which is before packaging. So that's wrong.

So the answer should be cases 2, 3, and 5. Now, I need to explain each violation in detail based on the normative description.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases. Case 1 is correct. Case 4 is correct. So that's it.

### **Identified Violations in the Event Log**

#### **Case 2**  
**Violation:**  
- **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`  
- **Issue:** The activity **"Package items"** occurs **before** **"Authorize payment"**, which violates the normative requirement that **"Authorize payment"** must occur **after** **"Check inventory"** and **before** **"Package items"**.  
- **Explanation:** The correct flow for sufficient inventory is:  
  **Receive order**  **Check inventory**  **Authorize payment**  **Package items**  **Ship order**  **Close order**.  
  In Case 2, **"Package items"** is executed before **"Authorize payment"**, which is illogical and violates the process constraint that payment authorization must occur before packaging.

---

#### **Case 3**  
**Violation:**  
- **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`  
- **Issue:** The activity **"Ship order"** occurs **after** **"Cancel order"**, which violates the rule that **"Ship order"** should **never** be executed after an order is canceled.  
- **Explanation:** When inventory is insufficient, the process should branch to **"Cancel order"**, followed by **"Close order"**. The correct flow for a canceled order is:  
  **Receive order**  **Check inventory**  **Cancel order**  **Close order**.  
  In Case 3, **"Ship order"** is executed after **"Cancel order"**, which is invalid because shipping is only permitted after packaging, and packaging is only allowed after payment authorization (which is not applicable in this case).

---

#### **Case 5**  
**Violation:**  
- **Sequence:** `Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`  
- **Issue:** The activity **"Ship order"** occurs **before** **"Package items"**, which violates the requirement that **"Package items"** must occur **after** **"Authorize payment"** and **before** **"Ship order"**.  
- **Explanation:** The correct flow for sufficient inventory is:  
  **Receive order**  **Check inventory**  **Authorize payment**  **Package items**  **Ship order**  **Close order**.  
  In Case 5, **"Ship order"** is executed before **"Package items"**, which is invalid because items must be prepared before being shipped.

---

### **Summary of Violations**  
- **Case 2:** Incorrect sequence of **"Package items"** before **"Authorize payment"**.  
- **Case 3:** **"Ship order"** executed after **"Cancel order"**.  
- **Case 5:** **"Ship order"** executed before **"Package items"**.  

All other cases (1 and 4) follow the normative process correctly.
