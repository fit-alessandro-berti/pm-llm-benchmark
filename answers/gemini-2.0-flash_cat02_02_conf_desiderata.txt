Okay, let's analyze the event log against the defined normative rules and desiderata.

**1. Normative Violations:**

*   **Case 2:** Violates multiple normative rules.
    *   **Violation 1:**  The Risk Assessment occurred *before* the Credit Check. This breaks the defined sequence constraint: "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."
    *   **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation occurred after the Loan Decision was "Rejected." This directly contradicts the rule: "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."

**2. Desiderata Violations:**

*   **Case 3:** Violates the timing desiderata.
    *   **Violation 1:** The Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after the Application Received (2 full days later).  This violates the "Credit Check is completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours)" recommendation.
    *   **Violation 2:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision (2 days and 3 hours later). This violates the "applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision)" recommendation.
    *   **Violation 3:** No Follow-up Call was performed. Although it is optional, it's still a missed opportunity to confirm all parties are aligned.

**3. Cases Adhering to Normative Rules:**

*   **Case 1:** This case follows all the defined normative rules.

**Justifications/Interpretations (Where Possible):**

*   **Case 2: Sequence and Decision Logic Violations:**  It's difficult to justify these violations without additional context.  The Risk Assessment *must* follow the credit check according to the normative constraint. Performing "Finalize Documentation" after a rejection is *explicitly prohibited.* This suggests a potential system error, a misunderstanding of the process, or intentional circumvention of the rules (which would be a severe issue).
*   **Case 3: Timing Violations:** These are easier to interpret. The delay in the Credit Check might be due to high workloads or unavailability of credit check resources. The delay in informing the applicant might stem from staff unavailability or an overloaded communications queue.  Skipping the Follow-up Call might be due to it being considered optional and staff prioritizing other tasks. Importantly, the absence of a follow-up call is not a violation.

**Summary:**

*   **Case 1:** Compliant with all normative rules and recommendations (no violations).
*   **Case 2:** Serious violations of normative rules related to process sequence and decision logic.  Requires immediate investigation.
*   **Case 3:** Compliant with the normative rules, but violates desiderata related to timing and communication. This suggests potential areas for process improvement (e.g., resource allocation for credit checks, communication queue management, or training on the importance of follow-up calls). While no rules were violated, the process could be improved.
