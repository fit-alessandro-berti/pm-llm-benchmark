Based on the process requirements and the provided event log, here is the analysis of the loan application cases.

---

### 1. Normative Rule Violations
These cases failed to adhere to the strict, mandatory sequence and logic of the process.

**Case 2: Severe Non-Compliance**
Case 2 contains multiple critical violations of the normative constraints:
*   **Out-of-Order Execution:** The `Risk Assessment` was performed at 08:20, before the `Credit Check` at 09:00. The rules strictly state that a credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation.
*   **Skipped Activity:** The mandatory step `Inform Applicant` was skipped entirely. The process jumped from the `Loan Decision` straight to documentation and closing.
*   **Contradictory Action:** The activity `Finalize Documentation` was performed despite the loan being **Rejected**. The normative rules explicitly state that if a loan is rejected, documentation should not be finalized and the case should be closed without it.

**Case 1 & Case 3: No Normative Violations**
*   Both cases followed the correct sequence, respected the decision logic, and included all mandatory steps in the correct order.

### 2. Desiderata Failures
These cases followed the mandatory rules but failed to meet the recommended best practices (suboptimal behavior).

**Case 1: Minor Suboptimal Behavior**
*   **Missing Follow-up Call:** While the mandatory steps were completed efficiently, the recommended `Follow-up Call` before closing the case was not performed.

**Case 2: Minor Suboptimal Behavior**
*   **Missing Follow-up Call:** Like Case 1, no follow-up call was conducted. (Note: This is secondary to its major normative violations).

**Case 3: Significant Desiderata Failures**
Case 3 followed all strict rules but failed every timing and recommendation guideline:
*   **Delayed Credit Check:** The `Credit Check` occurred approximately 49 hours after the application was received, exceeding the recommended 24-hour window.
*   **Delayed Notification:** The applicant was informed 51 hours after the `Loan Decision` was made, exceeding the recommended 48-hour window.
*   **Missing Follow-up Call:** The recommended follow-up call was not performed.

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

To improve the process or understand why these deviations occurred, we can suggest the following interpretations:

*   **Case 2 (The "Broken" Process):** 
    *   *Interpretation:* The sequence reversal (Risk before Credit) suggests a manual override or a system error where an analyst might have started the assessment based on internal knowledge before the formal credit report arrived. 
    *   *Justification for Documentation:* Finalizing documentation after a rejection is highly unusual; this could indicate a "Data Entry Error" where the clerk accidentally triggered the wrong sub-process, or perhaps the "Rejected" status was logged incorrectly when the intention was to approve.

*   **Case 3 (The "Slow" Process):**
    *   *Interpretation:* The timestamps show the application came in on Friday (2024-01-12) and the next step occurred on Sunday (2024-01-14). 
    *   *Justification:* The violation of the 24-hour and 48-hour desiderata likely stems from **non-business days (the weekend)**. If the "24-hour" rule does not account for weekends, the staff may need more resources on Saturdays/Sundays, or the desiderata should be updated to "1 Business Day" to reflect reality.

*   **General (Missing Follow-up Calls):**
    *   *Interpretation:* None of the three cases included a follow-up call.
    *   *Justification:* This suggests a systemic issue rather than an individual mistake. The staff likely views the "Follow-up Call" as unnecessary overhead or is prioritizing "Case Closing" speed over the recommended relationship-management step. If this desideratum is important for customer satisfaction, it may need to be moved from a "desiderata" to a "normative rule" to ensure compliance.
