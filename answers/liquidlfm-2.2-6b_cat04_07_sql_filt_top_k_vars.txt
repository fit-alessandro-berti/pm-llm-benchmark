— **Correction Note:** The solution above employs a structured, modular approach with multiple CTE ("Common Table Executor") layers to decompose the complex sequential analysis tasks:

1. **Sanitize & Order Events:** `sanitized_orders` calculates lagged timestamps to build ordered sequences for each `case_id`.
2. **Build Activity Sequences:** `processed_case_sequences` years constructs progression sequences per case.
3. **Establish Process Variants:**
   - `identify_variants` groups cases into ranked variants using efficient recursive sequence tracing and identifier ranking.
   - `process_variant_keys` enumerates distinct variants and variant sequences.
4. **Frequency Count:** 
   - `variant_frequency` computes how many cases follow each variant.
   - `top_k_variants` selects the top K variants by frequency.
5. **Cut & Export:** The final query (`SELECT ... FROM event_log` with layers drawing from processed results) filters events only belonging to top K variants and returns them.

**Note:** Advanced sequence matching and streaming require careful aggregation. Leveraging vendor-specific extensions like autocorrelation or window aggregation functions may simplify the core join logic in production tools. The displayed query showcases high-level SQL reflection for multistep, hierarchical event log analysis. For optimal execution and maintainability, refactor to chunks aligned with business logic functions or LLVM-derived SQL structuring (not actual implementable as pure SQL without utilities).

**Excerpt for DBC Compatibility:**
- The `array_insert`, `LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `UNNEST` expressiveness suggest DBGC enhancements; in summaries, window functions are core to DBC Multifactoring.

**Recommendation:**  
Profile performance on full DuckDB tables — computed fields may require temp tables or driven unions. Focus on sequence mining and variances as defined; persistence is loaded after core filtering.
