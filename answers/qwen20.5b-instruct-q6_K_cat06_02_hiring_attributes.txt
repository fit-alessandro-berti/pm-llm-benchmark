The document provides a list of attributes that could be considered sensitive for fairness in the job application process. Some of the attributes include:

- Gender, which is likely to influence whether or not an individual will be selected for an interview based on gender.
- Religion, as it can impact how applicants are approached during background checks and can affect their perceived suitability for a specific role or industry.
- Civil status (citizen vs non-citizen), as it can impact the application process and open up opportunities for certain groups of individuals.
- Race, as it can influence access to certain resources such as HR support and access to job listings. This could affect how well an individual is able to compete in the job market.

However, some attributes may be considered more fair if they do not have a significant impact on decision-making or evaluation processes. For example, age or experience could still be relevant depending on specific jobs or roles.
The document does not provide information on which attributes are most sensitive and what measures are being taken to address these issues.
