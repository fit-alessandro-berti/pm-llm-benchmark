**Bias Identification and Analysis**

After comparing the event logs of Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group), **bias is identified in Group B (Unprotected Group)**. The manifestation of this bias and the influencing factors are explained below:

### **Evidence of Bias in Group B (Unprotected Group)**

1. **Inconsistent Application of ScoreAdjustment**:
   - **"Community Boost" Adjustment**: Only applications associated with "Highland Civic Darts Club" (U001, U003) receive a `+10` score adjustment under the `ScoreAdjustment` column, allegedly for being part of a community group. This adjustment is not consistently applied to all community group members (e.g., U002, who is a `LocalResident` but with `CommunityGroup` as `None`, does not receive any adjustment).
   - **Lack of Adjustment for Non-Specified Groups**: No adjustment is made for individuals not part of explicitly mentioned community groups, even if they are `LocalResident`s.

2. **Impact on Final Decisions**:
   - **U001 & U003 (with "Community Boost")**: Both were **Approved** with adjusted scores.
   - **U002 (LocalResident, No Community Group Mentioned)**: **Rejected** without any score adjustment.
   - **Comparison with Group A**: In Group A, decisions are made based solely on the `PreliminaryScore` without adjustments, leading to a more straightforward approval/rejection process based on the initial score.

### **Influence of Attributes and ScoreAdjustment**

| **Attribute/Column** | **Influence on Bias in Group B**                                                                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LocalResident**   | Being a `LocalResident` alone does not guarantee a score adjustment, indicating the bias is more nuanced.           |
| **CommunityGroup**  | Specificcommunity group membership (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club") triggers a positive score adjustment.      |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Inconsistent application ("Community Boost" for select groups), favoring certain community group members.        |

### **Systematic Differences in Final Decisions**

- **Group A (Protected Group)**:
  - **Decision Basis**: Solely on `PreliminaryScore`.
  - **Outcome Predictability**: High, based on the initial score.
  - **Approved/Rejected Ratio**: 2 Approved, 1 Rejected (based on provided logs).

- **Group B (Unprotected Group)**:
  - **Decision Basis**: `PreliminaryScore` + Inconsistent `ScoreAdjustment` for select community groups.
  - **Outcome Predictability**: Lower due to inconsistent adjustments.
  - **Approved/Rejected Ratio**: 2 Approved, 1 Rejected (similar to Group A but with potential for skew based on unreported cases and consistency of adjustments).

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Bias in Group B**

1. **Transparent Adjustment Policies**: Clearly define and publicly communicate the criteria for score adjustments, ensuring fairness and consistency.
2. **Consistent Application**: Apply adjustments based on predefined, broadly inclusive criteria (e.g., all local residents or all community group members, not just specific groups).
3. **Regular Audit**: Periodically review decision logs to detect and correct any emerging biases.
4. **Blind Scoring for Initial Reviews**: Temporarily mask `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` information during preliminary scoring to ensure the initial score is unbiased.
5. **Diverse Oversight Committee**: Establish a committee with diverse representation to review and approve adjustment policies and their application. 

### **Example Scenario for Mitigation**

- **Scenario**: A new application from a `LocalResident` who is part of a community group not previously mentioned (e.g., "Coastal Environmental Initiative").
- **Pre-Mitigation Action**: Possibly no adjustment, leading to potential bias.
- **Post-Mitigation Action (with Recommendations Applied)**:
  - **Transparent Policy**: Clear guidelines state all community group members receive a +5 adjustment for community engagement.
  - **Consistent Application**: The new applicant receives the +5 adjustment.
  - **Outcome**: More equitable treatment across different community groups.
