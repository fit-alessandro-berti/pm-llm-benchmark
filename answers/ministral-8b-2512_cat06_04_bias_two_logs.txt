### **Analysis of Bias in Event Logs: Group A (Protected) vs. Group B (Unprotected)**

The two event logs reveal **systematic differences in decision-making** between **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)**, with **Group B exhibiting clear signs of bias** due to the **influence of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` attributes**, particularly through **score adjustments** that favor certain applicants.

---

### **Key Observations of Bias in Group B (Unprotected Group)**

#### **1. Differential Treatment Based on `LocalResident` Status**
- **Group A (Protected):**
  - All applicants are **non-local residents (`LocalResident = FALSE`)**.
  - No **score adjustments** are applied, and decisions are based **solely on preliminary scores** (720, 710, 740).
  - **Outcome:**
    - **P001 (720)  Approved**
    - **P002 (710)  Rejected**
    - **P003 (740)  Approved**
  - **No community or local affiliation boosts scores.**

- **Group B (Unprotected):**
  - **Some applicants are local residents (`LocalResident = TRUE`), and those affiliated with the `Highland Civic Darts Club` receive a **+10 score adjustment** (Community Boost).**
  - **Outcome:**
    - **U001 (720  730 after boost)  Approved** (would have been borderline without adjustment)
    - **U002 (710, no boost)  Rejected** (same as P002, but no adjustment)
    - **U003 (695  705 after boost)  Approved** (would have been rejected without adjustment)

#### **2. Systematic Score Adjustments Favor Local Affiliations**
- **Group B shows explicit bias through `ScoreAdjustment`:**
  - **U001 & U003** (both `Highland Civic Darts Club` members) receive **+10 points**, pushing them from **borderline (710-720) to approved (730+)**.
  - **U002** (no community affiliation) gets **no adjustment**, leading to rejection despite having the same raw score as **P002 (Group A)**.
- **Group A has no such adjustments**, meaning **non-local applicants are treated uniformly** without favoritism.

#### **3. Final Decision Disparities Due to Adjustments**
| CaseID | Raw Score | Adjustment | Adjusted Score | Decision | LocalResident? | Community Affiliation? |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| **P001** (Group A) | 720 | 0 | 720 | **Approved** |  No |  None |
| **P002** (Group A) | 710 | 0 | 710 | **Rejected** |  No |  None |
| **P003** (Group A) | 740 | 0 | 740 | **Approved** |  No |  None |
| **U001** (Group B) | 720 | **+10** | **730** | **Approved** |  Yes |  Highland Civic Darts Club |
| **U002** (Group B) | 710 | **0** | 710 | **Rejected** |  Yes |  None |
| **U003** (Group B) | 695 | **+10** | **705** | **Approved** |  Yes |  Highland Civic Darts Club |

- **Key Takeaway:**
  - **Without adjustments, U001 (720) and U003 (695) would have been rejected or borderline.**
  - **The +10 boost effectively lowers the approval threshold for local community members**, while **non-affiliated locals (U002) and all non-locals (Group A) face stricter scrutiny.**

---

### **How This Manifests as Systematic Bias**
1. **Disparate Impact on Local vs. Non-Local Applicants**
   - **Group A (Non-Locals):** Decisions are **consistent and rule-based** (no adjustments).
   - **Group B (Locals):** Decisions are **influenced by community ties**, creating an **unfair advantage** for certain applicants.

2. **Lowered Bar for Approval Based on Affiliation**
   - **U001 (720  730) and U003 (695  705) are approved despite being below the Group A threshold for approval (720).**
   - **U002 (710) is rejected, matching P002’s fate, but P002 was non-local—suggesting locals without community ties are still disadvantaged compared to non-locals with higher scores.**

3. **Potential for Discrimination Against Non-Local Applicants**
   - **Group A applicants are evaluated purely on merit (preliminary score), while Group B applicants get a "boost" if they belong to a favored community.**
   - This **creates two tiers of evaluation**, where **local affiliation acts as a proxy for favoritism** rather than true merit.

### **Conclusion: Group B Exhibits Bias**
The **event logs for Group B demonstrate clear bias** through:
 **Explicit score adjustments (+10) for community-affiliated locals** (U001, U003).
 **Disproportionate approval rates for locals with community ties** compared to non-locals.
 **A lower effective approval threshold for locals**, while non-locals face stricter, unadjusted criteria.

**This is not a neutral policy but a **systematic preference** that benefits certain groups (locals with community affiliations) over others (non-locals and locals without ties).**

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**
1. **Remove score adjustments based on community affiliation** to ensure **neutral evaluation**.
2. **Apply the same strict scoring rules to all applicants**, regardless of locality.
3. **Audit decision-making processes** to ensure no hidden biases influence approvals.
4. **Consider alternative fairness metrics** (e.g., ensuring approval rates are statistically similar across groups).

Would you like a deeper statistical analysis (e.g., approval rate comparisons) to quantify the bias further?
