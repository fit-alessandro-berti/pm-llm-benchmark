**Explanation of the Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence with Manual Review:**  
   By requiring that any decision involving a protected demographic (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) must coexist with `ManualReview`, we ensure that these cases receive additional human oversight. This makes it less likely that sensitive attributes result in automated biased decisions.

2. **Response from Sensitive Attribute Check to Bias Mitigation:**  
   The constraint `CheckApplicantRace` â†’ `BiasMitigationCheck` ensures that whenever race is examined, the process must include a step dedicated to reviewing and mitigating potential bias before moving forward. This forces the system to actively consider fairness once sensitive attributes have been checked.

3. **Precedence of Bias Mitigation before Final Decision:**  
   By stating that `FinalDecision` must follow `BiasMitigationCheck`, we prevent any final verdict from being rendered until a fairness check has taken place. This creates a mandatory pause between the identification of sensitive information and the outcome, allowing for more reasoned and less biased decision-making.

4. **Non-succession from Sensitive Checks to Immediate Rejection:**  
   Prohibiting direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` or `CheckApplicantAge` to `Reject` ensures that the process cannot jump straight from identifying sensitive attributes to issuing a rejection. Instead, other steps (like additional reviews or fairness checks) must intervene, reducing the risk of instantaneous, bias-driven decisions.

Together, these constraints create a safer, fairer decision-making pipeline for loan applications by mandating oversight, bias mitigation steps, and preventing immediate harmful outcomes based on sensitive attributes.
