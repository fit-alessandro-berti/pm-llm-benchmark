### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

The temporal profile reveals several irregularities in the average time intervals (in seconds) and standard deviations between activity pairs, suggesting deviations from a standard process flow:

1. **('R', 'P')**: Average ~25 hours (90000 seconds) with an unusually low STDEV (3600 seconds, ~1 hour). This tight variance implies highly consistent, possibly scripted or automated approvals without natural variability.
   
2. **('P', 'N')**: Extremely long average (604800 seconds, ~7 days) with high STDEV (172800 seconds, ~2 days). This indicates inconsistent and prolonged delays in notification post-approval.

3. **('A', 'C')**: Short average (7200 seconds, ~2 hours) from assignment to closure, which is suspiciously fast given intermediate steps like evaluation and approval are expected.

4. **('E', 'N')**: Very rapid average (300 seconds, ~5 minutes) with low STDEV (60 seconds), suggesting rushed or skipped transitions that bypass realistic review times.

Other pairs like ('R', 'A') and ('N', 'C') appear more reasonable, but these stand out as potential flags for process manipulation, errors, or shortcuts.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

- **Rigid timing in R to P**: Could result from automated approval bots or pre-scheduled scripts that trigger approvals at fixed intervals, ignoring case complexity, possibly to meet internal KPIs or game metrics.
  
- **Prolonged and variable P to N**: Likely due to backlogs in notification systems, manual customer outreach delays, or resource shortages in customer service teams, exacerbated by high claim volumes or weekends/holidays.

- **Quick A to C**: Indicates premature closures, such as claims being auto-closed without full evaluation (e.g., low-value or duplicate claims), or adjusters bypassing steps for efficiency, potentially leading to fraud or oversight.

- **Rapid E to N**: Might reflect automated notifications firing immediately after evaluation without human review, or data entry errors where timestamps are backdated/clustered artificially.

Overall, these could stem from systemic issues like poor workflow automation, inconsistent adjuster behavior, or external factors such as batch processing during off-hours.

### Proposed Verification SQL Queries

Use these PostgreSQL queries on the `claim_events` table (with joins to `claims` and `adjusters` where relevant) to pinpoint anomalous claims and correlations. They compute time differences in seconds and flag outliers (e.g., using a simple threshold of avg ± 3*STDEV for detection).

1. **Claims with anomalous R to P timing (outside 90000 ± 3*3600 seconds)**:
   ```sql
   WITH ra_times AS (
       SELECT ce1.claim_id,
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
         AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT claim_id, r_to_p_seconds
   FROM ra_times
   WHERE ABS(r_to_p_seconds - 90000) > (3 * 3600)
   ORDER BY r_to_p_seconds;
   ```

2. **Claims with prolonged P to N delays (> 604800 + 3*172800 seconds), correlated with adjusters**:
   ```sql
   WITH pn_times AS (
       SELECT ce1.claim_id, ce1.resource AS approver_resource,
              a.name AS approver_name, a.region,
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_seconds
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM pn_times
   WHERE p_to_n_seconds > (604800 + 3 * 172800)
   ORDER BY p_to_n_seconds DESC;
   ```

3. **Claims closed too quickly after A (A to C < 7200 - 3*3600 seconds), checking intermediate steps**:
   ```sql
   WITH ac_times AS (
       SELECT ce1.claim_id,
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_seconds,
              COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN 1 END) AS intermediate_steps
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
         AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
       GROUP BY ce1.claim_id, ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM ac_times
   WHERE a_to_c_seconds < (7200 - 3 * 3600) OR intermediate_steps = 0
   ORDER BY a_to_c_seconds;
   ```

4. **Claims with rapid E to N (< 300 - 3*60 seconds), filtered by claim type and customer**:
   ```sql
   WITH en_times AS (
       SELECT ce1.claim_id,
              c.claim_type, c.customer_id, c.submission_date,
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
         AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
   )
   SELECT *
   FROM en_times
   WHERE e_to_n_seconds < (300 - 3 * 60)
   ORDER BY e_to_n_seconds;
   ```

5. **Summary of anomaly frequency by resource/adjuster across all flagged pairs**:
   ```sql
   SELECT resource,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN pair = 'R-P' THEN 1 END) AS rp_anomalies,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN pair = 'P-N' THEN 1 END) AS pn_anomalies,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN pair = 'A-C' THEN 1 END) AS ac_anomalies,
          COUNT(CASE WHEN pair = 'E-N' THEN 1 END) AS en_anomalies
   FROM (
       -- Subquery for each pair's anomalies (reuse logic from above)
       SELECT claim_id, resource, 'R-P' AS pair FROM (/* Insert ra_times anomaly CTE */) anomalies_rp
       UNION ALL
       SELECT claim_id, resource, 'P-N' AS pair FROM (/* Insert pn_times anomaly CTE */) anomalies_pn
       -- Similarly for others
   ) all_anomalies
   GROUP BY resource
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5  -- Flag high-frequency offenders
   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
   ```

These queries can be executed sequentially to drill down from broad anomalies to specific claims, adjusters, or patterns, enabling targeted investigations. Adjust thresholds based on business-defined ZETA scores if available.
