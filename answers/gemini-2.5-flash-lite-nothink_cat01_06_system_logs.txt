## Explanation of Logic

The transformation into a process mining event log was based on the following principles:

1.  **Case Identification:**
    *   **Document-Centric Approach:** The primary heuristic for identifying a new case was the opening or focusing on a *new document file* (identified by the `Window Title`) or a *new application session* that doesn't seem directly related to the previous one.
    *   **Application Context:** A `SWITCH` event signifies a potential transition to a new logical task or case, especially when switching between distinct application types (e.g., from Word to Chrome, or Chrome to Acrobat).
    *   **Sequential Activity Grouping:** Events occurring within the same application and window title, in sequence, were grouped into the same case. A new case was initiated when a `SWITCH` event led to a different application or window title.
    *   **Handling Multiple Documents:** The user worked on `Document1.docx` and then `Quarterly_Report.docx` in Microsoft Word. These were treated as separate cases because the window titles were distinct, implying different documents were being worked on. The initial `FOCUS` on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at 08:59:50 was initially ambiguous, but the subsequent focus on `Document1.docx` at 09:00:00 and the series of activities associated with it strongly suggested a new working session. Later, when the user returns to `Quarterly_Report.docx` after working with Excel, this was identified as a new case (Case 5).

2.  **Activity Naming:**
    *   **Abstraction from Raw Actions:** Low-level actions like `FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`, `SWITCH`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, and `HIGHLIGHT` were mapped to more descriptive, higher-level activities that represent a meaningful step in a user's workflow.
    *   **`FOCUS` and initial `TYPING`/`CLICK`:** An initial `FOCUS` event on a document followed by interaction activities (like `TYPING` or `CLICK` to open/reply) often indicates the start of a new task related to that document or application. This was generalized to activities like "Start Document Editing", "Start Email Interaction", "Start Document Review", and "Start Spreadsheet Editing".
    *   **`TYPING`:** This was mapped to "Write Document", "Write Email", or "Update Spreadsheet Data" based on the application context. The `Keys` attribute was preserved as a useful detail.
    *   **`SAVE`:** Mapped to generic "Save Document", "Save Spreadsheet", etc.
    *   **`SWITCH`:** This event was primarily used as a trigger for case identification. The activity itself wasn't explicitly named in the log as a distinct step for the *target* case, but rather as the transition *between* cases. For instance, the `SWITCH` from Word to Chrome initiated Case 2. The initial `FOCUS` on the target application after the switch effectively marks the start of the new case's first activity.
    *   **`CLICK`:** This was contextualized based on the `Action` attribute. If it was to open an email, it's "Open Email". If it was to reply, it's "Compose Email Reply". If it was to send, it's "Send Email".
    *   **`SCROLL`:** Mapped to generic "Navigate Document" or "Navigate Email", indicating user exploration.
    *   **`HIGHLIGHT`:** Mapped to "Highlight Document Content" to represent a specific annotation or focus on text.
    *   **`CLOSE`:** Mapped to "Close Document" to indicate the end of interaction with that specific document instance.

This approach aims to provide a clear, process-oriented view of the user's activities, allowing for analysis of workflows, task sequences, and application usage patterns.
