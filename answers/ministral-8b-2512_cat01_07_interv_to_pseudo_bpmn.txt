### **Invoice Approval Process Model**
**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Workflow
**Scope:** Accounts Payable (AP) + Purchasing + Department Managers
**Key Artifacts:** Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Approval Notifications, Supplier Communications

---

#### **1. Start Event**
- **Trigger:** Invoice arrives (via email or system upload).
- **Input:** Invoice document (physical or digital).

---

#### **2. Activities & Sequence Flow**
*(Roles: AP Clerk [Mary], Purchasing Officer [Dan], Department Manager [Carlos], AP Supervisor [Rita], Supplier Relationship Manager [Karen])*

##### **A. Initial Validation (AP Clerk)**
1. **Check for PO Number**
   - *Activity:* AP Clerk reviews invoice for a valid PO number.
   - *Outcome:*
     - **If PO missing:**
       - **Activity:** Send email to supplier requesting PO details.
       - **Gateway:** *Exclusive (XOR)*
         - **Path 1:** Supplier provides PO  Proceed to **Log Invoice in System** (Step 2).
         - **Path 2:** Supplier does not respond  Escalate to **AP Supervisor** (Step 10).
     - **If PO present:**
       - **Activity:** Log invoice into accounting system (creates record with PO reference).

2. **Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation**
   - *Activity:* AP Clerk emails invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan) with request to confirm receipt of goods/services.
   - *Artifact:* Email confirmation required.

---

##### **B. Purchasing Validation (Dan)**
3. **Compare Invoice to PO**
   - *Activity:* Purchasing Officer (Dan) opens PO and compares:
     - Quantities, prices, delivery charges, line items.
   - *Outcome:*
     - **If discrepancy found:**
       - **Gateway:** *Exclusive (XOR)*
         - **Path 1:** Discrepancy resolvable (e.g., minor error):
           - *Activity:* Contact supplier directly or ask AP Clerk to hold invoice.
           - *Artifact:* Corrected invoice or clarification email.
           - *Flow:* Return to **Check for PO Number** (Step 1) or **Log Invoice in System** (Step 2).
         - **Path 2:** Discrepancy unresolved (e.g., missing items, pricing error):
           - *Activity:* Escalate to **AP Supervisor** (Step 10).
     - **If no discrepancy:**
       - *Activity:* Send confirmation email to AP Clerk.

---

##### **C. Invoice Matching (AP Clerk)**
4. **Match Invoice to PO in System**
   - *Activity:* AP Clerk verifies invoice line items against PO in the accounting system.
   - *Outcome:*
     - **If mismatch:**
       - *Activity:* Email Purchasing Officer to clarify.
       - *Gateway:* *Exclusive (XOR)*
         - **Path 1:** Issue resolved  Proceed to **Request Manager Approval** (Step 5).
         - **Path 2:** Issue unresolved  Escalate to **AP Supervisor** (Step 10).
     - **If match:**
       - *Activity:* Proceed to **Request Manager Approval** (Step 5).

---

##### **D. Manager Approval (Carlos)**
5. **Request Manager Approval**
   - *Trigger:* System sends automatic email notification to Department Manager (Carlos) with:
     - Invoice details, PO, and Purchasing confirmation.
   - *Activity:* Carlos reviews:
     - Quantities, pricing, budget alignment, special notes.
   - *Outcome:*
     - **If approved:**
       - *Activity:* Carlos hits "Approve" in the system.
       - *Flow:* Proceed to **Schedule for Payment** (Step 6).
     - **If rejected/suspicious:**
       - *Activity:* Carlos rejects or asks AP Clerk to hold invoice.
       - *Gateway:* *Exclusive (XOR)*
         - **Path 1:** AP Clerk resolves issue (e.g., supplier clarification)  Return to **Check for PO Number** (Step 1).
         - **Path 2:** Issue unresolved  Escalate to **AP Supervisor** (Step 10).

---

##### **E. Payment Scheduling (AP Clerk)**
6. **Schedule for Payment**
   - *Activity:* AP Clerk adds approved invoice to the next payment run.
   - *End Event:* Invoice processed for payment.

---

#### **3. Gateways & Decision Points**
| **Gateway**               | **Type**       | **Conditions**                                                                 | **Paths**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PO Validation             | XOR           | PO present/absent                                                           | Proceed to log invoice or request PO from supplier.                       |
| Purchasing Discrepancy    | XOR           | Discrepancy resolvable/unresolvable                                           | Resolve or escalate to supervisor.                                         |

---

#### **4. Exceptions & Variations**
*(Handled by AP Supervisor [Rita] or Supplier Relationship Manager [Karen])*

7. **Escalation to AP Supervisor (Rita)**
   - *Trigger:* AP Clerk or Purchasing cannot resolve issues (e.g., missing PO, unresolved discrepancies).
   - *Activities:*
     - Contact supplier (via Karen if needed) for clarification/correction.
     - For informal contracts (no PO):
       - Work with department heads to create retrospective PO or reject invoice.
     - Ensure invoice doesn’t get stuck indefinitely.
   - *Outcome:*
     - **If resolved:** Return to **Check for PO Number** (Step 1) or **Log Invoice in System** (Step 2).
     - **If rejected:** Close invoice without payment.

8. **Supplier Involvement (Karen)**
   - *Trigger:* AP or Purchasing requests supplier intervention (e.g., missing PO, pricing dispute).
   - *Activities:*
     - Contact supplier to provide missing PO or confirm correct pricing.
     - Verify against contract terms.
   - *Flow:* Return resolved invoice to AP Clerk for reprocessing.

#### **5. Roles & Responsibilities**
| **Role**                  | **Key Activities**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AP Clerk (Mary)**       | Initial validation, logging, forwarding to Purchasing, matching, scheduling payment. |
| **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** | Validates invoice against PO; confirms receipt.                                  |
| **Department Manager (Carlos)** | Final approval/rejection based on budget and details.                          |
| **AP Supervisor (Rita)**  | Resolves exceptions, coordinates between departments/suppliers.                 |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** | Mediates supplier issues (PO, pricing, contracts).                          |

---

#### **6. Artifacts & Data Flow**
- **Inputs:**
  - Invoice (physical/digital).
  - Purchase Order (PO) reference.
  - System notifications (approval requests, discrepancies).
- **Outputs:**
  - Logged invoice records.
  - Approval/rejection emails.
  - Payment scheduling entries.
- **Shared Documents:**
  - Corrected invoices (if supplier provides updates).
  - Retrospective POs (for informal contracts).

---

#### **7. Ambiguities & Notes**
1. **PO Handling:**
   - *Uncertainty:* Some invoices may lack POs (e.g., informal services). Rita handles these via retrospective POs or rejection.
   - *Clarification Needed:* Is there a threshold for informal contracts (e.g., dollar amount)?

2. **Escalation Paths:**
   - *Variation:* Mary mentions escalating to her supervisor for unresolved discrepancies, while Rita confirms her role. The model assumes Rita is Mary’s supervisor.

3. **Supplier Interaction:**
   - Karen’s role is indirect; her involvement is triggered by AP/Purchasing requests. No direct system access.

4. **Payment Timing:**
   - The process ends at "schedule for payment," but the actual payment execution is not detailed (assumed to be a separate process).

5. **Frequency of Manager Rejections:**
   - Carlos notes this happens "once every couple of months," but no trigger thresholds are defined (e.g., budget overages).

---
### **Visualization Guidance for BPMN Conversion**
To convert this to a BPMN diagram:
1. **Start Event**  "Invoice Arrives."
2. **Pooled Lanes** for each role (AP Clerk, Purchasing, Manager, Supervisor, Supplier).
3. **Gateways** as XOR decisions (e.g., PO present/absent, approval/rejection).
4. **Message Flows** for emails between roles (e.g., AP Clerk  Purchasing, Supplier  AP).
5. **Intermediate Catch Events** for system notifications (e.g., manager approval request).
6. **Ad-hoc Subprocess** for the "Escalation to AP Supervisor" (Step 10) to show parallel coordination with suppliers.
7. **Data Objects** for artifacts like the PO, invoice, and approval emails.

This model balances the stakeholders’ perspectives while highlighting areas for clarification (e.g., informal contracts, escalation thresholds). Would you like to refine any specific part further?
