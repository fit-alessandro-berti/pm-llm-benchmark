The picture is a BPMN 2.0 (Business-Process-Model-and-Notation) diagram that models how a computer-hardware shop prepares and hands over parcels for shipment.  
The drawing is organised as a pool called “Dispatch of goods – Computer Hardware Shop”. Inside that pool there are three horizontal swim-lanes that show who does what:

1. Logistics (top lane)  
2. Secretary (middle lane)  
3. Warehouse (bottom lane)

High-level flow

1. A none-start-event labelled “Ship goods” triggers the procedure in the Secretary lane.  
2. The Secretary immediately reaches a parallel gateway (black “+”) that starts two branches:  
   • One branch goes straight down to the Warehouse so packing can start early.  
   • The other branch stays in the Secretary lane where the administrative shipping tasks are clarified.

Secretary lane (administrative branch)

3. “Clarify shipment method” (task).  
4. Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
   • If “no”, the flow returns to the parallel join gateway further on.  
   • If “yes”, the Secretary must:  
     a. “Get 3 offers from logistic companies”  
     b. “Select logistic company and place order”  
5. The two administrative branches reunite in an exclusive merge gateway.

Logistics lane (insurance branch)

6. Simultaneously, the Logistics department checks whether the parcel needs insurance:  
   • Data store “Customer information” is read in “Check if insurance is required”.  
   • Exclusive gateway “If insurance necessary” decides:  
     – If insurance is needed, task “Insure parcel” is executed and then flows to “Write package label”.  
     – If not, the flow goes directly to “Write package label”.  
7. The Logistics branch also joins the administrative branch in a merge gateway.

Warehouse lane (physical branch)

8. “Package goods” task starts right after the parallel split (step 2).  
   • A boundary timer event marked “48 hours” is attached; if packing takes too long, the flow triggers “Notify customer about delay”.  
9. After packing, sequence flow joins the other branches in a parallel gateway (black “+”).

Final consolidation and finishing steps (Warehouse)

10. Parallel join ensures all preceding streams (administration, insurance/label, and packing) are completed.  
11. “Fill out shipment paperwork” (Warehouse).  
12. “Move package to pickup area”.  
13. End event “Shipment prepared”.

Notational elements used

• Circle = start event; bold circle = end event.  
• Diamond with “X” = exclusive gateway (decision/merge).  
• Diamond with “+” = parallel gateway (fork/join).  
• Document icon = data object (“Order details”).  
• Cylinder = data store (“Customer information”).  
• Square with folded corner = user/regular task.  
• Little clock on the boundary = interrupting timer boundary event.

Interpretation

The model shows three roles working in parallel so that physical packing does not have to wait for paperwork, yet everything is synchronised before the parcel is released to the carrier. Optional activities (insurance, special handling offers) are only carried out when required, keeping the process efficient.
