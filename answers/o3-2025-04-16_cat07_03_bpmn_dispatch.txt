The picture is a BPMN (BusinessProcessModelandNotation) diagram that shows how a computerhardware shop prepares and dispatches a parcel.  
The diagram is drawn as one pool called “Dispatch of goods – Computer hardware shop,” subdivided into two horizontal lanes:

1. Logistics (upper lane)  
2. Warehouse (lower lane)

Main flow, step by step

1. Start event – “Ship goods.”  
2. Parallelgateway split ( + symbol ) opens two threads:
   • Logistics clarifies the shipment method.  
   • Warehouse can start packaging the goods right away.

Logistics path
3. Task “Clarify shipment method.”  
4. Exclusive gateway “Special handling?”  
   • No  go to “Check if insurance is required.”  
   • Yes  go to “Get 3 offers from logistic companies,” then “Select logistic company and place order.”
5. Join back into the flow at a merging gateway.
6. Task “Check if insurance is required” (uses customer data).  
7. Exclusive gateway:
   • If insurance is necessary  “Insure parcel,” then rejoin.  
   • Otherwise flow straight ahead.
8. Task “Write package label.”  
9. The logistics branch waits for the warehouse branch at a gateway that synchronises both threads.

Warehouse path
10. Task “Package goods.”  
    • A timer boundary event (“48 hours”) is attached: if packaging exceeds two days, the flow triggers “Notify customer about delay,” after which it returns to the main packaging task.
11. Packaging finishes and reaches a merging gateway that waits for the logistics side.

Common completion
12. Once both paths join, perform “Fill out shipment paperwork.”  
13. “Move package to pickup area.”  
14. End event – “Shipment prepared.”

Key elements and what they mean

• Pool & lanes: show organisational responsibility (Logistics vs. Warehouse).  
• Tasks: rectangles with rounded corners (e.g., “Package goods”).  
• Gateways: diamonds  
  – +  = parallel (AND)  
  – X  = exclusive (XOR)  
• Data objects: “Order details,” “Customer information” feed some tasks.  
• Timer boundary event: clock symbol on “Package goods” means escalation after 48 h.  
• Sequenceflows: solid arrows show the order of work.

Overall story

• As soon as an order is ready to ship, Logistics and Warehouse work largely in parallel.  
• Logistics decides on shipping method, insurance, labeling, and eventually books a carrier.  
• Warehouse packs the goods; if it takes too long, the customer is notified.  
• When both branches are finished, paperwork is completed, the parcel is moved to the pickup zone, and the shipment is officially prepared.
