### Analysis of POWL Models

#### **POWL Model 1**
- **Standard Hire-to-Retire Process**: Typically, activities proceed in a linear sequence: Post Job Ad  Screen Candidates  Conduct Interviews  Make Hiring Decision  Onboard Employee  Add to Payroll  Close Case.
- **Model 1 Analysis**:  
  - **Post_Job_Ad (Transition)** leads directly to **Screen_Candidates (Transition)**.
  - From **Screen_Candidates**, there are two outgoing edges: one leading to **Conduct_Interviews (Transition)** and another directly to **Make_Hiring_Decision (Transition)**. This introduces an anomaly because typically, screening candidates precedes conducting interviews. The direct path from screening to making a hiring decision bypasses the interview step, which is a clear deviation from the standard process.
  - After making the decision, the model follows the typical sequence: Onboard  Payroll  Close. 

**Anomalies in Model 1**: 
- **Deviation 1**: The process skips the interview phase directly after screening candidates. This could lead to a hasty hiring decision without thorough candidate evaluation, potentially impacting employee fit and organizational goals negatively.

#### **POWL Model 2**
- **Standard Hire-to-Retire Process**: As stated above, the typical sequence involves posting an ad, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a decision, onboarding, payroll processing, and closing the case.
- **Model 2 Analysis**:  
  - **Post_Job_Ad (Transition)** leads to both **Screen_Candidates (Transition)** and **Conduct_Interviews (Transition)**. This allows for flexibility in whether candidates are screened before or during interviews, but it still maintains a core linear sequence.
  - The model includes a loop for onboarding: `*(Onboard, skip)`, allowing for the possibility of repeating onboarding steps if necessary. However, this introduces complexity without clear context for when such loops should occur.
  - After making a decision, the process follows **loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close**. This suggests potential rework or flexibility in payroll processes, but still adheres to the core hiring sequence.

**Anomalies in Model 2**:
- **Deviation 1**: The introduction of a loop for onboarding and XOR for payroll processing adds unnecessary complexity without clear justification. These elements might confuse stakeholders and introduce additional costs or delays if not properly managed.
- **Deviation 2**: While the model maintains a core sequence, the lack of explicit logic guiding when these loops should activate could lead to inefficiencies or errors in process execution.

### Conclusion

**Which Model More Closely Aligns with Normative Hire-to-Retire Process?**

**Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process due to its straightforward sequence and minimal deviations:

- It directly skips the interview step after screening, which is a clear anomaly.
- The subsequent activities follow the standard sequence (decide  onboard  payroll  close).

**Model 2**, while flexible in terms of timing (through loops and XOR), introduces unnecessary complexity and potential for errors without clear guidelines on when these additional elements should be activated. This complexity deviates significantly from the expected simplicity and linearity of a well-structured Hire-to-Retire process.

**Justification**: The anomalies in Model 1 are more severe and fundamentally violate the essence of the hiring process, whereas Model 2 introduces complications that do not align with standard business practices without clear operational justification. Thus, Model 1 is preferable for its adherence to normative process logic and clarity in executing the hiring workflow.
