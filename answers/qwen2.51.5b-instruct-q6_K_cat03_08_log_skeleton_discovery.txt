To model this log skeleton, we'll create a series of events and statuses that track the progress of each fine throughout its lifecycle. This information helps in understanding various stages including initial notification, appeal to different bodies (Prefecture, Judge), fines imposed or credited collection.

### Sample Log Skeleton Model

1. **Fine Creation Event**
   - Key: `create-fine`
 
2. **Notification Sent**
   - Key: `send-notification`
   - `fineId`: ID of the fine
   - `outcome`: "Sent"

3. **Fines Impose Penalty**
   - Key: `_insert_fine_notification -> add_penalty`

4. **Fine Appeals to Judge/ Appeal Prefecture**
   - Additional outcome details: 
     * `appealOutcome` (e.g., "Appealed to Prefecture" or "Appealed to Judge")
     - If appeal is accepted,
       * Change status to `Awaiting Decision`
     - If appeal is rejected:
       * Update the previous state with penalty for further actions

5. **Appeals Outcome (Accept/Reject)**
   - Key: `_insert_fine_notification -> [action]`

6. **Credit Collection Attempted or Pending**
   - Extra key after any appeals acceptance
     * `creditStatus` ("Pending", "In Progress")

7. **Fine Payment Process**
   - Additional conditions:
        - If penalty is due based on schedule, go to payment 
        - Otherwise (payment due at specific time),
          * Update fine status to reflect pending payment

8. **Fine Appeal Follow Up**
   - Key: `appeal-follow-up`
   
9. **Final Outcome Notifications**
   - Additional details:
      - For appeals or credit collection outcomes,
       * Send a notification if they are ready for next action, e.g., "Fines Pending Payment"
  
10. **Final Payment Process Step**
    - After payment is made, send notification

### Sample Data
```
| key                      | fineId  |
+-------------------------+---------+
| create-fine              |         |
+----------------------------+-----+
| send-notification        |         |
+---------------------------+----------|
| _insert_fine_notification -> add_penalty       |          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+

key                                  fineId             outcome
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+------------+
| insert_date_of_appeal_for_prefecture        2024-03-15      "Sent"         |
| send_appeal_to_prefecture_by_date           2024-03-15      "Sent"         |    
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Event Correlation**: Ensure that each action or event has a clear key and related fineId for tracking purposes.
- **Status Flow**: Maintain readability through log entries. If multiple actions lead to the same outcome, keep them grouped logically.
- **Outcome Tracking**: Include specific outcomes or statuses (like "Sent", "Awaiting Decision") as tags in your model.

This skeleton provides a systematic way on how to track and document each fine throughout its entire lifecycle from creation to final payment or appeal.
