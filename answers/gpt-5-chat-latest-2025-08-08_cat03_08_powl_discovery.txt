Got it — the event log you’ve shared contains repeating inspection loops (both for **IQC** and for **TST/RT**), optional skips (**LB** may be skipped, IQC can be skipped), and strict sequential ordering for certain core manufacturing phases.  

We can model this process as follows in **POWL** using the `StrictPartialOrder` and operator nodes (\*, X):

---

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

#### 1. **Core sequential structure**
From logs:
1. `OR`  `MS`  `QS`  
   This sequence is fixed.
2. After QS, an **assembly+inspection loop** can occur.
3. Afterwards, a **testing+retesting loop** occurs.
4. Then `PK`  `LB?` (optional)  `DP`  `D`.

---

#### 2. **Assembly and IQC loop**
We see:
- AS is followed by IQC sometimes, but can be repeated multiple times  essentially a loop between **AS** and **IQC**.
- IQC step is optional (some cases go directly to next stage without IQC).

In POWL terms:
- `* ( AS, IQC )` means:  
  - Perform AS (`A` in loop entry)  
  - Either exit the loop OR execute IQC and return to AS.

#### 3. **Testing and Re-Testing loop**
Observed:
- TST happens always first.
- Sometimes RT occurs, leading back to TST again.
- Can happen multiple cycles.
  
In POWL:
- `* ( TST, RT )`

#### 4. **Optional Labeling step**
- LB sometimes exists after packaging (PK) but can be skipped.
- That’s an exclusive choice (XOR) between LB and silent transition (skip).

In POWL:
- `X ( LB,  )`

#### 5. **Overall sequential order**
Putting it all together:

```
OR  MS  QS  AS+IQC loop  TST+RT loop  PK  (LB or skip)  DP  D
```

### **POWL Model Code Representation**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define atomic activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
tau = SilentTransition()

# Step 2: Define loops
assembly_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
testing_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Step 3: Optional labeling (XOR LB or skip)
labeling_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, tau])

# Step 4: Create partial order structure
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, assembly_loop, testing_loop, PK, labeling_choice, DP, D])

# Step 5: Define order relations
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_loop)
root.order.add_edge(assembly_loop, testing_loop)
root.order.add_edge(testing_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_choice)
root.order.add_edge(labeling_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

### **Visual Logical Representation**

```
[OR]  [MS]  [QS]   * (AS, IQC)   * (TST, RT)  [PK]   X (LB, )  [DP]  [D]
```

- `* (AS, IQC)` = Assembly loop with quality checks.
- `* (TST, RT)` = Testing loop with re-testing on fail.
- `X (LB, )` = Optional Labeling step (skip allowed).

---

### **Concurrency Notes**
From the given logs, no two activities occur concurrently — so the **StrictPartialOrder** sequence here is effectively linear with loops and choices embedded.

---

###  Final Answer

The final POWL **structure** (logical form):

```
PO = StrictPartialOrder(
  nodes = {
    OR,
    MS,
    QS,
    * (AS, IQC),
    * (TST, RT),
    PK,
    X (LB, ),
    DP,
    D
  },
  order = {
    OR  MS,
    MS  QS,
    QS  * (AS, IQC),
    * (AS, IQC)  * (TST, RT),
    * (TST, RT)  PK,
    PK  X (LB, ),
    X (LB, )  DP,
    DP  D
  }
)
```

If you want, I can **also draw this as a flow diagram** so it's easy to visualize before implementing it in code.  
Do you want me to produce that diagram?
