Below is a structured, indepth response tailored to Precision Parts Inc.’s highmix job shop environment. It links processmining evidence to concrete, advanced scheduling strategies and a rigorous evaluation/continuousimprovement framework.

# 1. **Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **1.1. Event Log Preparation & Modeling**
**Goal:** Reconstruct *actual* job flows and machine sequences.

- **Event log cleaning & structuring**
  - Case ID = Job ID (e.g., JOB7001).
  - Activity lifecycle = Queue Entry  Setup Start/End  Task Start/End.
  - Include attributes: machine, operator, priority, due date, planned vs. actual duration, setup flag, breakdown events.
- **Create multiple perspectives**
  - **Casecentric log:** job routing and flow times.
  - **Resourcecentric log:** machine sequences to study setups.
  - **Objectcentric mining:** link jobs, machines, operators, and breakdown events in a unified view.

### **1.2. Process Discovery & Variant Analysis**
- Use **Inductive Miner / Heuristics Miner** to reconstruct actual routing sequences (Petri nets or BPMN).
- Use **Variant analysis** to:
  - Identify common routing patterns.
  - Compare ontime vs late variants.
  - Detect rework loops or routing deviations.

### **1.3. Performance Metrics from Process Mining**

| KPI Category | Process Mining Technique | How It’s Computed |
|---|---|---|
| **Job Flow / Lead Time** | Performance analysis on case traces | Release  completion; distribution and percentiles |
| **Makespan** | Period aggregation (daily/weekly) | Latest completion – earliest release |
| **Task Waiting Time** | Queue entry  Task start per machine | Median/95th percentile waiting by work center |
| **Resource Utilization** | Resource performance mining | % time busy (processing + setup) vs idle vs down |
| **Setup Time Analysis** | Sequence mining on machine logs | Setup duration by jobtojob transition |
| **Tardiness / Lateness** | Conformance & performance | Completion – due date; % late, avg tardiness |
| **Disruption Impact** | Event correlation analysis | KPI deviations before/after breakdowns/hot jobs |

### **1.4. SequenceDependent Setup Analysis**
- For each machine:
  - Sort jobs by actual execution order.
  - For each job \(j\), link its setup duration to previous job \(j-1\).
  - Build **setup time matrix** indexed by job family/material, e.g.:

  \[
  \text{SetupTime}_{Family_A \rightarrow Family_B}
  \]

- Use clustering (e.g., kmeans on job attributes) to infer setup families.
- Fit regression models to predict setup time based on transition attributes.

### **1.5. Disruption & Priority Change Analysis**
- Mark breakdown periods, hotjob injections, and priority changes.
- Use **timealigned analysis**:
  - Compare queue time distributions immediately before/after breakdown.
  - Identify ripple effects across downstream machines.

---

# 2. **Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Using the above metrics and mining techniques, key inefficiencies can be revealed:

### **2.1. Bottlenecks**
- **Symptoms:** long queues, >90% utilization, high setup ratio.
- **Evidence:** performance spectrum shows long waiting at a specific machine (e.g., Heat Treat).
- **Process mining proof:** resource performance mining + queue time heatmaps.

### **2.2. Poor Task Prioritization**
- Highpriority jobs waiting behind lowpriority jobs.
- **Evidence:** conformance check shows that EDD/priority rules are violated in practice.
- **Variant analysis:** late jobs often follow routes with longer waits at bottleneck machines.

### **2.3. Suboptimal Sequencing**
- Frequent changeovers causing excessive setup time.
- **Evidence:** setup time matrix shows large penalties for certain sequences; actual sequence violates “family” grouping.
- Setup time as % of total machine time unusually high.

### **2.4. Starvation & Downstream Idling**
- Downstream machines idle while upstream queues are large.
- **Evidence:** low utilization with long idle blocks; starvation analysis from event logs.

### **2.5. WIP Volatility / Bullwhip Effect**
- Large fluctuations in WIP due to poorly synchronized release and machine schedules.
- **Evidence:** WIP time series from event log; spikes correlated with breakdowns or hot jobs.

# 3. **Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **3.1. Likely Root Causes**
1. **Local, static dispatching rules** (FCFS/EDD) ignore global impacts.
2. **Lack of realtime visibility**, so schedules aren’t updated after disruptions.
3. **Inaccurate processing & setup estimates**, causing unrealistic plans.
4. **Sequencedependent setups ignored**, leading to frequent expensive changeovers.
5. **Poor coordination between work centers**, causing pushtype behavior and WIP spikes.
6. **Disruptions handled reactively**, not proactively or predictively.

### **3.2. How Process Mining Differentiates Scheduling vs Capacity Issues**
- If utilization is **near 100%** at bottleneck resources and queues are stable  **capacity issue**.
- If utilization is moderate but waiting times are still high  **scheduling logic issue**.
- Compare planned vs actual processing time variability:
  - High variance  reliability/estimation problem.
  - Low variance + high queues  sequencing/dispatching inefficiency.

# 4. **Advanced DataDriven Scheduling Strategies**

Below are three **distinct**, advanced strategies derived from mined insights.

---

## **Strategy 1: Dynamic MultiCriteria Dispatching (ATCSStyle)**
**Core logic:** A priority index calculated in real time per machine that blends due date, remaining processing time, setup penalty, and downstream load.

**Example priority function:**

\[
P_i = \exp\left(-\frac{\max(0, d_i - t - p_i)}{k_1}\right) \times \exp\left(-\frac{s_{prev,i}}{k_2}\right) \times \frac{w_{priority}}{p_i}
\]

Where:
- \(d_i\): due date, \(p_i\): processing time, \(s_{prev,i}\): setup from previous job.
- \(k_1, k_2\) tuned using historical mining.

**How process mining informs it**
- Setup matrix, processing time distributions, downstream congestion times.

**Addresses**
- Poor prioritization
- Excessive setups
- Unbalanced queues

**Expected impact**
-  Tardiness
-  WIP
-  bottleneck throughput

---

## **Strategy 2: Predictive / RollingHorizon Scheduling**
**Core logic:** Use predictive models for task duration and breakdown risk, then run periodic (e.g., hourly) schedule optimization.

**Components**
- **ML models** to predict:
  - Processing time (job × machine × operator).
  - Setup time (sequencedependent).
  - Breakdown probability (MTBF/MTTR).
- **Rolling-horizon optimization** (MIP / metaheuristics).
- **Reschedule when deviations exceed threshold**.

**How process mining informs it**
- Trains ML models with actual performance data.
- Derives routing probabilities and rework likelihood.

**Addresses**
- Unpredictable lead times
- Disruptions
- Inaccurate completion promises

**Expected impact**
-  schedule reliability
-  lateness variation
- More realistic promised dates

---

## **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Family Batching**
**Core logic:** Group jobs into setupcompatible families and sequence them to minimize total changeovers on bottleneck machines.

**Steps**
1. Cluster jobs into setup families using historical transitions.
2. Build **setuptime transition matrix**.
3. Apply sequencing heuristics (TSP or MILP) within duedate windows.
4. Insert urgent jobs via limited “override slots”.

**How process mining informs it**
- Reveals highcost setup transitions and optimal family clusters.

**Addresses**
- High setup time ratio
- Bottleneck overload
- Excessive WIP

**Expected impact**
-  effective capacity at bottlenecks
-  setup time proportion
-  lead time and WIP

---

# 5. **Simulation, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement**

### **5.1. DiscreteEvent Simulation (DES)**
Build a **digital twin** of the job shop using process mining parameters:

| Input Parameter | Mined From Logs |
|---|---|
| Routing probabilities | Variant frequencies |
| Processing time distributions | Task duration data |
| Setup time matrix | Sequence mining |
| Breakdown MTBF/MTTR | Resource logs |
| Job arrival patterns | Release events |
| Priority changes | MES history |

### **5.2. Test Scenarios**
Simulate each strategy under:
- **Baseline load**
- **Peak demand**
- **High breakdown frequency**
- **Increased hot job arrivals**
- **Reduced capacity**

Metrics: tardiness, WIP, throughput, utilization, setup ratio.

### **5.3. Continuous Improvement Framework**
- **Live process mining dashboard** for:
  - Tardiness distribution
  - Queue time drift
  - Setup ratio trends
- **Drift detection** triggers scheduling parameter updates.
- **Automatic model retraining** for predictive scheduling.
- **A/B tests** of rule weights on selected work centers.
