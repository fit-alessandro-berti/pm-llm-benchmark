Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model captures the workflow where a specific XOR branch exists after the skill assessment. This branch allows certain applicants to undergo a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" instead of the "StandardCulturalFit," potentially introducing bias.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the basic transitions (activities)
# Stage 1: Data Loop
resume_parsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

# Stage 2: Sequential Skill Check
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Stage 3: The Biased Branching (XOR)
# One path is the standard check, the other is the potentially biased affiliation check
std_cultural_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFit")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

# Stage 4: Finalization
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 1. Construct the Loop for Data Completeness
# Logic: Execute ResumeParsing. Then loop (RequestMoreInfo -> ResumeParsing) until complete.
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[resume_parsing, request_more_info])

# 2. Construct the Unfair XOR Choice
# Logic: Choose between Standard Cultural Fit OR Community Affiliation Check
bias_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[std_cultural_fit, community_check])

# 3. Construct the Main Partial Order
# Order: Data Loop -> Skill Assessment -> Bias XOR -> Managerial Review -> Final Decision
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[data_loop, skill_assessment, bias_xor, managerial_review, final_decision])

# Add edges to define the sequence
unfair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, bias_xor)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(bias_xor, managerial_review)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" branch. All applicants, regardless of background or local affiliation, must pass through the same "CulturalFitCheck" activity, ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation process.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the basic transitions (activities)
resume_parsing = Transition(label="ResumeParsing")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# In the fair model, there is only one standardized cultural check
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 1. Construct the Loop for Data Completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[resume_parsing, request_more_info])

# 2. Construct the Main Partial Order
# Note: No XOR operator is used for the cultural stage here. It is a direct sequence.
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    data_loop, 
    skill_assessment, 
    cultural_fit_check, 
    managerial_review, 
    final_decision
])

# Add edges to define the sequence
fair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
fair_model.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
fair_model.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
fair_model.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```
