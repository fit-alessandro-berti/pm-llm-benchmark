# Bias Analysis of the Two Event Logs

## Identifying the Biased Log

**Group B's event log exhibits systematic bias**, introduced through the **+5 "Association Boost"** applied during the `CulturalFitCheck` activity for candidates affiliated with the *LocalBusinessLeadersClub*. While Group A's log evaluates all candidates on identical, unadjusted criteria, Group B's log embeds a preferential mechanism that inflates scores based on a social affiliation rather than job-relevant merit.

## How the Bias Manifests

### 1. The Score Adjustment Mechanism
At the `CulturalFitCheck` step, the HR Analyst applies a **+5 point boost** exclusively to candidates who are members of the LocalBusinessLeadersClub. This adjustment is:
- **Not based on demonstrated competence** (skill, personality, or actual cultural alignment)
- **Applied selectively** — only to candidates with a specific social network affiliation
- **Invisible at the decision stage** — by the time the `HiringDecision` is made, the adjusted score appears as a single number (e.g., "65 (Adjusted)"), obscuring the artificial inflation

### 2. Correlation Between Group Membership and Boost Eligibility
A critical structural observation ties the bias directly to group identity:

| Attribute | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---|---|---|
| **LocalResident** | All FALSE | All TRUE |
| **ProfessionalAssociation** | All None | 2 of 3 have membership |
| **Boost Received** | Never | U001 and U003 receive +5 |

Group A candidates are **structurally excluded** from ever receiving the boost because they are non-local residents with no access to the LocalBusinessLeadersClub. The association membership functions as a **proxy for local residency and in-group social networks**, creating a pathway to advantage that is systematically unavailable to the protected group.

### 3. Concrete Outcome Disparities

The most damning comparison is between **U003** and **P002**:

| Metric | P002 (Group A) | U003 (Group B) |
|---|---|---|
| Skill Score | **78** | 75 |
| Personality Score | **75** | 65 |
| Raw Cultural Fit | **60** | 58 |
| Score Adjustment | 0 | **+5** |
| Final Cultural Fit | 60 | 63 |
| **Decision** | **Not Hired** | **Hired** |

P002 **outperforms** U003 on every raw metric — skill, personality, and unadjusted cultural fit — yet is rejected while U003 is hired. The only differentiator is the association-based boost. This is a textbook case of a **less-qualified candidate from the unprotected group being selected over a more-qualified candidate from the protected group** due to a non-merit-based adjustment.

Similarly, **U001** (raw CulturalFit = 60, SkillScore = 80) was hired after a boost to 65, while **P002** (raw CulturalFit = 60, SkillScore = 78) was not — despite comparable profiles. Without the boost, U001's cultural fit would have been identical to P002's, making the divergent outcomes harder to justify.

## Mechanisms of Bias: A Process-Level View

The bias is **embedded mid-process** at a subjective evaluation stage (cultural fit), which is precisely where discretionary adjustments are hardest to audit. By the time the Hiring Manager makes the final call, the inflated score appears legitimate.

## Implications for Fairness and Equity

### Disparate Impact
Even if the boost is facially neutral ("we reward professional engagement"), it produces **disparate impact** because eligibility is structurally tied to local residency and access to specific social networks — attributes that cleanly divide the protected and unprotected groups.

### Opacity and Accountability
The adjustment is embedded within event data but would not necessarily appear in a final scorecard. This makes the bias **difficult to detect through outcome-only audits** and highlights the value of process mining for fairness analysis.

### Compounding Exclusion
The bias reinforces existing social stratification: those already embedded in local professional networks gain a measurable advantage, while outsiders — who may lack access not due to merit but due to geography, socioeconomic background, or other protected characteristics — face a systematically higher bar.

### Undermining Meritocracy
The process nominally uses standardized tests and assessments, creating an **illusion of objectivity**. The association boost subverts this by inserting a subjective, non-validated factor that privileges social capital over demonstrated ability.

## Summary

**Group B's log is biased.** The bias operates through a culturally-coded score adjustment that functions as a proxy advantage for in-group candidates, producing outcomes where objectively weaker candidates from the unprotected group are hired over stronger candidates from the protected group. Remediation would require **removing the association-based adjustment**, auditing the cultural fit assessment for other subjective inflation patterns, and ensuring all scoring criteria are validated against job-relevant performance outcomes.
