To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Identify cases that contain the exact sequence:  
   `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`  `'Create Order'`  `'Confirm Order'`  
   with **no intervening events** from the same case.

2. Among those, filter only the cases where the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **> 5 days**.

3. **Exclude all events** from such cases.

4. Return **all other events** — i.e., events from cases that either:
   - Do not contain the exact sequence, OR
   - Contain the sequence but the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is  5 days.

---

### Strategy:

- Use window functions (`LEAD`) to look ahead within each `case_id` (ordered by `timestamp`) to find direct 3-event sequences.
- Compute the time difference between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` in matching sequences.
- Collect the `case_id`s that satisfy **both** the sequence and the >5-day condition.
- Finally, select all events from `event_log` where `case_id` is **NOT IN** that set.

### DuckDB SQL Query:

```sql
WITH sequence_candidates AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
matching_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_candidates
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL 5 DAYS
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM matching_cases);
```

---

### Explanation:

- **`sequence_candidates`**: For each event, we look at the next two events in the same case (by timestamp) using `LEAD`. This allows us to check for direct 3-event sequences without gaps.
- **`matching_cases`**: We filter for rows where the current activity is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, followed immediately by `'Create Order'`, then `'Confirm Order'`. We also check that the time between `'Create Order'` (next_timestamp) and `'Confirm Order'` (next_next_timestamp) is **more than 5 days**.
- **Final SELECT**: We return all events from cases that are **not** in `matching_cases`.

>  Note: We use `> INTERVAL 5 DAYS` — this correctly excludes cases where the gap is exactly 5 days or less. Only gaps strictly greater than 5 days trigger exclusion.

This query efficiently identifies the unwanted cases and excludes all their events, returning only events from “good” cases as required.
