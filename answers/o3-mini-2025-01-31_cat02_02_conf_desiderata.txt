Below is an analysis of each case based on the strict normative rules and the recommended (desiderata) best practices:


1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Process Constraints)

• Case 1:  
– All activities occur in the proper order.  
 Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
– No normative violations are identified.

• Case 2:  
– Violation 1: The sequence is broken because the Risk Assessment (08:20) is performed before the Credit Check (09:00). The rule requires that the Credit Check always occurs before the Risk Assessment.  
– Violation 2: Following a Rejected Loan Decision, the process forbids finalizing documentation. However, the log shows that a Finalize Documentation activity occurred after the rejection.  
– These actions directly violate the strict constraints.

• Case 3:  
– The process follows the correct order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.  
– No normative sequence or ordering rules are broken, so no serious violations are present according to the strict rules.


2. Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)

• Case 1:  
– This case appears to follow both the normative and the recommended best practices (timely credit check after the application and prompt informing of the applicant). No desiderata missteps are observed.

• Case 2:  
– Although the normative issues in Case 2 are severe, there are no additional timing recommendations specified for this case because the primary focus was on order rather than timing.  
– The key issues here are the sequence and activity type violations, not just delays.

• Case 3:  
– Timing Issues:  
 The Credit Check occurred on 2024-01-14, which is more than 24 hours after the Application Received on 2024-01-12. This deviates from the preferred short time window.  
 The Inform Applicant activity happened on 2024-01-16 at 15:00, which is later than the recommended 48 hours after the Loan Decision (made on 2024-01-14 at 12:00).  
– Follow-Up Call:  
 No Follow-Up Call was performed before closing the case, even though it is recommended to ensure all parties remain aligned.  
– While these deviations are not considered serious (i.e., they do not break the process rules), they represent suboptimal process performance.


3. Interpretations and Justifications

• For Case 2:  
– The early occurrence of the Risk Assessment might be attributed to a human or system error where activities were executed out of order. Alternatively, it might indicate a misunderstood or miscommunicated procedure.  
– Similarly, Finalizing Documentation after a rejection could be due to an operator’s oversight or a misinterpretation of the process guidelines, possibly reflecting a “one-size-fits-all” system response that did not adequately distinguish between approved and rejected cases.

• For Case 3:  
– The delays in performing the Credit Check and informing the applicant may be due to resource constraints, such as backlog or heavy workload on specific days.  
– The absence of a Follow-Up Call might indicate that the team assessed that the existing communications were sufficient. However, adding a follow-up call could help clarify any remaining issues and improve customer satisfaction.  
– These deviations, although not critical for compliance, provide useful feedback on potential process improvements and efficiency gains.


In Summary:

• Only Case 2 violates the strict normative rules by (a) performing the Risk Assessment before the Credit Check and (b) finalizing documentation after a loan has been rejected.  
• Case 3 meets the normative requirements but falls short of the desiderata recommendations regarding timing and follow-up activities.  
• Understanding such deviations can guide process improvement initiatives, with Case 2 requiring immediate remediation and Case 3 serving as a prompt for revisiting performance targets and best practices.
