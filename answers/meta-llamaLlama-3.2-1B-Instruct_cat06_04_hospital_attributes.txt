In the context of process and event logs, fairness refers to the proportion of correct outputs among all possible correct outputs. In this context, attributes are sensitive for fairness if they significantly impact the probability of a correct output. Here's a breakdown of the attributes that could be sensitive for fairness:

1. **Case:gender**: The probability of a correct outcome ( Diagnosis or Treatment successful) changes based on the gender of the citizen. If the cases are evenly split between male and female, the probability of a correct outcome could be significantly skewed.
2. **Resource:resource**: The resource is related to a specific diagnosis, and the probability of a correct outcome (Diagnosis or Treatment successful) may vary based on the resource. For example, if there are more Doc. Low resources available, the probability of a correct outcome may increase.
3. **Start_timestamp**: The start timestamp is important because it determines the total time elapsed and how the process unfolds. If the process has a significant number of early starts or interruptions, the fairness of the process could be affected.
4. **Time:timestamp**: Time is also an important factor, as it determines the elapsed time and how the process completes. A significant time gap between the start and end of the process could impact fairness.

However, the following attributes do not seem to be sensitive for fairness:

1. **Concept:name**: This attribute seems to be unrelated to the process and event logs.
2. **Case:citizen**: This attribute appears to be unrelated to the process and event logs.

To further investigate fairness, you could:

* Calculate the proportion of correct outcomes for each attribute.
* Plot a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of correct outcomes.
* Use statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA, regression analysis) to examine if there are significant differences in the proportion of correct outcomes across different attributes.
* Use simulation-based methods to test the robustness of your analysis against different scenarios and scenarios.
