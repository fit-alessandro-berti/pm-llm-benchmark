Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the two parts: the normative rules (strict) and the desiderata (recommended). The user provided an event log with three cases and wants me to identify violations and suboptimal behaviors.

Starting with Part 1, the normative constraints. The sequence must be Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [Finalize Documentation if approved]  Close Case. Also, certain ordering rules must be followed. Let's check each case.

Case 1: Looking at the activities in order. They received the application, did credit check, risk assessment, approved, informed, finalized docs, closed. Everything seems to follow the sequence. No violations here.

Case 2: Application received, then Risk Assessment before Credit Check. That's a clear violation because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Also, after rejection, they finalized documentation which is not allowed. So two violations here: wrong order and finalizing after rejection.

Case 3: The activities are in the correct order. Application received, credit check (though delayed), risk assessment, approved, informed (late), finalized, closed. The order is correct. But there's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. The timing of Credit Check and informing the applicant are late but that's only a recommendation violation.

Now for Part 2, desiderata. Case 1: All timings seem within 24 hours for Credit Check and 48 hours for informing. They might have done a Follow-up Call? The log doesn't mention it, but since it's not in the events, maybe they didn't. But since it's a recommendation, it's just suboptimal.

Case 2: Even though they had violations in normative rules, their timing might be okay? But since they rejected, maybe timing isn't relevant here. But the main issue is the normative violations.

Case 3: Credit Check happened more than 24 hours after application (from 12th to 14th), and informing took over 48 hours from decision (14th to 16th). Also, no Follow-up Call. These are all desideratum violations.

Possible justifications: For Case 2's Finalize Documentation after rejection, maybe an error in logging or an exception case where documentation was needed for record-keeping despite rejection. But according to rules, it's not allowed. For Case 3's delays, maybe high volume of applications caused delays, which is understandable but not ideal.

So summarizing:

Normative violations: Only Case 2.
Desideratum issues: Cases 1 (maybe no follow-up), 3 (delays and no follow-up).

**1. Normative Rule Violations**

**Case 2** violates strict normative rules due to:
- **Order violation**: Conducted *Risk Assessment* before *Credit Check* (violates "Credit Check  Risk Assessment" sequence).  
- **Contradictory action**: *Finalize Documentation* occurred after a *Loan Decision (Rejected)* (prohibited by constraints).  

**Interpretation**:  
The reversed order in Case 2 suggests either a procedural error or mislogging of events. Finalizing documentation after rejection could indicate an oversight in adhering to post-decision protocols[1][3].

**2. Desiderata Violations**

| Case | Desideratum Issue                                                                 | Severity       |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **1** | No *Follow-up Call* logged before closing (recommended but not enforced).        | Minor          |
| **3** | - Credit Check delayed (>24 hours after application).<br>- Applicant notified >48 hours post-decision.<br>- No *Follow-up Call*. | Suboptimal but permitted |

**Interpretation**:  
- **Case 3’s delays** might reflect operational inefficiencies (e.g., backlog) rather than systemic noncompliance[5][7].  
- Missing follow-ups across cases could stem from resource limitations or prioritization of mandatory steps over recommendations[5].

**Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Shortcomings?               |
|------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    |  None                |  No Follow-up Call                    |
| 2    |  Sequence violation<br> Illegal documentation | N/A (normative failures supersede)      |
| 3    |  None                |  Late Credit Check & Notification<br> No Follow-up Call |

---

**Key Takeaways**  
- **Critical compliance failures** occur only in Case 2 due to misordered steps and improper documentation[1][3].  
- **Process optimizations** are needed for Case 3’s timing and follow-ups to align with best practices[5][7].  
- Justifications for deviations may include human error (Case 2) or workload pressures (Case 3), but these do not excuse normative breaches[1][4].
