# High-Level Activity Grouping for Manufacturing Process

Based on the provided event log, I've identified the following high-level activities that represent logical groupings of the low-level events in the manufacturing process:

## 1. Material Preparation
**Includes:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events represent the initial phase where raw materials are obtained, identified, positioned, and prepared for processing. All these activities are temporally close and serve the common purpose of getting the raw metal sheet ready for the next manufacturing steps.

## 2. Welding Assembly
**Includes:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These events are all related to the assembly process using welding. They involve obtaining the necessary tool and performing the actual welding operations. These activities are performed by the same operator and represent a distinct phase in the manufacturing workflow.

## 3. Quality Inspection
**Includes:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
This event represents a dedicated quality check to ensure the welding meets required standards. It occurs after the welding is completed and before proceeding to the next phase, making it a clear checkpoint in the process.

## 4. Surface Treatment
**Includes:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These events form a logical sequence where a protective coating is applied to the product, followed by a drying process. They represent a specific treatment phase that enhances the product's durability and finish.

## 5. Final Quality Assurance
**Includes:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
This event represents the final inspection before the product would presumably be completed or packaged. It serves as a human verification of the overall product quality, ensuring it meets all visual and structural requirements.

## Process Flow Overview

The manufacturing process can be visualized as a sequence of these high-level activities:

1. **Material Preparation** - Acquiring and preparing the raw metal sheet
2. **Welding Assembly** - Performing structural welding operations
3. **Quality Inspection** - Checking the quality of the welds
4. **Surface Treatment** - Applying and curing protective coatings
5. **Final Quality Assurance** - Conducting a final visual inspection

This grouping provides a clear, high-level view of the manufacturing workflow while maintaining the necessary detail to understand the key stages of the process.
