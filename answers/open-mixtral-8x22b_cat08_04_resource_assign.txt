**1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns:**

To analyze resource behavior and assignment patterns, we will leverage event log data to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for individual agents and support tiers. These metrics may include:

- Workload distribution: Comparing the number of tickets handled by each agent or tier to identify imbalances.
- Activity processing times per agent/tier: Measuring the time taken to complete specific tasks to assess efficiency.
- First-call resolution rate for L1: Tracking the percentage of incidents resolved by L1 agents without escalation.
- Frequency of handling specific ticket types/skills: Evaluating the focus area of each agent or tier.

Process mining techniques, such as resource interaction analysis and social network analysis based on handovers, will help reveal the actual assignment patterns, escalations, and reassignments in the process. By comparing these patterns with the intended assignment logic, we can identify deviations and areas for improvement.

To analyze the utilization of specific skills across the agent pool, we will examine the distribution of tickets requiring different skills among agents. This analysis will help determine whether specialized skills are being used effectively or if specialists are often assigned to tasks below their skill level.

**2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues:**

Based on our analysis, we can pinpoint specific resource-related problems, such as:

- Bottlenecks caused by insufficient availability of agents with specific required skills.
- Delays introduced by frequent or unnecessary ticket reassignments or escalations.
- Impact of incorrect initial assignments by L1 or dispatchers.
- Identification of underperforming or overloaded agents/teams.
- Correlation between resource assignment patterns and SLA breaches.

To quantify the impact of these issues, we can calculate metrics like the average delay caused per reassignment or the percentage of SLA breaches linked to skill mismatches.

**3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies:**

Potential root causes for assignment problems may include:

- Deficiencies in the current assignment rules.
- Inaccurate or incomplete agent skill profiles.
- Poor initial ticket categorization or skill requirement identification.
- Lack of real-time visibility into agent workload and availability.
- Insufficient training or empowerment of L1 agents leading to excessive escalations.

By performing variant analysis or decision mining, we can identify factors leading to poor assignment decisions. This may involve comparing cases with smooth assignments to those with many reassignments or analyzing decision points in the process to determine the causes of suboptimal choices.

**4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies:**

*Strategy 1: Skill-based Routing*

Implementing skill-based routing, potentially weighted by proficiency level, would help ensure tickets are assigned to agents with the most relevant skills. This strategy leverages insights from the process mining analysis regarding skill utilization and assignment patterns. To implement this strategy, we would need data on agent skills and proficiency levels. The expected benefits include improved first-call resolution rates, reduced resolution time, and better utilization of specialized skills.

*Strategy 2: Workload-aware Assignment Algorithm*

Developing a workload-aware assignment algorithm that considers current queue lengths and agent availability would help distribute work more evenly and prevent overloading individual agents. This strategy leverages insights from the process mining analysis regarding workload distribution and activity processing times per agent/tier. To implement this strategy, we would need data on agent availability and queue lengths. The expected benefits include improved SLA compliance, reduced resolution time, and more balanced workloads.

*Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics*

Introducing predictive assignment based on ticket characteristics, such as category and description keywords, would help anticipate required skills and complexity. This strategy leverages insights from the process mining analysis regarding ticket types and skills handled by each agent. To implement this strategy, we would need data on ticket characteristics and historical assignment patterns. The expected benefits include improved first-call resolution rates, reduced resolution time, and better utilization of specialized skills.

**5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring:**

Before implementing the proposed strategies, we can use business process simulation, informed by mined process models and resource characteristics, to evaluate their potential impact. This will help us estimate the expected benefits and make informed decisions about strategy implementation.

Once the strategies are implemented, we can monitor their effectiveness using process mining dashboards. Key resource-related KPIs to track continuously may include:

- Workload distribution among agents and tiers.
- First-call resolution rate.
- Average resolution time.
- Number of reassignments and escalations.
- SLA compliance rate.

By continuously monitoring these KPIs and adjusting our resource assignment strategies as needed, we can ensure that TechSolve's IT service desk operates more efficiently and effectively.
