### **Assumptions and Notes**
1. **Missing Data for Order 1004**:
   - No `Delivery`, `Invoice`, or `Payment` records exist for `order_id 1004`. This is likely incomplete data, but the event log reflects what is available.
   - If this is intentional (e.g., order is still in progress), the log can be updated later.

2. **Multiple Invoices/Payments**:
   - For `order_id 1002`, two invoices (`INV-1002` and `INV-1003`) and two payments (`PAY-2002` and `PAY-2003`) are recorded. Each is treated as a separate event.

3. **Multiple Deliveries**:
   - `order_id 1002` has two deliveries (`DLV-5002` and `DLV-5003`), each with its own dispatch/arrival events.

4. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Resources (e.g., `SP-001`, `WH-001`) are mapped to names/roles using the `Resources Table`. If a resource is missing (e.g., `CR-01`), the ID is retained.

5. **Activity Naming**:
   - "Items Picked" is used for each line item in `Order Lines`, as picking is typically item-level.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" are derived from `Delivery` records, with `delivery_dispatch_date` and `delivery_arrival_date`.

6. **Chronological Order**:
   - Events are ordered by timestamp. For `order_id 1002`, the second delivery (`DLV-5003`) occurs after the first (`DLV-5002`), so its events are placed later.
