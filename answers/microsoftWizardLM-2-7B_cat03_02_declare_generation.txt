Certainly! Below is an example of a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. In this model, we assume that the process starts with the execution of 'Initiate Purchase Request' and ends with 'Make Payment'. The model includes various constraints that must be satisfied by the process instances.

```python
declare_model_p2p = {
    'existence': {
        'Initiate Purchase Request': 1.0,
        'Approve Purchase Request': 1.0,

        'Receive Goods': 1.0,
        'Create Invoice': 1.0,
        'Review Invoice': 1.0,
        'Approve Payment': 1.0,
        'Make Payment': 1.0,
    },

```

This model defines the constraints for the P2P process, ensuring that each activity occurs at least once (existence), that the process starts with 'Initiate Purchase Request' (init), and that certain activities must follow others (response, precedence, succession). It also defines that some activities should not occur together (noncoexistence) or in a certain sequence (nonsuccession, nonchainsuccession). The confidence for all constraints is set to 1.0, assuming certainty in the model.
