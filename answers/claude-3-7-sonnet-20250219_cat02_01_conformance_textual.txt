# Analysis of Process Violations in Order Handling

After reviewing the normative process description and the event log, I've identified several cases that deviate from the expected process flow. Here's my analysis:

## Case 1
**Status**: Compliant
**Explanation**: Case 1 follows the expected sequence for sufficient inventory:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

This sequence adheres to all constraints in the normative process.

## Case 2
**Status**: Non-compliant
**Violation**: Packaging items before payment authorization
**Explanation**: The normative process clearly states that payment authorization should occur before packaging items. In Case 2, the sequence is:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Package items (violation - should occur after payment authorization)
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

The description specifically mentions that "Authorize payment" should occur before packaging, as "payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."

## Case 3
**Status**: Non-compliant
**Violations**: 
1. Shipping after cancellation
2. Illogical process flow

**Explanation**: Case 3 shows a serious violation of the process logic:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order (major violation - shipping after cancellation)
6. Close order

The normative description explicitly states that "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)" after an order is canceled. Additionally, the process flow is inconsistent - authorizing payment suggests sufficient inventory, but then the order is canceled, which implies insufficient inventory.

## Case 4
**Status**: Compliant
**Explanation**: Case 4 follows the expected sequence for insufficient inventory:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

This matches the described shorter sequence for cases where inventory is insufficient.

## Case 5
**Status**: Non-compliant
**Violation**: Missing "Package items" activity
**Explanation**: Case 5 is missing a critical step:
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order (violation - shipping without packaging)
5. Close order

The normative process states that "Package items" should occur after payment authorization and before shipping, as "items must be prepared before they can be shipped." This step is completely missing in Case 5.

## Summary of Violations

1. **Case 2**: Incorrect sequence - packaging before payment authorization
2. **Case 3**: Major logical violation - shipping after cancellation and inconsistent process flow
3. **Case 5**: Missing required activity - shipping without packaging

These violations represent deviations from the intended process flow as described in the normative process description. The most severe is Case 3, which completely contradicts the logical flow by shipping a canceled order.
