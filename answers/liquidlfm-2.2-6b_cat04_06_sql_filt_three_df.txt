**Explanation and Correction:**

The initial query, while conceptually similar, had a flawed approach to timing and grouping. Here's a corrected and more robust version:

1. **`sequence_events` CTE:**

   - This part correctly identifies the sequence of activities within each case. 
   - It uses the `LAG` window function to look back at previous timestamps and activities to check for the exact sequence pattern.
   -  It now calculates the days difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' using `LAG` and `dirlater` correctly within the context of the `SEQUENCE_OF_ACTIVITIES` logic.
   - **Problem Fixed:** The timing logic was incorrectly nested and using `LAG` strategically is crucial here.

2. **`filtered_cases` CTE:**

   - This CTE identifies the case IDs associated with the specific sequence pattern and the timing condition (Create to Confirm Order more than 5 days).
   - It creates a meta-type of identifying cases based on the sequences and timing, simplifying the final filtering.

3. **Final Select:**

   - The final `SELECT`:
     - Selects *all* events from `event_log`.
     - Uses `WHERE` to **exclude** only the events that fall within the filtered `filtered_cases`.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Performance:**  This query involves rolling calculations within a window function (`LAG`) and potentially subqueries, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets. Consider indexing `case_id`, `timestamp`, and `activity` if performance is critical. 
* **Time Zones:** If your `timestamp` data is timezone-aware, be mindful of time zone conversions when calculating the 5-day difference.  Use `SHOW TIME ZONE current_timestamp(LANGUAGE = 'C')` to get the timezone information and adjust accordingly.
* **Data Quality:** The assumption of "direct succession" is critical.  If there's a possibility of near-duplicates or slight timing variations, you might need to adjust the logic to be more flexible in recognizing the sequence (perhaps allowing for a small tolerance window between events).
* **DuckDB Version:** Ensure you are using a DuckDB version that supports window functions and `LAG` correctly.
