We are given a temporal profile model that shows average times and standard deviations between pairs of activities.
 The anomalies have been highlighted in the example, but we are to independently analyze the model and propose hypotheses and verification.

 Steps:
 1. Identify anomalies by looking at pairs with:
    - Very short or very long average times that don't make sense in the business context.
    - Very small standard deviation (indicating rigid timing) or very large standard deviation (indicating inconsistency).

 2. Generate hypotheses for each anomaly.

 3. Propose SQL queries to verify the hypotheses.

 Let's break down the temporal_profile:

    ('R', 'A'): (3600, 600)      -> 1 hour ± 10 minutes: seems normal.
    ('R', 'E'): (86400, 28800)   -> 1 day ± 8 hours: normal variation? (but note: 8 hours is a third of a day, so quite variable)
    ('R', 'P'): (90000, 3600)    -> 25 hours ± 1 hour: very low standard deviation for a day-long process? (anomaly: low STDEV)
    ('A', 'C'): (7200, 3600)     -> 2 hours ± 1 hour: very fast closure after assignment? (anomaly: fast closure without intermediate steps?)
    ('E', 'N'): (300, 60)        -> 5 minutes ± 1 minute: very fast? (anomaly: too quick)
    ('E', 'C'): (3600, 3000)     -> 1 hour ± 50 minutes: high variability? (but note: 50 minutes is a lot, but not necessarily an anomaly without context)
    ('P', 'N'): (604800, 172800) -> 7 days ± 2 days: very long and variable? (anomaly: long delay and high STDEV)
    ('N', 'C'): (1800, 300)      -> 30 minutes ± 5 minutes: normal.

 The example already pointed out:
    - R to P: low standard deviation (suspiciously rigid)
    - P to N: long average and high standard deviation (inconsistent delays)
    - A to C: quick closure after assignment (might skip steps)
    - E to N: too quick (might skip steps or automated without real work)

 However, note that the example also mentioned E to C as having a high standard deviation? But we are to do independent analysis.

 Let's re-identify anomalies:

  Anomaly 1: (R, P) - Average time is about 25 hours (which is a bit more than a day) but with a very low standard deviation (1 hour). 
      This suggests that the time from receiving a claim to approval is almost exactly 25 hours for most claims. 
      Why would that be? It might be an artificial deadline or an automated step that happens at a fixed time.

  Anomaly 2: (P, N) - Average time is 7 days with a standard deviation of 2 days. This is a long time and also highly variable. 
      This step (from approval to notification) should be quick because once approved, notifying the customer is a simple step. 
      Why the delay? Maybe there's a backlog in the notification step or manual intervention required.

  Anomaly 3: (A, C) - Average time is 2 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This is very fast for closing a claim after assignment. 
      The process steps include Evaluate and Approve after Assign and before Close. So closing a claim just 2 hours after assignment might mean 
      that some claims are being closed without evaluation and approval? Or maybe they are being closed as denied? But note: the activity 'C' (Close) 
      should come after approval and notification. So this might indicate a subset of claims that are closed prematurely.

  Anomaly 4: (E, N) - Average time is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This is extremely fast. 
      After evaluation, the claim must be approved (step P) before notification. So how can notification happen 5 minutes after evaluation? 
      Either the approval step is happening very quickly (and not captured in the profile) or the notification step is being triggered without approval? 
      Or perhaps the evaluation and approval are done together? But note: the profile does not have (E, P) or (P, N) for this claim? Actually, we have (E, N) and (P, N). 
      This might indicate that for some claims, the notification is sent immediately after evaluation without waiting for approval? That would be a violation.

  Additionally, note that the profile does not include all pairs? For example, we don't have (A, E) or (E, P). But that's because the model is built on pairs that are observed? 

  Hypotheses:

  Anomaly 1 (R to P: rigid 25 hours):
    Hypothesis 1: There might be an automated batch process that approves claims exactly 25 hours after submission, regardless of when they were evaluated.
    Hypothesis 2: Claims are being held until a specific time of day (e.g., next business day at a fixed hour) for approval.

  Anomaly 2 (P to N: long and variable delay):
    Hypothesis 1: The notification step is manual and there is a backlog in the notification team.
    Hypothesis 2: Notifications are being sent in batches only on certain days (e.g., weekly) leading to delays and variability.
    Hypothesis 3: There might be a dependency on external systems or third-party services for notification that are slow.

  Anomaly 3 (A to C: very fast closure after assignment):
    Hypothesis 1: Some claims are being closed without going through the required steps (e.g., evaluation and approval) because they are duplicates or invalid.
    Hypothesis 2: The adjuster might be closing claims immediately after assignment if they are below a threshold (fast-track) but without recording the intermediate steps.

  Anomaly 4 (E to N: too quick):
    Hypothesis 1: The notification step is automatically triggered immediately after evaluation, skipping the approval step (which might be done later? but that would break the process).
    Hypothesis 2: The evaluation and approval steps are being recorded as the same event? But the activities are distinct.

  Verification Queries:

  We will write SQL queries to investigate each anomaly.

  General approach:
    - For a pair of activities (A1, A2) for a claim, we want to compute the time difference between the first occurrence of A1 and the first occurrence of A2 for that claim.
    - Then, we can compare against the temporal profile to find outliers.

  We'll use the `claim_events` table. We can group by claim_id and then pick the min timestamp for each activity? But note: a claim might have multiple events of the same activity? 
  The problem does not specify, but we assume that each activity occurs at most once per claim? Or we take the first occurrence? 

  We'll assume we take the first occurrence of each activity for a claim.

  Query structure for a given pair (A1, A2):

    WITH events_per_claim AS (
        SELECT 
            claim_id,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A1' THEN timestamp END) AS a1_ts,
            MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A2' THEN timestamp END) AS a2_ts
        FROM claim_events
        GROUP BY claim_id
        HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A1' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
           AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A2' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a2_ts - a1_ts)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM events_per_claim;

  Then we can use this to find claims that are outside the expected range (e.g., for (R,P): we expect around 90000 seconds, but with low STDEV so anything outside [90000 - 3*3600, 90000 + 3*3600] might be an outlier? But note: the STDEV is 3600, so 3 STDEV would be 10800 seconds -> 3 hours. So we might look for claims where the duration is not between 79200 and 100800 seconds?).

  However, note: the temporal profile is built from the entire data, so we are looking for claims that are extreme relative to the profile? Actually, we are trying to verify the anomaly by breaking down by other factors.

  Instead, let's design queries for each anomaly:

  Anomaly 1: (R, P) - rigid timing.

    We want to see if the time from R to P is indeed clustered around 25 hours.

    Query 1: Distribution of R to P times.

        WITH rp_times AS (
            SELECT 
                claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_ts
            FROM claim_events
            GROUP BY claim_id
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_ts - r_ts)) / 3600 AS hours_diff,
            COUNT(*) AS num_claims
        FROM rp_times
        GROUP BY hours_diff
        ORDER BY hours_diff;

    This will show if the times are indeed clustered at 25 hours.

    Query 2: Check if the approval happens at a fixed time of day? For example, every day at 5 PM.

        WITH rp_times AS (
            SELECT 
                claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_ts
            FROM claim_events
            GROUP BY claim_id
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            EXTRACT(HOUR FROM p_ts) AS approval_hour,
            COUNT(*) AS num_claims
        FROM rp_times
        GROUP BY approval_hour
        ORDER BY approval_hour;

    If we see a spike at a particular hour, that might explain the rigidity.

  Anomaly 2: (P, N) - long and variable delay.

    We want to see if there are specific adjusters, claim types, or time periods that cause the delay.

    Query 1: Find claims where P to N time is more than 7 days + 2*STDEV (i.e., 7 days + 4 days = 11 days) and see if they are concentrated in a particular region or adjuster.

        WITH pn_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS p_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS n_ts,
                c.claim_type,
                -- We might also get the adjuster? But note: the assign event? We don't have direct link. We can try to get the adjuster from the event that performed the activity? 
                -- The claim_events table has a 'resource' column. We can get the resource for the 'P' or 'N' event? But note: the resource might be the one who approved? 
                -- Also, we can join with the claims table to get claim_type and customer_id? and then adjuster? But adjuster is assigned at step A? 
                -- Alternatively, we can get the adjuster assigned from the 'A' event? 
                (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'A' LIMIT 1) AS adjuster_id
            FROM claim_events ce
            JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            pn_times.*,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts)) / 86400 AS days_diff
        FROM pn_times
        WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts)) > 11 * 86400  -- more than 11 days
        ORDER BY days_diff DESC;

    Then we can group by claim_type or adjuster_id to see patterns.

    Query 2: Check if the delay is decreasing over time? Or if there are periods of high delay? (e.g., by month)

        WITH pn_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS p_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS n_ts,
                DATE_TRUNC('month', p_ts) AS approval_month
            FROM claim_events ce
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id, approval_month
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            approval_month,
            AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts)) / 86400) AS avg_days,
            COUNT(*) AS num_claims
        FROM pn_times
        GROUP BY approval_month
        ORDER BY approval_month;

  Anomaly 3: (A, C) - very fast closure after assignment.

    We want to check if these claims skipped the evaluation and approval steps.

    Query 1: For claims that have A and C within 2 hours, check if they have E and P events?

        WITH ac_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS a_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS c_ts,
                -- Check for existence of E and P
                BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') AS has_e,
                BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P') AS has_p
            FROM claim_events ce
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            ac_times.*,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ts - a_ts)) / 3600 AS hours_diff,
            has_e, has_p
        FROM ac_times
        WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ts - a_ts)) <= 3 * 3600  -- within 3 hours (to capture the average of 2 hours and a bit more)
        ORDER BY hours_diff;

    Then we can see how many of these fast-closed claims have no evaluation (has_e = false) or no approval (has_p = false).

    Query 2: Also, we might check the claim_type and adjuster for these fast closures.

        WITH ac_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS a_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS c_ts,
                (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'A' LIMIT 1) AS adjuster_id,
                c.claim_type
            FROM claim_events ce
            JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.claim_type
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            adjuster_id,
            claim_type,
            COUNT(*) AS num_fast_closures,
            AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ts - a_ts)) / 3600) AS avg_hours
        FROM ac_times
        WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_ts - a_ts)) <= 3 * 3600
        GROUP BY adjuster_id, claim_type
        ORDER BY num_fast_closures DESC;

  Anomaly 4: (E, N) - too quick.

    We want to check if the notification happens without an approval? Or if the approval happens in between?

    Query 1: For claims that have E and N within 5 minutes, check the time between E and P and between P and N? And also check if P happened at all?

        WITH en_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS e_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS n_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS p_ts
            FROM claim_events ce
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            claim_id,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - e_ts)) AS en_seconds,
            p_ts IS NOT NULL AS has_approval,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_ts - e_ts)) AS ep_seconds,  -- if p_ts is not null
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts)) AS pn_seconds   -- if p_ts is not null
        FROM en_times
        WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - e_ts)) <= 300 + 3*60  -- within 8 minutes (5 minutes + 3*1 minute STDEV) to capture the anomaly
        ORDER BY en_seconds;

    Then we can see:
        - How many of these have no approval? (has_approval = false)
        - For those that have approval, is the approval happening after the notification? (pn_seconds negative?) or before? 
          But note: the process should be E -> P -> N. So if p_ts is after n_ts, that's a problem.

    Query 2: Also, check the resource who did the evaluation and the notification? Are they the same? And what is the resource?

        WITH en_times AS (
            SELECT 
                ce.claim_id,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS e_ts,
                MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS n_ts,
                (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'E' LIMIT 1) AS evaluator,
                (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE claim_id = ce.claim_id AND activity = 'N' LIMIT 1) AS notifier
            FROM claim_events ce
            GROUP BY ce.claim_id
            HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
               AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
        )
        SELECT 
            claim_id,
            evaluator,
            notifier,
            evaluator = notifier AS same_resource,
            EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - e_ts)) AS en_seconds
        FROM en_times
        WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - e_ts)) <= 300 + 3*60;

    If the same resource is doing both, maybe they are skipping steps? Or if it's an automated resource, that might explain the speed.

  We'll present the anomalies, hypotheses, and queries independently as per the prompt.

  Note: The prompt says "Do not reference the instructions or explanations above". So we present as if we are the analyst.

  Let's structure the response:

  # Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

  We have identified the following anomalies:

  1. **Activity Pair (R, P)**: The average time from claim receipt (R) to approval (P) is 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour. This rigidity is unexpected in a typical claim handling process.

  2. **Activity Pair (P, N)**: The average time from approval (P) to customer notification (N) is 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates inconsistent and prolonged delays in notification.

  3. **Activity Pair (A, C)**: The average time from adjuster assignment (A) to claim closure (C) is 2 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This is surprisingly fast given that intermediate steps (evaluation and approval) are required.

  4. **Activity Pair (E, N)**: The average time from claim evaluation (E) to notification (N) is 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This transition is too rapid to allow for the required approval step.

  # Hypotheses for Anomalies

  ## Anomaly 1: (R, P) - Rigid Timing
  - **Hypothesis 1.1**: Claims are being approved in a batch process that runs at a fixed time each day, leading to a consistent delay.
  - **Hypothesis 1.2**: An artificial deadline of 25 hours is enforced by the system, regardless of the actual evaluation time.

  ## Anomaly 2: (P, N) - Long and Variable Delay
  - **Hypothesis 2.1**: The notification step is manual and subject to backlogs, causing delays that vary based on workload.
  - **Hypothesis 2.2**: Notifications are sent in weekly batches, leading to delays of up to a week and high variability.
  - **Hypothesis 2.3**: External factors (e.g., third-party notification services) introduce delays and inconsistencies.

  ## Anomaly 3: (A, C) - Fast Closure
  - **Hypothesis 3.1**: Some claims (e.g., duplicates or invalid claims) are closed immediately after assignment without undergoing evaluation or approval.
  - **Hypothesis 3.2**: Adjusters are using a fast-track process for low-amount claims, bypassing standard steps.

  ## Anomaly 4: (E, N) - Rapid Notification after Evaluation
  - **Hypothesis 4.1**: The system triggers notification immediately after evaluation, skipping the approval step.
  - **Hypothesis 4.2**: Evaluation and approval are recorded as a single step (e.g., by the same adjuster simultaneously), but the approval event is not logged.

### Anomalies in Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: Average time of 25 hours with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hour). This suggests unnaturally consistent timing, potentially indicating automated scheduling or bypassed steps.
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**: Average delay of 7 days with high variability (STDEV=2 days). This indicates inconsistent notification processes, possibly due to manual bottlenecks or resource constraints.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**: Average closure within 2 hours after assignment (STDEV=1 hour). This is unusually fast given intermediate steps (Evaluate, Approve), suggesting premature closures or skipped validations.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**: Average 5-minute gap (STDEV=1 minute) between evaluation and notification. This rapid transition may indicate skipped approvals or unrealistic automation.

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

#### R to P Anomaly
- **Hypothesis 1**: Automated batch approvals run on a fixed schedule (e.g., daily), creating artificial consistency.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Claims are held until a predefined deadline (e.g., 25-hour SLA), overriding actual processing time.

#### P to N Anomaly
- **Hypothesis 1**: Manual notification processes cause backlogs during peak periods, leading to high variability.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Notifications are batched weekly, creating delays and inconsistent timing.

#### A to C Anomaly
- **Hypothesis 1**: Low-value claims are fast-tracked without evaluation/approval.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Adjusters prematurely close invalid claims (e.g., duplicates) immediately after assignment.

#### E to N Anomaly
- **Hypothesis 1**: System misconfiguration triggers notifications immediately after evaluation, skipping approval.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Evaluation and approval are logged as a single step ("Evaluate"), hiding the approval delay.

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Verify R-to-P Rigidity (Fixed Scheduling)
```sql
-- Check if approvals cluster at specific times
SELECT
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM approval_ts) AS hour_of_day,
  COUNT(*) AS approvals
FROM (
  SELECT 
    MIN(timestamp) AS approval_ts 
  FROM claim_events 
  WHERE activity = 'P'
  GROUP BY claim_id
) AS approvals
GROUP BY hour_of_day
ORDER BY approvals DESC;
```

#### 2. Identify P-to-N Delays by Region/Adjuster
```sql
-- Find adjusters/regions with longest notification delays
SELECT
  a.region,
  e.resource AS adjuster_id,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_ts - p_ts))) / 86400 AS avg_days_delay
FROM (
  SELECT
    claim_id,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS p_ts,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS n_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') IS NOT NULL
) AS events
JOIN claim_events e ON e.claim_id = events.claim_id AND e.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = e.resource::INTEGER
WHERE n_ts - p_ts > INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY a.region, e.resource
ORDER BY avg_days_delay DESC;
```

#### 3. Detect Premature Closures (A-to-C)
```sql
-- Find claims closed without evaluation/approval
SELECT
  c.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  a_ts,
  c_ts,
  (c_ts - a_ts) AS time_to_close
FROM (
  SELECT
    claim_id,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS a_ts,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS c_ts,
    BOOL_AND(activity NOT IN ('E', 'P')) AS missing_steps  -- Check for skipped E/P
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') IS NOT NULL
) AS closures
JOIN claims c USING (claim_id)
WHERE 
  c_ts - a_ts < INTERVAL '3 hours'  -- Within 2h ± 1h STDEV
  AND missing_steps = TRUE;
```

#### 4. Validate E-to-N Skipped Approvals
```sql
-- Check if notifications precede approvals
SELECT
  claim_id,
  e_ts,
  n_ts,
  p_ts,
  (n_ts - e_ts) AS en_time,
  (p_ts - n_ts) AS pn_time  -- Negative if P occurs after N
FROM (
  SELECT
    claim_id,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS e_ts,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS n_ts,
    MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS p_ts
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
  HAVING MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') IS NOT NULL
) AS events
WHERE 
  n_ts - e_ts < INTERVAL '6 minutes'  -- 5m ±1m STDEV
  AND (p_ts IS NULL OR p_ts > n_ts);  -- Approval missing or after notification
```

### Key Verification Strategies
- **Temporal Outliers**: Use `EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (...))` to compare against profile thresholds (e.g., `> 7 days + 2*STDEV`).
- **Resource Correlation**: Join `claim_events` with `adjusters` to link delays to regions/specializations.
- **Step Validation**: Use `BOOL_AND()` or `FILTER` to detect missing activities (e.g., no "P" between "E" and "N").
- **Trend Analysis**: Group by time periods (e.g., `DATE_TRUNC('week', timestamp)`) to identify backlog patterns.
