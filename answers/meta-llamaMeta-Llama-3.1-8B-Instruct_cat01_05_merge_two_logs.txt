**Reasoning and Conflict Resolution:**

-   **Timestamp Tolerance**: A tolerance of 2 seconds was applied to align timestamps between the two logs. Where the difference was less than 2 seconds, events were merged as representing the same occurrence. For instance, "Order Validated" from Log A was merged with "OrderValidation" from Log B (a 1-second difference), and "Item Shipped" from Log A was merged with "Shipping" from Log B (a 2-second difference).

-   **Event Naming Variations**: Variations in event names between the two logs were addressed by matching events based on order ID and event timing. For example, "Order Received" from Log A was matched with "OrderReceived" from Log B, and "Payment Processed" from Log A was matched with "Payment Check" from Log B, taking into account additional attributes for more confident matching.

-   **Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**: Events appearing only in one log were included as-is, indicating their origin. For instance, "Quality Check" from Log B was left separate since there was no matching event in Log A within the allowed timestamp tolerance.

-   **Attributes Integration**: For merged events, all attributes from both logs were included. Where an attribute was missing from one log, it was noted as "None" in the merged event. This decision was made to preserve the full context of events while also acknowledging the limitations of each log.

This approach aimed to strike a balance between aligning events across the two logs while respecting their individual timestamp granularities, naming conventions, and attribute sets. The resulting merged log offers a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, incorporating the strengths of both System A and System B.
