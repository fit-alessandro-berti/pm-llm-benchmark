1. **Anomalies:**
   - **R to P (Receive to Approve):** Average approval time of around 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation.
   - **P to N (Approve to Notify):** Extensive delay of 7 days on average with a high standard deviation.
   - **A to C (Assign to Close):** Quick closure within 2 hours after assignment without consistently seeing evaluation or approval steps.
   - **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Only a 5-minute average gap between evaluation and notification which seems too quick.

2. **Hypotheses:**
   - *R to P (Receive to Approve):* Potential hypothesis could be an automated approval system that bypasses manual assessments, leading to a consistent, artificially low approval time.
   - *P to N (Approve to Notify):* Delays might be due to high workload during notification, indicating a bottleneck in communication or manual intervention required for notification.
   - *A to C (Assign to Close):* Premature closures could stem from an automated system marking claims as closed without full evaluation or approval.
   - *E to N (Evaluate to Notify):* Rapid transitions might result from automated notifications triggered immediately after evaluations, possibly skipping intermediate steps.

3. **Verification Queries:**
   - Identify claims where the time between Receive and Approve is less than 12 hours:
     ```sql
     SELECT claim_id, TIMESTAMP_DIFF(MAX(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN timestamp END), MIN(CASE WHEN activity='R' THEN timestamp END), SECOND) AS time_diff
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
     GROUP BY claim_id
     HAVING time_diff < 43200; -- Less than 12 hours
     ```
   - Check if specific adjusters show unusual delays in approval to notification:
     ```sql
     SELECT a.name, AVG(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(CASE WHEN c.activity='N' THEN c.timestamp END, CASE WHEN c.activity='P' THEN c.timestamp END, SECOND)) AS avg_time_diff
     FROM claim_events c
     JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = c.resource
     WHERE c.activity IN ('P', 'N')
     GROUP BY a.name;
     ```
   - Detect claims closed immediately after assignment:
     ```sql
     SELECT claim_id
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
     GROUP BY claim_id
     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2; -- Both Assign and Close present, but no other activities
     ```
   - Investigate claims where approval to notification takes more than 3 days:
     ```sql
     SELECT claim_id, TIMESTAMP_DIFF(MAX(CASE WHEN activity='N' THEN timestamp END), MIN(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN timestamp END), SECOND) AS time_diff
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
     GROUP BY claim_id
     HAVING time_diff > 259200; -- More than 3 days
     ```
