Here’s the updated `declare_model` with bias-mitigating constraints, along with a rationale for each addition:

```python

    # --- New Bias-Mitigating Constraints ---

    # 1. Unary: Ensure ManualReview always exists if a decision involves a sensitive applicant
    "existence": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },

    # 2. Binary: ManualReview must coexist with sensitive-decision traces (e.g., Approve/Reject for Minority)
    "coexistence": {
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    # 3. Binary: BiasMitigationCheck must precede sensitive-decision activities (e.g., Approve/Reject)
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve_Elderly": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject_Elderly": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    # 4. Binary: No direct succession from sensitive-attribute checks (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) to biased decisions
    "noncoexistence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    # 5. Binary: ManualReview must succeed Approve/Reject for sensitive applicants (ensuring fairness)
    "succession": {
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Elderly": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },

    # 6. Binary: BiasMitigationCheck must succeed sensitive-attribute checks (e.g., CheckApplicantRace)
    "succession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    }
}

### **Rationale for Bias-Mitigating Constraints**:
1. **ManualReview Existence (Unary `existence`)**
   - Ensures that manual oversight is always present for sensitive-decision activities (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Elderly`). This prevents algorithmic bias from overriding human judgment.

2. **Coexistence with ManualReview (Binary `coexistence`)**
   - Requires that `ManualReview` must occur alongside sensitive-decision activities. This enforces that no decision is made without human intervention, reducing reliance on biased automated checks.

3. **Precedence of BiasMitigationCheck (Binary `precedence`)**
   - Ensures that sensitive-decision activities (e.g., `Approve_Minority`) cannot occur without first validating against bias (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck`). This breaks the chain of biased outcomes.

4. **Non-Coexistence of Sensitive Checks and Biased Decisions (Binary `noncoexistence`)**
   - Prohibits direct succession from sensitive-attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to biased decisions (e.g., `Reject`). This prevents immediate discrimination without mitigation.

5. **Succession of ManualReview (Binary `succession`)**
   - Ensures that manual review is mandatory after sensitive decisions, ensuring fairness by requiring human validation.

6. **Succession of BiasMitigationCheck (Binary `succession`)**
   - Requires that bias checks (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck`) follow sensitive-attribute checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`). This enforces a structured workflow to mitigate bias proactively.

### **Key Benefits**:
- **Protects Sensitive Demographics**: Constraints like `noncoexistence` and `precedence` explicitly block biased paths (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace  Reject`).
- **Human Oversight**: Mandatory `ManualReview` ensures no decision is made without human judgment, reducing algorithmic bias.
- **Structured Workflow**: `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede sensitive decisions, ensuring fairness by validating outcomes before finalization.

This model aligns with fairness principles by enforcing transparency, accountability, and proactive bias mitigation in the loan application process.
