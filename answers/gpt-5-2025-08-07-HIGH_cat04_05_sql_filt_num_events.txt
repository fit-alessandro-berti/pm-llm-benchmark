Here’s a simple way to do it using an aggregate subquery and a join:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS keep USING (case_id)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;

Equivalent window-function alternative:

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT e.*, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS n_events
  FROM event_log e
) t
WHERE n_events <= 6
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
