If you read the set of constraints as a whole they paint a fairly typical “apply–assess–prepare–disburse” journey, but expressed in a declarative way so you know what must and must not happen rather than a single rigid flow.

A plausible path through it would look something like this:

- The case has to start with **ReceiveApplication** (`init` and `existence`), because nothing else makes sense until you’ve got a request from a customer.

- Each case has to have exactly one **PreliminaryCreditCheck** (`exactly_one`), and it must occur after the application is received (`response`). The chainprecedence on **AuthorizeContractTerms** means you only ever authorize terms immediately after having done that credit check, so risk assessment feeds directly into what you are willing to offer.

- After the check, you must eventually **GatherAdditionalDocuments** (`succession`), and that task is coupled with authorization: if you collect documents you also authorize terms, and vice versa (`coexistence`). In practice this reflects the need to corroborate the applicant’s claims before finalising the deal.

- Document gathering must be followed by a **QualityAssuranceReview** (`altsuccession`), and any QA review is only allowed if authorization has happened before (`precedence`). That review, in turn, must immediately be followed by assembling the actual offer pack (`chainsuccession`), and you can’t assemble a pack unless QA has taken place (`responded_existence`).

- As soon as the offer is assembled it has to be booked for payment: **AssembleLoanOfferPackage** is chained to **TransferFunds** (`chainresponse`). Each disbursement has a onetoone relationship with customer notification (`altresponse`/`altprecedence`): for every transfer there is a subsequent **NotifyCustomer**, and you don’t notify anyone unless there’s been a transfer.

- There are also negative rules to stop “jumping the gun”: **ProceedWithoutCompliance** must never occur (`absence`), you don’t perform a credit check after you’ve notified someone of an outcome (`nonsuccession`), and you don’t go straight from authorizing terms to notifying the customer (`nonchainsuccession`).

All of these constraints reflect realworld concerns. Starting with an application and doing one credit check ensures a consistent risk assessment; forcing document collection, QA and authorization before disbursement aligns with regulatory compliance and fraud prevention; pairing transfers with notifications supports transparency and customer satisfaction. The “noncoexistence” of **TransferFunds** and **ReceiveApplication** would normally be interpreted as “don’t disburse until an application exists,” i.e. no paying out on a nonexistent case.

If you violate the ordering or omit steps, the consequences are predictable: disbursing before checking credit or collecting documents exposes you to losses and compliance penalties, skipping QA increases the chance of errors, and notifying prematurely can mislead customers and damage trust. The declarative rules are there to keep the process controlled, auditable and fair.
