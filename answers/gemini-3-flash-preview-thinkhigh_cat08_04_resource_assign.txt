This report outlines a comprehensive process mining-driven approach to optimize the resource assignment practices at TechSolve Solutions. By leveraging the available event log, we can move from subjective observations to data-driven operational excellence.

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To understand the current state, we will apply three primary process mining lenses to the event log:

*   **Individual and Tier Performance Metrics:**
    *   **Throughput Time vs. Service Time:** We will calculate the "Service Time" (Work Start to Work End) vs. "Waiting Time" (Assign to Work Start). This distinguishes between an agent's actual effort and the delay caused by queueing.
    *   **Workload Distribution (Case Load):** By measuring the number of active tickets per agent over time, we can identify "Hotspots" (overloaded agents) and "Coldspots" (underutilized agents).
    *   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) for L1:** We will identify cases where the activity sequence is `Assign L1 -> Work L1 -> Resolve` without any `Escalate` or `Assign L2/L3` activities.
    *   **Skill-Activity Alignment:** We will map `Required Skill` against the `Agent Skills` attribute. This reveals the "Specialization Ratio"—how often a specialist (e.g., B15) is working on a ticket that matches their `Database-SQL` skill versus generic tasks.

*   **Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Interaction Patterns:**
    *   **Handover-of-Work Analysis:** This visualizes the flow of tickets between agents. We can identify "Ping-Pong" behavior (tickets bouncing between L1 and L2 or between agents in the same tier), which indicates unclear ownership or skill gaps.
    *   **Role Discovery:** By applying clustering algorithms to the activities performed, we can see if L2 agents are performing "L1-type" activities (e.g., password resets), confirming the suspicion that highly skilled resources are misallocated.

*   **Actual vs. Intended Assignment Logic:**
    *   We will compare the "intended" round-robin logic against the "actual" flow. If certain agents have 40% more assignments than others in the same tier, it suggests the manual "Dispatcher" or "Self-assignment" is bypassing the system logic.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Using the analysis above, we will pinpoint specific friction points:

*   **Skill Availability Bottlenecks:** By filtering for cases with long "Waiting Times" for specific categories (e.g., `Network`), we can identify if the bottleneck is a lack of agents with the `Networking-Firewall` skill. If P2/P3 tickets wait 4 hours for assignment but L1 agents are idle, the mismatch is clear.
*   **Reassignment Waste:** We will quantify the "Reassignment Penalty"—the average increase in total resolution time for every reassignment activity. For example: *“Each reassignment adds an average of 5.5 hours to the ticket lifecycle due to context switching and re-queueing.”*
*   **The "Dispatcher" Delay:** We will analyze the time between `Ticket Created` and `Assign L1/L2`. If the Dispatcher activity takes hours, the manual assignment step itself is a bottleneck.
*   **SLA Correlation:** Using a **Dotted Chart analysis**, we will plot cases over time, highlighting those that breached SLAs. This allows us to see if breaches occur during specific shifts or when specific agents are "holding" tickets.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

To understand *why* these issues occur, we will use the following techniques:

*   **Variant Analysis:** We will compare the "Fast Path" (SLA-compliant, 0–1 reassignments) against the "Slow Path" (SLA breach, 3+ reassignments).
    *   *Finding:* If the Slow Path is dominated by "Software-App" tickets assigned initially to L1 Agent A05, it may indicate a training gap for that specific agent or a failure in the initial web portal categorization.
*   **Decision Mining:** We will analyze the `Escalate L2` activity. What ticket attributes lead to an escalation?
    *   If tickets with `Required Skill: App-CRM` are escalated 90% of the time after only 5 minutes of L1 work, the root cause is that L1 agents are not empowered or trained to handle CRM issues, and the ticket should have been routed to L2 immediately.
*   **Conformance Checking:** We will compare the event log against the "Standard Operating Procedure" (SOP). We may find that L1 agents are "cherry-picking" easy P4 tickets and ignoring P2 tickets to keep their individual metrics high, causing the P2 SLA breaches.

### 4. Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

I propose the following three strategies to optimize TechSolve’s operations:

#### Strategy A: Automated Skill-Based Routing (SBR)
*   **The Issue:** Frequent reassignments due to initial "blind" assignments to L1.
*   **Logic:** Use the `Required Skill` (identified via NLP on the ticket description or mandatory portal fields) to bypass the general L1 pool and route directly to a "Specialized L1" or a specific L2 queue.
*   **Data Required:** Updated Agent Skill Matrix and Keyword-to-Skill mapping.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces reassignments by ~30% and lowers the "Waiting Time" for specialized tickets.

#### Strategy B: Workload-Aware Dynamic Dispatching
*   **The Issue:** Uneven workload distribution and specialists working on low-value tasks.
*   **Logic:** An algorithm that assigns tickets based on the formula: `(Agent Skill Match Score) / (Current Queue Length)`. If a specialist's queue is long, the system routes the ticket to a "Next-Best" resource or holds it rather than overloading the specialist.
*   **Data Required:** Real-time event log feed showing "Work Start" and "Work End" to calculate current live load.
*   **Benefit:** Prevents agent burnout and ensures P2 tickets aren't stuck behind a "wall" of P3 tickets in a single agent's queue.

#### Strategy C: "Shift-Left" via Historical Outcome Analysis
*   **The Issue:** Specialists reporting they handle tasks that L1 could do.
*   **Logic:** Identify the top 10 most common `L2 Resolve` patterns that have a low "Service Time" (under 15 mins). Use this data to create specific L1 "Resolution Kits" or Knowledge Base articles.
*   **Data Required:** Activity sequences and resolution codes from L2/L3 cases.
*   **Benefit:** Increases L1 FCR rate and frees L2/L3 capacity for complex P1/P2 incidents.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

#### Business Process Simulation (BPS)
Before rollout, we will use **Discrete Event Simulation**:
1.  **Baseline:** Replay the last 3 months of data to confirm the simulator matches the current SLA breaches.
2.  **What-If Analysis:** Change the assignment logic to "Skill-Based Routing" (Strategy A).
3.  **Outcome:** Observe if the predicted SLA breach rate drops. This provides management with a "Risk-Free" ROI calculation for the change.

#### Post-Implementation Monitoring
We will deploy a Process Mining Dashboard (e.g., using Celonis or ProM) to track:
*   **Reassignment Rate (by Category):** Are reassignments decreasing in the "Software-App" category after the new routing?
*   **Skill Utilization Index:** The % of time specialists spend on tickets matching their primary skill.
*   **Queue Depth per Tier:** Real-time visibility into whether L2 is becoming a bottleneck.
*   **Compliance to Routing:** A conformance check to ensure "Dispatchers" aren't manually overriding the new data-driven logic without valid justification.
