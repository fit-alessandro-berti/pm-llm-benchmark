Hereâ€™s a DuckDB SQL query to achieve the requested analysis:

```sql
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    -- Step 1: Order activities per case by timestamp
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        activity, 
        timestamp
    FROM event_log
    ORDER BY case_id, timestamp
), 

Variants AS (
    -- Step 2: Aggregate activities into an ordered sequence per case
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' â†’ ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM OrderedEvents
    GROUP BY case_id
), 

VariantCounts AS (
    -- Step 3: Count the number of cases per unique activity sequence
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence, 
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM Variants
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K  -- Select top K variants
), 

FilteredCases AS (
    -- Step 4: Filter cases that belong to one of the top K variants
    SELECT v.case_id
    FROM Variants v
    JOIN VariantCounts vc ON v.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
)

-- Step 5: Retrieve all events for the selected cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN FilteredCases fc ON e.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation:
1. **OrderedEvents CTE**: Ensures that activities within each `case_id` are ordered by `timestamp`.
2. **Variants CTE**: Aggregates activities into a structured sequence for each `case_id` using `STRING_AGG()`.
3. **VariantCounts CTE**: Groups cases by their activity sequence and counts occurrences, selecting only the top `K` variants.
4. **FilteredCases CTE**: Identifies cases that belong to one of the top `K` variants.
5. **Final Query**: Retrieves all events from the original event log for the cases that match the top `K` variants.

This ensures that only events from the most frequent process variants are included in the final result. ðŸš€
