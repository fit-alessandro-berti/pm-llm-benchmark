Based on the analysis of static patient attributes (`patient_age`, `patient_gender`) and the logical flow of hospital workflows (Department and Clinical History), there are **3 distinct cases** in this log.

Here is the breakdown of the inferred cases:

### Case 1: The ER Leg Injury
**Patient Profile:** 45 Years Old | Male
**Department:** ER -> Radiology -> ER
**Narrative:** A patient arrives at the ER, receives triage, gets an X-ray for a leg injury, is diagnosed with a fracture, and discharged.

| Line # | Timestamp | Activity | Info |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 08:05:13 | Register patient | insurance=private |
| **4** | 08:10:50 | Initial triage | triage_code=3 |
| **7** | 08:15:42 | X-ray imaging | body_part=left_leg |
| **12** | 08:23:10 | Doctor consultation | diagnosis=hairline_fracture |
| **15** | 08:30:05 | Patient discharged | followup=outpatient_clinic |

### Case 2: The ER Infection Treatment
**Patient Profile:** 62 Years Old | Female
**Department:** ER -> Laboratory -> ER
**Narrative:** A patient arrives at the ER, is triaged, requires blood work, receives a diagnosis of infection based on lab results, is prescribed antibiotics, and discharged.

| Line # | Timestamp | Activity | Info |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2** | 08:07:02 | Register patient | insurance=public |
| **5** | 08:12:29 | Initial triage | triage_code=2 |
| **8** | 08:16:10 | Lab test requested | test_type=blood_panel |
| **10** | 08:20:27 | Lab test completed | results=normal_levels |
| **11** | 08:22:54 | Doctor consultation | diagnosis=minor_infection |
| **14** | 08:27:00 | Prescription created | medication=antibiotics |
| **17** | 08:35:29 | Patient discharged | followup=pharmacy_pickup |

### Case 3: The Scheduled Knee Surgery
**Patient Profile:** 28 Years Old | Male
**Department:** Surgery
**Narrative:** A patient arrives for a scheduled procedure, consults with the surgeon, undergoes anesthesia preparation, has the surgery (arthroscopy), recovers, and is discharged with physiotherapy orders.

| Line # | Timestamp | Activity | Info |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3** | 08:07:15 | Register patient | insurance=private |
| **6** | 08:13:00 | Doctor consultation | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery |
| **9** | 08:16:45 | Surgery preparation | prep_type=general_anesthesia |
| **13** | 08:25:19 | Surgery performed | procedure=arthroscopy |
| **16** | 08:31:37 | Recovery room | condition=stable |
| **18** | 08:40:13 | Patient discharged | followup=physiotherapy_sessions |

### Summary of Logic Used
1.  **Static Attribute Matching:** The primary grouping key was the combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. In this dataset, these combinations were unique to specific workflows (45/M, 62/F, 28/M).
2.  **Departmental Consistency:** Events for Case 3 remained strictly within the "Surgery" context, whereas Cases 1 and 2 were "ER" based (with standard sub-loops to Radiology and Laboratory).
3.  **Clinical Flow:**
    *   *Case 1:* X-ray (Leg) $\rightarrow$ Diagnosis (Fracture).
    *   *Case 2:* Lab Test $\rightarrow$ Diagnosis (Infection) $\rightarrow$ Prescription.
    *   *Case 3:* Consultation (Knee) $\rightarrow$ Surgery (Arthroscopy) $\rightarrow$ Recovery.
