Based on the provided process data, here are some process- and data-specific potential root causes for performance issues:

1. **Inefficient Loading Bay Operations**:
	* **Frequent switches between "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Load to Vehicle"**: 1753 events with a duration of 2318.32 hours suggest that loading bay operations might be causing bottlenecks, potentially due to inadequate resource allocation or inefficient scheduling.
	* **Long duration for "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (112600.53 hours)**: This transition's extremely long duration hints at significant waiting times or storage capacity issues before items are brought to the loading bay.

2. **Weighing Process Inefficiencies**:
	* **High frequency of "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" and "Place in Stock" -> "Weigh"**: These frequent transitions (1673 and 1326 events, respectively) with substantial durations suggest potential weighing process inefficiencies or the need for repeated weight verifications.
	* **Long duration for "Load to Vehicle" -> "Weigh" (29836.64 hours)**: This could indicate that items are waiting excessively before being weighed after loading, possibly due to weighing capacity constraints.

3. **Vehicle Booking and Container Scheduling Issues (Transport Document)**:
	* **Significant duration for "Create Transport Document" -> "Book Vehicles" (22207.07 hours)**: This might point to difficulties in finding suitable vehicles or inefficient booking processes.
	* **Long duration and high frequency of "Depart" -> "Depart" (1051301.41 hours, 142 events)**: Repeated departures with long durations could indicate frequent rescheduling, potentially caused by:
		+ Inadequate initial scheduling
		+ Insufficient vehicle or container capacity
		+ High rates of container unavailability

4. **Container Rescheduling and Availability**:
	* **"Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" and "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container"**: The existence of these paths with notable durations and frequencies (e.g., 275189.97 hours for the former) suggests that container unavailability or scheduling conflicts are common, leading to additional delays.

**Recommendations for Further Analysis:**

1. **Detailed Resource Utilization Analysis**: Examine resource allocation (e.g., forklifts, weighing machines, vehicles, containers) to identify underutilized or overburdened resources.
2. **Scheduling Process Review**: Investigate the scheduling algorithms and practices for loading bays, vehicle bookings, and container allocations to optimize workflows.
3. **Root Cause Analysis for Rescheduling**: Conduct in-depth analysis on instances of rescheduling (container and departure) to pinpoint recurring causes.
4. **Storage Capacity Assessment**: Evaluate storage capacity in relation to workflow demands to address potential bottlenecks at the loading bay and stock areas.
