Example of a problematic trace the model accepts:

Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Close_Order

Why the model accepts this trace
- After Receive_Order and Check_Inventory the model selects the "successful" branch, which is a PARALLEL node containing {Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order}. A PARALLEL node allows its children to occur in any order (and interleaved), so Ship_Order can legitimately occur before Authorize_Payment and Package_Items in the model.  
- The root SEQUENCE then allows the final Close_Order after the parallel branch, so the trace above fits the process tree.

Why this trace is invalid in the OrdertoCash domain
- You should not ship items before payment is authorized: shipping before Authorize_Payment can mean delivering goods without confirmed payment (financial and fraud risk).  
- You should not ship items before they are packaged: Ship_Order prior to Package_Items is physically impossible or logically inconsistent.  
- In short, the model is underfitting because it fails to encode the real ordering constraints (Authorize_Payment before Package_Items and Ship_Order, and Package_Items before Ship_Order), so it erroneously admits traces that violate critical business rules.

(Another example of underfitting in the same model: choosing the cancel branch yields Cancel_Order  Close_Order and then the root adds another Close_Order, producing two Close_Order events in a row — also domain-invalid.)
