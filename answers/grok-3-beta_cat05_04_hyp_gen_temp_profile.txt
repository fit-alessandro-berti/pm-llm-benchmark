### Analysis of Temporal Profile Model for Insurance Claim Handling Process

#### 1. Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

Upon reviewing the temporal profile model for the insurance claim handling process, several anomalies in the average times and standard deviations between activities have been identified. These anomalies could indicate potential irregularities or inefficiencies in the process flow:

- **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average time between receiving a claim and approving it is approximately 25 hours, with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour. This suggests a rigid, possibly artificial schedule for approvals that may not align with realistic business processing times.
- **P to N (Approve to Notify):** There is a significant average delay of 7 days between approving a claim and notifying the customer, with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates inconsistent timing, where notifications are sometimes heavily delayed or occur very quickly, pointing to potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- **A to C (Assign to Close):** The average time between assigning an adjuster and closing a claim is only 2 hours, with a standard deviation of 1 hour. This rapid closure might suggest that some claims are being closed prematurely, potentially skipping critical steps like evaluation or approval.
- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The average time between evaluating a claim and notifying the customer is just 5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1 minute. This extremely short interval raises concerns about whether proper checks or processes are being followed, or if intermediate steps are being bypassed.

#### 2. Hypotheses for Anomalies

Several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the identified anomalies in the temporal profile:

- **R to P (Receive to Approve) - Low Standard Deviation and Short Time:** This could be due to an automated or pre-scheduled approval mechanism that does not account for the complexity of individual claims, leading to a uniform but potentially unrealistic approval timeline. Alternatively, certain claims might be fast-tracked without proper evaluation.
- **P to N (Approve to Notify) - Long Delay with High Variability:** The extended delay and high variability might result from resource constraints, such as insufficient staff to handle notifications, leading to backlogs. It could also indicate manual processing delays or inconsistent communication protocols with customers.
- **A to C (Assign to Close) - Rapid Closure:** This anomaly may reflect a procedural flaw where claims are closed immediately after assignment due to errors, misclassification, or administrative decisions to dismiss certain claims without full processing. It could also suggest adjuster workload issues or system glitches.
- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) - Extremely Short Interval:** The rapid transition might indicate an automated notification system triggering immediately after evaluation, potentially bypassing necessary review steps. Alternatively, it could suggest that evaluation and notification are performed by the same resource in a single step, which may not align with intended separation of duties.

#### 3. Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

To investigate these anomalies further, the following SQL queries are proposed to analyze the data in the `claim_events` table and correlate timing deviations with other factors such as adjusters, claim types, or regions. These queries aim to identify specific claims exhibiting anomalous behavior and uncover patterns that might explain the irregularities.

##### a. Investigate R to P (Receive to Approve) - Short Time with Low Standard Deviation
This query identifies claims where the time between Receive and Approve is significantly outside the expected average of 90,000 seconds (25 hours), focusing on unusually quick approvals (e.g., less than 21 hours or 75,600 seconds).

```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS receive_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'
    AND ce2.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    td.claim_id,
    td.receive_time,
    td.approve_time,
    td.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount
FROM time_diffs td
JOIN claims c ON td.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE td.time_diff_seconds < 75600  -- Less than 21 hours
ORDER BY td.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query helps identify claims with unusually quick approvals, which can be correlated with claim type or amount to check if specific categories are being fast-tracked.

##### b. Investigate P to N (Approve to Notify) - Long Delay with High Variability
This query targets claims where the time between Approve and Notify exceeds the average of 604,800 seconds (7 days) by a significant margin (e.g., more than 9 days or 777,600 seconds).

```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS approve_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    td.claim_id,
    td.approve_time,
    td.notify_time,
    td.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM time_diffs td
JOIN claims c ON td.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON td.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE td.time_diff_seconds > 777600  -- More than 9 days
ORDER BY td.time_diff_seconds DESC;
```

**Purpose:** This query isolates claims with excessive delays in notification, linking them to adjusters and regions to determine if specific resources or locations are contributing to the backlog.

##### c. Investigate A to C (Assign to Close) - Rapid Closure
This query identifies claims closed within 3,600 seconds (1 hour) of assignment, which is below the average of 7,200 seconds (2 hours), to check for premature closures.

```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS assign_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS close_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'A'
    AND ce2.activity = 'C'
)
SELECT 
    td.claim_id,
    td.assign_time,
    td.close_time,
    td.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    ce.additional_info
FROM time_diffs td
JOIN claims c ON td.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON td.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE td.time_diff_seconds < 3600  -- Less than 1 hour
ORDER BY td.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query highlights claims closed unusually quickly after assignment, using additional information and adjuster details to investigate potential reasons for premature closure.

##### d. Investigate E to N (Evaluate to Notify) - Extremely Short Interval
This query finds claims where the time between Evaluate and Notify is less than 240 seconds (4 minutes), below the average of 300 seconds (5 minutes), to check for overly rapid transitions.

```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        ce1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
        ce2.timestamp AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'E'
    AND ce2.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    td.claim_id,
    td.evaluate_time,
    td.notify_time,
    td.time_diff_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    a.name AS adjuster_name
FROM time_diffs td
JOIN claims c ON td.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN claim_events ce ON td.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE td.time_diff_seconds < 240  -- Less than 4 minutes
ORDER BY td.time_diff_seconds;
```

**Purpose:** This query detects claims with suspiciously fast notifications after evaluation, linking them to adjusters and claim types to assess if automation or procedural shortcuts are in play.

These queries provide a starting point for deeper analysis into the root causes of the temporal anomalies, enabling stakeholders to address potential inefficiencies or compliance issues in the claim handling process.
