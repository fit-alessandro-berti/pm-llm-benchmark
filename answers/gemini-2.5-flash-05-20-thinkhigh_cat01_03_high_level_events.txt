Based on the analysis of the provided event log, the low-level events can be grouped into five meaningful, higher-level process steps. These steps represent coherent stages of the manufacturing process for a single product (CaseID).

### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

**1. High-Level Activity Name: Material Preparation & Setup**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   Retrieve raw metal sheet
    *   Scan barcode
    *   Place metal sheet on table
    *   Align metal sheet
    *   Preheat metal sheet
*   **Rationale for Grouping:**
    *   **Purpose:** These events collectively prepare the raw material (metal sheet) for the core manufacturing process. They involve initial physical handling, identification/tracking, precise positioning, and pre-treatment (preheating) to bring the material into the correct state and location.
    *   **Temporal Cohesion:** They occur sequentially and consecutively at the very beginning of the process for each case, indicating a distinct initial phase.
    *   **Resource Involvement:** While different resources are involved (Operator A, Robot Arm #2, Heating Unit #1), all are dedicated to conditioning the input material.

**2. High-Level Activity Name: Component Fabrication (Welding)**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   Pick up welding tool
    *   Weld corner A
    *   Weld corner B
*   **Rationale for Grouping:**
    *   **Purpose:** These events represent the primary value-adding manufacturing step where the raw material is transformed into a more complete product through a specific fabrication method (welding). This is the core assembly or joining operation.
    *   **Resource and Tool Focus:** All events are directly related to the welding process, performed by the same operator (Operator B) using a specific tool (welding tool), highlighting a dedicated work center or skill set.
    *   **Temporal Cohesion:** They are tightly clustered in time, indicating a continuous operation that forms a single, logical work package.

**3. High-Level Activity Name: Post-Fabrication Quality Inspection**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   Measure weld integrity
*   **Rationale for Grouping:**
    *   **Purpose:** This event is a critical quality control measure taken immediately after the primary fabrication step (welding) to verify the quality and integrity of the work performed. It serves as a specific check before further processing.
    *   **Logical Dependency:** It directly follows and assesses the outcome of the "Component Fabrication" step.
    *   **Resource Specialization:** It's performed by an automated quality sensor, indicating a dedicated inspection point.

**4. High-Level Activity Name: Surface Finishing & Curing**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   Apply protective coating
    *   Dry coating
*   **Rationale for Grouping:**
    *   **Purpose:** These events represent the process of applying a protective or aesthetic layer to the product and ensuring it is properly set or cured. This is a distinct treatment phase following assembly.
    *   **Process Specificity:** They involve specialized equipment (Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2) and are focused on altering the product's surface properties.
    *   **Logical Flow:** They logically follow the core fabrication and initial quality checks, preparing the product for final stages.

**5. High-Level Activity Name: Final Product Quality Assurance**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   Visual check
*   **Rationale for Grouping:**
    *   **Purpose:** This event represents a final, overall quality check of the product before it is considered complete, ready for packaging, or dispatch. It's a broader assessment compared to the specific "Measure weld integrity" check.
    *   **Position in Workflow:** It occurs at the very end of the observable process sequence for each case, acting as a final gate.
    *   **Resource Role:** Performed by a different operator (Operator C), suggesting a dedicated role for final inspection.
