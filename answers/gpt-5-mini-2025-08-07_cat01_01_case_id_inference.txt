Inferred that there are three distinct cases, identified by patient_age + patient_gender (these attributes uniquely tie events together). Mapping of event numbers -> case and brief justification:

Case A — Patient: 45 M (ER)
- Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- Sequence (times): Register 08:05:13  Initial triage 08:10:50  Xray 08:15:42  Doctor consult (hairline fracture) 08:23:10  Discharge 08:30:05
- Rationale: same age/gender, ER department for registration/triage/consult, imaging matches fracture, logical temporal ordering.

Case B — Patient: 62 F (ER)
- Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- Sequence: Register 08:07:02  Initial triage 08:12:29  Lab test requested 08:16:10  Lab completed 08:20:27  Doctor consult (minor infection) 08:22:54  Prescription 08:27:00  Discharge 08:35:29
- Rationale: same age/gender, all ER/laboratory activities and timestamps form a coherent clinical path (triage  labs  consult  prescription  discharge).

Case C — Patient: 28 M (Surgery)
- Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- Sequence: Register (Surgery) 08:07:15  Doctor consult (scheduled knee surgery) 08:13:00  Surgery preparation 08:16:45  Surgery performed 08:25:19  Recovery room 08:31:37  Discharge (Surgery) 08:40:13
- Rationale: same age/gender, all Surgery/Recovery department activities with consistent procedural flow and timestamps.

Summary table (event -> case):
- 1  Case A (45 M)
- 2  Case B (62 F)
- 3  Case C (28 M)
- 4  Case A
- 5  Case B
- 6  Case C
- 7  Case A
- 8  Case B
- 9  Case C
- 10  Case B
- 11  Case B
- 12  Case A
- 13  Case C
- 14  Case B
- 15  Case A
- 16  Case C
- 17  Case B
- 18  Case C

If you want, I can output these as explicit case traces (ordered event records per case) or produce a visual timeline showing the interleaving.
