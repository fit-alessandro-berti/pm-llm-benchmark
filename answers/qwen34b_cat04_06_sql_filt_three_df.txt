<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a DuckDB query that returns all events from the event_log table except those in cases that have a specific sequence of three activities with a time gap between the second and third activity of more than 5 days.

First, I need to understand the requirements. The main steps are:

1. Find cases where the three activities happen in order with no events in between.
2. For those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude those cases from the final result.

So, the final result should include all events except those in cases that meet both conditions.

Let me break it down. To find the sequence of three activities in order, I need to check for consecutive events in the same case. Since the activities must be in order with no other events in between, I need to ensure that between the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and 'Create Order' there's no other event, and similarly between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

But how do I check for that? Maybe by ordering the events by timestamp within each case and then checking the activity sequence.

Alternatively, for each case, I can find the positions of each activity in the sequence. Let me think about using window functions or self-joins.

Another approach is to generate a sequence of events for each case, ordered by timestamp, and then check if the activities are in the correct order. For example, for each case, we can check if there's a row where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', followed by 'Confirm Order', with no other events in between.

But how to do that in SQL?

Maybe using a self-join approach. Let's think: for each case, we can find the earliest occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then find the next occurrence of 'Create Order' after that, and then check if there's a 'Confirm Order' after that. But also ensuring that there are no events between them.

Alternatively, for each case, we can look for the first occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then find the next occurrence of 'Create Order' that is after that, and then check if the next occurrence of 'Confirm Order' is after that, and that there are no events between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

But how to model this in SQL?

Another idea: For each case, order the events by timestamp, then check if the activity sequence is exactly 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in consecutive rows. That would require that the first activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order', and that there are no other activities in between.

So, for each case, we can assign a row number within the case ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the activity matches the sequence for the row number.

For example:

Within a case, if the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', and the third is 'Confirm Order', then that case meets the first condition. But we need to ensure that there are no other events between these three. So, the row numbers for these three events should be 1, 2, 3, and the activities should match.

So, the plan is:

1. For each case, order the events by timestamp, assign row numbers.

2. Filter for cases where there exists a row with row number 1, activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', row number 2, activity 'Create Order', and row number 3, activity 'Confirm Order'.

But how to do that in SQL?

Maybe using a CTE to assign row numbers, then check for those specific row numbers and activities.

Alternatively, using a window function to get the activity for each row number.

Let me try to write that.

First, create a CTE that for each case, orders the events by timestamp, and assigns a row number.

Then, select from that CTE where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and row number is 1, and activity is 'Create Order' and row number is 2, and activity is 'Confirm Order' and row number is 3. Then, check if the time between row 2 and row 3 is more than 5 days.

But how to handle that?

Wait, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is the difference between their timestamps. So, for each case, if the row numbers are 1, 2, 3, then the timestamp of row 2 is the 'Create Order' event, and row 3 is 'Confirm Order'. The difference between these two timestamps should be more than 5 days.

So, the steps are:

- Find all cases where there are three consecutive events with the correct activities.

- For those cases, check if the time between the second and third events is more than 5 days.

- Exclude those cases from the final result.

So, the query needs to first identify these cases, then exclude them, and return all other events.

So, the approach is:

1. Find all case_ids that meet the three-activity sequence and the time condition.

2. Then, from the event_log, select all events where the case_id is not in that list.

But how to find the case_ids that meet the criteria.

Let me think about how to structure this.

First, for each case, order the events by timestamp and assign row numbers.

Then, check for row numbers 1, 2, 3 with the correct activities.

Then, compute the time between row 2 and row 3.

So, in SQL:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT 
    o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
WHERE 
    o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
;

Wait, but this would get the case_ids that have the three activities in order with no other events in between, and the time between the second and third is more than 5 days.

Then, the final query would be to exclude those case_ids from the event_log.

So, the final query is:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    -- subquery to get the case_ids that meet the criteria
);

But the problem is that the subquery might have multiple entries for the same case_id. However, since we are checking for case_id in the subquery, it's okay.

But wait, the subquery might return multiple case_ids, but the case_id is unique. So, the NOT IN would work.

But need to make sure that the subquery returns the correct case_ids.

But how to structure the subquery?

Let me think again. The subquery would be the one that finds all case_ids that have the three activities in order with no other events between them, and the time between the second and third is more than 5 days.

So, the subquery is:

SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
WHERE 
    o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
;

But wait, this is assuming that the three events are consecutive in the ordered_events. Because the row numbers are 1, 2, 3. So, the join between o1, o2, o3 is such that o1.rn is 1, o2.rn is 2, o3.rn is 3. So, the three events are in order, and there are no other events between them.

But what if there are other events after the third? That's okay, because the problem is only about the sequence of three events in order, with no events between them. So the rest of the events in the case are irrelevant.

So, this subquery should correctly find the case_ids that meet the criteria.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But wait, the ordered_events CTE is a subquery. So, in DuckDB, can I use that?

Yes, as long as it's properly structured.

But in DuckDB, the ROW_NUMBER() function is available.

But what if a case has more than three events? For example, if a case has the three activities in order, but then more events after. But the subquery would still find that case as it has the three events in order.

Now, the problem is that the three events must be in direct succession, with no other events between them. The way the row numbers are set, the three events are consecutive. So, the joins would ensure that.

But I need to make sure that the three events are in order. For example, the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the second is 'Create Order', the third is 'Confirm Order', and there are no other events between them.

So, the joins are correct.

Now, the next step is to write the final query.

But in the final query, the subquery is selecting the case_ids that meet the criteria, and then the main query excludes those.

But what about cases that have multiple such sequences? For example, a case may have the three activities in order more than once. But the subquery would include the case_id once, so the NOT IN would exclude it once.

But the problem is that the subquery may return multiple rows for the same case_id, but using DISTINCT ensures that each case_id is only considered once.

So, that should be okay.

Now, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
        FROM event_log
    ) AS ordered_events
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON ordered_events.case_id = o2.case_id AND ordered_events.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON ordered_events.case_id = o3.case_id AND ordered_events.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        ordered_events.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

Wait, but in the CTE, the name is ordered_events, and then I'm joining to it again. So, perhaps the CTE is defined once, and then joined.

But in the above code, the CTE is defined as ordered_events, and then in the joins, it's joined to itself. So, the code is correct.

But in DuckDB, the syntax is okay.

But perhaps I should use a CTE for ordered_events once.

Wait, the code inside the subquery is:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
FROM event_log

Then, the joins are on ordered_events (the CTE) and the same CTE again. So, the code is correct.

But in the code above, the subquery is:

SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
...

But in the code, the CTE is named ordered_events, and then the joins are on o1, o2, o3, which are all from the same CTE. So, this is correct.

But in the code, the CTE is defined once, and then joined to itself. So, the code is correct.

But in DuckDB, can you do that? Yes, because the CTE is a subquery.

But in the code above, the CTE is named ordered_events, and then in the subquery, it's referenced as ordered_events o1, ordered_events o2, etc. So, that's correct.

But perhaps the code should be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
WHERE 
    o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
;

But the problem is that the CTE is not in the same scope as the subquery. But in DuckDB, the WITH clause is allowed.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    WITH ordered_events AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
        FROM event_log
    )
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But I'm not sure if the WITH clause is allowed inside the subquery. Because in DuckDB, the WITH clause is part of the query, not inside a subquery. So, the code above may not be valid.

Wait, the subquery is part of the NOT IN clause. So, the WITH clause can't be inside the subquery. Therefore, the code would need to be structured differently.

Alternatively, the CTE can be defined outside, but in the main query.

But in the main query, the code would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
WHERE 
    o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
;

But this is the subquery that is used in the NOT IN clause.

But in DuckDB, the WITH clause is allowed in the main query. So, the code would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    WITH ordered_events AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
        FROM event_log
    )
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But I'm not sure if DuckDB allows the WITH clause inside the subquery. Because the subquery is part of the NOT IN clause, which is a scalar subquery. So, the WITH clause can't be inside the subquery. Therefore, this approach may not be valid.

Alternative approach: move the CTE outside.

So, the code would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
FROM ordered_events o1
JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
WHERE 
    o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
;

Then, this subquery is used in the NOT IN clause.

But in the main query, the code would be:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But in this case, the CTE ordered_events is not available in the subquery. Because the subquery is inside the NOT IN clause, and the CTE is defined outside. So, the code would be:

But the CTE is defined outside, and then the subquery can refer to it.

Wait, no. The CTE is defined once, and then the subquery can use it. So, in DuckDB, the CTE can be defined once, then used in the subquery.

So, the code would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But this would be valid if the CTE is defined before the subquery.

But in DuckDB, the WITH clause is allowed in the main query, so this should work.

So, this is the correct approach.

But let me check if the joins are correct.

The o1.rn is 1, o2.rn is 2, o3.rn is 3. So, the join between o1 and o2 is on o1.rn = o2.rn - 1, and between o1 and o3 is o1.rn = o3.rn - 2. So, that would make o2.rn = o1.rn +1, and o3.rn = o1.rn +2. So, the three events are consecutive in the case.

Yes, that seems correct.

But what if a case has multiple instances of the three activities in order? For example, if a case has the three activities in order, then later, again the three activities in order. But the subquery would capture that case_id once, so the NOT IN would exclude it once.

But the problem is that the case may have multiple such sequences. But the query only needs to exclude the case if it has at least one such sequence meeting the criteria.

So, the code is correct.

Now, the final query is as above.

But what about the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'?

The code uses o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the final query should be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But wait, the CTE is defined once, and then the subquery uses it. So, this should work.

But in the subquery, the JOINs are on the same CTE. So, the code is correct.

Now, the problem is that the CTE is defined once, and then the subquery uses it. So, this should be valid in DuckDB.

Another thing to consider: the ordered_events CTE may include all events in the case, with their row numbers. So, for each case, the row numbers are assigned based on the timestamp order.

Thus, the joins should correctly find the three consecutive events.

So, this should be the correct query.

Now, the user said that the final query should return all events from the cases that do not meet the criteria. So, the code above does that by excluding the case_ids that meet the criteria.

Therefore, this should be the correct answer.
</think>

To address the problem, we need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that:

1. **Identifies cases** that contain the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession:  
   `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`  `'Create Order'`  `'Confirm Order'`, with **no other events** between them.

2. **Finds cases** where the **time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days**.

3. **Excludes those cases** from the final result, returning **all other events**.

---

###  Solution Strategy

We will:

- Use a **CTE (Common Table Expression)** to assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp.
- Join the CTE on itself to find the three consecutive events in the required order.
- Filter for cases where the time between the second and third events in the sequence is **more than 5 days**.
- Exclude those cases from the final result using a `NOT IN` clause.

---

###  Final SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o1.case_id = o2.case_id AND o1.rn = o2.rn - 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o1.case_id = o3.case_id AND o1.rn = o3.rn - 2
    WHERE 
        o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

---

###  Explanation

- **CTE `ordered_events`**: Assigns a row number (`rn`) to each event in a case, ordered by timestamp.
- **Joins on `ordered_events`**: The three events are joined such that:
  - `o1.rn = 1`, `o2.rn = 2`, `o3.rn = 3`  ensures the three events are consecutive.
- **Filtering**: Ensures the sequence of activities is correct and the time between the second and third events is more than 5 days.
- **`NOT IN` clause**: Excludes the identified cases from the final result, returning all other events.

---

###  Notes

- The `INTERVAL '5 days'` is used to ensure the time difference is more than 5 days.
- The `DISTINCT` keyword in the subquery ensures that each case is only considered once, even if multiple valid sequences exist within it.
- The query is structured to ensure correctness and performance by leveraging window functions and joins.
