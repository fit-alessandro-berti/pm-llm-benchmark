1. What triggers the start of the onboarding process—does it always begin with an inbound landlord request, or are there other entry points (referrals, acquisitions, portfolio transfers)?

2. What are the clear “end conditions” for onboarding in your organization—tenant moved in, property activated in the portal, or all audits completed?

9. Where does responsibility sit for document validation (coordinator only, legal/compliance review, third-party verification)?

10. Are there any service-level targets for documentation review (e.g., “review within X business days”), and what happens if those targets aren’t met?

11. What property details are required in the central database beyond what you listed (ownership structure, utilities, parking, HOA rules, accessibility features, licensing numbers, insurance)?

12. How do you ensure data accuracy when entering property information—double entry checks, approvals, standardized templates, or periodic audits?

13. When property details change during onboarding (price range, amenities, unit count), how is versioning handled and who approves the updates?

17. What standard topics or checklists are covered in the intro meeting, and what is considered “custom” vs. “standard policy”?

18. How are special conditions captured and made actionable (e.g., pet policy, tenant maintenance responsibilities)—do they become lease clauses, internal notes, portal settings, or all three?

20. At what point do you confirm the landlord’s chosen payment channels and banking details, and how do you validate them?

23. What are the inspection standards you follow (local code, internal checklist, third-party certification), and who defines them?

24. How are inspection findings categorized (critical vs. minor), and what thresholds must be met before marketing/activation can proceed?

25. If issues are found, who owns remediation coordination (landlord vs. property manager), and who pays by default?

26. What happens when the landlord disagrees with inspection findings or refuses to make repairs—do you escalate, pause onboarding, or decline the property?

27. How do you track remediation tasks, deadlines, and contractor performance, and who signs off when issues are resolved?

28. Are there scenarios where you can activate/market a property “pending repairs” with disclosures, or is passing inspection always required first?

29. How is initial pricing decided—landlord expectations vs. market comps vs. internal margin targets—and who has final approval?

30. How frequently are pricing models refreshed, and can pricing change during active marketing?

31. What does the marketing team need as inputs (photos, inspection pass, amenity data, price band), and what are typical turnaround times?

32. Which channels do you publish to (company portal only vs. third-party marketplaces), and how do you ensure listing consistency across channels?

33. What internal review happens before a listing goes live (brand checks, compliance checks, accuracy validation)?

34. What does “activated” mean in operational terms—what systems are updated, and what capabilities become available at that moment?

35. Are there gating criteria for activation besides inspection pass (signed management agreement, insurance proof, landlord identity verification, banking setup)?

36. Who can authorize activation, and is it a single approval or multiple approvals (manager + compliance, etc.)?

37. How are prospective tenant inquiries handled once activated—central call center, property manager, leasing agent—and what’s the handoff process?

38. What screening criteria are standard (credit score thresholds, income-to-rent ratios, background checks), and how do they vary by city or property type?

39. Who performs each part of screening (application review vs. credit check vs. employment verification vs. reference checks), and how is it documented?

40. How do you handle applicants who don’t meet criteria but have compensating factors (co-signers, higher deposit, upfront rent)?

41. What is your process when multiple qualified applicants exist—first-come-first-served, scoring model, landlord preference, or negotiation?

42. How and when do landlords participate in tenant selection—do they approve the final tenant, or is it delegated to the company?

43. What kinds of lease term negotiations are allowed (rent, lease length, concessions), and what requires approval beyond the property manager?

44. How do promotional discounts get decided, funded, and recorded—and are there limits or guardrails?

45. What is the standard lease template, and what are the most common customizations landlords request?

46. How do you ensure custom clauses remain compliant with local laws and fair housing rules—who reviews and signs off?

47. At what point is the lease considered “final”—after all reviews, after signatures, after payment collection?

48. How are security deposits handled (timing, accepted methods, holding accounts by jurisdiction), and what’s the process if payment fails or is delayed?

49. How is the move-in date scheduled and coordinated (keys, access codes, utilities, walk-through), and who owns each step?

50. What quality checks happen before move-in (property condition check, inventory for furnished units, safety equipment verification)?

51. Can you describe the compliance officer’s review in more detail—what are they checking, and what typically causes a lease to be flagged?

52. What does the financial analyst verify exactly (rent vs. target, fee structure, expected costs), and what happens if the deal doesn’t meet targets?

54. Do these audits happen sequentially or in parallel, and are they blocking steps or post-activation controls?

55. Where do handoffs most commonly fail (between coordinator  manager, manager  marketing, leasing  compliance), and how do you mitigate that?

56. What are the most frequent exceptions you see (special insurance, unique property types, custom clauses), and how is exception handling formally managed?

57. How do you decide when an exception requires escalation, and who is the escalation path (legal, regional director, risk/compliance)?

58. How do you track and centralize communication today (email, CRM, project tools), and what is the “system of record” for key decisions?

59. How do you ensure everyone is working from the same latest information (document versions, pricing changes, inspection status)?

60. What metrics do you track for onboarding performance (cycle time, drop-off reasons, inspection failure rate, marketing turnaround, time-to-lease)?
