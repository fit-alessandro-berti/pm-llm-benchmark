### 3. Process Flow Description

#### **Phase 1: Receipt and Initial Triage (AP Clerk)**

**Start Event:** Invoice received (usually via email).

1.  **Task:** Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number.
    *   *Performed by:* AP Clerk.
2.  **Gateway (Exclusive):** Is a valid PO Number present?
    *   **Path A (No PO):**
        *   **Task:** Request details from Supplier OR Forward to AP Supervisor.
            *   *Sub-process (Exception):* AP Supervisor investigates. If the service was informal, coordinate with Dept Head to create a **Retrospective PO**. If invalid, **Reject Invoice**.
            *   *Outcome:* If resolved, proceed to Step 3. If rejected, **End Process**.
    *   **Path B (Yes PO):** Proceed to Step 3.

3.  **Task:** Log Invoice into Accounting System.
    *   *Performed by:* AP Clerk.
4.  **Task:** Forward to Purchasing Department.
    *   *Action:* Send email/notification to confirm goods/services receipt.

#### **Phase 2: Purchasing Verification (Purchasing Officer)**

5.  **Task:** Verify Invoice Details against PO.
    *   *Performed by:* Purchasing Officer.
    *   *Actions:* Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges, and confirm goods receipt.
6.  **Gateway (Exclusive):** Are there discrepancies (e.g., price mismatch, extra units)?
    *   **Path A (Yes - Discrepancy Found):**
        *   **Task:** Resolve Discrepancy.
            *   *Option 1:* Contact Supplier directly.
            *   *Option 2:* Consult **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen) to check contract terms.
            *   *Option 3:* Request AP Clerk to "Hold" invoice.
        *   **Gateway:** Can it be resolved?
            *   *No:* Escalate to **AP Supervisor** (Rita) $\rightarrow$ Supervisor determines if Invoice is Rejected or Accepted with notes.
            *   *Yes:* Supplier sends **Corrected Invoice** $\rightarrow$ Return to Step 5.
    *   **Path B (No - Everything Correct):**
        *   **Task:** Send Confirmation Email to AP Clerk.

#### **Phase 3: System Matching (AP Clerk)**

7.  **Task:** Perform 3-Way Match (Invoice Line Items vs. PO).
    *   *Performed by:* AP Clerk (upon receipt of Purchasing confirmation).
    *   *Note:* If a mismatch occurs here that Purchasing missed, loop back to **Phase 2 (Discrepancy)**.
8.  **Task:** Initiate Manager Approval.
    *   *Action:* System triggers an automatic email/notification to the Department Manager.

#### **Phase 4: Manager Approval (Department Manager)**

9.  **Task:** Review Invoice & PO Details.
    *   *Performed by:* Department Manager.
10. **Gateway (Exclusive):** Approval Decision?

        *   **Task:** Reject in system OR Request AP to Investigate.

    *   **Path B (Approve):**
        *   **Task:** Approve in System.

#### **Phase 5: Payment Scheduling (AP Clerk)**

11. **Task:** Schedule Payment Run.
    *   *Performed by:* AP Clerk.
    *   *Trigger:* Occurs after Manager Approval is logged in the system.
    *   *Note:* Accounts Payable Supervisor ensures "Problem Invoices" eventually re-enter this flow after resolution.

### 4. Summary of Identified Exceptions
*   **Missing PO:** Handled by AP Clerk initially; escalated to AP Supervisor for "Retrospective PO" creation if the contract was informal.
*   **Pricing/Term Discrepancies:** Handled by Purchasing, often looping in the Supplier Relationship Manager for contract verification.
*   **Manager Rejection:** Rare (once every couple of months); results in a hold/investigation loop led by AP.
