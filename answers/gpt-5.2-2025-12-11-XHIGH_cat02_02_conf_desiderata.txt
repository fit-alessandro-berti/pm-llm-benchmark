## 1) Normative (hard-rule) compliance

### Case 1 — **Compliant**
Observed order matches the required sequence:
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
No steps are skipped, reordered, or contradictory.

---

### Case 2 — **Violates normative rules**
Hard-rule deviations:
1. **Wrong order:** *Risk Assessment* happens **before** *Credit Check*  
   - Logged: Application Received (08:00)  **Risk Assessment (08:20)**  Credit Check (09:00)  
   - Violates: **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.
2. **Skipped required step:** *Inform Applicant* is **missing after the decision**  
   - Violates: **Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision** (and is mandatory).
3. **Contradictory action after rejection:** *Finalize Documentation* occurs despite **Loan Decision (Rejected)**  
   - Violates: **If rejected, do not finalize documentation; close the case without finalization**.

So Case 2 is non-compliant on ordering, completeness (missing “Inform Applicant”), and decision-dependent logic.

---

### Case 3 — **Compliant (normatively)**
All hard ordering/logic rules are respected:
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
Delays do not break the *normative* constraints (since those were about order/logic, not time).

---

## 2) Desiderata (soft recommendations) deviations (suboptimal, not “serious”)

Assumed desiderata:
- Credit Check within **24h** after Application Received
- Inform Applicant within **48h** after Loan Decision
- Follow-up Call encouraged before Close Case

### Case 1 — **Meets timing desiderata (no issues visible)**
- Credit Check: 30 minutes after receipt (within 24h)
- Inform Applicant: 2 hours after decision (within 48h)
- Follow-up Call: not recorded, but also not explicitly expected in the case data  cannot call it a definite deviation based only on the provided log.

### Case 2 — **Timing desiderata mostly not assessable / overshadowed by normative violations**
- Credit Check: 1 hour after receipt (meets the 24h recommendation)
- Inform Applicant: **not recorded**, so it fails the “prompt informing” recommendation in practice (and is also a hard-rule issue).
- Follow-up Call: not recorded (optional).

### Case 3 — **Fails multiple desiderata (but still normatively compliant)**
1. **Late Credit Check:**  
   - 2024-01-12 09:00  2024-01-14 10:00 = ~49 hours (**>24h**)
2. **Late Inform Applicant:**  
   - 2024-01-14 12:00  2024-01-16 15:00 = ~51 hours (**>48h**)
3. **No Follow-up Call:** explicitly noted as missing (recommended but not required)

These indicate suboptimal responsiveness/communication, not a hard compliance breach.

## 3) Plausible interpretations / justifications

### Case 2 (normative violations) — possible explanations
- **Logging/timestamp error:** Credit Check may have been performed first but recorded late, making the Risk Assessment appear earlier.
- **“Risk Assessment” might be a preliminary pre-screen:** Some organizations run an initial risk triage before a formal credit bureau check; the activity label could be too coarse for compliance monitoring.
- **“Finalize Documentation” label ambiguity:** It might refer to **finalizing rejection paperwork** (decline letter, internal closure forms) rather than loan-contract documentation—still a problem relative to your stated rule, but it explains why it appears after rejection.
- **Missing “Inform Applicant” event may be out-of-system communication:** e.g., a phone call/email done in a CRM not integrated into this event log.

### Case 3 (desiderata violations) — possible explanations
- **External dependency delays:** credit bureau downtime, waiting for applicant consent, missing info, or back-office backlog could push the Credit Check beyond 24h.
- **Delayed applicant contact:** multiple contact attempts, applicant unresponsive, or batching notifications could explain informing >48h after the decision.
- **Follow-up Call omitted intentionally:** communication may have happened via email/portal updates, or staff may skip calls when documentation is straightforward.

### Case 1
- Represents the intended “happy path” and can serve as a benchmark trace for conformance checking.

If you want, I can express the normative rules as a simple declarative constraint set (e.g., precedence/response constraints) and map each violation to specific constraint breaches.
