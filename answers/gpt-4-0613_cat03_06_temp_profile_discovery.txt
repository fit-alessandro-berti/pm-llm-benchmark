Generating a temporal profile for your process would require calculation of average time between activities and the standard deviation of these times. Given the information provided, it's possible to derive the frequency of specific actions, but it's not detailed enough to calculate the time difference between any two specific actions or their average time. Performance values also provide some hint but without units and context, or understanding how they relate to your process events, it's impossible to use.

A temporal profile would also require data on when each process started and ended. This should ideally be timestamped data, i.e., having exact times/dates when each activity in the process was performed.

Once you have these time stamps, the time difference between two activities can be calculated by simply subtracting the timestamp of the first activity from the timestamp of the second activity. The average time between the two activities can be calculated by taking the mean of all these time differences.

Standard deviation, which measures the variation or dispersion of a set of values, can also be calculated if you have this data set.

However, without this additional specific timestamped data, generating a temporal profile as described isn't feasible.
