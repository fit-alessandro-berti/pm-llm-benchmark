**END**

## NOTES ON PROCESS VARIATIONS AND AMBIGUITIES:
1. There is some variation in whether the Purchasing Officer contacts suppliers directly or asks Accounts Payable to handle communication when there are discrepancies.
2. The exact point at which the Supplier Relationship Manager gets involved in resolving issues is not completely clear from the interviews, but appears to be primarily when the Accounts Payable Supervisor is handling escalated issues.
3. The interviews suggest that the process can return to different points after exception handling, depending on the nature of the issue resolved.
4. The frequency of manager rejections appears to be low ("maybe once every couple of months" according to Carlos).
5. The specific details of the payment scheduling process are not elaborated in the interviews.
