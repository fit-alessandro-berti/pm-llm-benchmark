To solve this problem, we need to construct a SQL query that follows these steps:

1. Identify cases with the specific sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order'.
2. Filter those cases where the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude events from these filtered cases and return all other events from the log.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Cases with Specific Sequence:**
   We will use subqueries to identify cases that have these activities in the correct sequence.

2. **Filter Based on Timing Condition:**
   Calculate the time difference and filter based on whether it exceeds 5 days.

3. **Exclude Filtered Cases:**
   Exclude events from those cases that meet both conditions above.

### DuckDB Query

Here is a sample query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM event_log AS e2
    JOIN event_log AS e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e2.timestamp < e3.timestamp
    WHERE e2.activity = 'Create Order' AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND DATEDIFF(e3.timestamp, e2.timestamp) <= INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

### Explanation:

- The outer query selects all events from `event_log`.
- The subquery checks if there are any other records in the same case where 'Create Order' appears before 'Confirm Order' and the time difference is more than 5 days.
- `DATEDIFF(e3.timestamp, e2.timestamp) <= INTERVAL '5 days'` ensures that 'Confirm Order' does not occur within 5 days of 'Create Order'.
- The `NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that only events from cases meeting the specified conditions are excluded.

This query will return all events except those from cases where 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' are found in direct succession with a time difference of more than 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
