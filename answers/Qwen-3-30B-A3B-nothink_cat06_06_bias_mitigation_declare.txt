Here is the **updated `declare_model`** with added constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process. These constraints ensure fairness by preventing direct or unmonitored transitions from sensitive attributes to biased decisions, and by requiring fairness checks for sensitive applicants.

###  **Updated `declare_model` with Bias-Mitigating Constraints**

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "precedence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "succession": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

###  **Explanation of Added Constraints and Their Rationale**

1. **`existence["ManualReview"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that `ManualReview` is always present in the process, which is necessary for fairness checks, especially for sensitive applicants.

2. **`responded_existence["CheckApplicantRace"]["BiasMitigationCheck"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that after checking a sensitive attribute (`CheckApplicantRace`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur before any decision is made. This prevents biased outcomes based on sensitive data.

3. **`coexistence["Approve_Minority"]["ManualReview"]` and `coexistence["Reject_Minority"]["ManualReview"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that if a decision is made for a minority applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` must also occur. This adds a fairness check for decisions involving sensitive demographics.

4. **`response["CheckApplicantRace"]["BiasMitigationCheck"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that after checking a sensitive attribute, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow. This prevents direct decision-making without review.

5. **`precedence["CheckApplicantRace"]["BiasMitigationCheck"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that `BiasMitigationCheck` always precedes any decision after a sensitive attribute is checked. This prevents biased decisions from being made too quickly.

6. **`succession["BiasMitigationCheck"]["Approve"]` and `succession["BiasMitigationCheck"]["Reject"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Ensures that `Approve` and `Reject` can only occur after a `BiasMitigationCheck`, which enforces that decisions are made with fairness in mind.

7. **`nonsuccession["CheckApplicantRace"]["Reject"]`**  
   - **Rationale:** Prevents `Reject` from occurring immediately after `CheckApplicantRace`, which could lead to biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

###  **Summary of Bias Mitigation**

These constraints collectively ensure that:
- Decisions involving sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) are not made without a fairness check.
- There is a mandatory review step (`ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck`) for decisions affecting minority applicants.
- Direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to decisions are prohibited.
- All decisions are preceded by a fair and monitored process.

This helps reduce the risk of algorithmic bias and ensures the process is more equitable and transparent.
