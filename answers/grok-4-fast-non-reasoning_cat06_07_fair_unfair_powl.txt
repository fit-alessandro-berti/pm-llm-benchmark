Below are the two POWL models based on the provided hiring process description. I've used the pm4py-style syntax for defining the models, incorporating appropriate activity labels (e.g., `Transition` for labeled activities like "ReceiveApplication"). Silent transitions (`SilentTransition`) are used where needed for branching or skipping without explicit labels. Loops are modeled with `Operator.LOOP` to handle data completeness checks (e.g., repeating until complete). XOR choices are modeled with `Operator.XOR` where branching occurs. Partial orders (`StrictPartialOrder`) enforce sequential dependencies (e.g., skill assessment before cultural fit). Unconnected nodes in a partial order imply concurrency, but here all flows are sequential to reflect the process.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an XOR branch after the skill assessment: one path is a standard `CulturalFitCheck`, and the other is a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (which implicitly provides a subtle advantage via affiliation flags, introducing potential bias). The loop ensures data completeness early on, and the final stages involve managerial review and decision-making. The XOR represents the "either/or" choice where bias can creep in based on affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck"), Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")])
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
xor_bias = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck"), Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")])
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define partial order with sequential dependencies
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, xor_bias, managerial_review, final_decision])
root.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_bias)
root.order.add_edge(xor_bias, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes the XOR branch to eliminate the potential for bias. All applicants follow the same sequential path, including a single `CulturalFitCheck` (without any community-affiliation-specific adjustments). The loop for data completeness is retained, as is the sequence for skill checks and final review/decision, ensuring fairness and uniformity.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck"), Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")])
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define partial order with sequential dependencies (no XOR branch)
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, managerial_review, final_decision])
root.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```
