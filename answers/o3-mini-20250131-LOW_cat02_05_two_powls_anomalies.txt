Below is an analysis of both models with respect to the normative Hire-to-Retire process, followed by a decision on which model adheres more closely to the expected process logic.

  
1. Review of the Standard Process  
A normative Hire-to-Retire process typically follows these activities in a logical, sequential order:  
• Posting a job advertisement  
• Screening candidates  
• Conducting interviews  
• Making the hiring decision  
• Onboarding the new employee  
• Adding the employee to the payroll  
• Closing the case  

Any deviation must be carefully weighed because the order of these activities not only represents a series of logical steps but also ensures that prerequisites are fulfilled before moving on to subsequent steps.

  
2. Analysis of POWL Model 1

• Structure Overview:  
  – Nodes: Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close.  
  – Ordering:  
- Post must precede Screen.  
- Screen must precede both Decide and Interview (i.e. screening feeds both decision and interview tasks).  
- Decide precedes Onboard, which in turn precedes Payroll, and then Close.

• Identified Anomalies:  
  – The anomaly that stands out is the placement of Interview after Screen with a parallel dependency: Screen is prerequisite for both Decide and Interview. In normative processes, interviews normally take place before making a hiring decision.  
  – Here, the model seems to allow the two concurrent branches (Decide and Interview) after screening, meaning a hiring decision (Decide) might be reached concurrently with, or even before, the interview process is fully complete. This could lead to a situation where hiring decisions do not properly consider candidate interviews.  
  – Although the decision is logically tied to screening in the model, completely bypassing or misordering interviews undermines the standard hiring evaluation.

• Severity:  
  – This anomaly is relatively severe because conducting interviews is a critical step that should precede any hiring decision. Hence, the sequencing does not preserve the integrity of the typical decision-making process.  

  
3. Analysis of POWL Model 2

• Structure Overview:  
  – Nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding (with Onboard and a skip option), xor_payroll (with Payroll and a skip option), Close.  
  – Ordering:  
- Post precedes Screen and Interview concurrently.  
- Interview precedes Decide.  
- Decide precedes the loop_onboarding operator.  
- loop_onboarding precedes the xor_payroll operator, which then precedes Close.

• Identified Anomalies:  
  – Posting of job advertisement is directly connected to both Screen and Interview. This implies that the interview might occur in parallel with screening. In a normative process, screening typically takes place before or concurrently with scheduling interviews, but the simultaneous start of interviews and screening can be seen as unusual depending on organizational practice.  
  – The inclusion of loop_onboarding with a skip option indicates a control-flow possibility to bypass or repeatedly engage in onboarding. While loops for onboarding might be justified by iterations or rework in practice, the option to skip onboarding entirely is an anomaly because onboarding is an essential process for preparing the new hire.  
  – Similarly, the xor_payroll operator allows for the possibility to skip adding the new employee to the payroll. Skipping payroll integration is a fundamental deviation—if payroll is not updated, the employee might never receive compensation or be officially recognized.  

• Severity:  
  – Although the ordering from interview to decision is maintained (which is good), the optional aspects introduced by loops and choices (onboarding and payroll can be skipped) are anomalies. Depending on the intent, these deviations compromise the mandatory nature of these subsequent steps.  
  – These anomalies are severe in terms of process integrity: the possibility of bypassing onboarding and payroll undermines the whole “hire-to-retire” lifecycle.   

  
4. Who is Closer to a Normative Hire-to-Retire Process?

Examining both anomalous aspects:  

• Model 1’s primary fault is that it allows the decision to be made concurrently with the interviewing process. This misorder may compromise candidate evaluation; however, despite this misordering, the steps after (onboarding, payroll, case closing) are sequential and mandatory. Thus, the overall process still obliges a followup for the hire.

• Model 2, on the other hand, respects the ordering from interview to decision. However, it introduces optional execution of crucial steps:
- The onboarding step is embedded in a loop that includes a “skip” alternative.  
- Similarly, adding the employee to the payroll can be skipped.
Skipping these steps threatens the integrity of the process because onboarding and payroll integration are generally non-optional in a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.

Given that the core mandate of a Hire-to-Retire process is not only a proper evaluation and selection (which Model 2 supports more rigorously by sequencing Interview  Decide) but also ensuring that the new hire is properly integrated (onboarding and payroll), the option to bypass these critical steps in Model 2 is a more fundamental anomaly than reordering Interview and Decide. Missing onboarding or payroll is a critical flaw which could completely invalidate the process from an operational or legal standpoint.

  
5. Conclusion and Justification

Between the two models, Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process despite its anomaly in the sequencing of the interview and decision steps. Every step following the decision in Model 1 is mandatory and sequentially correct (onboarding, payroll, case closure), so the overall integrity of hiring is maintained.  

Model 2, in contrast, while correctly ordering the interview before the hiring decision, introduces choice operators that allow essential activities—onboarding and payroll—to be optionally skipped. Skipping these vital activities undermines the very purpose of the process, making these anomalies more severe in terms of process correctness and organizational integrity.

Therefore, Model 1 is preferred as it, despite some misordering in candidate evaluation steps, maintains the mandatory execution of essential post-selection activities, thereby preserving the core integrity of the Hire-to-Retire process.
