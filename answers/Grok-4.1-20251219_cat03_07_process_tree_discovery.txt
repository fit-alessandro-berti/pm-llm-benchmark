The discovered **process tree** that balances fitness, precision, and simplicity for the given event log is:

```
-> ( 
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    'Validate Form (VF)',
    'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
    * ( 
        -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' ),
        tau 
    ),
    'Approval Decision (AD)',
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
)
```

### Explanation of the structure:
- The overall flow is a strict **sequence** (`->`) from start to end.
- After **Assess Eligibility (AE)**, there is an optional **loop** (`*`):
  - The **do** part (first child): `-> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' )` — when information is missing, request it (possibly multiple times, as seen in case 3), then re-validate the form.
  - The **exit** part (second child): `tau` (silent step) — allows direct exit from the loop without executing the do part (for cases where no missing info is found, like case 2).
- This captures:
  - No request/re-validation in some cases.
  - One or more requests followed by re-validation in others.
  - The main sequence otherwise remains linear and mandatory.
- The model is simple (minimal operators), fits all observed traces perfectly, and avoids overgeneralizing (high precision) by not allowing invalid interleavings or skipped core activities.
