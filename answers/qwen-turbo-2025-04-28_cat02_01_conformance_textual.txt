Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to figure out which cases in the event log deviate from the normative process described. Let me start by carefully reading the normative process description again to make sure I understand the rules.

The process starts with "Receive order," then "Check inventory." After that, if inventory is sufficient, the next steps are "Authorize payment," then "Package items," "Ship order," and finally "Close order." If inventory isn't sufficient, after "Check inventory," it should go to "Cancel order" and then "Close order." The key constraints are that "Authorize payment" must come after "Check inventory" and before packaging. "Package items" after authorization and before shipping. "Ship order" only after packaging and not after cancellation. "Close order" is always last.

Now, looking at the event log cases one by one.

Case 1:
Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This seems to follow the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. All steps are in order. No violations here.

Case 2:
Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here "Package items" comes before "Authorize payment." According to the description, "Package items" should be after "Authorize payment." So this is a violation. The order is wrong here. The payment authorization should happen before packaging. So Case 2 is violating the rule.

Case 3:
Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. After canceling, they ship? The description says that after cancellation, you should close the order, and shipping shouldn't happen. So "Ship order" after "Cancel order" is a violation. Because once canceled, you shouldn't proceed with shipping. So Case 3 has a violation here.

Case 4:
Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. That's the correct sequence for insufficient inventory. No issues here. All steps are in order.

Case 5:
Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, they skip packaging. The process says "Package items" must occur before "Ship order." So in this case, they went from authorize payment directly to ship, skipping packaging. That's a violation. So Case 5 is also incorrect.

Wait, but the normative description says "Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" So shipping without packaging is a violation. So yes, Case 5 is wrong.

So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Let me double-check each.

For Case 2: The sequence is Check inventory, then Package items before Authorize payment. The rules say payment authorization must be before packaging. So that's a violation.

Case 3: After cancel, they ship. The description says after cancellation, you should close, not ship. So that's a violation.

Case 5: Ship before packaging. Also a violation.

Case 1 and 4 are correct.

So the answer should be cases 2, 3, 5. Now, I need to explain each violation based on the description.

For Case 2: The order of activities is Check inventory, then Package items, then Authorize payment. But according to the normative process, "Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment." So this is a violation of the rule that "Package items" must be after authorization.

Case 3: After "Cancel order," they proceed to "Ship order," which is not allowed. The description states that after cancellation, the next step should be "Close order," and shipping shouldn't happen. So this is a violation of the rule that shipping should never occur after cancellation.

Case 5: They go from "Authorize payment" directly to "Ship order," skipping "Package items." The rule says "Ship order" must be after packaging. Hence, this is a violation.

I think that's all. Let me check again if there are any other possible issues. For example, in Case 3, after cancel, they do "Ship order" and then "Close." But the normative says after cancellation, it's "Cancel order" then "Close order." So the "Ship order" is an extra step that shouldn't be there. So that's definitely a violation.

Yes, I think that's correct.

**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

### **Violating Cases:**
- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

---

### **Detailed Violations:**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
- **Violation:**  
  The activity **"Package items"** occurs **before** **"Authorize payment"**, which violates the normative rule that **"Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment"** and **before "Ship order"**.  
  - **Rule Violated:** *"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping.*  
  - **Explanation:** Payment authorization is a prerequisite for packaging, as the process requires confirming payment validity before preparing items for shipment.

---

#### **Case 3:**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
- **Violation:**  
  The activity **"Ship order"** occurs **after** **"Cancel order"**, which is explicitly prohibited.  
  - **Rule Violated:** *"Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.*  
  - **Explanation:** Once an order is canceled, the process should terminate with **"Close order"**. Shipping after cancellation is illogical and contradicts the normative flow for insufficient inventory scenarios.

---

#### **Case 5:**
- **Sequence:** Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
- **Violation:**  
  The activity **"Ship order"** occurs **without** **"Package items"**, violating the requirement that **"Ship order" must follow "Package items"**.  
  - **Rule Violated:** *"Ship order" should only occur after packaging.*  
  - **Explanation:** Items must be packaged before shipping to ensure proper preparation. Skipping this step undermines the integrity of the fulfillment process.

---

### **Non-Violating Cases:**
- **Case 1:** Follows the correct sequence for sufficient inventory (Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close).  
- **Case 4:** Follows the correct sequence for insufficient inventory (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close).

| Case | Violation Type                          | Rule Violated                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | Incorrect order of "Package" and "Authorize" | "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment".                         |
| 3    | Shipping after cancellation              | "Ship order" is not allowed after "Cancel order".                             |
| 5    | Shipping without packaging               | "Ship order" must follow "Package items".                                     |
