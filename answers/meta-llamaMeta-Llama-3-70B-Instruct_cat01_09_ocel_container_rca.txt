Based on the provided directly follows graph, I'll highlight some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **Looping behavior in Truck and Vehicle objects**: The graphs show frequent loops between "Load Truck" and "Load Truck" for Trunks, and between "Load to Vehicle" and "Load to Vehicle" for Vehicles. These loops can lead to inefficiencies and increased processing times.
2. **High frequency of "Load Truck" and "Load to Vehicle" events**: These events have high frequencies (8559 and 1827, respectively), which could indicate bottlenecks in the process. Investigate the underlying reasons for these frequent events and optimize the process accordingly.
3. **Long duration for "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" (368943.92 seconds)**: This transition takes an extremely long time, which could be a significant performance issue. Analyze the root cause of this delay and optimize the process to reduce the waiting time.
4. **High frequency of "Bring to Loading Bay" -> "Load to Vehicle" and "Weigh" -> "Place in Stock" events**: These events have frequencies of 1931 and 1814, respectively, which could indicate inefficiencies in the process. Investigate the underlying reasons for these frequent events and optimize the process accordingly.
5. **Long duration for "Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (743380.51 seconds)**: This transition takes an extremely long time, which could be a significant performance issue. Analyze the root cause of this delay and optimize the process to reduce the waiting time.
6. **Frequent rescheduling of containers**: The presence of multiple "Reschedule Container" events across different object types (e.g., Container, Vehicle, and Transport Document) could indicate inefficiencies in the process. Investigate the root cause of these rescheduling events and optimize the process to reduce their frequency.
7. **Inefficient use of Forklifts**: The Forklift object type has a high number of events with short durations, which could indicate inefficient use of resources. Analyze the underlying process and optimize the use of Forklifts to reduce idle time and increase productivity.
8. **Long duration for "Depart" -> "Depart" (1051301.41 seconds)**: This transition takes an extremely long time, which could be a significant performance issue. Analyze the root cause of this delay and optimize the process to reduce the waiting time.
