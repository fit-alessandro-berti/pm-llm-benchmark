Here's the Python code to construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create a new Petri net
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# Places
places = {
    "Start": PetriNet.Place("Start"),
    "Claim Registered": PetriNet.Place("Claim Registered"),
    "Documents Verified": PetriNet.Place("Documents Verified"),
    "Fraud Checked": PetriNet.Place("Fraud Checked"),
    "Claim Assessed": PetriNet.Place("Claim Assessed"),
    "Claim Approved": PetriNet.Place("Claim Approved"),
    "Claim Paid": PetriNet.Place("Claim Paid"),
    "Customer Notified": PetriNet.Place("Customer Notified"),
    "End": PetriNet.Place("End"),
    "Re-Document Submission": PetriNet.Place("Re-Document Submission"),
    "In-depth Investigation": PetriNet.Place("In-depth Investigation")
}

# Add places to the net
for place in places.values():
    net.places.add(place)

# Transitions
transitions = {
    "C": PetriNet.Transition("C", "Insurance Claim"),
    "CR": PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration"),
    "DV": PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification"),
    "FC": PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check"),
    "CA": PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment"),
    "AP": PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval"),
    "P": PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment"),
    "N": PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification"),
    "CL": PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure"),
    "RDS": PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission"),
    "II": PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")
}

# Add transitions to the net
for trans in transitions.values():
    net.transitions.add(trans)

# Define arcs
arcs = [
    (places["Start"], transitions["C"], net),
    (transitions["C"], places["Claim Registered"], net),
    (places["Claim Registered"], transitions["DV"], net),
    (transitions["DV"], places["Documents Verified"], net),
    (places["Documents Verified"], transitions["FC"], net),
    (transitions["FC"], places["Fraud Checked"], net),
    (places["Fraud Checked"], transitions["CA"], net),
    (transitions["CA"], places["Claim Assessed"], net),
    (places["Claim Assessed"], transitions["AP"], net),
    (transitions["AP"], places["Claim Approved"], net),
    (places["Claim Approved"], transitions["P"], net),
    (transitions["P"], places["Claim Paid"], net),
    (places["Claim Paid"], transitions["N"], net),
    (transitions["N"], places["Customer Notified"], net),
    (places["Customer Notified"], transitions["CL"], net),
    (transitions["CL"], places["End"], net),
    # Loops for document resubmission
    (transitions["DV"], places["Re-Document Submission"], net),
    (places["Re-Document Submission"], transitions["RDS"], net),
    (transitions["RDS"], places["Claim Registered"], net),
    # Loops for in-depth investigation
    (transitions["FC"], places["In-depth Investigation"], net),
    (places["In-depth Investigation"], transitions["II"], net),
    (transitions["II"], places["Fraud Checked"], net)
]

# Create arcs using petri_utils
for source, target, net in arcs:
    petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, target, net)

# Initial marking
im = Marking()
im[places["Start"]] = 1

# Final marking
fm = Marking()
fm[places["End"]] = 1

# Display the structure (for verification purposes)
print("Net Structure:")
print(f"Places: {', '.join([p.name for p in net.places])}")
print(f"Transitions: {', '.join([t.label for t in net.transitions])}")
print(f"Initial Marking: {im}")
print(f"Final Marking: {fm}")
```

This code creates an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process with:

- **Places** representing different stages of the process.
- **Transitions** for each activity in the process, including loops for document resubmission and in-depth investigation.
- **Arcs** connecting places and transitions according to the described workflow.
- **Initial Marking** with a token in the 'Start' place to indicate the beginning of a claim.
- **Final Marking** with a token in the 'End' place to represent a closed claim.

The loops for document resubmission and in-depth investigation ensure that these steps can occur multiple times if necessary before moving forward in the process. Remember, this model can be further refined or expanded based on more detailed business rules or additional steps in the insurance claim management process.
