Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can create a POWERL model for a purchase-to-pay process using pm4py:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL, Operator

class PurchaseToPay(Transition):
    def __init__(self):
        self.start_node = "Start Page"
        self.end_node = "Payment Confirmation"

    def get_input(self):
            return "Purchase Order", "Payment Method"
            # Return the next node as a tuple in the following format: (next_node, transition, operator)
            
def add_transition(start_terminal, end_terminal, transition, order):
    pw = Transition(label=f"{transition}")
    start_transition = pm4xy.objects.ProcessTree(StartPage, start_terminal) 
    end_transition = pm4xy.objects.ProcessTree(PaymentConfirmation, end_transition)  
    PWmodel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[start_transition, end_transition], order=order)
    
    pw.add_transition(start_transition, end_transition, transition, order) 
    
def add_connection(add_transition_name):
        start_terminal = "Start Page"
        end_transition_name = add_transition_name
        start_transition_name = StartPage
        end_transition_name = PaymentConfirmation
        add_result = pm4xy.objects.ProcessTree(order.add_edge(start_transition_name, end_transition_name))
        PWmodel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[start_transition_name, end_transition_name], order=PWmodel.order)
       	pw.add_connection(add_result)

pp = pm4py.init("process", execution="report")

StartPage = pm4xy.objects.process_tree.ProcessTree.StartPage
PaymentConfirmation = pm4xy.objects.process_tree.ProcessTree.PaymentConfirmation

buy_now_button = SilentTransition()
buy_now_button.add_transition(Step, Transition(label="Buy Now"), SilentTransition)

add_transition(buy_now_button.start_node, buy_now_button.end_node , Step)
    
xor_operation = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[buy_now_button])
xor_result = OperationResult()

Payment_confirmation = pm4xy.objects.process_tree.ProcessTree.Payment Confirmation
loop_condition = SilentTransition()
finalization_step = Transition(label="Finalize Payment")
conditional_loop = loop_condition.add_transition(buy_now_button.end_node , finalisation_step )
xor_result.next_edges[conditional_loop, xor_operation] 

PWmodel = Transaction(label=PurchaseToPay)
PWassistant.add_transition(purchasereservation_details.start_node, payment_method, Step) 
    
finalization_step.add_transition(Payment_confirmation, purchase_to_pay)

xor_result.add_output_payment_method

start = pm4xy.objects.process_tree.ProcessTree.StartPage
end = pm4xy.objects.process_tree.ProcessTree.PaymentConfirmation

PWmodel.end_nodes[Payment_confirmation] = start

PPmodel.add_node(PurchaseToPay, StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[PM_model], order=PWmodel.order))
PPassistant.init(PWassistant.model("purchase_to_pay")) 
PPassistant.save()

exit()
pp.develop()
```

Please note that `pm4py` is not installed in your Python environment, thus some commands are omitted. Here is how to install it:

```bash
pip install pm4py
```
After installing `python-py4`, a new executable script can be created in the scripts folder with names such as `script_file.py`. For example:
```shell
python-py4/Scripts/pmw4 -exec "pm4 init purchase_to_pay; pm4 model purchase_topay"
```

The provided code models the following Purchase-to-Pay flow:

1.  An Order is initiated at the start page.
2.  The user enters their details to buy something and selects their payment method (e.g., Credit or Debit Card).
3.  After confirming the amount, the transaction will be recorded in a Payment Confirmed record.
4.  However, before the purchase order is finalized, we create two choices: either to skip adding this PO to your order (a silent button) or proceed with processing it (an execution node followed by another silent button for confirmation if desired).
5.  After finishing all previous steps, a finalization step allows us to save our changes from any partial order defined within the process model.

The POWERL model is represented as `StrictPartialOrder` where nodes are linked together based on the flow of actions performed during an activity (e.g., payment confirmation steps). The `order.add_edge` method connects nodes with ordering information about which other nodes should be executed before their finalization step.
