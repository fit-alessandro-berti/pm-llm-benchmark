Here’s the updated `declare_model` with new constraints to mitigate bias, along with explanations for each addition:

### Updated `declare_model`:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Ensure manual review exists in traces
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Ensure bias check exists
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure ManualReview coexists with any sensitive decision (e.g., Reject_Minority)
        "Reject": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure BiasMitigationCheck must respond to sensitive attribute checks
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # Ensure sensitive attribute checks occur before decisions
        "FinalDecision": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # Ensure bias mitigation check precedes any decision
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        # Prevent sensitive attribute checks from directly leading to a decision (e.g., Reject)
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints:
1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - Added `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` as mandatory activities (`existence`). This ensures these steps are part of the process, reducing the risk of unchecked biased decisions.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - Added `"Reject": {"ManualReview": {...}}` and `"Approve": {"ManualReview": {...}}` to ensure that any decision (approve/reject) coexists with a manual review. This enforces scrutiny of decisions involving sensitive attributes.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - Added constraints like `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {...}}` to ensure that any activity checking sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender, age) must be followed by a bias mitigation check. This prevents decisions from being made immediately after sensitive information is reviewed.

4. **Precedence Constraints:**
   - Added `"FinalDecision": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {...}}` to enforce that bias mitigation checks must occur before any final decision is made.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Added constraints like `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {...}}` to prevent a direct succession from checking sensitive attributes to a rejection decision. This ensures that other steps (e.g., bias checks) intervene.

### Rationale for Bias Mitigation:
- **Manual Review and Bias Checks:** By requiring manual reviews and bias checks to coexist with or precede decisions, we ensure that sensitive cases are not decided automatically or without oversight.
- **Breaking Direct Links:** Non-succession constraints prevent immediate decisions after sensitive attribute checks, forcing the process to include mitigation steps.
- **Enforced Process Steps:** The new constraints make bias checks and manual reviews mandatory parts of the process, not optional, thus reducing the risk of unconscious bias.

This updated model ensures that the loan application process is more fair and transparent, with explicit safeguards against biased decision-making.
