Great, here’s a focused set of open-ended, targeted questions grouped by theme to deepen understanding of your onboarding process.

1. Intake and initial qualification
- How does a new landlord typically initiate contact (phone, email, web form, referral), and does the intake method change how their request is handled?
- What criteria do you use to determine whether a property/landlord is eligible to be onboarded at all (e.g., location, size, property type, minimum standards)?
- At what point do you decide not to proceed with a landlord, and who makes that decision?
- How do you capture the initial requirements and expectations from the landlord before documentation is fully verified?

2. Documentation review and verification
- Can you walk me through the exact steps your coordinator follows when reviewing landlord and property documents?
- What specific documents are mandatory versus “nice to have,” and how do you decide if something is acceptable or needs updating?
- How do you track and follow up on missing or outdated documents, and what happens if the landlord is slow or unresponsive?
- Are there different documentation requirements by city or property type, and how do coordinators know which set of rules to apply?
- At what point is documentation considered “complete” so the process can move forward, and who signs off on that?

3. Data entry and system updates
- What information about the property must be entered into your system before you can assign a property manager?
- Who is responsible for the accuracy of that data, and how is it validated or checked for consistency across systems?
- How do you handle updates if property information changes after the initial entry (e.g., amenities added, price adjusted)?

4. Property manager assignment
- How do you evaluate a manager’s workload and expertise when deciding who should take on a new property?
- Is there a formal set of criteria or a more informal judgment call for assigning managers?
- How do you handle situations where multiple managers could be a fit, or no manager seems ideal?
- Who makes the final decision on the assignment, and can landlords request a change in manager?

5. Landlord-manager alignment
- What are the core topics that must be covered in the initial call/meeting with the landlord?
- How are special conditions or landlord preferences documented, and where do they live so that other teams can see them?
- How do you resolve conflicts when a landlord’s requested conditions don’t align with company policy or legal constraints?

6. Inspections, photography, and pre-listing activities
- How is the scheduling of photographers and inspectors coordinated, and who owns that coordination?
- Are there service-level expectations (e.g., complete visit within X days of assignment)?
- What are the typical inspection outcomes, and how are “pass,” “conditional pass,” or “fail” defined?
- When issues are found, how do you decide whether to proceed with conditional activation, delay activation, or drop the property?
- Who is responsible for selecting and managing contractors if repairs are needed?

7. Pricing and marketing setup
- How is the initial rental price range set, and what factors carry the most weight in that decision?
- What is the interaction between the property manager, marketing team, and pricing/analytics in finalizing the listing details?
- How do you handle disagreements between your pricing recommendation and the landlord’s desired price?
- Are there standard marketing packages or levels, and how is the appropriate level chosen for each property?

8. Activation and listing management
- What criteria must be satisfied before a property is officially “activated” in your portal and internal systems?
- Who has the authority to approve activation, and is there a formal checklist?
- How do you ensure consistency between what’s in the internal system and what appears on public listings?
- What triggers a re-evaluation or temporary deactivation of a listing (e.g., compliance issues, landlord changes, system errors)?

9. Tenant inquiries, applications, and screening
- Once activated, who is primarily responsible for responding to inquiries and showing the property?
- What is your standard tenant screening workflow from application received to decision made?
- How are trade-offs handled when multiple qualified applicants are interested (e.g., higher rent vs. longer lease vs. move-in date)?
- How do you document the reasoning behind accepting one applicant over another for compliance and audit purposes?
- Are there any central guidelines to ensure consistent and fair screening across different managers and regions?

10. Lease negotiation and signing
- How much flexibility do property managers have to negotiate terms (rent, lease length, concessions) without further approval?
- How are non-standard or custom lease clauses evaluated and approved, and by whom?
- At what point is a lease considered “final,” and how are all parties notified and aligned on that status?
- How are deposits, fees, and move-in conditions documented and communicated internally?

11. Compliance, audit, and quality checks
- At which stages do compliance officers, legal, and finance teams get involved, and what exactly are they checking?
- What are the most common issues that internal audits uncover during or after onboarding?
- How do you handle situations where a lease or listing is found to be non-compliant after activation?
- Is there a defined feedback loop from audits back into training or process improvements?

12. Roles, responsibilities, and handoffs
- Can you outline the primary roles (coordinator, property manager, leasing agent, marketing, compliance, finance, IT) and what each is accountable for?
- Where do handoffs between teams typically occur, and how do you confirm that a handoff is complete and nothing is missed?
- In practice, where do responsibilities blur or overlap, and how do you resolve those ambiguities?

13. Timing, SLAs, and bottlenecks
- What is your ideal end-to-end timeline from first landlord contact to a tenant moving in, and how does that compare to reality?
- Do you have service-level targets for each step (document review, inspection, listing creation, screening, etc.)?
- What are the most frequent bottlenecks or points of delay, and how are they currently managed or escalated?

14. Exceptions, special cases, and risk management
- How do you handle properties with special requirements (e.g., short-term rentals, student housing, luxury, subsidized housing, HOA restrictions)?
- What is your process when a property requires special insurance, permits, or additional legal review?
- How do you deal with landlords who insist on terms that conflict with your standard practices or pose higher risk?
- What is your approach if a landlord or tenant backs out late in the process—do you roll back steps, re-list quickly, or involve specific teams?

15. Communication, tools, and tracking
- Which tools and systems are used at each stage (CRM, project management, email, listing platforms), and how integrated are they?
- How do you ensure that communication threads (internal and external) are visible to the right people and not lost across channels?
- Do you maintain a single “source of truth” for the status of each property, and who is responsible for keeping it up to date?
- How do you capture lessons learned or recurring issues from past onboardings to refine the process over time?
