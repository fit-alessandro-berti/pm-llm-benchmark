### **Notes on Ambiguities:**
- **In some cases, after Task B (Check for Valid Purchase Order), participants move directly to Task D (Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation) without logging the invoice in the system.**
- **The exact criteria for when an invoice is rejected by the manager are not fully detailed but involve suspicious amounts or unexpected items.**
- **The process for creating a retrospective PO is not fully described but involves coordination between the supervisor and department heads.**

This textual representation should be clear enough for conversion into a BPMN diagram, capturing the key steps, decision points, roles, and exceptions as described by the interviewees.
