<think>User message states prompt with instructions. The instructions are about constructing a DuckDB SQL query for processing event logs stored in table `event_log` and includes columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. Process variant is defined as ordered sequence of activities that occur in single case (sorted by their timestamp). Requirements:
1) Construct DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities per each case using ordering by timestamp.
2) Group cases by complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.
3) Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine top K variants by frequency.
4) Return all events from original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants.

Constraints: Query should correctly extract ordered sequence of activities per case, aggregate and count cases per variant, filter down to cases belonging to the top K variants and return corresponding events.

We must output a query that does that using SQL. Possibly we can use window function or string_agg with order by to get concatenated sequence for each case_id.

Plan:
- We need to define parameter "K" maybe as some integer value (like 3) and treat it as top K variants count.
- Steps: first, compute variant for each case: SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id;
- Then join counts per sequence with that derived table.

But the tricky part is "top K" meaning we need to find variants that have highest frequency. Steps:
a) Create a subquery or CTE: "variants" = SELECT STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant, count(*) as freq FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id.
b) Then rank these based on frequency and filter the top K.
c) Then join back to cases that belong to these variants.

Plan using DuckDB SQL query:
We can use CTEs: "variants" as computed from grouping by case. Then second CTE for ranking variants, then final joining event_log with filtered variant list.

However careful: The original problem says: "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants." So we must return events where case_id is in the set of top K variant cases. But need to find out how many cases per variant, rank them by frequency descending, then pick those with frequency >= threshold or something. But careful: "top K" may refer to top K most frequent process variants overall, not necessarily K = constant count parameter (e.g., 3). So we can use a parameter like :K.

I can declare the query as follows:

WITH variant_sequences AS (
 SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
 FROM event_log
 GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
 SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS freq
 FROM variant_sequences
 GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_variants AS (
 SELECT activity_sequence
 FROM variant_frequencies
 ORDER BY freq DESC
 LIMIT :K
)
SELECT * from event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id FROM variant_sequences WHERE activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_variants)
);

But note: The above query has nested subqueries; however, it is not the optimal one but should suffice. But need to incorporate parameter K.

Alternatively, we can join variant_frequencies with variant_sequences and then filter by ranking order.
We can also use a window function (ROW_NUMBER OVER (ORDER BY freq DESC) ) in a CTE over variant_frequencies, and then use that to filter top variants if needed.

Using window function:
WITH variant_sequences AS (
 SELECT 
   case_id,
   STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
 FROM event_log
 GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
 SELECT
  activity_sequence,
  COUNT(*) as frequency,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rn
 FROM variant_sequences
 GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON el.case_id = vs.case_id
WHERE vs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_counts WHERE rn <= :K
);

That query is more efficient and correct.

Edge: The problem says "top K variants by frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)". So indeed variant_counts is grouping over variant_sequences aggregated by case_id per variant. So we want to filter only events from top K variants using the join with variant_sequences filtered to top variants.

So I'll produce query as:

WITH variant_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
  SELECT
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rn
  FROM variant_sequences
  GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON el.case_id = vs.case_id
WHERE vs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_frequencies WHERE rn <= :K
);

This should be the final query.

I can also mention that if one wants to use parameter K, then we need to have a parameter substitution. I might say "Assuming :K is provided as a parameter".

I'll output this query with explanation of each step. Additionally, I include disclaimer for legal topics maybe not needed.

The instructions from user: "Your task: ...". The content doesn't require disclaimers for sensitive topics because it's a technical topic (SQL queries). But instructions in guidelines say that if the topic is medical, legal, etc. then add disclaimers. However this query is about SQL code. So I'll output plain text explanation and final answer.

I need to include disclaimer both at beginning and end? The guideline says: "when replying topics above such as sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters you must provide a disclaimer." But not for technical queries? It's not required. But instructions say: "provide a disclaimer at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above" but that is specifically mentioned for sensitive topics (like medical, legal, etc.). However this is just SQL query for benchmarking so no disclaimers needed.

The instructions mention to provide a disclaimer both at the beginning and end when replying topics above. But it says "sensitive topics like medical, legal, financial matters or political matters" and then "you must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end." The query is not sensitive topic, so no need for disclaimers.

I'll produce answer with markdown formatting as required. I'll also mention that this query uses window functions and may require parameter substitution in DuckDB.

I should produce final answer with explanation and then final query code in markdown block.

I'll produce answer accordingly:

I'll output a summary explanation: This query computes process variants by aggregating events for each case, ordering them using timestamp. Then it groups cases by variant and counts frequency. Next, we use a window function to rank these variants by frequency, selecting the top K. Finally, we join the original event log with those filtered cases (variant_sequences) to return corresponding events.

I'll then produce final query code:

```
WITH variant_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
  SELECT
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
  FROM variant_sequences
  GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON el.case_id = vs.case_id
WHERE vs.activity_sequence IN (
  SELECT activity_sequence 
  FROM variant_frequencies 
  WHERE rn <= :K
);
```

I'll also mention that if you need to adjust for a different K, change parameter accordingly.

I'll produce final answer with some markdown formatting. We'll produce final answer accordingly.</think>Below is one acceptable solution. In this query we:

1. Build a CTE (variant_sequences) that aggregates all events for each case in order by timestamp, producing the ordered activity sequence.
2. Create a second CTE (variant_frequencies) to count how many cases share each variant and rank them using a window function.
3. Finally, join back to the original event log, filtering only those cases whose variant is among the top K variants.

You can adjust the parameter :K as needed (for example, 3 for the top three variants). Here’s the complete SQL query:

------------------------------------------------------------
-- Begin Query
------------------------------------------------------------

WITH variant_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_frequencies AS (
  SELECT
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rn
  FROM variant_sequences
  GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON el.case_id = vs.case_id
WHERE vs.activity_sequence IN (
  SELECT activity_sequence 
  FROM variant_frequencies 
  WHERE rn <= :K
);

------------------------------------------------------------
-- End Query
------------------------------------------------------------

This query first extracts the ordered sequence of activities per case, groups them to count how many cases follow each variant (assigning a row number based on frequency), and finally returns only the events from those cases whose variant is among the top K most frequent ones.
