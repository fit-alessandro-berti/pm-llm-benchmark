**Proposed High-Level Activities:**

1. **Material Preparation**
   - Retrieve raw material
   - Scan barcode
   - Place material on table
   - Align material
   - Preheat material

2. **Assembly**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corners
   - Measure weld integrity

3. **Coating Application**
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating

4. **Quality Inspection**
   - Visual check

**Justification:**

1. **Material Preparation:**
   - These low-level events are grouped together as they involve the preparation of the base material for further processing. The activities in this group follow a logical order of handling the raw material, ensuring its readiness for subsequent steps.

2. **Assembly:**
   - The events related to picking up the welding tool, performing welding tasks, and checking the integrity of the weld are grouped together as they represent crucial steps in assembling the components. These activities are closely related and form a coherent sub-process within the manufacturing workflow.

3. **Coating Application:**
   - Applying protective coating and drying it form a distinct stage in the process of finishing the manufactured component. These tasks are typically performed together and contribute to enhancing the product's durability and aesthetics.

4. **Quality Inspection:**
   - The visual check is a final assessment step to ensure that the manufacturing process has been completed correctly and that the product meets the specified quality standards. This activity serves as a concluding step before the product is deemed ready for the next phase or shipment.
