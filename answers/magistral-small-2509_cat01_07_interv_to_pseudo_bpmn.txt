Now, let's organize this information into a structured model.

**Activities/Tasks:**
1. Receive Invoice
2. Check PO Exists
3. Send Back to Supplier (if no PO)
4. Log Invoice in System
5. Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation
6. Match Invoice to PO

10. Contact Supplier (for discrepancies)
11. Review Invoice (Manager)
12. Approve/Reject (Manager)

**Sequence Flow:**
1. Receive Invoice
   - Check PO Exists (Gateway: PO exists? Yes/No)
     - If No: Send Back to Supplier  End (or wait for corrected invoice)
     - If Yes: Log Invoice in System  Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation
2. Purchasing Confirmation (Gateway: Goods Received & Details Match?)
   - If No: Contact Supplier or Hold Invoice (possibly involving Karen)
   - If Yes: Match Invoice to PO (Gateway: Match? Yes/No)
     - If No: Email Purchasing for Clarification (Gateway: Resolved? Yes/No)
       - If No: Escalate to Supervisor
         - Supervisor resolves (possibly involving Karen)  Back to Match Invoice to PO
       - If Yes: Send to Manager for Approval
     - If Yes: Send to Manager for Approval
3. Manager Review (Gateway: Approve? Yes/No)
   - If Yes: Schedule Payment

**Roles/Participants:**
1. Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
2. Purchasing Officer (Dan)
3. Department Manager (Carlos)
4. Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
5. Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- Invoice (input)

3. Unresolved discrepancy  Escalate to supervisor (Rita).
4. Informal invoices (no PO)  Create retrospective PO or reject.
5. Manager rejects invoice  Investigate further.

Now, let's draft the BPMN-like textual description.

We'll structure it as follows:
1. Start Event: Receive Invoice
2. Sequence Flow to Check PO
   - Gateway: PO Exists?
     - No: Send Back to Supplier (End or loop back if corrected)
     - Yes: Log Invoice in System
3. Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation
   - Gateway: Goods Received & Details Match?
     - No: Contact Supplier or Hold Invoice (involve Karen if needed)
     - Yes: Match Invoice to PO
       - Gateway: Invoice Matches PO?
         - No: Email Purchasing for Clarification
           - Gateway: Resolved?
             - No: Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)
               - Resolution steps (possibly involve Karen)
               - Back to Match Invoice to PO
             - Yes: Send to Manager for Approval
         - Yes: Send to Manager for Approval
4. Manager Review
   - Gateway: Approve?
     - Yes: Schedule Payment (End)
     - No: Reject or Investigate (possibly escalate to Supervisor again)

Let's refine this into a clear textual model.

**Process Model:**

**Sequence Flow:** Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

**Activity:** Confirm Goods/Services Received and Match PO Details (Role: Purchasing Officer)
- **Gateway:** Details Match and Goods Received? (Decision)
  - **No:** Contact Supplier or Hold Invoice (Role: Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager)
    - Note: If missing PO number, inform AP to get it.
    - If discrepancy, may involve Karen for resolution.
    - After resolution, back to Confirm Goods/Services Received and Match PO Details.

2. Pricing discrepancies may involve Karen to check contracts.
3. Manager may reject invoice if total amount is significantly higher than budgeted.

**Roles:**
1. Accounts Payable Clerk: Mary

Now, let's present this in a clear textual format that can be converted to BPMN.
</think>

**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**Start Event:** Invoice Received (by email)

     - **Yes:** Log Invoice in Accounting System

**2. Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)**

**3. Confirm Goods/Services Received and Match PO Details (Role: Purchasing Officer)**
   - **Gateway: Details Match and Goods Received?**
     - **No:** Contact Supplier or Hold Invoice (Role: Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager)
       - Note: If missing PO, inform AP to obtain it. May involve Karen for resolution.
       - After resolution, loop back to this step.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to next step

**4. Match Invoice Line Items to PO (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - **Gateway: Invoice Matches PO?**
     - **No:** Email Purchasing for Clarification (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
       - **Gateway: Discrepancy Resolved?**
         - **No:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Role: Rita)
           - **Activity:** Resolve Issue (Role: Rita, possibly involving Karen)
             - Options: Create retrospective PO, reject invoice, or contact supplier again.
             - After resolution, loop back to Match Invoice Line Items to PO.
         - **Yes:** Proceed to next step
     - **Yes:** Proceed to next step

**5. Send to Manager for Approval (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)**
   - **Gateway: Manager Approval? (Role: Department Manager)**
     - **No:** Reject or Investigate (Role: Department Manager)
       - Note: May escalate to supervisor for further action. After investigation, may loop back to previous steps or end process.
     - **Yes:** Proceed to next step

**6. Schedule Payment for Next Payment Cycle (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)**

**End Event:** Payment Scheduled

---

**Roles/Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Handles initial checks, logging, and coordination.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt and details against PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Provides final approval or rejection.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles escalations and exceptions.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Assists in resolving supplier-related issues.

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Inputs:** Invoice, Purchase Order (PO)
- **Outputs:** Confirmation emails, approval emails, scheduled payment

**Exceptions/Variations:**
1. Invoices without PO may require retrospective PO creation or rejection (handled by Rita).
2. Discrepancies may involve Karen to verify contract terms with suppliers.
3. Manager may reject invoices if amounts exceed budget; this may lead to further investigation or escalation.
4. In some cases, after discrepancy resolution, the process may loop back to earlier steps (e.g., re-matching invoice to PO).

**Notes on Ambiguities:**
- The exact point at which the corrected invoice re-enters the process if sent back to the supplier is unclear. It likely restarts from "Check PO Exists" but this should be confirmed.
- The involvement of Karen is indirect; her role is to assist resolution, not a direct step in the process flow.
- The process for handling rejected invoices (step 5, No branch) is not fully detailed; it may involve additional steps or loops, which could be clarified in further interviews.
