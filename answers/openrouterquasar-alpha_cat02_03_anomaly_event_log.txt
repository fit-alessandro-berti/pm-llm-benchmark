Certainly! Let’s first recall the **standard P2P process sequence** (simplified, typical flow):

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods** (Goods Receipt)  
5. **Receive Vendor Invoice**  
6. **Three-Way Match** (Invoice to PO and goods receipt)  
7. **Release Payment**  
8. **Close Case**

Now, let's analyze each case.

### **Case 1001 — Appears Standard**  
**Flow:**

- Requisition created  Approved  PO issued  Goods received  Invoice received  Invoice matching  Payment  Close  
**Assessment:** This case follows the typical sequence and timing with no anomalies.

### **Case 1002 — Multiple Anomalies**

| Event                                  | Timestamp                    | Note                                           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Purchase Requisition **created**       | 2024-02-01 08:30             |                                                |
| **Purchase Order issued**              | 2024-02-01 08:40             | Before requisition approval                    |
| **Invoice received**                   | 2024-02-03 07:00             | **Before goods receipt**                       |
| **Payment released**                   | 2024-02-03 07:15             | Before requisition approval + goods receipt    |
| **Purchase Requisition approved**      | 2024-02-03 08:00             | Approved **after** PO issued & payment!        |
| Goods received                         | 2024-02-04 09:00             | After invoice & payment                        |
| Invoice matched                        | 2024-02-05 08:00             | After payment was already released             |
| Case closed                            | 2024-02-06 16:00             |                                                |

**Anomalies:**

- **Purchase Order before Approval:** The PO issued only 10 minutes after requisition creation, before approval. Standard practice **requires approval before committing to a vendor.**  
- **Invoice and Early Payment before Approval:** Invoice received, and more notably, **payment is released even before the purchase was formally approved** — highly questionable governance breach.  
- **Payment before Goods Receipt and Invoice Matching:** Payment typically should follow invoice verification and goods receipt confirmation. Here, payment is **well ahead** of both.  
- **Approval after Payment:** The requisition is approved only *after* payment! This undermines control mechanisms ensuring purposeful spend.  
- **Invoice Matching after Payment:** Matching occurs after releasing funds, defeating its validation role.

**Problem Implications:**

- **High risk of fraud or erroneous payments.**  
- **Non-compliance with control requirements.**  
- **Lack of segregation of duties and oversight.**  
- **Possibility of duplicate/fraudulent invoices going undetected.**

### **Case 1003 — Key Anomaly in Payment Timing**

| Event                                  | Timestamp                    | Note                                           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Req created & approved  PO issued     | 2024-02-02 morning           | Sequence OK                                    |
| **Payment released**                   | 2024-02-08 11:00             | **Before vendor invoice even received**        |
| Invoice received                       | 2024-02-09 12:00             |                                                |
| Goods received                         | 2024-02-10 13:00             | After payment                                  |
| Invoice matched                        | 2024-02-11 14:00             | After payment                                  |

**Anomalies:**

- **Payment released before invoice is received:** Unusual — payment made without any invoice or confirmation potentially.  
- **Payment before goods receipt:** Risk of paying for undelivered goods.  
- **Invoice matching after payment:** Again, validation is post-payment, limiting its control purpose.

**Problem Implications:**

- **Risk of prepaying without contractual or business justification.**  
- **Potential violation of payment controls.**  
- **Vulnerability to fraud or errors.**

### **Case 1004 — Key Anomaly in PO Timing**

| Event                                  | Timestamp                    | Note                                           |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Requisition created & approved         | 2024-02-05 morning           | Sequence OK                                    |
| **Goods received**                     | 2024-02-06 09:00             | **Before PO is issued!**                       |
| **PO issued**                          | 2024-02-06 09:15             | After receipt                                  |
| Invoice received  Matching  Payment  | Later, sequence OK relative to PO issuance     |

**Anomalies:**

- **Goods received before issuing purchase order:** Implies order was not formalized at receipt time; possibly "maverick buying."  
- **This can indicate:**  
  - Unauthorized purchasing outside official process.  
  - Poor procurement discipline.  
  - Difficulty in enforcing contract terms or warranty claims.

**Problem Implications:**

- **Compliance breaches with procurement policy.**  
- **Potentially receiving unapproved or unauthorized goods.**  
- **Undermines ability to negotiate or enforce terms.**

## **Summary of Detected Anomalies**

| Case   | Anomalous Behavior                                                                                        | Why Problematic                                                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1002**  | PO & payment before requisition approval, payment before receipt & invoice matching                    | Ignores all key controls, increases fraud risk, procurement governance breach      |
| **1003**  | Payment before invoice received and goods received                                                      | Overpayment risk, validates nothing before issuing funds                          |
| **1004**  | Goods received **before** PO issued                                                                    | Lack of procurement control, risk of unauthorized purchases                        |

## **Conclusion**
While **Case 1001** is a good example of healthy P2P flow, cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 all **deviate significantly** from standard, controlled P2P practices.

The main risks include:

- **Loss of financial control**  
- **Fraud susceptibility**  
- **Potential regulatory non-compliance**  
- **Weakened negotiation & contract enforcement position**

These anomalies suggest serious **process discipline issues** and would warrant detailed audit and corrective action in a real business environment.
