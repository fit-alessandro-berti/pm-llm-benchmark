### Reasoning and Matching Decisions

I analyzed the two logs to identify corresponding events based on:
- **Same order_id** (all events share Order#1234).
- **Proximity in timestamps** (using a tolerance of ~2-5 seconds for slight offsets, as System B timestamps appear slightly earlier or later possibly due to system clock differences or recording delays).
- **Semantic similarity** in event names/types (e.g., "Order Received" vs "OrderReceived").

Here is the event-by-event matching:

1. **Log A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z, Order Received**  
   **Log B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived**  
   → **Clear match**. Names are essentially identical (camelCase difference). Timestamps differ by 2 seconds (well within tolerance). Likely the same event, with Log B recorded slightly earlier.

2. **Log A: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z, Order Validated**  
   **Log B: 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, OrderValidation**  
   → **Clear match**. Names are very similar ("Validated" vs "Validation"). Timestamps differ by 1 second. Same event.

3. **Log A: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z, Payment Processed**  
   **Log B: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck**  
   → **Likely match**. Names indicate the same activity (processing/checking payment). Timestamps differ by 5 seconds — slightly over 2 seconds but still reasonable given potential gateway delays (noted in Log B). No other events in either log align better. Treated as the same event.

4. **Log A: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z, Item Shipped**  
   **Log B: 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Shipping**  
   → **Clear match**. Names are synonymous. Timestamps differ by 2 seconds. Same event.

5. **Log A: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered**  
   → **No corresponding event in Log B**. Kept separate.

6. **Log B: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check**  
   → **No corresponding event in Log A**. This appears to be an additional step in System B (possibly a warehouse-specific inspection). Kept separate.

**Timestamp resolution strategy**:  
- For merged events, I chose Log A's timestamp as the primary (since Log A is described as the "primary" timeline).  
- I also retained Log B's timestamp as a secondary attribute where it exists for transparency.

**Event naming in merged log**:  
- Used the more descriptive/human-readable name from Log A where available, with Log B's name noted as an alias if significantly different.

**Attribute integration**:  
- Combined all available attributes.  
- Added a `source` field to indicate origin (A, B, or Both).  
- Included all notes and extra fields from Log B.

### Merged Enriched Event Log

Events are sorted chronologically by primary timestamp (Log A where available, otherwise Log B).

| Primary Timestamp       | Event Name              | Alias (from other log) | Order ID   | User ID | Resource ID | Notes                                      | Source | Secondary Timestamp     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z    | Order Received          | OrderReceived         | Order#1234 | u45    | r10        | Event captured at warehouse system         | Both   | 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z    |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z    | Order Validated         | OrderValidation       | Order#1234 | u12    | r10        | Cross-check inventory                      | Both   | 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z    |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z    | Payment Processed       | PaymentCheck          | Order#1234 | u12    | r99        | Payment gateway delay                      | Both   | 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z    |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z    | Quality Check           | —                     | Order#1234 | u45    | r11        | Random inspection                          | B      | —                       |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z    | Item Shipped            | Shipping              | Order#1234 | u45    | r10        | Package handed to courier                  | Both   | 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z    |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z    | Item Delivered          | —                     | Order#1234 | —      | —          | —                                          | A      | —                       |

This merged log preserves all information from both systems, enriches events with additional attributes where possible, and provides a single coherent chronological view of the order fulfillment process for Order#1234. The extra "Quality Check" step visible only in System B and the final delivery visible only in System A highlight differences in what each system tracks.
