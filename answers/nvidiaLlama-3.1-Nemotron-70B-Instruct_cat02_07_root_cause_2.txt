**Task 1: Identify Cases with Significant Delays**

To identify cases with performance issues, we calculate the **lead time** for each case, which is the time from "Submit Claim" to "Close Claim".

| Case ID | Lead Time (From Submit to Close) | Complexity |
|---------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| 2001    | **30 minutes**                    | Low        |
| 2002    | **2 days, 1 hour, 55 minutes**    | Medium     |
| 2003    | **3 days, 30 minutes**            | High       |
| 2004    | **1 hour, 25 minutes**            | Low        |
| 2005    | **4 days, 5 hours**               | High       |

**Cases with Significant Delays:**
- **2002**: 2 days, 1 hour, 55 minutes (Medium Complexity)
- **2003**: 3 days, 30 minutes (High Complexity)
- **2005**: 4 days, 5 hours (High Complexity)

**Task 2: Analyze Attributes for Root Causes**

### Resource Analysis

| Case ID | Resource Involvement | Lead Time       | Complexity |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|------------|
| 2002    | Adjuster_Lisa (Evaluate, Request) | Long          | Medium     |
| 2003    | Adjuster_Mike (Evaluate, 2xRequest) | Long          | High       |
| 2005    | Adjuster_Lisa (Evaluate, 3xRequest) | Longest       | High       |
| *Common Resource for Quick Cases*: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike (for 2001), Finance_Alan | Short          | Low        |

**Observation:** Adjuster_Lisa is involved in two of the longest cases (2002, 2005), and Adjuster_Mike in one (2003), suggesting potential workload or efficiency issues with these resources, particularly with medium to high complexity cases.

### Region Analysis

| Region | Average Lead Time | Complexity Distribution |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| A      | **1.5 days**      | 1 Low, 1 High (2003)    |
| B      | **3.5 days**      | 1 Low (2004), 2 High (2002, 2005) |

**Observation:** Region B exhibits a longer average lead time, potentially indicating regional inefficiencies or higher complexities predominantly handled in this region.

### Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Average Lead Time | Additional Documents Requests |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Low        | **<1 day**        | 0 (2001, 2004)                |
| Medium     | **2 days, 1 hour** | 1 (2002)                       |
| High       | **3.5 days**      | 2 (2003), 3 (2005)            |

**Observation:** High complexity cases significantly increase lead times, primarily due to multiple requests for additional documents, suggesting inefficiencies in initial claim evaluation for complex cases.

**Task 3: Propose Explanations and Mitigations**

**1. Resource-Related Issues:**
   - **Explanation:** Overload or lower efficiency of specific adjusters (Lisa, Mike) with medium to high complexity cases.
   - **Mitigation:**
     * **Workload Balancing:** Distribute cases more evenly among adjusters based on their workload and expertise.
     * **Training:** Provide additional training to enhance efficiency in handling complex cases.

**2. Region-Related Inefficiencies:**
   - **Explanation:** Potential lack of resources, less experienced staff, or regional bureaucracy in Region B.
   - **Mitigation:**
     * **Resource Allocation:** Ensure equitable resource distribution across regions.
     * **Knowledge Sharing:** Organize workshops for staff in Region B to learn from best practices in Region A.

**3. Complexity-Related Delays:**
   - **Explanation:** Inefficient initial evaluation leading to multiple requests for additional documents.
   - **Mitigation:**
     * **Enhanced Initial Evaluation:** Implement a more detailed initial assessment checklist for complex cases.
     * **Expert Involvement:** Engage senior adjusters or specialists early in the process for complex claims.
