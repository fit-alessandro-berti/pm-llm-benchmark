Of course. Here is a detailed analysis, the revised event log, and the justifications for the naming changes.

### 1. Identification of Ambiguous Activities

By analyzing the event log, the following activities appear multiple times within a single case but have different contextual meanings:

*   **Verify Documents:** This activity occurs twice in Case C001 and twice in Case C003. In both cases, the first instance is an initial check, while the second is a re-verification that happens after an intervening step (like receiving additional documents or an account adjustment).
*   **Call Customer:** This activity occurs twice in Case C002. The first call is to investigate and clarify a problem (an account discrepancy). The second call is a follow-up to confirm that a resolution has been implemented.

### 2. Renaming Strategy

To resolve the ambiguity, the activities will be renamed as follows:

| Original Ambiguous Activity | Context                                     | Proposed New Name                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Verify Documents`          | The first check in the process              | `Verify Documents (Initial)`        |
| `Verify Documents`          | A subsequent check after a correction       | `Re-verify Documents`               |
| `Call Customer`             | A call to investigate or request information| `Call Customer (Clarification)`     |
| `Call Customer`             | A call to confirm an action has been taken  | `Call Customer (Confirmation)`      |

### 3. Revised Event Log

Here is the updated event log with the disambiguated activity names.

### 4. Justification for Naming Choices

The new names were chosen based on the following contextual clues from the log:

*   **Verify Documents (Initial) vs. Re-verify Documents:**
    *   **Contextual Clue:** The position in the workflow and the description in "Additional Context".
    *   **Justification:** The first occurrence of `Verify Documents` in a case always follows the `Initiate Request` activity. This is the standard, primary check, which is why it is renamed **`Verify Documents (Initial)`**. The second occurrence always follows a corrective action (e.g., `Submit Additional` or `Adjust Account`). The context explicitly mentions "re-checks" or "re-verify," making **`Re-verify Documents`** a fitting and descriptive name for this rework loop.

*   **Call Customer (Clarification) vs. Call Customer (Confirmation):**
    *   **Contextual Clue:** The purpose of the call, as described in "Additional Context".
    *   **Justification:** In Case C002, the first call's purpose is to "clarify account discrepancy." This is an investigative action to gather information. **`Call Customer (Clarification)`** accurately captures this intent. The second call's purpose is to "confirm adjustments made." This is a concluding action to inform the customer of a resolution. **`Call Customer (Confirmation)`** clearly distinguishes this from the first call and highlights its role as a follow-up.
