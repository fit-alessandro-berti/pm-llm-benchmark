To construct a process tree that balances fitness, precision, and simplicity based on the provided event log, we need to analyze the observed behavior and map it to the process tree operators (`->`, `X`, `+`, `*`) and leaf nodes (activities or silent steps). Here's the reasoning:

### Analysis of the Event Log
1. **Main Sequence**: All cases follow a general sequence:
   - `Receive Application (RA)` → `Validate Form (VF)` → `Assess Eligibility (AE)` → `Approval Decision (AD)` → `Send Confirmation (SC)` → `Archive Case (AC)`.
   - This suggests a backbone of sequential execution (`->`).

2. **Optional Loop**: 
   - In some cases (e.g., Case 1 and Case 3), after `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there’s an optional `Request Missing Info (RMI)` followed by another `Validate Form (VF)`.
   - This can repeat (e.g., Case 3 has two `RMI` events before re-validating).
   - This behavior fits the loop operator (`*`), where `RMI` and re-`VF` can occur zero or more times before proceeding.

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop should allow exiting after `AE` (no `RMI`) or iterating through `RMI` → `VF` multiple times.
   - In process tree terms, `* (A, B)` means: execute `A`, then either exit or execute `B` and repeat `A`. Here:
     - `A` could be a silent step (`tau`) to allow exiting or proceeding.
     - `B` would be the sequence `RMI` → `VF`.

4. **Simplification**:
   - We aim for simplicity by avoiding unnecessary complexity while capturing the main flow and the optional loop.
   - No parallelism (`+`) or exclusive choice (`X`) is evident, as all activities follow a sequential order with the loop as the only variation.

### Final Process Tree
Based on this analysis, the process tree should:
- Start with `RA`, `VF`, and `AE` in sequence.
- Include a loop for `RMI` and `VF` that can be skipped or repeated.
- End with `AD`, `SC`, and `AC` in sequence.

Here’s the final process tree structure:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        -> (
            'AE',
            -> (
                * (
                    'tau',
                    -> (
                        'RMI',
                        'VF'
                    )
                ),
                -> (
                    'AD',
                    -> (
                        'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

### Explanation
- **`->`** operators enforce the main sequence: `RA` → `VF` → `AE` → loop → `AD` → `SC` → `AC`.
- **`* ('tau', -> ('RMI', 'VF'))`** represents the loop:
  - `tau` is a silent step allowing the loop to exit immediately (no `RMI`) or proceed to `RMI` → `VF`.
  - After `RMI` → `VF`, it loops back to `tau`, enabling multiple iterations (as seen in Case 3).
- This model captures:
  - **Fitness**: All traces (e.g., `RA→VF→AE→AD→SC→AC` or `RA→VF→AE→RMI→VF→AD→SC→AC`) are possible.
  - **Precision**: It avoids overgeneralization by restricting the loop to `RMI` → `VF`.
  - **Simplicity**: It uses a single loop and sequence structure without unnecessary operators.

This process tree effectively represents the discovered process from the event log.
