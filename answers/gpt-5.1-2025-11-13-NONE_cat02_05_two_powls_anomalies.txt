Below is a comparison of the two models against a typical (“normative”) HiretoRetire process. I’ll first briefly restate a plausible normative flow, then analyze anomalies in each model, and finally decide which model is closer to that norm.

## 1. Normative HiretoRetire Process (Reference)

A typical highlevel sequence (ignoring variations and details) is something like:

1. Post_Job_Ad  
2. Screen_Candidates  
3. Conduct_Interviews  
4. Make_Hiring_Decision  
5. Onboard_Employee  
6. Add_to_Payroll  
7. Close_Case  

Key logical constraints:

- Interviews normally happen after at least some screening, not before.
- Hiring decisions occur after interviews (for those interviewed).
- You cannot onboard a person that has not been hired.
- You cannot add someone to payroll unless they are hired and onboarded (or at least formally accepted).
- You cannot close the case before finalizing the employment (decision + onboarding/payroll or explicit rejection).
- Typically, posting the job ad is the very first step and precedes screening and interviewing.

## 2. Analysis of POWL Model 1

### Model 1 Structure

```text
Nodes: Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close

Edges:
Post  Screen
Screen  Decide
Screen  Interview
Decide  Onboard
Onboard  Payroll
Payroll  Close
```

Implied behavior:

- Strict order: Post  Screen.
- After screening, both Decide and Interview become enabled because:
  - Screen  Decide
  - Screen  Interview
- No edge between Interview and Decide: they can occur in any relative order (or even in parallel in partialorder semantics).
- Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close is a fixed linear suffix.

### Anomalies in Model 1

1. **Decision can be made before (or without) interviews**

   - Edges: `Screen  Decide` and `Screen  Interview` with no constraint between Decide and Interview.
   - Possible execution: Post  Screen  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close, and never perform Conduct_Interviews.
   - Another possible execution: Post  Screen  Decide, then Interview after the decision.
   - Both are highly counterintuitive: a hiring decision should generally be based on interviews (especially in a model that explicitly includes them).

   Severity: **High**. It undermines the logical essence of “hiring based on evaluation”.

2. **Interviews are not required at all**

   - Since Interview has no outgoing edge influencing the rest, it becomes optional: you can complete the process with no Conduct_Interviews ever executed.
   - It might be acceptable in edge cases (e.g., rehiring known employee), but as a “default HiretoRetire” pattern, this is a deviation.

   Severity: **Medium to High**, depending on interpretation, but still a systematic anomaly.

3. **Missing explicit precedence: Screen before Interview is OK, but no enforcement of Interview before Decide**

   - The model ensures: Post before Screen, and Screen before Interview and Decide.
   - It does *not* ensure Interview before Decide, which is the main logical issue as described above.

   Severity: This is essentially the same as #1, but phrased as a missing constraint.

4. **No other major structural issues**

   - Once Decide happens, the sequence Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close is linear and aligned with typical logic:
     - You cannot onboard before a decision.
     - You cannot add to payroll before onboarding.
     - You cannot close before payroll.
   - There is no option to skip onboarding or payroll once you decide to hire.

   This part is **strongly aligned** with a normative process, assuming “Decide” means a positive hiring decision.

## 3. Analysis of POWL Model 2

### Model 2 Structure

```python
loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)
xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)

Nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close

Edges:
Post  Screen
Post  Interview
Interview  Decide
Decide  loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
xor_payroll  Close
```

Informal semantics:

- Post  Screen, and Post  Interview.
  - So Screen and Interview are both after Post, but independent of each other.
- Interview  Decide: you must interview before making the hiring decision.
- loop_onboarding is a loop over Onboard_Employee: you can do onboarding once, multiple times, or potentially not at all (depending on where the loop exits).
- xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip): either execute Payroll or skip it, then Close_Case.

### Anomalies in Model 2

1. **Screening and interviews can occur in any order, and screening is optional**

   - No edge Screen  Interview, nor Interview  Screen.
   - Partial order: after Post, you can:
     - do Screen first then Interview, or
     - do Interview first then Screen, or
     - in terms of partial order semantics, they are parallel, so a trace could effectively omit Screen if not enforced at the event level.
   - From the edges alone, the only strict requirement is: Post before Screen and Post before Interview, and Interview before Decide.
   - Practically, a run without Screen (Post  Interview  Decide…) is possible.

   Severity: **Medium**. Screening is typically expected, but logically less essential than “interview before decision” for hiring correctness.

2. **Onboarding may be skipped entirely**

   - `loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)` means:
     - You execute the first child (Onboard) once, then decide whether to repeat via the second child (skip  Onboard again) or exit the loop.
     - However, depending on precise semantics in pm4py, a LOOP with skip as the “redo” part usually still forces at least one execution of the first child.  
       If interpreted differently (or if loop semantics allow zero iterations), onboarding could be skipped entirely.
   - Given standard process logic, skipping onboarding is an anomaly: an employee typically must be onboarded.

   Severity:  
   - If loop semantics = “at least one Onboard”: **Low** anomaly (it just allows repeated onboarding, which is unusual but not logically fatal).  
   - If loop semantics = “Onboard is optional”: **High** anomaly (employee hired without onboarding).

3. **Payroll can be skipped**

   - `xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)` means: after onboarding loop, either:
     - Add_to_Payroll, or
     - Skip directly to Close_Case.
   - So a case can be completed without ever putting the employee on payroll.

   Severity: **Very High**. This directly violates the essence of “HiretoRetire” from an administrative/financial standpoint. Employing someone but never adding them to payroll is a severe business error.

4. **Sequence from Interviews to Decision is correct**

   - Interview  Decide ensures decisions are based on interviews, unlike in Model 1.
   - This is a strong positive: it captures a key logical constraint of the hiring process.

5. **Potential overspecification of reonboarding**

   - The loop_onboarding allows multiple Onboard_Employee executions.  
   - While possible in special cases (e.g., extended onboarding phases), repeated formal onboarding is atypical for a generic H2R model.

   Severity: **Low** – more of an uncommon variant than a core correctness issue.

## 4. Comparative Assessment

### Core Logic Alignment

- **Model 1:**
  - Strong on the “post  screen  (decision)  onboarding  payroll  close” chain.
  - But **critically flawed** in allowing:
    - Decision before or without interviews.
    - Interviews possibly after hiring decision.
  - From a processlogic standpoint, this means you can “hire blindly” without evaluating candidates.

- **Model 2:**
  - Correctly enforces the key evaluation relation: **Interview before Decide**.
  - However, it allows:
    - Skipping screening (mediumlevel anomaly).
    - Possibly skipping onboarding (depending on exact loop semantics).
    - **Explicitly skipping payroll** via XOR(Payroll, skip), which is a severe violation of the HiretoRetire objective.

### Severity and Nature of Anomalies

- Model 1’s main anomaly:
  - Decision not causally dependent on interviews.
  - This undermines the hiring logic (quality/compliance issue), but the downstream administrative steps (onboarding, payroll) are structurally correct and mandatory.

- Model 2’s main anomaly:
  - Employee can be hired and case closed without adding to payroll.
  - This is not only a quality issue but a fundamental breach of the “HiretoRetire” concept as a lifecycle including HR and payroll integration.

### Which Model Is Closer to a Normative HiretoRetire Process?

Given typical expectations for “HiretoRetire”:

- The **essence** of the process is:
  - There is a decision based on evaluation (interviews/screening),
  - A successful decision leads to formal onboarding and payroll registration,
  - The case is closed only after the employment is properly established.

Between the two:

- Model 1 preserves the **administrative integrity** (onboarding  payroll  close is mandatory and ordered) but weakens the **evaluation integrity** (interviews not required before decision).
- Model 2 preserves the **evaluation integrity** (decision after interview) but breaks the **administrative integrity** (payroll is optional, possibly onboarding too).

In a HiretoRetire context, having an employee that never reaches payroll is typically more unacceptable than the possibility that, in some edge cases, a hire is made with minimal or no interviews (e.g., internal transfer, rehire, urgent temporary hire). The payroll step is structurally indispensable for the “toRetire” lifecycle.

**Therefore, Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative HiretoRetire process.**

Justification in short:

- Model 1:
  - + Mandatory post  screen  decision  onboard  payroll  close
  -  Missing requirement “interview before decision”

- Model 2:
  - + Enforces “interview before decision”
  -  Allows skipping the fundamentally required payroll step (and likely allows skipping onboarding or screening), which is more damaging to the core purpose of the HiretoRetire lifecycle.

If the goal is overall lifecycle correctness and integrity of HR and payroll integration, Model 1 is the better approximation of a normative process, despite its flaw regarding interview dependency.
