1. Comparison with a “normative” HiretoRetire process  
A typical simplified HiretoRetire control flow is:

1) Post_Job_Ad  
2) Screen_Candidates  
3) Conduct_Interviews  
4) Make_Hiring_Decision  
5) Onboard_Employee  
6) Add_to_Payroll  
7) Close_Case  

(Optionally: some loops/backtracking before a final decision, but at least: no payroll without hire, a case is closed only after the employment decision and all mandatory admin are done, etc.)

2. Anomalies in Model 1

Model 1 structure (edges only):

- Post  Screen  
- Screen  Decide  
- Screen  Interview  
- Decide  Onboard  
- Onboard  Payroll  
- Payroll  Close  

Key observations:

1) Interviews and decision are only partially ordered via Screen  
   - Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview, but **no order between Interview and Decide**.  
   - This means the model allows:
     - Screen  Decide  Onboard  … and never doing an Interview, or  
     - Screen  Decide first, then Interview later while onboarding is already possible, or  
     - Screen  Interview  Decide (the sensible one).  
   - Anomalies:
     - **Decision without interview**: the hiring decision may be made without conducting interviews at all.  
     - **Interview after decision**: interviews may happen after the hiring decision is already taken, which contradicts basic hiring logic.

2) Screening is mandatory (which is fine), but interview is optional  
   - Because Interview is a separate node with no outgoing edges and no requirement to happen before Decide, a run can entirely skip Interview (just never execute it) and still reach Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close.  
   - In most normative processes, at least some evaluation step (interview or equivalent) is required before the decision, not purely optional.

3) No explicit loop or rejection path  
   - There is no way to represent:
     - multiple rounds of interviews, or  
     - the possibility that no candidate is hired and the case is closed as “not hired.”  
   - This is more a limitation than an anomaly, but compared to a realistic HiretoRetire, the model is incomplete.

Severity assessment (Model 1):  
- **Severe**: enabling the hiring decision before or without interviews undermines the essence of the hiring logic.  
- **Moderate**: lack of explicit “reject” or “no hire” outcome; process always goes to onboarding/payroll/close as if hiring occurred.

3. Anomalies in Model 2

Model 2 structure:

Nodes (some wrapped in operators):  
- Post, Screen, Interview, Decide  
- loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)  
- xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)  
- Close  

Edges:

- Post  Screen  
- Post  Interview  
- Interview  Decide  
- Decide  loop_onboarding  
- loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  
- xor_payroll  Close  

Semantics of the two operators:

- `loop_onboarding = *(Onboard, skip)`  
  - Start: run Onboard once.  
  - Then each iteration: either exit loop, or execute `skip` and go back to Onboard.  
  - Effect: **Onboard_Employee occurs at least once, possibly multiple times**.

- `xor_payroll = X(Payroll, skip)`  
  - Choose exactly one child: either  
    - execute Payroll, or  
    - execute skip (i.e., **do not execute Payroll at all**).

Key observations:

1) Parallelism between screening and interviews  
   - Post  Screen, Post  Interview, with no order between Screen and Interview.  
   - This allows:
     - Screen  Interview (common),  
     - Interview  Screen (interview before any screening result),  
     - Or performing them concurrently or even skipping one if nothing forces its execution.  
   - Anomalies:
     - Interview can be conducted before screenings are completed. That is odd but not impossible in some organizations (e.g., very quick prescreen based on CV before a deeper screening), so it’s arguable, but it does diverge from the typical ScreenthenInterview pattern.
   - More importantly: **Decide depends only on Interview, not on Screen**; the model does not require Screen to complete before Decide. So the decision can be made without screening the candidates at all.

2) Decision requires Interview, but Screening can be skipped  
   - Decide has incoming edge only from Interview.  
   - There is no edge Screen  Decide, and no requirement that Screen is done at all.  
   - So: **Screen_Candidates is logically optional** with respect to the hiring decision.  
   - That’s a deviation, but less severe than allowing the decision without interview; at least some assessment (Interview) is mandatory.

3) Onboarding loop: multiple onboardings  
   - Once Decide is done, the loop ensures Onboard executes at least once and may repeat multiple times (Onboard  skip  Onboard  …).  
   - Anomalies:
     - From a hiretoretire perspective, **you normally onboard the employee once** for a given case. Multiple onboardings for the same “case” is unusual.  
     - However, it does respect timing: onboarding happens only after the decision is made.

4) Payroll is optional  
   - XOR(Payroll, skip) means either:
     - Add_to_Payroll is done, or  
     - It is not done at all.  
   - Anomalies:
     - For a successful hire, adding to payroll is usually mandatory. Allowing closure without payroll contradicts the financial/HR integrity of the process (employee would work but never appear on payroll).  
   - However, if you interpret the model as covering both “hired” and “not hired” outcomes under a single case, then:
     - “Not hired” path might go: Post  Screen/Interview  Decide  Onboard (logically should be skipped, but the model forces at least one Onboard)  skip Payroll  Close.  
     - That still forces at least one onboarding even when no one is actually hired, which is clearly wrong.

Severity assessment (Model 2):  
- **Severe**:
  - Mandatory Onboard_Employee after any decision, even if the decision is “no hire” (since the loop does not distinguish outcome) and allowing multiple onboardings per case.  
  - Making Add_to_Payroll optional for a presumably hired employee.  
- **Moderate**:
  - Screening not required, decision can be based solely on interviews.  
  - Ordering between Screen and Interview is loosened.

4. Which model is closer to a normative HiretoRetire process?

Key normative expectations:

- **At least one evaluative step (screening and/or interview) before a hiring decision**.  
- **Hiring decision precedes onboarding and payroll**.  
- **Onboarding and payroll are single, mandatory steps for a successful hire**.  
- **No onboarding/payroll if no hire happens; closure after administrative completion**.

Compare:

- **Model 1**  
  - Pros:
    - Clear linear path after Post: Screen  (Interview somewhere)  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.  
    - Onboard and Payroll are mandatory and occur in the correct order after Decide.  
    - Payroll always happens before Close.  
  - Cons:
    - Interviews are optional and can occur after the decision.  
    - No explicit “no hire” path.

- **Model 2**  
  - Pros:
    - Decision can only occur after Interview (so at least interviews are mandatory before decide).  
    - Onboarding and payroll occur only after Decide.
  - Cons:
    - Screening is optional and unordered w.r.t. decision.  
    - Onboarding is **forced and repeatable** after any decision (no distinction between hire vs nohire and multiple onboardings).  
    - Payroll is **optional**, so a hired employee might never be added to payroll.  
    - Every case must go through onboarding at least once, even when that would be inappropriate.

Overall judgment:

- The anomalies in **Model 1** are primarily about **insufficient predecision assessment** (you can decide without interviewing, and interviews might be misplaced).  
- The anomalies in **Model 2** directly affect **postdecision correctness and administrative integrity**: it permits onboarding in situations where there should be none, allows multiple onboardings per case, and may omit payroll entirely.

From a processintegrity and compliance perspective, violating the “if hired, then onboard exactly once and add to payroll before closing” rule is more serious than the looseness in Model 1 around screening/interviews.

Therefore, **Model 1 is closer to a normative HiretoRetire process**. It preserves the essential “decide  onboard  payroll  close” core better than Model 2, whose loop/XOR constructs introduce more severe inconsistencies in how hires are finalized and administratively completed.
