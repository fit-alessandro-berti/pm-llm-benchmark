The diagram illustrates a process flow for handling a registration request, starting from the initial registration (a) and progressing through various decision points and actions. The key components include nodes labeled with actions such as examining thoroughly (b), examining casually (c), checking a ticket (d), reinstating a request (f), deciding (e), paying compensation (g), rejecting the request (h), and ending the process (z). The arrows between these nodes indicate the flow of the process, showing different paths based on the decisions made. The inset in the bottom right corner depicts various types of logical splits and joins, including XOR-split, AND-split, OR-split, XOR-join, AND-join, and OR-join, which are used to manage the flow of processes. The overall concept conveyed by the diagram is a structured approach to handling registration requests, with clear decision points and actions leading to different outcomes, ultimately guiding the process to completion.
