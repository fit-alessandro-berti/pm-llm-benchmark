Yes, there are several anomalies in the proposed process model. Here are a few examples:

1. A declaration can be simultaneously submitted and approved by different levels of approval (e.g., (`'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER')`)
2. There is no constraint between `Submission` and approval, e.g., the employee's final approval does not logically follow the supervisor's final approval.
3. Approval is repeated from different levels to the same point in the workflow (e.g., supervisory and administrative approval to both super/supervisor level)
4. Missing data are considered as a legitimate action after initial declaration submission by EMPLOYEE, but there is no clear mechanism by which it would result directly from an earlier stage in this process
5. Several activities have duplicate names. However, the problem statement does not mention `Request Payment`, however all activity names (`Declartion SAVED by EMPLOYEE'); etc`) appear to suggest that requestPayment may be a valid action in the workflow.

To address these issues, you would need to refine the model to:

1. Ensure consistency in approval levels and roles.
2. Add constraints between sequential activities (e.g., employee's final approval following supervisor's final approval).
3. Eliminate duplicate approval steps or re-norm those steps so they're meaningful.
4. Specify consequences for missing data, if it directly impacts the process.
