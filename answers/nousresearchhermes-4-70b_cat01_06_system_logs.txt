We are given a system log of user activities. We need to transform this into an event log for process mining.
 Steps:
 1. Identify cases: A case should represent a logical unit of work. In this context, we can consider each document/email as a case.
    - However, note that the user switches between documents and applications. We can group by the window title (which often includes the document name) and by application.
    - But note: the same window title might reappear after switching away and coming back. We need to consider continuity.

 Approach for case identification:
    - We observe that the user works on specific documents: 
        - "Quarterly_Report.docx" in Microsoft Word
        - "Document1.docx" in Microsoft Word
        - "Email - Inbox" in Google Chrome (for email)
        - "Report_Draft.pdf" in Adobe Acrobat
        - "Budget_2024.xlsx" in Microsoft Excel

    - However, note that the user might work on the same document in multiple sessions (e.g., Document1.docx is worked on at 09:00 and then again at 09:06 after switching from Excel).
    - We have to decide: should multiple sessions on the same document be one case or multiple?
        - Since the user switches applications in between, we might consider that the same document is part of the same case (a longer task). However, note that the system log does not explicitly indicate when a case starts and ends.

    - We can use the following logic for case grouping:
        - Each time the user focuses on a window (with a unique document/description) and starts working on it, we can consider it as part of a case. But if the same document is worked on in two separate sessions (with other activities in between on different documents), we might keep them together as one case for that document? 
        - Alternatively, we can break by application context? 

    - However, note that the user might be working on multiple tasks simultaneously (interleaving). 

    - Let's look at the sequence:

        - Starts with Quarterly_Report.docx (Microsoft Word) at 08:59.
        - Then switches to Document1.docx (Microsoft Word) at 09:00.
        - Works on Document1.docx until 09:01:45.
        - Then switches to Google Chrome (Email - Inbox) at 09:01:45.
        - Works on email until 09:04:00.
        - Then switches to Adobe Acrobat (Report_Draft.pdf) at 09:04:00.
        - Then switches to Excel (Budget_2024.xlsx) at 09:05:00.
        - Then switches back to Document1.docx at 09:06:00 and works until 09:07:00.
        - Then closes Document1.docx and reopens Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:15 and works until 09:08:15.

    - We can group by the window title and the application? But note that the same window title might appear in different applications? (e.g., "Email - Inbox" is unique to Google Chrome, and "Quarterly_Report.docx" is unique to Word).

    - We can define a case by the unique combination of (Application, Window). However, note that the window title might be the same for different documents? In this log, they are distinct.

    - But the same document (by window title) might be edited in multiple sessions. We want to group all events for the same document (even if interrupted by other documents) into one case? 
        - This is common in process mining: a case (e.g., an order) might be worked on, then put aside, then resumed. We want one case for one document.

    - Therefore, we can assign a case ID for each unique (Application, Window) combination. However, note that the same (App, Window) might be used for a long time (with multiple saves, etc.) and that is acceptable.

    - But note: the email inbox might be one case? However, the user might be working on multiple emails? The log shows one email interaction: "Open Email about Annual Meeting", then reply and send. Then we leave the email.

    - We can break the email into a separate case? But note the window title is "Email - Inbox", which is generic. We cannot tell if it's the same email or a new one? The log only says "Open Email about Annual Meeting", so we can assume that this is one email task. However, the next events are in the context of the inbox. We might consider the entire email session as one case? But the user only interacted with one email? 

    - Alternatively, we can consider the email as one case and the window title as the inbox, but then the next email (if any) would be a different case? But we don't have that.

    - Since the log only shows one email interaction, we can assign a case for that email by the email subject? But we don't have the subject as a separate attribute. We have the window title for the email as "Email - Inbox", which is generic.

    - How about we use the following for case ID:
        - For Microsoft Word: the window title (which is the document name) is the case ID? But note that two different documents are open. So we can have two case IDs for Word: "Quarterly_Report.docx" and "Document1.docx".
        - For Google Chrome: we have the window title "Email - Inbox", but we also see an action that opens a specific email. We can use the email subject as the case ID? But the log doesn't provide it in the window title. However, in the action of the click: "Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting". We can use that to create a case for the email? But then the subsequent events (reply, send) are for that email? 

    - Let's break the email into a case by the email subject? We can extract the subject from the action: "Annual Meeting". So case ID: "Email: Annual Meeting".

    - For Adobe Acrobat: window title is "Report_Draft.pdf", so case ID: "Report_Draft.pdf".
    - For Excel: "Budget_2024.xlsx".

    - Now, what about the initial focus on "Quarterly_Report.docx" at 08:59? Then the user switches to "Document1.docx" without closing the first document? We don't see a close event for Quarterly_Report.docx until 09:08:15. So the user has two Word documents open? But the focus events are on one document at a time.

    - We can have two cases for Word: one for "Quarterly_Report.docx" and one for "Document1.docx".

    - Steps for case assignment:

        Case ID rules:
          - When the application is Microsoft Word, use the window title (without ".docx")? Or keep as is? We'll keep as is for uniqueness.

          Case IDs:
            - "Quarterly_Report.docx" (Word)
            - "Document1.docx" (Word)
            - "Email: Annual Meeting" (Chrome)
            - "Report_Draft.pdf" (Acrobat)
            - "Budget_2024.xlsx" (Excel)

        How to assign events to cases?

          Event at 08:59: FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx -> Case: Quarterly_Report.docx
          Event at 09:00: FOCUS on Document1.docx -> Case: Document1.docx
          Then until 09:01:45: events on Document1.docx -> same case.

          Then at 09:01:45: SWITCH to Chrome. The next events in Chrome are about the email. We assign to the email case? But note the event at 09:02:00: CLICK, Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting. This is the start of the email case? We can assign all events in Chrome from 09:02:00 until the switch at 09:04:00 to the email case.

          However, the SWITCH event itself? It is from Word to Chrome. It doesn't belong to a specific case? We can assign it to the last active case? Or we can assign it to the case that is being switched to? But the switch event is a transition.

          We can assign the SWITCH event to the case that is being switched to? Because it marks the start of work on that case? But note the SWITCH event has both FromApp and ToApp. We can assign it to the ToApp case? 

          Alternatively, we can treat SWITCH events as system activities and assign them to the case that is being focused on next? 

          Since we are building an event log for process mining, we want to capture the work on each case. The SWITCH event is a contextual event that leads to the next work. We can assign it to the case that the user is switching to? 

          Example: 
            At 09:01:45: SWITCH from Word (Document1.docx) to Chrome (Email - Inbox). This SWITCH event is part of the email case because it is the event that brings the user to the email application. Similarly, the next event (CLICK at 09:02:00) is the first activity in the email case.

          But note: the email case starts with the SWITCH? Or with the first CLICK? We might consider the SWITCH as the first event of the email case? 

          However, the email case is about the email "Annual Meeting". The SWITCH event does not mention the email. We can start the email case with the first event that is specific to that email? 

          We have two options:
            Option 1: Start the email case at the SWITCH event (when the user switches to Chrome) and then the CLICK event on the email is part of that case.
            Option 2: Start the email case at the CLICK event that opens the email.

          I think Option 2 is better because the SWITCH event is a transition and not specific to the email. The email work starts when the user clicks on the email.

          But note: the SWITCH event is necessary to bring the user to the email application. However, without the email, the user might have done something else. Since the user then opens the email, we can consider the entire email session (from the SWITCH to the next SWITCH) as part of the email case? But that would include the time before the email is opened? 

          Alternatively, we can break the email case only for the events that are about the email? But the email is opened and then the user replies and sends. We can assign all events in Chrome (from the first event in Chrome until the next SWITCH) to the email case? But note the window title is "Email - Inbox", which is the application, not the specific email. However, the log does not show any other email activity. So we can assume that the entire Chrome session from 09:01:45 to 09:04:00 is for the same email? 

          How about we define the email case starting from the SWITCH to Chrome until the next SWITCH? But then the SWITCH event would be the first event? 

          Let's see the events for Chrome:

            2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox
            2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting
            ... and then more events until 09:04:00.

          We can assign the SWITCH event to the email case? Why? Because it is the event that leads to the email application. But note, the user might have switched to Chrome for a different reason? However, the next event is about the email. So we can assign the SWITCH event to the email case? 

          Alternatively, we can create a new case for the email when the email is opened? But then we lose the transition. 

          In process mining, we often have events that are transitions. We can include the SWITCH as the first event of the target case? 

          I propose: 
            - The SWITCH event that leads to a new application is assigned to the case of the new window that is focused after the switch? 

          Steps:

            For an event of type SWITCH:
              - The case ID is the case of the ToApp and ToWindow? But note: the ToWindow might be the same as a previous case? 

            However, in the email case, the ToWindow is "Email - Inbox", which we are using as the window for the email case. But we are going to call the case "Email: Annual Meeting". We can derive the case ID for email from the action? 

          This becomes complex. 

    - Alternative approach: group events by the top-level window title and by application, and then by the main focus. We can break the log into sessions per window. 

    - We can define a case as starting when a window is focused and then ends when the window is closed or when the user switches away and does not return? But we see that the user switches back to Document1.docx.

    - We can use a timeout? But the log doesn't have timeouts.

    - Given the complexity, we will do the following:

        We will assign a case ID based on the following:

          - For Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Excel: use the window title as the case ID.

          - For Google Chrome: we will create a case ID from the email subject if available, otherwise use the window title. In this log, we have an email subject in the action of the click: "Open Email about Annual Meeting". So we extract "Annual Meeting" and form the case ID as "Email: Annual Meeting".

          - The SWITCH events: 
              - When switching to an application, the SWITCH event is assigned to the case of the target window (if we can determine it). But note, the SWITCH event only has the ToWindow. We can assign it to the case that we are about to work on? 

          How to handle the SWITCH event at 09:01:45? 
            - We are switching to Chrome with ToWindow="Email - Inbox". We don't have an email subject at the SWITCH event. But the next event (at 09:02:00) is a CLICK with action "Open Email about Annual Meeting". We can look ahead? 

          We can do:

            We'll process the log and for each event, we assign a case ID by:

              - If the application is Word, Excel, Acrobat: case ID = window title.
              - If the application is Chrome: 
                  - We look at the action attribute if available? 
                  - But note: the SWITCH event doesn't have an action. The CLICK event does.

          Alternatively, we can assign the SWITCH event to the email case by making a note that the email case starts with the SWITCH? But then we don't have the subject at the SWITCH event.

          We can do:

            We'll create a list of cases and assign events to a case based on:

              - The primary window (the one that is being worked on) at the time.

            But we don't have a clear session end.

        Proposed method:

          We'll traverse the log and maintain:

            current_case: the case that is currently active.

          Steps:

            - Start: no current case.

            - Event 1: FOCUS, App=Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx -> 
                case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
                current_case = "Quarterly_Report.docx"

            - Event 2: FOCUS, App=Word, Window=Document1.docx -> 
                This is a new window in the same application. We consider it a new case? 
                case_id = "Document1.docx"
                current_case = "Document1.docx"

            - Events on Document1.docx: assign to "Document1.docx"

            - Event: SWITCH to Chrome with ToWindow="Email - Inbox" -> 
                We are leaving the current case (Document1.docx) and going to Chrome. 
                This SWITCH event: we can consider it as belonging to the next case? But we don't have the email subject yet. 
                However, the next event (at 09:02:00) is a CLICK that opens a specific email. We can assign the SWITCH event to a temporary case? 

            This becomes messy.

    - After reconsideration, we can do:

        We will create a case for each unique window in each application? But then the email case would be the same window (Email - Inbox) for multiple emails? 

        We need to break the email by the email subject. How? The only clue is the action in the CLICK event.

        We can do:

          - For Chrome, we will create a case for each email that is opened? But we don't know when the email task ends. We see the reply and send, but then the user switches away.

        - We can define the email case as starting with the CLICK that opens the email and ending with the send? But then the SWITCH event at 09:04:00 is not part of the email case? 

        How about:

          - The email case: 
              Starts: 09:02:00 (CLICK, Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting)
              Then: 09:02:30 (SCROLL), 09:02:45 (CLICK, Reply), 09:03:00 (TYPING), 09:03:20 (CLICK, Send)

          The SWITCH event at 09:01:45 is not part of the email case? Then what case is it? We can create a case for the Chrome application without an email? But that doesn't fit.

        Alternatively, we can consider the entire Chrome session (from the SWITCH until the next SWITCH) as a single case? And then we name it by the email if we can? 

        We can do:

          - The SWITCH event at 09:01:45: we don't assign it to any case? Or we assign it to the previous case (Document1.docx)? That doesn't make sense.

        Another idea: we can treat the SWITCH events as system events that are not part of any case? But then we lose the context of switching.

    - I found a better approach: in process mining, we often have events that are part of a case. The SWITCH event is a user activity that switches the focus from one case to another. We can consider the SWITCH event as belonging to the case that the user is leaving? Or the one they are entering? 

        - In the literature, sometimes a case is defined by the resource (application) and the object (document). The SWITCH event is a handover? 

        - We can model the SWITCH event as a separate activity type and assign it to the case that is being left? Because the user is leaving that case to go to another.

        But wait, the SWITCH event has both FromApp and ToApp. So we can extract two pieces of information: leaving one case and entering another.

        We can split the SWITCH event into two events? 

          - An event for leaving the previous case: activity="LEAVE" for the case being left.
          - An event for the new case: activity="ENTER" for the case being entered.

        But we are constrained by the event log format.

        Alternatively, we can assign the SWITCH event to both cases? But that is not standard.

    - Given the complexity and the fact that the SWITCH events are only 4 in the log, we can do:

        We will create a case for the email starting at the first event in Chrome that is specific to the email (the CLICK to open the email) and assign all subsequent Chrome events until the next SWITCH to that email case. The SWITCH event at 09:01:45 is not assigned to any case? Or we assign it to the email case? 

        But note: the SWITCH event occurs at 09:01:45 and the email opens at 09:02:00. There is a 15-second gap. What if the user did something else? The log doesn't show any event in Chrome between the SWITCH and the CLICK. So we can assume that the SWITCH event is the first step to get to the email application, and then the email work begins.

        We can assign the SWITCH event to the email case? But then we have to change the activity name of the SWITCH event for the email case to something else? The email case starts with a SWITCH event that brought the user to Chrome? 

        We can rename the SWITCH event to "OPEN_APPLICATION" for the email case? And then the next events are the email interactions.

        So for the email case:

          Activity: OPEN_EMAIL_APPLICATION (derived from SWITCH) at 09:01:45
          Then: OPEN_EMAIL, SCROLL_IN_EMAIL, REPLY_EMAIL, etc.

        This way, we capture the whole email session including the switch.

    - We'll do:

        Case ID for email: "Email: Annual Meeting"

        Events for email case:

          2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z -> Activity: "Open Email Application" (derived from SWITCH event, but note the SWITCH event is about the target application)
          2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z -> "Open Email"
          ... and so on until the next SWITCH (09:04:00) which is from Chrome to Acrobat. We assign that SWITCH event to the next case (Report_Draft.pdf) as an "Open Application" event? 

        Then the SWITCH event at 09:04:00: 
          - We assign to the case "Report_Draft.pdf" as an "Open Application" event.

        This way, every time there is a SWITCH, we assign it to the target case as an "Open Application" event? 

        But note: the SWITCH event from Word to Chrome at 09:01:45: we are assigning to the email case. But the email case hasn't started until the click? We can consider the SWITCH as the first event of the email case.

    - Similarly, the SWITCH from Chrome to Acrobat at 09:04:00: assign to the case "Report_Draft.pdf" as an "Open Application" at 09:04:00? But then the next event is at 09:04:30 (SCROLL). That gap is acceptable.

    - The SWITCH event from Acrobat to Excel at 09:05:00: assign to the case "Budget_2024.xlsx" as "Open Application".

    - The SWITCH event from Excel to Word (Document1.docx) at 09:06:00: assign to the case "Document1.docx" as "Open Application". But note, this is a return to the document. We already have events for Document1.docx. We are resuming? 

        In process mining, we can have multiple events for the same case over time. So we can add these events to the existing case for Document1.docx.

    - The SWITCH event from Word (Document1.docx) to Word (Quarterly_Report.docx) at 09:07:15? Wait, there is no SWITCH event shown. There is:
          2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z,CLOSE,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx
          2024-12-11T09:07:15.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Quarterly_Report.docx

        This is a CLOSE event for Document1.docx and then a FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx. We don't have a SWITCH event. But we can treat the FOCUS event as a resumption of Quarterly_Report.docx? 

        We can assign the FOCUS event to the case "Quarterly_Report.docx".

 3. Activity Naming:

        We'll map the raw actions to standardized activity names:

          - FOCUS: We can consider this as "Resume Work" or "Open". But note, when the user returns to a document, we can call it "Resume Work". For the first time, we can call it "Open". However, we don't know if the document was opened before.

          - We have a SWITCH event that we are going to rename to "Open Application" when it is the first event of a case? But note, the SWITCH event represents a switch to an application that is not necessarily opening a new case? 

          However, in our assignment above, we are using the SWITCH event as the first event of a case (for Chrome, Acrobat, Excel) when it is the first time we see that case? But for Document1.docx, we see a FOCUS event as the first event.

          We can standardize:

            For the first event in a case (for a new document/object), we can call it "Start" or "Open". For subsequent returns, we can call it "Resume".

          But we don't track if the case is being opened for the first time or resumed.

          Alternatively, we can use a consistent activity for the first event? 

          We can do:

            - SWITCH events: we map to "Switch to Application"

            - FOCUS events: we map to "Focus on Document"

            - TYPING: "Edit Content"
            - SAVE: "Save Document"
            - SCROLL: "Scroll Document"
            - CLICK: we map based on the action: 
                  - If action contains "Open Email", then "Open Email"
                  - If action contains "Reply to Email", then "Reply to Email"
                  - If action contains "Send Email", then "Send Email"
            - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlight Text"
            - CLOSE: "Close Document"

          But note: the SWITCH event we are assigning to the target case. We want to capture that the user switched to that application. We can call it "Switch to Application" and then the next event is the first work on that case.

          However, for the email case, we are assigning the SWITCH event to the email case. Then the next event is the CLICK to open the email. We can have:

            Email case:
              Switch to Application: Chrome (for Email)
              Open Email: Annual Meeting
              Scroll in Email
              ...

          This seems acceptable.

 4. Event Attributes:

    We will have:
        Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp

    We can also include the application and window as additional attributes? But they can be derived from the case ID? Not exactly: the case ID is the window title for Word, etc., but for email we have a different name.

    We can include:

        Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window

    But note: the SWITCH event has FromApp, FromWindow, ToApp, ToWindow. We can map:

        For a SWITCH event, we are including in a case, we set:
            Application = ToApp
            Window = ToWindow

        For other events, they have App and Window.

    We can derive for every event in the log:

        - The application: 
            - For a SWITCH event: we use ToApp (because we are focusing on the target application for the case)
            - For others: the given App.

        Similarly, the window: 
            - For SWITCH: ToWindow
            - For others: the given Window.

    But note: the case ID for email is "Email: Annual Meeting", but the window is "Email - Inbox"? We can keep the window as is.

 5. Implementation:

    We'll go event by event and assign:

        Case ID and Activity Name.

    Steps:

        Initialize:

          current_cases = {}   # we might not need? 
          cases = {}            # to track if a case already exists? We can create a list of events per case.

          We'll create a list for the event log.

        For each event in the system log:

          if event is SWITCH:
             case_id = determine_case_id(event['ToApp'], event['ToWindow'], event)
                 For ToApp:
                    if ToApp in ['Microsoft Word', 'Adobe Acrobat', 'Microsoft Excel']:
                         case_id = event['ToWindow']
                    if ToApp is 'Google Chrome':
                         # check if the next event in the log has an action that indicates an email subject? 
                         # But we are processing in order. We can look ahead? 
                         # Alternatively, we can postpone the assignment? 
                         # We'll do: assign a temporary case_id for Chrome as "Chrome:"+ToWindow, and then when we see an email action, we change it? 
                         # But that is complex.

                 Alternatively, we can do: 
                    We'll assign the SWITCH event to a case by the target application and window? But then the email case would be "Email - Inbox", which is the window title.

                 However, we want to name the email case by the email subject. We can do:

                    For Chrome, we will not assign the SWITCH event to a specific email case until we see an email action? 

                 This is getting too complex.

        Revised plan for case assignment without look ahead:

          We'll assign the SWITCH event to a case based on the target application and target window only? Then, for Chrome, we use the window title "Email - Inbox". Then, when we see a CLICK event in Chrome with an action that has an email subject, we change the case ID of all events in that Chrome session to the email subject? 

          How to do that? We can:

            - First pass: assign a preliminary case ID for every event.
            - Then, when we encounter an event that has an email subject, we update all events in the current Chrome session (from the SWITCH until now) to the new case ID (email subject).

          But we are only doing one pass.

        Given the small size of the log, we can do:

          We know that the email subject is only in one event: the CLICK at 09:02:00. So we can remember that and then when we process the SWITCH event at 09:01:45, we don't know the email subject. Then when we get to 09:02:00, we look back and change the case ID of the SWITCH event and any events in between? 

          But there are no events between 09:01:45 and 09:02:00.

        We can do:

          events = []
          cases = {}   # case_id: list of events

          We process in order.

          event0: 08:59: FOCUS, Word, Quarterly_Report.docx -> case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx", activity="Focus on Document"

          event1: 09:00: FOCUS, Word, Document1.docx -> case_id="Document1.docx", activity="Focus on Document"

          event2: 09:00:30: TYPING, Word, Document1.docx -> case_id="Document1.docx", activity="Edit Content"

          ... until event: 09:01:45: SWITCH from Word to Chrome, ToWindow=Email-Inbox.

          We don't know the email subject yet. We assign case_id = "Chrome:Email-Inbox", activity="Switch to Chrome"

          Then event: 09:02:00: CLICK, Chrome, Email-Inbox, Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting

          Now we see the email subject. We want to change the case_id of the previous event (09:01:45) and this event to "Email: Annual Meeting". But also, we want the activity of the SWITCH event to be something else? 

          We can change the case_id of the SWITCH event to "Email: Annual Meeting", and change its activity to "Open Application".

          And for the CLICK event: case_id="Email: Annual Meeting", activity="Open Email"

          Then subsequent events in Chrome until the next SWITCH are also assigned to "Email: Annual Meeting".

          This requires look ahead and then going back to change events.

        Alternatively, we can process the log in one pass but store the events in a list and then after the email is opened, we change the case_id of the SWITCH event? 

        But that is not possible in a linear pass without storing state.

        We can do:

          We remember that when we see an email opening, we set a state for the current Chrome session to be for that email.

          We can store:

            current_email_case = None

          For an event in Chrome:

            if the event is CLICK and the action contains "Open Email about", then extract the subject and set current_email_case = "Email:"+subject

          Then for the SWITCH event that brought us to Chrome, we can set a flag that the next Chrome event might be for an email? But we don't know until the email is opened.

        Given the complexity and the small size, we will process the entire log and then at the end adjust the case_id for events in the Chrome session that are part of an email.

        But we are writing a linear transformation. We can do:

          Step 1: Preprocess and identify the email session.

          We can make one pass to detect the email subject and the SWITCH event that started the Chrome session.

          Then in a second pass, we assign cases.

        However, the problem says to transform the provided log. We are allowed to do as we wish.

        We'll do a two-pass approach:

          Pass 1: 
            - Identify all email sessions: 
                - Find events with action containing "Open Email about"
                - For each such event, note the time and the subject.

          In this log, we have one: at 09:02:00, subject: "Annual Meeting"

          Then, we find the SWITCH event that is the first event in Chrome before this email session. In this case, it's at 09:01:45.

          Pass 2:

            For each event, assign case_id and activity.

            Rules:

              - For the SWITCH event at 09:01:45: 
                    case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"
                    activity = "Open Application"

              - For the email session: from 09:02:00 to 09:04:00: case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"

              - For the SWITCH event at 09:04:00: 
                    This SWITCH event is from Chrome to Acrobat. We assign to the case "Report_Draft.pdf" (the ToWindow) and activity = "Open Application"

              - Similarly, the SWITCH event at 09:05:00: to Excel, case_id = "Budget_2024.xlsx", activity = "Open Application"

              - The SWITCH event at 09:06:00: to Word, Document1.docx. We assign to the case "Document1.docx", activity = "Open Application"

              - For the FOCUS event at 09:07:15: Word, Quarterly_Report.docx -> case_id="Quarterly_Report.docx", activity="Focus on Document"

          For other events:

            - FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, etc. in Word/Excel/Acrobat: use the window title as case_id.

          We also need to rename activities:

            - FOCUS events that are not SWITCH events and not the initial FOCUS events? We can call "Resume Work" for returning to an existing case? 

              But note: 
                  For Quarterly_Report.docx, the first event is FOCUS at 08:59 -> activity="Start Work" or "Open Document"
                  Then after switching away and coming back at 09:07:15: FOCUS -> activity="Resume Work"

              For Document1.docx: 
                  First event at 09:00: FOCUS -> "Start Work"
                  Then after switching away and coming back at 09:06:00: we have a SWITCH event with activity="Open Application", but then a TYPING event. We don't have a FOCUS event on return? We have a SWITCH event and then directly typing.

              For Excel: first event is SWITCH at 09:05:00 -> activity="Open Application", then TYPING.

          We can do:

            For the first event in a case (for a new document/email), we use "Start Work" or "Open". For subsequent events that are FOCUS or SWITCH that return to the case, we use "Resume Work" or "Open Application".

          But note: the SWITCH event to a case is an "Open Application" regardless of whether it's the first time or not.

          For FOCUS events that are not SWITCH events and not the first event of the case: we call "Resume Work".

          However, in the log, the only FOCUS events that are not SWITCH events are:

            - 08:59: FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx -> first event: "Open Document"
            - 09:00: FOCUS on Document1.docx -> first event: "Open Document"
            - 09:07:15: FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx -> not the first event of the case? (the case already had events at the beginning) -> "Resume Work"

          But note: the first event of the Quarterly_Report.docx case is at 08:59, then it is switched away, and then at 09:07:15, it is resumed. So we can call the 09:07:15 event "Resume Work".

          For the SWITCH events, we call them "Open Application" for the target case.

        Activity mapping:

          - FOCUS: 
               if it's the first event of the case: "Open Document"
               else: "Resume Work"

          - TYPING: "Edit Content"
          - SAVE: "Save Document"
          - SCROLL: "Scroll Document"
          - CLICK: 
               if action contains "Open Email about": "Open Email"
               if action contains "Reply to Email": "Reply to Email"
               if action contains "Send Email": "Send Email"
               else: leave as "Click"? But we map to a standard activity? We can use the action? Or we can call it "Click on Button" (or element) but without the action? We don't have that. We can use the action string as part of the activity? But we want standardized names.

          In this log, we have:
               CLICK, Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting -> "Open Email"
               CLICK, Action=Reply to Email -> "Reply to Email"
               CLICK, Action=Send Email -> "Send Email"

          - HIGHLIGHT: "Highlight Text"
          - CLOSE: "Close Document"

          - SWITCH: we are converting to "Open Application" for the target case.

        We'll create the event log in the following order:

          We'll collect all events with their assigned case_id and activity name.

        Let's create the event log step by step for this log:

          Event 0: 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx
             case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
             activity = "Open Document"

          Event 1: 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx

             activity = "Open Document"

          Event 2: 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx, ...

             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 3: 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx, ...

             activity = "Save Document"

          Event 5: 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, SWITCH, FromApp=Microsoft Word, FromWindow=Document1.docx, ToApp=Google Chrome, ToWindow=Email - Inbox
             case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"   [because we determined in pass1 that this SWITCH starts the email session for Annual Meeting]
             activity = "Open Application"

          Event 6: 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, CLICK, App=Google Chrome, Window=Email - Inbox, Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting

          Event 8: 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z, CLICK, App=Google Chrome, Window=Email - Inbox, Action=Reply to Email
             case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"
             activity = "Reply to Email"

          Event 9: 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z, TYPING, App=Google Chrome, Window=Email - Inbox, ...
             case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"
             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 10: 2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z, CLICK, App=Google Chrome, Window=Email - Inbox, Action=Send Email

             activity = "Send Email"

          Event 11: 2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z, SWITCH, FromApp=Google Chrome, FromWindow=Email - Inbox, ToApp=Adobe Acrobat, ToWindow=Report_Draft.pdf
             case_id = "Report_Draft.pdf"
             activity = "Open Application"

          Event 12: 2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z, SCROLL, App=Adobe Acrobat, Window=Report_Draft.pdf, ...
             case_id = "Report_Draft.pdf"
             activity = "Scroll Document"

          Event 13: 2024-12-11T09:04:45.000Z, HIGHLIGHT, App=Adobe Acrobat, Window=Report_Draft.pdf, ...
             case_id = "Report_Draft.pdf"
             activity = "Highlight Text"

          Event 14: 2024-12-11T09:05:00.000Z, SWITCH, FromApp=Adobe Acrobat, FromWindow=Report_Draft.pdf, ToApp=Microsoft Excel, ToWindow=Budget_2024.xlsx
             case_id = "Budget_2024.xlsx"
             activity = "Open Application"

          Event 15: 2024-12-11T09:05:15.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Excel, Window=Budget_2024.xlsx, ...

             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 16: 2024-12-11T09:05:30.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Excel, Window=Budget_2024.xlsx, ...
             case_id = "Budget_2024.xlsx"
             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 17: 2024-12-11T09:05:45.000Z, SAVE, App=Microsoft Excel, Window=Budget_2024.xlsx
             case_id = "Budget_2024.xlsx"
             activity = "Save Document"

          Event 18: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z, SWITCH, FromApp=Microsoft Excel, FromWindow=Budget_2024.xlsx, ToApp=Microsoft Word, ToWindow=Document1.docx
             case_id = "Document1.docx"
             activity = "Open Application"

          Event 19: 2024-12-11T09:06:15.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx, ...
             case_id = "Document1.docx"
             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 20: 2024-12-11T09:06:30.000Z, SAVE, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx
             case_id = "Document1.docx"
             activity = "Save Document"

          Event 21: 2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z, CLOSE, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx
             case_id = "Document1.docx"
             activity = "Close Document"

          Event 22: 2024-12-11T09:07:15.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx
             This is for the case "Quarterly_Report.docx", and it's not the first event of the case? (the case had events at the beginning) -> activity = "Resume Work"

          Event 23: 2024-12-11T09:07:45.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx, ...
             case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
             activity = "Edit Content"

          Event 24: 2024-12-11T09:08:00.000Z, SAVE, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx
             case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
             activity = "Save Document"

          Event 25: 2024-12-11T09:08:15.000Z, CLOSE, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx
             case_id = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
             activity = "Close Document"

 6. Additional attributes:

    We can include the original action and attributes (like Keys, Action, Direction) for context? But the problem says "You may include additional attributes if useful". We'll include:

        - Application (for non-SWITCH events, it's the App; for SWITCH, it's the ToApp)
        - Window (for non-SWITCH events, it's the Window; for SWITCH, it's the ToWindow)

    We can also include the low-level action type? But we are already mapping to an activity name.

    We'll include:

        Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window

    For the SWITCH events, we set:
        Application = ToApp
        Window = ToWindow

    For other events, we use the provided App and Window.

 7. Table:

    We'll write the event log as a table with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window

    Note: the Timestamp is the original timestamp.

 Implementation:

    We'll create a list of dictionaries and then print as a table.

    We have to do a two-pass? For the email case, we adjusted the case_id for the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 to be "Email: Annual Meeting". We also adjusted its activity to "Open Application".

    Let's code the two passes in concept.

    In practice, we can do:

        First, create a list of events with their raw data.

        Then, in a first pass, find all email opening events and note the time and the subject and the SWITCH event that is the first event of the related Chrome session.

        Then, in a second pass, assign case_id and activity.

    Steps for the code (pseudocode):

        events = list of 26 events (from the log)

        # First pass: find email sessions
        email_subjects = []
        for i, event in enumerate(events):
            if event['action'] == 'CLICK' and 'Action' in event and 'Open Email about' in event['Action']:
                subject = event['Action'].split('Annual Meeting')[0].strip()   # This is not robust. We can extract the subject as the whole string after "Open Email about"
                subject = event['Action'].replace('Open Email about ', '').strip()
                email_subjects.append( (i, subject) )

        # For each email session, find the SWITCH event that is the first event in the Chrome session before the email opening.
        # We assume that the email session starts with a SWITCH event to Chrome and then the email opening.
        for (email_index, subject) in email_subjects:
            # Find the last SWITCH event before email_index that has ToApp='Google Chrome'
            email_case = "Email: " + subject
            for j in range(email_index-1, -1, -1):
                if events[j]['action'] == 'SWITCH' and events[j]['ToApp'] == 'Google Chrome':
                    # We found the SWITCH event for this email
                    # Mark all events from j to email_index (inclusive) as belonging to email_case?
                    # But we want to reassign the SWITCH event to email_case and the email_case for the whole session until the next SWITCH.
                    # We'll mark from j to the next SWITCH event (if any) as email_case.
                    start_index = j
                    end_index = email_index   # we'll extend until the next SWITCH event that leaves Chrome?
                    # We'll find the next SWITCH event after email_index that has FromApp='Google Chrome'
                    for k in range(email_index, len(events)):
                        if events[k]['action'] == 'SWITCH' and events[k]['FromApp'] == 'Google Chrome':
                            end_index = k-1   # the email session is from start_index to k-1
                            break
                    else:
                        end_index = len(events)-1   # if no next SWITCH, then until end

                    # Now, for events from start_index to end_index, we set case_id = email_case
                    # But we don't want to do it now, we'll record for the second pass.
                    # We'll create a list of intervals: (start_index, end_index, email_case)
                    # But note: the email session might overlap with other cases? We are in the same Chrome application.
                    # We break the log into intervals per case.

                    # We'll record: for indices in [start_index, end_index] => case_id = email_case
                    # And for events in this interval, their activity might be adjusted? (like the SWITCH event at start_index becomes "Open Application")
                    pass   # we break after finding one for simplicity? There's only one email.

        # But we are not storing the intervals. We can do the second pass with these intervals.

    Given the complexity and the fact that we have only one email, we can hardcode:

        For events with index in [5, 10] (which are from index5: SWITCH to index10: Send Email) -> case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"

        For event index5 (SWITCH): activity = "Open Application"

        For event index6 (CLICK): activity = "Open Email"

        For event index8 (CLICK with Reply): activity = "Reply to Email"

        For event index10 (CLICK with Send): activity = "Send Email"

    But note: the log has events from index5 to index10? Let's list the indices:

        index5: SWITCH at 09:01:45
        index6: CLICK at 09:02:00
        index7: SCROLL at 09:02:30
        index8: CLICK at 09:02:45
        index9: TYPING at 09:03:00
        index10: CLICK at 09:03:20

        Then index11: SWITCH at 09:04:00 (leave Chrome)

        So we want events from index5 to index10 (inclusive) for the email case.

    We'll do:

        In the second pass, for each event, we check:

          if the event is in the email session (indices 5 to 10) then:
             case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"
             if event index==5: activity="Open Application"
             if event index==6: activity="Open Email"
             if event index==8: activity="Reply to Email"
             if event index==10: activity="Send Email"
             else: use the mapping as above.

          else:
             use the regular mapping.

    Regular mapping for other events:

        For SWITCH events not in the email session: 
            case_id = ToWindow (or ToApp+ToWindow) -> but we use ToWindow as case_id? 
            and activity="Open Application"

        For FOCUS events: 
            if it's the first event of the case: 
                case_id = ToWindow (for SWITCH) or Window (for FOCUS)
                activity = "Open Document"
            else:
                activity = "Resume Work"

        But note: for FOCUS events that are not the first event of the case, we need to know if the case already had events? We can track per case the first event time.

    We can do: 

        We'll create a dictionary for cases: case_first_event = {}   # case_id: first timestamp

        Then for an event:

          if event is FOCUS or (event is SWITCH and not in email session) then:

            case_id = event['ToWindow']   # for SWITCH, we use ToWindow; for FOCUS, we use Window

            if the case_id is not in case_first_event:
                case_first_event[case_id] = event['timestamp']
                activity = "Open Document"
            else:
                activity = "Resume Work"

        For other events (TYPING, SAVE, SCROLL, HIGHLIGHT, CLOSE) and for SWITCH events (non-email) and for email events (non-SWITCH non-first) we use the mapping.

    But note: the email session has a SWITCH event that we are treating specially.

    We'll do the second pass:

        events_transformed = []
        case_first_event = {}

        for i, event in enumerate(events):
            action = event['action']
            # Determine if this event is in an email session
            if i>=5 and i<=10:
                case_id = "Email: Annual Meeting"
                if i==5:
                    activity = "Open Application"
                    application = "Google Chrome"
                    window = "Email - Inbox"
                elif i==6:
                    activity = "Open Email"
                    application = "Google Chrome"
                    window = "Email - Inbox"
                elif i==8:
                    activity = "Reply to Email"
                    application = "Google Chrome"
                    window = "Email - Inbox"
                elif i==10:
                    activity = "Send Email"
                    application = "Google Chrome"
                    window = "Email - Inbox"
                else:
                    if action == 'SCROLL':
                        activity = "Scroll Document"
                    elif action == 'TYPING':
                        activity = "Edit Content"
                    else:
                        activity = action   # fallback
                    application = "Google Chrome"
                    window = "Email - Inbox"
            else:
                if action == 'SWITCH':
                    case_id = event['ToWindow']
                    activity = "Open Application"
                    application = event['ToApp']
                    window = event['ToWindow']
                elif action == 'FOCUS':
                    case_id = event['Window']
                    if case_id not in case_first_event:
                        case_first_event[case_id] = event['timestamp']
                        activity = "Open Document"
                    else:
                        activity = "Resume Work"
                    application = event['App']
                    window = event['Window']
                else:
                    # Use the mapping
                    if action == 'TYPING':
                        activity = "Edit Content"
                    elif action == 'SAVE':
                        activity = "Save Document"
                    elif action == 'SCROLL':
                        activity = "Scroll Document"
                    elif action == 'HIGHLIGHT':
                        activity = "Highlight Text"
                    elif action == 'CLOSE':
                        activity = "Close Document"
                    elif action == 'CLICK':
                        # Check the action attribute for email actions? But we are not in email session here.
                        # For other clicks, we can use a generic activity?
                        activity = "Click"   # or we can use the 'Action' field? But we want standardized. We'll use "Click on Button" or just "Click"
                        # We don't have context, so we use "Click"
                    else:
                        activity = action

                    application = event['App']
                    window = event['Window']

                case_id = event['Window']   # for non-SWITCH, non-FOCUS events, we use the Window as case_id? 
                # But note: for a close event, the window is the same as the case_id.

            # Append the event with: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Application, Window
            events_transformed.append({
                'Case ID': case_id,
                'Activity Name': activity,
                'Timestamp': event['timestamp'],
                'Application': application,
                'Window': window
            })

        Then print the table.

    However, note: for non-SWITCH and non-FOCUS events, we set case_id = event['Window']? 
        - For example, event at 09:00:30: TYPING, Window=Document1.docx -> case_id=Document1.docx -> correct.

    But what about the email case? We already handled email events in the first branch.

    Let's test for event at index5 (SWITCH): 
        It's in the email session (i=5), so we set case_id="Email: Annual Meeting", activity="Open Application", application="Google Chrome", window="Email - Inbox"

    Event at index=14: SWITCH to Excel at 09:05:00 -> not in email session, so we use the second branch for SWITCH: 
        case_id = ToWindow = "Budget_2024.xlsx"
        activity = "Open Application"
        application = "Microsoft Excel"
        window = "Budget_2024.xlsx"

    Event at index=18: SWITCH to Word, Document1.docx -> not in email session:
        case_id = "Document1.docx"
        activity = "Open Application"
        application = "Microsoft Word"
        window = "Document1.docx"

    Event at index=22: FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:15 -> not in email session, so:
        case_id = event['Window'] = "Quarterly_Report.docx"
        We check if this case_id is in case_first_event? 
            It was added at index0 (FOCUS) at 08:59 -> so it exists.
        Therefore, activity = "Resume Work"

    This seems to work.

    We'll code accordingly.

    Note: the email session indices: 5 to 10 (inclusive) for this log.

    Let's compute the indices:

        The log has 26 events.

        Event 5: 09:01:45, SWITCH
        Event 6: 09:02:00, CLICK (open email)
        Event 7: 09:02:30, SCROLL
        Event 8: 09:02:45, CLICK (reply)
        Event 9: 09:03:00, TYPING
        Event 10: 09:03:20, CLICK (send)
        Event 11: 09:04:00, SWITCH (leave)

        So we want events 5,6,7,8,9,10 for the email case.

    We'll write the event log in the following format:

        Case ID,Activity Name,Timestamp,Application,Window

    We'll output as CSV.

    Note: the original log has a timestamp format: "2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z"

    We'll keep that.

    Let's write the transformed events.

### Explanation of Logic

**1. Case Identification:**  
- **Documents/Emails as Cases:** Each unique document (e.g., `Quarterly_Report.docx`), spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`), PDF (`Report_Draft.pdf`), or email subject (`Annual Meeting`) represents a **case**.  
- **Email Handling:** The email case `Email: Annual Meeting` is derived from the `Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting` attribute, grouping all Chrome interactions (scrolling, replying) until the email is sent.  
- **Application Context:** Events are grouped by the active application window (e.g., Word, Excel) and document/PDF title.  

**2. Activity Naming (Standardization):**  
- **System Actions  Process Steps:**  
  - `FOCUS`  `Open Document` (first access) or `Resume Work` (re-accessing existing case).  
  - `SWITCH`  `Open Application` (transition to a new case/application).  
  - `TYPING`  `Edit Content` (content creation).  
  - `SAVE`  `Save Document`.  
  - `SCROLL`  `Scroll Document`.  
  - `CLICK`  Mapped to specific email actions (`Open Email`, `Reply to Email`, `Send Email`) based on the `Action` attribute.  
  - `HIGHLIGHT`  `Highlight Text`.  
  - `CLOSE`  `Close Document`.  

**3. Event Attributes:**  
- **Case ID:** Unique document/email identifier (e.g., `Document1.docx`).  
- **Activity Name:** Standardized process step (e.g., `Edit Content`).  
- **Timestamp:** Original event time.  
- **Application/Window:** Contextual attributes preserved for analysis.  

**4. Narrative Flow:**  
The log tells a story of **interleaved work sessions**:  
1. Start with `Quarterly_Report.docx`.  
2. Switch to `Document1.docx` for drafting and saving.  
3. Handle the `Annual Meeting` email (open, reply, send).  
4. Review `Report_Draft.pdf` (scroll/highlight).  
5. Edit `Budget_2024.xlsx`.  
6. Resume `Document1.docx`, then return to `Quarterly_Report.docx` for finalization.  

This structure enables analysis of task switching, work interruptions, and document-centric workflows.
