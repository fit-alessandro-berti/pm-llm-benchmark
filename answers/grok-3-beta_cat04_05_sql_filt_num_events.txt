Here's a refined version of your prompt for the benchmark, maintaining the original intent while ensuring clarity, precision, and a professional tone. I've also added a bit more context to guide the user and avoid ambiguity.

**Benchmark Prompt: Filtering Event Log Cases by Event Count**

"You are working with an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. Each row in the table represents a single event in a process, and the table includes at least the following columns:  
- `case_id`: A unique identifier for a process instance (or 'case') that groups related events.  
- `activity`: The type of event or action performed.  
- `timestamp`: The time at which the event occurred.  

**Task**: Write a DuckDB SQL query to filter the event log such that only events from cases with six or fewer events are included in the result set. In other words, identify cases (based on `case_id`) that have more than six events and exclude all events associated with those cases. The final output should include all events from the remaining cases (those with six or fewer events).

**Requirements**:  
- Use appropriate grouping and filtering techniques to count events per `case_id`.  
- Ensure that the query returns the complete event details (e.g., `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for the filtered cases.  
- Write the query in valid DuckDB SQL syntax.

**Expected Outcome**: The result should be a subset of the `event_log` table containing only events from cases where the total number of events per `case_id` is less than or equal to six."

This version ensures the task is clear, provides context about the data structure, and specifies the expected output. It also avoids redundancy and uses precise language to prevent misinterpretation. If you have additional constraints or sample data to include, they can be added as an optional section.
