Let's address the three requested steps for the two provided POWL models.

---

# 1. **Expected ("Normative") Hire-to-Retire Process**

Normal high-level order (assuming no skipping or looping):

1. **Post_Job_Ad**  
2. **Screen_Candidates**  
3. **Conduct_Interviews**  
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision**  
5. **Onboard_Employee**  
6. **Add_to_Payroll**  
7. **Close_Case**  

**Key points:**
- Screen before interview, interview before decision, decision before onboarding, onboarding before payroll and closure.
- Every step should be performed once in sequence. Skipping onboarding or payroll, or doing them multiple times, would be highly unusual and problematic.

---

# 2. **Analysis and Identification of Anomalies**

## **POWL Model 1**

### **Structure:**
- Nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close
- Edges:
  - Post  Screen
  - Screen  Decide
  - Screen  Interview
  - Decide  Onboard
  - Onboard  Payroll
  - Payroll  Close

### **Possible Traces (Partial Order Implications)**
The central anomaly is in the edges `Screen  Decide` **and** `Screen  Interview`.  

**This means:**  
After 'Screen', you may do 'Interview' **or** 'Decide', and their order is not constrained by each other.

**So, allowed:**
- **Screen  Decide  Onboard...** (i.e., skip Interview altogether, which is illogical)
- **Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard...** (the normative order)
- **Screen  Interview && Screen  Decide:** Interview and Decide can occur in any order (potential for Decide before Interview!)
- No constraint *between* Interview and Decide; so, "Screen  Decide  Interview" is possible, which is not logical: hiring decision before interviews made.

### **Summing up the anomalies in Model 1:**
1. **Interview may be skipped** altogether (not required by the model).
2. **Hiring decision can be made before interviews**, or even without them.
3. Only after Decide does Onboarding begin; at least it does **not** skip onboarding/payroll/close.
4. No mechanism for multiple executions (loops) or for skipping onboarding/payroll.

**Severity:** Severe logical issues—permits skipping interviews, and hiring without interviewing is a major process error for hire-to-retire.

---

## **POWL Model 2**

### **Structure:**  
- Nodes: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, *loop_onboarding (Onboard/skip), xor_payroll (Payroll/skip), Close
- Edges:
  - Post  Screen
  - Post  Interview
  - Interview  Decide
  - Decide  loop_onboarding
  - loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
  - xor_payroll  Close

### **Key Operator Anomalies:**
- **loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)**  
  This allows:
  - Do Onboard once and move on, **or**
  - Skip Onboard entirely (!), 
  - Or potentially repeat Onboard multiple times (though the standard loop semantics for two elements is: 
    - Do Onboard, then repeatedly either exit or re-do Onboard via skip. For practical purposes, it allows zero or more Onboard executions.)
- **xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)**
  - At runtime, pick **either** Payroll or skip.

### **Partial Order Anomalies:**
- Post  Screen  
- Post  Interview  
  - **Screen and Interview may be performed in any order**, or in parallel.

### **Summing up the anomalies in Model 2:**
1. **Screen and Interview** can occur in any order or in parallel.  
   - **That is, you can interview before screening.**
2. **Onboarding is optional or may occur multiple times** (can be skipped entirely due to loop/skip, or repeated).
3. **Adding to payroll is optional** (as it is an XOR choice with skip).
4. **Closure only happens after whatever occurred in the earlier steps.**

**Severity:**  
- Interviewing before screening is poor practice, but maybe less severe than outright skipping interviews.  
- Skipping onboarding or payroll is more severe: the process may result in an employee being "hired" (decided upon), but **not onboarded**, **not added to payroll**, and then simply "closed."
- Multiple executions of onboarding is nonstandard and potentially problematic (why onboard the same person more than once?).

# 3. **Comparison and Assessment: Which Model is More Correct?**

## **Model 1 Anomalies and Severity**
- **Most severe:** Permits skipping interviews entirely, or hiring before interviewing candidates.
- **Consequences:** Allows the process to make a hiring decision with insufficient information; *anti-pattern* for all hiring practices.
- **Positive:** Does **not** allow skipping onboarding or payroll once the hiring decision is made.

## **Model 2 Anomalies and Severity**
- **Most severe:** Permits skipping onboarding and payroll entirely after a hiring decision. This could result in a person being "hired" with no further action—no onboarding, not on payroll, just closure.  
- **Secondary:** Permits screening and interviewing in any order (which is unconventional, but possibly less critical).
- **Additional:** Allows multiple onboarding executions (rare and not "correct," but perhaps less severe than skipping major steps).
- **Positive:** Interview cannot be skipped once process starts from Interview node; hiring decision requires Interview.

## **Direct Comparison to Normative Process**
- **Model 1**'s worst-case trace: hire without interview.
- **Model 2**'s worst-case trace: hiring decision made after interview (good), but then skip onboarding and payroll (bad).

## **Which is worse?**
- Skipping interviews fundamentally undermines the logic of hiring, but skipping onboarding and payroll equally undermines *being employed* after a candidate is chosen!
- However, **in Model 2, interview is always required before decision**,
  - i.e., **Make_Hiring_Decision** requires **Interview**,
  - while *onboarding* and *payroll* might, in principle, be skipped due to process configuration/settings (e.g., hiring an external contractor, not a regular employee).
- **Model 1**, on the other hand, makes it formally possible to "hire" without even having met people: a more severe breach of process integrity, because 'Interview' becomes both optional and unlocked from 'Decide'.

---

## **Conclusion: Which Model is More Normative**

**Model 2 more closely aligns with normative Hire-to-Retire practice.**

**Why:**
- It always requires 'Interview' before 'Make_Hiring_Decision' (given the edge Interview  Decide).
- While onboarding and payroll may be skipped, one could argue that in special (though very rare) circumstances these are indeed skipped (e.g., transfer to a department, interns not on payroll, etc.); in practice, this is simply a modeling anomaly but not as severe as hiring without interviews.
- Model 1's lack of ordering requires only the sequence: Screen  Decide or Interview, and allows skipping Interview entirely, or deciding before interview—undermining hiring at its core.

**Anomaly Severity Table:**

| Anomaly                                    | Where    | Severity | Commentary                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Skipping Interview                          | Model 1  | Critical | Allows 'hiring' without evaluation          |
| Hiring Decision before Interview            | Model 1  | Critical | Inverts core recruitment logic              |
| Skipping Onboarding and Payroll             | Model 2  | Severe   | Undermines 'being employed', but less core  |
| Interview before Screening                  | Model 2  | Moderate | Unusual but not fatal                       |
| Multiple Onboardings                        | Model 2  | Minor    | Unusual but fixable in implementation       |

# **Final Answer**

> **Model 2 more closely aligns with the standard Hire-to-Retire process.**
>
> **Justification:** Its most severe anomalies relate to optional onboarding and payroll after the hiring decision, but—crucially—it always requires candidates to be interviewed before a hiring decision is made. In contrast, Model 1 permits hiring decisions before or even without ever interviewing candidates, which is a fundamental process violation. Therefore, despite its flaws, Model 2 better preserves the integrity and critical sequence of core hiring activities.
