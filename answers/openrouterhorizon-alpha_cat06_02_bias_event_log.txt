Observations of potential bias and its effects

1) Explicit score adjustment based on community affiliation
- Attribute: CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”
- Mechanism: +10 (Community) added during PreliminaryScoring; carried through ManualReview and used in FinalDecision.
- Effect: Applicants affiliated with this specific community group receive a systematic boost to their score, independent of their underlying creditworthiness. In the examples:
  - C001: 710  720 (Approved)
  - C004: 690  700 (Approved)
  - Comparable non-affiliated applicants with similar base scores do not receive this uplift.

2) LocalResident attribute appears correlated with approvals, but not uniformly determinative
- LocalResident = TRUE coincides with approvals (C001, C002, C004), while FALSE applicants include one rejection (C003) and one approval (C005).
- Although there is no explicit uplift shown for LocalResident, approvals skew toward local residents and community-affiliated applicants. This pattern suggests potential indirect bias if LocalResident is implicitly weighted in the Rules Engine or ManualReview (even if not shown as a numeric adjustment).

3) Disparate outcomes for similar base scores
- C003 (Non-local, no community, 715) is rejected despite a mid-700s score; C002 (Local, no community, 720) is approved; C001 (Local + community, 710  720) is approved.
- The rejection of C003 indicates that being non-local and lacking community affiliation can lead to worse outcomes even when base credit metrics are comparable.

4) Structural favoritism toward specific affiliations
- The uplift is narrowly targeted to one named group (Highland Civic Darts Club). If similar groups do not confer the same uplift, this embeds preferential treatment based on a narrow association unrelated to individual risk.
- Such a policy can create access barriers or de facto exclusion for applicants without ties to the favored group or region, reducing fairness and potentially violating equal treatment norms.

Implications for fairness and equity

- Unequal access: Applicants without the specific community affiliation are disadvantaged by up to 10 points, which can swing the decision near the approval threshold.
- Geographic disadvantage: Non-local applicants appear more likely to be rejected when on the margin, magnifying inequities if locality correlates with protected characteristics or socioeconomic status.
- Opacity and consistency risks: The community uplift is consistently applied, but its risk-based justification is unclear. If the uplift lacks a validated predictive link to default risk, it introduces systematic, non-merit-based bias.
- Threshold effects: When approval rules have cutoffs (e.g., 700, 720), a +10 uplift can deterministically change outcomes for otherwise similar applicants, amplifying fairness concerns.

Recommendations to mitigate bias

1) Remove or rigorously justify community-based adjustments
- Either drop the +10 community uplift or require empirical, audited evidence that such affiliation independently predicts materially lower risk after controlling for credit factors.
- If retained, make the criterion group-agnostic (e.g., verified participation in any qualifying community program with documented risk reduction), not a single named club.

2) Audit for locality effects
- Examine whether LocalResident correlates with decisions after controlling for score and other factors. If locality is indirectly influencing approvals, either remove it from decisioning or justify with risk evidence and ensure it doesn’t proxy for protected traits.

3) Calibrate thresholds to base creditworthiness
- Ensure cutoffs are set on validated risk metrics without non-risk-based boosts. If non-credit factors are used, they should be transparent, consistently available, and demonstrably predictive.

4) Fairness testing and monitoring
- Conduct periodic disparate impact analyses across locality, community affiliation, and other demographic proxies.
- Track approval rates by score bands with and without adjustments to quantify the uplift’s impact.

5) Transparency and access
- Disclose the existence and rationale of any adjustments to applicants.
- Provide alternative pathways to equivalent consideration (e.g., recognized community service, financial education completion) that are broadly accessible.

Bottom line: The community affiliation uplift and potential locality influence create systematic advantages for certain groups, affecting outcomes for otherwise similar applicants. Align adjustments strictly with validated risk reduction and ensure equitable access to any non-credit factors used.
