    *   11. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, diagnosis: minor\_infection
    *   14. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, medication: antibiotics
    *   17. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, followup: pharmacy\_pickup

**Case 3:**

*   **Patient Attributes:** Age: 28, Gender: M, Insurance: private
*   **Events:**
    *   3. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery
    *   6. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, reason: scheduled\_knee\_surgery
    *   9. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, resource: Surgical Nurse, department: Surgery, prep\_type: general\_anesthesia
    *   13. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, procedure: arthroscopy
    *   16. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, resource: Recovery Nurse, department: Surgery, condition: stable
    *   18. timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: Surgery, followup: physiotherapy\_sessions

**Reasoning for Grouping:**

The primary factors used to group these events into distinct cases are:

1.  **Patient Attributes:** The `patient_age` and `patient_gender` are consistent within each proposed case. This is a strong indicator that these events pertain to the same individual.
2.  **Logical Activity Flow:** The sequence of activities within each case follows a plausible patient journey: registration -> triage/consultation -> diagnostic tests/procedures -> treatment/surgery -> discharge.
3.  **Departmental Progression:** While patients can move between departments, the initial registration and subsequent significant activities (like surgery or main consultations) often anchor a case to a primary department. Case 3 clearly shows a surgical pathway, while Cases 1 and 2 are more focused on the ER initially.
4.  **Resource Association (Secondary):** While not definitive, the same doctors or nurses appearing for multiple activities within a potential case strengthens the grouping. For example, Dr. Lee is associated with both the surgery consultation and the surgery itself in Case 3, and also with a consultation in Case 1 (though this could be a different patient with the same doctor, the unique patient attributes in Case 1 make it less likely to be the same individual). Dr. Smith is consistently involved in Case 2.

These groupings assume that the provided attributes are accurate and that a new "case" starts with a new patient registration event, or a significantly different set of patient attributes and a new sequence of activities.
