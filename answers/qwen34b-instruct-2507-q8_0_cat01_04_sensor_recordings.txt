###  Process Mining Analysis: Inferring Manufacturing Activities from Sensor Data

We are given a time-ordered event log with sensor readings from a single machine (M1) over a 10-minute period. The goal is to **infer high-level manufacturing activities** such as "Cutting Metal," "Assembling Parts," "Welding," "Quality Inspection," or "Packaging" by analyzing the patterns in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption.

##  Step-by-Step Pattern Analysis

We analyze the events chronologically, looking for **distinct phases** where sensor values change in a consistent, interpretable way. We look for **transitions** and **stability** across variables to assign logical labels.

|------|----------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 1–3  | 20–21     | 1          | 0              | 0              | 0             | 0.40–0.50    | Baseline idle state |
| 4–6  | 50–58     | 1–1.5      | 30–38          | 5              | 5–10          | 2.00–3.00    | Sharp rise in temp, vibration, flow, tool position |

##  Phase Identification and Activity Labeling

We identify **clear transitions** in the sensor data that suggest distinct operational phases.

---

###  Phase 1: **Machine Idle / Preparation (Events 1–3)**  
- **Events**: 1, 2, 3  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - Temperature: 20°C  21°C (slight rise)  
  - Pressure: Stable at 1 bar  
  - Vibration: 0 Hz  remains 0  
  - Material Flow: 0  
  - Tool Position: 0 mm  
  - Energy: 0.40–0.50 kWh (low)  
- **Interpretation**:  
  This is a **pre-operation idle state**. All active processes are off. The machine is likely in a standby mode, preparing for the next step. No material movement or tool engagement.  
-  **Label**: **"Machine Idle / Preparation"**

>  *Rationale*: Zero flow, zero vibration, minimal energy use, and zero tool position indicate no active process. The small temperature increase may be due to ambient heating or system warm-up.

---

###  Phase 2: **Cutting Metal (Events 4–6)**  
- **Events**: 4, 5, 6  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - Temperature: 50°C  58°C (significant rise)  
  - Pressure: 1  1.5 bar (moderate increase)  
  - Vibration: 0  30  38 Hz (sharp spike)  
  - Material Flow: 5 units/s (starts)  
  - Tool Position: 5  10 mm (tool moving into position)  
  - Energy: 2.00  3.00 kWh (increases sharply)  
- **Interpretation**:  
  A sharp increase in **temperature**, **vibration**, **material flow**, and **energy consumption** indicates **mechanical cutting**. High vibration is typical of cutting tools engaging material. Rising temperature is expected due to friction and heat generation. Tool position increases as the blade moves into the workpiece.  
-  **Label**: **"Cutting Metal"**

>  *Rationale*: Vibration and temperature spike together with rising flow and energy consumption are classic signs of cutting. This phase shows a clear onset of a high-energy, high-vibration operation.

---

###  Phase 3: **Assembling Parts (Events 7–8)**  
- **Events**: 7, 8  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - Temperature: 40°C (moderate)  
  - Pressure: 2 bar (higher than during cutting)  
  - Vibration: 10 Hz (lower than cutting)  
  - Material Flow: 2 units/s (low)  
  - Tool Position: 15 mm (tool at a fixed position)  
  - Energy: 2.00 kWh (stable)  
- **Interpretation**:  
  Vibration is lower than in cutting, flow is low, temperature is moderate. Tool is held at a fixed position (15 mm), suggesting part placement or alignment. This is consistent with **manual or automated part assembly**, where components are being joined or positioned.  
-  **Label**: **"Assembling Parts"**

>  *Rationale*: Stable, moderate energy and lower vibration suggest a non-destructive, positioning operation. Tool position remains constant, which aligns with assembly where parts are placed rather than cut or welded.

---

###  Phase 4: **Welding (Event 9)**  
- **Event**: 9  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - Temperature: 80°C (very high)  
  - Pressure: 2 bar  
  - Vibration: 50 Hz (very high)  
  - Material Flow: 0 (no material movement)  
  - Tool Position: 15 mm (same as in assembly)  
  - Energy: 5.00 kWh (peak energy)  
- **Interpretation**:  
  This event shows a **peak in temperature and vibration**, with **no material flow** and **tool at fixed position**. High energy and vibration suggest **welding**, where heat is applied to join parts. The absence of material flow implies no cutting or feeding of raw material.  
-  **Label**: **"Welding"**

>  *Rationale*: Welding generates intense localized heat and vibration. The tool remains stationary, and material flow is zero, which is typical in welding operations where two parts are joined in place. The high energy consumption and temperature confirm this.

>  Note: Although only one event is shown, it is a **distinct, isolated peak** suggesting a single welding event. In a real process, welding might be a discrete step.

---

###  Phase 5: **Quality Inspection (Events 10–12)**  
- **Events**: 10, 11, 12  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - Temperature: 30  25°C (drops sharply)  
  - Pressure: 1 bar (drops)  
  - Vibration: 1  5 Hz (low)  
  - Material Flow: 0  1 unit/s (small increase)  
  - Tool Position: 15  20 mm (tool moves slightly)  
  - Energy: 1.00  1.60 kWh (modest rise)  
- **Interpretation**:  
  After welding, the system cools down. Vibration and temperature drop significantly. Material flow resumes slowly. Tool position shifts slightly (from 15 to 20 mm), possibly indicating a probe or sensor movement during inspection.  
-  **Label**: **"Quality Inspection"**

>  *Rationale*: The drop in vibration and temperature, along with low energy and minimal flow, fits an inspection phase. Tool movement may be used to scan or verify weld integrity. The gradual return to baseline supports this being a non-destructive check.

---

###  Phase 6: **Machine Idle / Return to Preparation (Events 13–15)**  
- **Events**: 13, 14, 15  
- **Sensor Pattern**:  
  - All values return to baseline:  
    - Temp: 20–21°C  
    - Press: 1 bar  
    - Vibration: 0  
    - Flow: 0  
    - Tool: 0 mm  
    - Energy: ~0.40–0.50 kWh  
- **Interpretation**:  
  The machine returns to a **standby state** after completing the process. This suggests a cycle is complete and the machine is ready for the next batch.  
-  **Label**: **"Machine Idle / Return to Preparation"**

>  *Rationale*: Full return to initial conditions indicates the end of a process cycle. This is a recurring pattern in manufacturing lines.

##  Process Flow Inferred

Based on the sequence, the inferred process flow is:

> **Idle  Cutting Metal  Assembling Parts  Welding  Quality Inspection  Idle (Ready for next cycle)**

This reflects a **common sequence in metal fabrication**:
1. Cut raw material to size
2. Assemble parts
3. Join them via welding
4. Inspect weld quality
5. Return to idle

##  Final Answer: Labeled Activities with Rationale

###  1. **Machine Idle / Preparation**  
**Events**: 1–3  
**Rationale**: All sensor values remain at baseline. No material flow, zero vibration, and minimal energy use. This indicates the machine is in a pre-operational state, ready to begin the manufacturing process.

###  2. **Cutting Metal**  
**Events**: 4–6  
**Rationale**: A sharp increase in temperature, vibration, material flow, and energy consumption occurs. High vibration and rising temperature are typical of cutting operations involving mechanical tools in contact with material.

###  3. **Assembling Parts**  
**Events**: 7–8  
**Rationale**: Tool is held at a fixed position, vibration and flow are moderate, and energy is stable. This suggests a positioning or joining step where parts are aligned or placed together, consistent with assembly.

###  4. **Welding**  
**Event**: 9  
**Rationale**: Exceptionally high temperature (80°C) and vibration (50 Hz), zero material flow, and peak energy consumption indicate a localized, high-heat process like welding. The tool remains stationary, which is typical for welding.

###  5. **Quality Inspection**  
**Events**: 10–12  
**Rationale**: A rapid drop in temperature and vibration, with a slight increase in tool movement and material flow, suggests a non-invasive inspection phase. The system is cooling down and scanning components.

###  6. **Machine Idle / Return to Preparation**  
**Events**: 13–15  
**Rationale**: All sensor values revert to initial baseline conditions. This signals the completion of the process cycle and the machine’s readiness to begin a new batch.

##  Conclusion

By applying **pattern recognition** and **sensor-based process mining**, we have successfully inferred a **structured manufacturing process** from raw numeric sensor data. The key insight is that **distinct operational phases** emerge from **changes in multiple sensor variables**, especially when temperature, vibration, flow, and energy are analyzed together.

This approach demonstrates the power of **process mining** in transforming raw operational data into actionable, human-readable process models — enabling better process optimization, fault detection, and workflow improvement in manufacturing environments.
