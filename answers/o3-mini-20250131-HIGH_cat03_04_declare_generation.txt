Below is one possible answer. In this example we assume that every activity must occur (an existence constraint), that the process always starts with idea generation (the init constraint), and that certain “gate‐keeping” events (such as Approval Gate and Final Launch) occur exactly once. In addition, we model the “flow” of the process with binary constraints. (Note that for binary constraints the keys are given as tuples of activities representing, for example, a response “if A then eventually B”. You may represent these keys differently if needed.)

### Explanation

- **Unary constraints:**  
  – **existence** enforces that every activity (IG, DD, TFC, etc.) appears at least once.  
  – **exactly_one** specifies that AG and FL occur exactly once.  
  – **init** fixes IG as the starting point.

- **Binary constraints:**  
  – **response** (e.g. `("DD", "TFC")`) states that if the Design Draft (DD) occurs then a Technical Feasibility Check (TFC) must follow sometime later.  
  – **precedence** ensures that an activity (e.g. TFC) is only allowed if its predecessor (DD) has already occurred.  
  – Additional constraints such as **chainresponse** or **nonchainsuccession** provide further restrictions (e.g. immediate succession or prohibition of certain follow‐ups).

This dictionary is just one valid way to encode a DECLARE model for the multi‐department product design and launch process. You may adjust the pairs and confidence values according to your exact process knowledge and analysis goals.
