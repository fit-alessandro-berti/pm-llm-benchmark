Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (first) and the 'unprotected' group (second):

1. **Initial Registration Point**:
   - Protected Group: Most patients initially register at Emergency Room (ER) (284 + 179 + 174 + ... = 635 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Most patients initially register at First Department (FD) or directly undergo Expert Examination (1466 + 1418 + 656 + ... = 3598 cases).

2. **Expert Examination**:
   - Protected Group: Expert Examination is less frequent and often follows registration (78 + 73 + 51 + ... = 253 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Expert Examination is more common and often the first step after registration or even before registration (1466 + 1418 + 190 + ... = 3162 cases).

3. **Thorough Examination**:
   - Protected Group: Thorough Examination is less frequent and usually follows Expert Examination (78 + 40 + 19 + ... = 137 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Thorough Examination is more common and often follows Expert Examination or is the first step after registration (656 + 192 + 100 + ... = 948 cases).

4. **Treatment Success**:
   - Protected Group: Treatment successful outcome is reported less frequently, with many variants involving treatment unsuccessful followed by repeated diagnosis and treatment (e.g., 40 + 22 + 16 + ... = 78 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Treatment successful outcome is reported more frequently, with fewer variants involving treatment unsuccessful (e.g., 505 + 279 + 262 + ... = 1346 cases).

5. **Process Length**:
   - Protected Group: Longer processes are more common, involving multiple diagnosis and treatment steps before successful outcome or discharge (e.g., 48 + 40 + 22 + ... = 100 cases).
   - Unprotected Group: Shorter processes are more common, with fewer steps between registration and successful outcome or discharge (e.g., 505 + 279 + 262 + ... = 1346 cases).

6. **Discharge without Treatment**:
   - Protected Group: Some variants involve discharge without treatment (e.g., Register at ER/ FD with frequency 158, 156).
   - Unprotected Group: Discharge without treatment is not reported in any variant.

These differences suggest that the 'unprotected' group may receive more specialized and thorough care earlier in their process, leading to more successful treatments and shorter overall processes. The 'protected' group, on the other hand, might face longer processes with more steps before reaching a successful outcome or discharge.
