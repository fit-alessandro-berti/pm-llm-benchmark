This solution requires several steps involving CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to correctly chain the logic: variant identification, frequency ranking, selection of top K cases, and final event retrieval.

We will use the DuckDB function `STRING_AGG(expression ORDER BY ordering_expression)` which is essential for step 1.

Let $K$ be the desired number of top variants (e.g., $K=3$).

```sql
-- Define K (e.g., K=3 for the top 3 variants)
-- In a real environment, K would likely be passed as a parameter or defined here.
-- For demonstration, we set K_VALUE = 3.
WITH K_SETTING AS (
    SELECT 3 AS K_VALUE
),

-- 1. Determine the ordered sequence (process variant) for each case
CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        -- Concatenate activities ordered by timestamp to form the variant sequence
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- 2. Group cases by variant and count frequencies
VariantCounts AS (
    SELECT
        process_variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS variant_frequency
    FROM CaseVariants
    GROUP BY process_variant
),

-- 3. Identify the set of case_ids belonging to the Top K variants
TopKCaseIDs AS (
    SELECT
        cv.case_id
    FROM CaseVariants cv
    JOIN VariantCounts vc ON cv.process_variant = vc.process_variant
    CROSS JOIN K_SETTING ks
    ORDER BY vc.variant_frequency DESC
    -- Filter down to only the cases associated with the top K variants
    LIMIT (
        SELECT SUM(count) FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(process_variant) as count
            FROM VariantCounts
            ORDER BY variant_frequency DESC
            LIMIT ks.K_VALUE
        )
    )
)

-- 4. Return all original events belonging only to cases in the Top K variants
SELECT
    el.* -- Selects all columns from the original event_log
FROM event_log el
JOIN TopKCaseIDs tki ON el.case_id = tki.case_id
ORDER BY 
    el.case_id, 
    el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation of the Limiting Logic (Step 3 Detail):

Since we need to filter based on the *rank* of the variant, not just the first $K$ rows encountered, the limiting logic in `TopKCaseIDs` ensures we capture all cases whose associated variant made it into the top $K$ by frequency:

1.  We join `CaseVariants` (which links `case_id` to `process_variant`) with `VariantCounts` (which provides the frequency).
2.  We use `ORDER BY vc.variant_frequency DESC`.
3.  The `LIMIT` clause is constructed dynamically to select exactly enough rows to cover all cases belonging to the top $K$ unique variants, based on the frequency ranking established in `VariantCounts`. (A slightly simpler, but less robust way if variants have the *exact same frequency* near the cutoff boundary, is to simply limit the variants first, then join the cases, as shown in the initial thought process. The final query structure above achieves the filtering based on the rank derived from the counts.)

**A more idiomatic and often cleaner way to handle the Top K filter in SQL (especially if we assume $K$ is defined and we don't need complex tied frequency handling beyond simple sorting):**

If we prioritize simplicity and assume standard sorting rules apply for the top $K$ variants:

```sql
WITH K_SETTING AS (
    SELECT 3 AS K_VALUE -- K = 3
),
CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
TopKVariants AS (
    -- Identify the actual strings of the top K variants
    SELECT
        process_variant
    FROM CaseVariants
    GROUP BY process_variant
    ORDER BY COUNT(case_id) DESC
    LIMIT (SELECT K_VALUE FROM K_SETTING)
)
-- 4. Return all original events belonging only to cases matching those variants
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN CaseVariants cv ON el.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN TopKVariants tkv ON cv.process_variant = tkv.process_variant
ORDER BY 
    el.case_id, 
    el.timestamp;
```
