### **Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log**

The standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process generally follows a structured sequence:  

1. **Create Purchase Requisition** â†’  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition** â†’  
3. **Issue Purchase Order** â†’  
4. **Receive Goods** â†’  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received** â†’  
6. **Match Invoice to PO** â†’  
7. **Release Payment** â†’  
8. **Close Case**  

However, in this event log, several cases exhibit deviations from this standard process flow that could indicate control weaknesses, process inefficiencies, or potential fraud. Below are the identified anomalies:

---

### **ðŸ”´ Case 1002: Payment Before Approval & Goods Receipt**  
**Anomaly:**
- **Issue Purchase Order occurs before Approve Purchase Requisition** (08:40 vs. 08:00 on Feb 1).
- **Vendor Invoice is received before Goods are received** (Feb 3 vs. Feb 4).
- **Payment is released before both goods are received and invoice matching** (Feb 3 at 07:15 vs. invoice matching on Feb 5).  

**Why Itâ€™s Problematic:**
- Issuing a PO before approval suggests a lack of internal controls, as approvals should validate the need before an order is placed.
- Receiving an invoice before receiving goods can indicate a potential fraudulent or incorrect invoice.
- Paying the invoice before matching it to the PO and confirming receipt of goods increases the risk of overpayments, duplicate payments, or even payments for undelivered goods.

### **ðŸ”´ Case 1003: Payment Before Invoice is Received**  
**Anomaly:**
- **Payment is released before the Vendor Invoice is received** (Feb 8 vs. Feb 9).
- Goods are received after the payment is released (Feb 10 vs. Feb 8).  

**Why Itâ€™s Problematic:**
- Releasing payment before receiving the invoice can indicate weak financial controls and risks paying incorrect amounts.
- Payment before goods receipt may lead to financial exposure if the vendor fails to deliver as expected.

---

### **ðŸ”´ Case 1004: Goods Received Before PO Issued**  
**Anomaly:**
- **Goods are received before the PO is issued** (Goods received on Feb 6 at 09:00, but the PO is only issued at 09:15).  

**Why Itâ€™s Problematic:**
- Normally, a purchase order should be issued **before** the vendor ships the goods to ensure the order is authorized and tracked properly.
- Receiving goods before issuing a PO suggests informal purchasing practices, potentially leading to unapproved or unauthorized spending.
- This could indicate a "maverick buying" scenario, where purchases are made outside of the formal procurement process.

### **Key Takeaways & Risks Identified**
| Anomaly Type | Cases Affected | Risk / Issue |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Payment before invoice is received | 1003 | Risk of paying incorrect or fraudulent invoices |
| Payment before goods receipt | 1002, 1003 | Risk of paying for undelivered goods |
| PO issued before requisition is approved | 1002 | Lack of procurement control and policy violations |
| Goods received before PO is issued | 1004 | Unapproved spending and potential compliance violations |

### **Recommendations**
1. **Enforce Approval Workflows** â†’ Ensure no PO is issued without an approved requisition.
2. **Implement Invoice Verification** â†’ Payments should not be made before invoices are received and matched to both PO and goods receipt.
3. **Strengthen Controls on Payment Processing** â†’ Payment should only be released **after** invoice validation and goods receipt.
4. **Monitor & Audit Transactions Regularly** â†’ Detect and correct process deviations to avoid financial losses or compliance risks.

These anomalies indicate potential risks in the procurement process, such as unauthorized purchases, financial mismanagement, or fraud. Addressing these issues will help ensure a compliant and efficient P2P workflow.
