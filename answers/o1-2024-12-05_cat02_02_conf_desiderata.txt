Below is a detailed analysis of each case in terms of both the strict normative requirements and the more lenient desiderata.

---

**1. Normative Rule Violations**

- **Case 1:**
  - **Activities:** Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
  - **Check Against Normative Rules:**
    - All required activities occur in the correct order:
      - Credit Check before Risk Assessment ✔  
      - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision ✔  
      - Loan Decision before Informing the Applicant ✔  
      - Approved case includes Finalize Documentation before Close Case ✔
    - No steps are skipped, and the order is strictly followed.
    - **Conclusion:** Case 1 fully complies with all normative constraints.

- **Case 2:**
  - **Activities:** Application Received → Risk Assessment → Credit Check → Loan Decision (Rejected) → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
  - **Check Against Normative Rules:**
    - The Risk Assessment occurs **before** the Credit Check. This violates the requirement that the Credit Check must be performed prior to the Risk Assessment.
    - The Loan Decision is Rejected, but Finalize Documentation is performed afterward. This directly contradicts the rule that Finalize Documentation should not occur in rejected cases.
    - **Conclusion:** Case 2 violates the normative rules in two ways:
      1. Incorrect sequence (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
      2. Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.

- **Case 3:**
  - **Activities:** Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
  - **Check Against Normative Rules:**
    - The sequence is correct:
      - Credit Check occurs before Risk Assessment ✔  
      - Risk Assessment occurs before Loan Decision ✔  
      - Loan Decision before Informing Applicant ✔  
      - For an approved case, Finalize Documentation before Closing ✔
    - No contradictory actions (no finalization after rejection, etc.).
    - **Conclusion:** Case 3 meets all normative sequence requirements.

**Summary of Normative Violations:**
- **Case 1:** No violations.
- **Case 2:** Violates normative rules (order of activities, finalizing documentation after rejection).
- **Case 3:** No normative violations.

**2. Desiderata (Non-Strict) Deviations**

The desiderata include preferred timing for certain activities and a suggestion to perform a Follow-up Call, but these are not strict rules. Deviations from these do not constitute serious violations, merely suboptimal behavior.

- **Case 1:**
  - **Recommended Timing Checks:**
    - Credit Check after Application Received: Completed within 30 minutes—well within the recommended 24-hour window.
    - Inform Applicant after Decision: Informed at 13:00 on the same day as the decision (11:00). That is a 2-hour gap, well within the suggested 48-hour window.
  - **Follow-up Call:** Not mentioned, but not mandatory.
  - **Conclusion:** Case 1 meets all the timing recommendations and does not deviate from desiderata.

- **Case 2:**
  - Although normative rules are broken here, let’s note the desiderata:
    - The Credit Check was performed at 09:00 after an 08:00 application. This is timely.
    - The Loan Decision was made at 09:30 and presumably the applicant could have been informed soon after, had the sequence been correct. Actual outcome is overshadowed by normative violations.
    - No mention of a Follow-up Call, but again, this is not mandatory.
  - **Conclusion:** Given the severe normative violations, the desiderata are a secondary concern here. The timing for activities that did occur was generally prompt, so no clear desiderata violations stand out other than lack of a follow-up call (which is non-mandatory and not serious).

- **Case 3:**
  - **Recommended Timing Checks:**
    - Credit Check occurred on 2024-01-14 10:00, while the application was received on 2024-01-12 09:00. This is approximately 2 days (over 48 hours) after receipt. The recommendation was to do the Credit Check within 24 hours, so this is a deviation from the desiderata.
    - Inform Applicant occurred on 2024-01-16 15:00, whereas the Loan Decision was made on 2024-01-14 12:00. That’s a delay of about 2 days (48+ hours) to inform the applicant, which exceeds the recommended 48-hour timeframe.
  - **Follow-up Call:** None was performed before closing the case. While recommended, it’s not mandatory.
  - **Conclusion:** Case 3 meets all normative requirements but does not adhere to the timing recommendations. It took longer than preferred for both the Credit Check and the Applicant Notification. Also, the suggested Follow-up Call was not done.

**Summary of Desiderata Deviations:**
- **Case 1:** No desiderata issues.
- **Case 2:** Lack of a follow-up call is a minor deviation, but overshadowed by normative violations. Otherwise, timing seems fine.
- **Case 3:** Delayed Credit Check (beyond 24 hours), delayed Inform Applicant (beyond 48 hours), and no Follow-up Call. All are minor, non-critical issues.

**3. Interpretations and Justifications**

- **Case 1:**  
  This case followed the textbook process. One might interpret that this case experienced no resource constraints or communication delays. The timely completion of all steps suggests a smooth, well-executed process.

- **Case 2:**  
  The early Risk Assessment might reflect a scenario where an eager risk analyst started the evaluation before the formal Credit Check results were ready. This could happen if the team assumed the credit report was known or if there was a misunderstanding of the standard procedure. The finalization of documentation after a rejection could indicate confusion, an administrative error, or a lack of clarity about the proper termination steps in the workflow.

- **Case 3:**  
  The delays in the Credit Check and informing the applicant might be due to workload bottlenecks, holidays, staff shortages, or technical issues that slowed down the process. The absence of a Follow-up Call might be due to shifting priorities, assuming the applicant’s understanding, or lack of resources to conduct the call. Although these are not severe rule violations, they illustrate less-than-ideal efficiency and responsiveness.

**Final Overview:**

- **Normative Compliance:**
  - Case 1: Compliant
  - Case 2: Non-compliant (sequence/order violation, finalization after rejection)
  - Case 3: Compliant

- **Desiderata Compliance:**
  - Case 1: Optimal timing and optional steps
  - Case 2: Timing acceptable, no follow-up call, but overshadowed by normative issues
  - Case 3: Delayed actions and no follow-up call, indicating non-optimal yet not rule-breaking performance

These observations underscore the importance of distinguishing between strict normative rules (where violations are serious) and desiderata (where deviations are more about missed opportunities for optimal performance rather than breaking the fundamental process structure).
