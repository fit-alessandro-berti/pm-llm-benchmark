Based on the directly-follows graphs provided, this appears to be a logistics process involving the transportation of containers. Here's my interpretation of the main flow:

1. The process typically starts with registering a customer order, which leads to creating a transport document.

2. After the transport document is created:
   - Vehicles are booked
   - Empty containers are ordered
   - Empty containers are picked up

3. There's a goods handling phase where:
   - Goods are collected and loaded onto trucks
   - Multiple handling units can be loaded onto a truck
   - Trucks drive to a terminal

4. At the terminal, containers go through several steps:
   - Containers are weighed
   - They can be placed in stock (storage)
   - They are brought to a loading bay
   - They are loaded onto vehicles (likely for further transport)

5. Forklifts are used throughout the terminal operations for:
   - Moving containers between storage and loading bay
   - Assisting with loading/unloading
   - Moving containers for weighing

6. Finally, vehicles depart with the loaded containers

There are also some exception handling procedures:
- Containers can be rescheduled
- Vehicles can be rebooked
- Some containers may bypass storage and go directly from weighing to loading bay

The process seems to be a typical container logistics operation, possibly at a port or inland terminal, handling the movement of containers from collection of goods to final departure for delivery.
