The image is a **processmining style flow map** showing how different business objects move through a procurement / sales / return workflow.  

**Main elements**
- **Five object types** at the top (each with a count of items):  
  *VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M), ReturnOrderItem (0.8M), PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M), SalesOrderItem (3.5M), PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M).*  
  Each object type starts at an oval **“Start”** node.

- **Activity boxes** (rounded rectangles) show steps in the process with an **overall frequency** in millions.  
  Examples: *Create Requisition (3.0M), Approve Requisition (5.7M), Create Order (8.5M), Pack Goods, Ship Goods, Confirm Delivery, Close Order, Send Order, Check Stock, Process Return, Approve Payment, Create Invoice.*

- **Colored dots and lines** indicate which object types are involved in each step.  
  Each arrow is labeled with an **average time (ms)** between activities.

**Flow structure**
- **Requisition/invoice path:**  
  *PurchaseRequisitionItem  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition *  
  branching into **Send Order**, **Check Stock**, **Process Return**, **Approve Payment**, **Create Invoice  End**.  
  Vendor invoices and return orders also feed into *Approve Requisition* and *Process Return*.

- **Order fulfillment path:**  
  *SalesOrderItem/PurchaseOrderItem  Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order  End.*  
  Returns can also feed into *Close Order*.

- **Multiple end points** at the bottom show the completion of different object flows.

**In short:**  
It’s a colorcoded, multiobject workflow diagram showing how requisitions, orders, invoices, and returns move through various activities, with volumes and average transition times labeled on each step.
