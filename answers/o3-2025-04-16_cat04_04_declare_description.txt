Below is one way the process would typically unfold if every constraint contained in the DECLARE model is respected.  The wording is intentionally “operational”: it tells the story as a case officer, a risk manager and the IT system would see it, while at the same time pointing out which constraint is doing the policing in the background.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Receive Application  - the mandatory starting point  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – existence + init: the case cannot start with anything else, and the event must appear at least once.  
   • Business logic  
     – Every loan needs a formally logged application for auditability and to trigger the downstream workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Preliminary Credit Check – and only one of them  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – response(Receive Application  Preliminary Credit Check): the check is guaranteed to happen after the intake.  
     – exactly_one: it happens exactly once, preventing “shopping” for better results or data drift.  
   • Business logic  
     – A single, authoritative credit score is taken so that subsequent decisions all use the same risk picture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Authorize Contract Terms – immediately after the credit check  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – chainprecedence(Authorize Contract Terms, Preliminary Credit Check): every Authorize Contract Terms must be immediately preceded by the credit check.  
       (In practice this means the credit analyst signs off and the authorisation screen pops up right afterwards—no other steps allowed in-between that could taint the risk view.)  
   • Business logic  
     – Ensures the person/company signing the terms has the freshest credit information in front of them, limiting exposure to rapid credit deterioration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Gather Additional Documents – after the credit check and before quality gates  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – succession(Preliminary Credit Check  Gather Additional Documents): gathering cannot start before the credit check finishes.  
     – coexistence(Gather Additional Documents  Authorize Contract Terms): once you start collecting documents you are implicitly promising the customer that an authorisation decision will eventually be produced, and vice-versa.  
   • Business logic  
     – Prevents staff from requesting documents on applications that were never viable, reducing customer frustration and internal workload.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Quality Assurance Review – must co-occur with, and is followed by, the offer assembly  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – altsuccession(Gather Additional Documents  Quality Assurance Review): every case in which documents are gathered will eventually be inspected by QA.  
     – precedence(Quality Assurance Review  Authorize Contract Terms): QA is not allowed to step in until the contractual wording has an owner (the authorising officer).  
     – chainsuccession(Quality Assurance Review  Assemble Loan Offer Package): the very next step, with no gap, is to package the offer exactly as approved.  
   • Business logic  
     – Prevents “drift” between what was authorised and what is communicated to the customer; the one-to-one hand-off is an important Sarbanes-Oxley style control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Assemble Loan Offer Package – immediately before funds can flow  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – responded_existence(Assemble Loan Offer Package  Quality Assurance Review): assembling an offer without a QA review somewhere in the case is forbidden.  
     – chainresponse(Assemble Loan Offer Package  Transfer Funds): once the package is generated, the next step must be the disbursement—no extra, possibly compromising, activities in between.  
   • Business logic  
     – Keeps the time window between final document generation and funding as small as possible, so that nothing can invalidate the offer (rate change, new risk info, etc.).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Transfer Funds – but never in parallel with receiving the application  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – noncoexistence(Transfer Funds, Receive Application): the system makes absolutely sure the two events never overlap in time (think of two different work items).  
     – altresponse(Transfer Funds  Notify Customer): every funding must ultimately be followed by customer notification, although not necessarily immediately.  
   • Business logic  
     – Eliminates any possibility that staff record “funds transferred” while the application is still open in the first data-entry screen—an accounting-control requirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Notify Customer – the formal close-out  
   • Constraint(s) involved  
     – altprecedence(Notify Customer  Transfer Funds): notification is not allowed unless (at some point earlier) funds have actually been released.  
     – nonsuccession(Notify Customer ¬ Preliminary Credit Check): once the customer has been told the outcome, the case cannot revert to doing another credit check.  
     – nonchainsuccession(Authorize Contract Terms ¬· Notify Customer): a QA or funding step must sit between authorisation and telling the customer, avoiding premature communication.  
   • Business logic  
     – Guarantees customers only receive definitive, accurate information backed by actual money movement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Forbidden activity  
   • absence(Proceed Without Compliance): the activity is “black-listed”; if it occurs, the trace is invalid.  
   • Business logic  
     – This represents any shortcut that bypasses mandatory KYC/AML or regulatory checks. Its outright prohibition is the strongest possible compliance guardrail.

====================================================================
Why these rules exist (business perspective)

1. Regulatory compliance  
   – Credit-related legislation (e.g., FDIC, ECB guidelines) demands auditable proof of risk assessment, document retention, and proper sequencing.

2. Fraud prevention and risk management  
   – Exactly-one credit check and immediate authorisation prevent “credit shopping” and minimise the window for identity fraud.

3. Operational efficiency & data quality  
   – Chain-based constraints (chainprecedence, chainsuccession, chainresponse) compress critical hand-offs so that no manual “parking” or duplicate work can sneak in.

4. Customer experience  
   – By forcing QA before the offer is assembled and funds are disbursed right after, the customer sees a smooth, timely process with few ‘dead periods’.

5. Governance & auditability  
   – Non-coexistence and non-succession rules stop staff from mixing incompatible stages or backtracking after a formal communication, making deviations easy to detect.

====================================================================
What could go wrong if the rules are violated?

• Skipping the Preliminary Credit Check  
  – Funds could be released to an insolvent borrower, triggering write-offs and regulatory sanctions.

• Gather Additional Documents before the credit check  
  – Wastes customer time and may expose the bank to accusations of unfair data harvesting.

• Quality Assurance Review after funds transfer  
  – Any discovered defect would require costly claw-backs and damage customer trust.

• Notifying the customer before funds are really available  
  – Leads to embarrassing reversals, potential legal claims, and reputational loss.

• Running “Proceed Without Compliance”  
  – Direct violation of AML/KYC; can result in multi-million dollar fines or loss of banking licence.

• Transferring funds while still ‘receiving’ the application (breaking noncoexistence)  
  – Creates reconciliation nightmares and breaks the four-eyes principle separating initiation from execution.

====================================================================
In short, the DECLARE constraints act like an invisible compliance officer: they do not prescribe one rigid flowchart but they make sure every admissible execution is safe, auditable and customer-friendly.
