Below is a plainlanguage walkthrough of the loanapproval process that is implicitly defined by the DECLARE rules you supplied.  I start with the “happypath” sequence that is forced by the strongest constraints and then explain, one by one, how the remaining constraints police the flow, why a bank would want each rule, and what could go wrong if a rule were violated.


1.  Happypath sequence enforced by the rules

Step 1 – Receive Application  
•  Must be the first activity (init).  
•  It is guaranteed to occur at least once (existence).

Step 2 – Preliminary Credit Check  
•  Required after each application (response from Receive Application).  
•  Must occur exactly once in the whole case (exactly_one).  
•  Nothing is allowed to happen between Authorize Contract Terms and the *immediately* preceding activity, which must be this credit check (chainprecedence).

Step 3 – Gather Additional Documents  
•  Must eventually follow every credit check (succession).  
•  If it happens, Authorize Contract Terms must also happen in the same case and viceversa (coexistence).

Step 4 – Quality Assurance Review  
•  Altsuccession says every “Gather Additional Documents” must *eventually* be followed by either “Quality Assurance Review” or something else, but chainlevel constraints tighten this to the specific order shown below.

Step 5 – Assemble Loan Offer Package  
•  Every Quality Assurance Review must be *immediately* followed by Assemble Loan Offer Package (chainsuccession).  
•  Assemble Loan Offer Package itself obliges the occurrence of a QA Review somewhere in the case (responded_existence). Because of the previous bullet, that QA Review will actually be the event that appears immediately before.

Step 6 – Transfer Funds  
•  Must occur *immediately* after every Assemble Loan Offer Package (chainresponse).  
•  Transfer Funds and Receive Application are declared noncoexistent, meaning Transfer Funds can only happen in cases where the initial application has already been consumed; functionally this blocks an accidental second “Receive Application” after funds are wired.

Step 7 – Notify Customer  
•  There is an alternativeresponse/precedence pair between Transfer Funds and Notify Customer:  
  – altresponse: every Transfer Funds eventually leads to a Notify Customer, *or* to some alternative closing activity (none is defined, so Notify Customer becomes mandatory).  
  – altprecedence: Notify Customer can only occur if Transfer Funds (or an alternative) happened before.  
•  nonsuccession additionally states that once the customer is notified, the process is finished; a new Preliminary Credit Check may not follow.

Forbidden activity – Proceed Without Compliance  
•  Marked “absence.”  It must never occur; doing so would violate compliance policy.


2.  How each constraint protects the business

1.  init + existence (Receive Application)  
    •  Guarantees that every case is a genuine customer request, preventing “orphan” backoffice work that is not tied to a real demand.

2.  response (Receive Application  Preliminary Credit Check)  
    •  Blocks anyone from pushing a file forward without at least a basic risk assessment—crucial for fraud control and regulatory KYC/AML duties.

3.  exactly_one (Preliminary Credit Check)  
    •  Stops conflicting credit scores from being generated and keeps the risk profile consistent with what was actually approved.

4.  succession (Preliminary Credit Check  Gather Additional Documents)  
    •  Ensures that if the bank needs more evidence to validate income or identity, it is collected before money is put on the table.

5.  coexistence (Gather Additional Documents  Authorize Contract Terms)  
    •  Tethers document gathering to final approval: if you needed more paperwork, you can’t close the deal until the underwriter has reauthorised based on that paperwork.

6.  chainsuccession (Quality Assurance Review  Assemble Loan Offer Package)  
    •  Makes QA and package assembly backtoback, reducing the window in which an alreadychecked file could be altered unnoticed.

7.  precedence (Quality Assurance Review  Authorize Contract Terms)  
    •  No contract can be authorised unless QA signed off first—mirrors the “foureyes” principle used by most regulators.

8.  chainprecedence (Authorize Contract Terms immediately preceded by Preliminary Credit Check)  
    •  Forces the credit decision data to be fresh at the exact moment of authorisation—important in volatile credit environments.

9.  chainresponse (Assemble Loan Offer Package  Transfer Funds)  
    •  Prevents lastminute edits between the final offer and disbursement; the customer gets exactly what was approved.

10. altresponse + altprecedence (Transfer Funds  Notify Customer)  
    •  Guarantees that customers are informed promptly after money is disbursed, but allows additional alternative closing steps (e.g., internal ledger postings) if the bank chooses to add them later.

11. nonsuccession (Notify Customer not followed by Preliminary Credit Check)  
    •  Declares the process closed; no new creditrelated work may sneak in after the customer has been told the deal is done.

12. noncoexistence (Transfer Funds with Receive Application)  
    •  Effectively bans a second “Receive Application” event in the same case once funds have moved, blocking double funding under one caseID.

13. nonchainsuccession (Authorize Contract Terms not immediately followed by Notify Customer)  
    •  Ensures there is at least one operational step (Transfer Funds) after authorisation before the customer hears back, preventing the nightmare scenario where a customer is promised money that backoffice systems then fail to release.

14. absence (Proceed Without Compliance)  
    •  A hard stop: any occurrence would expose the bank to fines or licence suspension, so systems typically disable the button entirely.


3.  What could go wrong if rules are broken?

•  Skipping Preliminary Credit Check  
  – Approving highrisk borrowers unintentionally; later chargeoffs, higher capital requirements, reputational damage.

•  Gathering documents before doing a credit check  
  – Wasted customer effort if the applicant is obviously unqualified; poor customer satisfaction, unnecessary data exposure.

•  Transferring funds before QA or Authorisation  
  – Breach of internal controls, immediate financial loss, potential clawback problems, reportable incidents to regulators.

•  Not notifying the customer after funding  
  – Creates service confusion; the customer may be unaware of payment schedules or even of the fact that the loan exists, increasing legal disputes.

•  Allowing “Proceed Without Compliance”  
  – Direct violation of laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, GDPR, AML statutes; heavy fines, personal liability for executives.

•  Rerunning a credit check after notifying the customer  
  – Could result in inconsistent data between customer documentation and bank records, leading to legal challenges if terms are changed retroactively.


4.  Summary

The DECLARE model encodes both business logic (e.g., “always do a credit check”) and microordering requirements (e.g., “QA Review must sit directly in front of Assemble Loan Offer Package”).  Together these rules create a compliant, auditable, and customerfriendly process that:

1. Starts only with a bona fide loan request,  
2. Assesses risk exactly once and at the right time,  
3. Collects documentation before granting credit,  
4. Subjects the offer to a fresh, independent quality review,  
5. Immediately disburses the approved amount, and  
6. Closes the loop by informing the customer—never skipping compliance or backtracking into earlier stages.

Breaking any of these rules undermines risk management, operational efficiency, or regulatory standing; hence the constraints are not mere technicalities but safeguards for both the bank and its customers.
