The **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** process is a well-defined business process that typically follows a logical sequence of steps, ensuring proper controls, compliance, and efficiency. The standard P2P flow generally includes the following steps in this order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods/Services**  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
6. **Match Invoice to PO and Requisition (Three-way match)**  
7. **Approve Payment (if needed)**  
8. **Release Payment**  
9. **Close Case**  

Now, let's analyze the provided event logs and identify **anomalies** or **unusual sequences** that deviate from this standard.

## **Case ID: 1001**  
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

 **No anomalies found.**  
This follows the standard P2P process flow correctly.

## **Case ID: 1002**  
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. **Issue Purchase Order** *(Before approval)*  
3. Vendor Invoice Received  
4. Release Payment  
5. **Approve Purchase Requisition** *(After PO issuance and payment)*  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case  

###  **Anomalies identified:**
1. **Issue Purchase Order before Approval**:  
   - This is a **critical deviation** from the standard P2P process.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - Approvals are a key control to ensure that the purchase is authorized, within budget, and aligned with organizational policies.  
     - Issuing a PO without approval could lead to **unauthorized spending**, **fraud**, or **budget overruns**.  
     - This may also indicate **lack of internal controls** or **process bypassing**.

2. **Payment released before receiving goods and matching the invoice**:  
   - Payment is released **before** receiving the goods and before the invoice is matched to the PO.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - This skips the **three-way match** (requisition, PO, and invoice), which is a critical step to ensure that the invoice corresponds to the actual goods received and the original purchase request.  
     - This could result in **overpayment**, **duplicate payments**, or **payment for goods not received**.

3. **Approving the purchase requisition after payment and receiving goods**:  
   - This is **logically inconsistent**.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - Approval should happen **before** the PO is issued and the goods are received.  
     - Approving after the fact undermines the **integrity of the approval process** and may be a sign of **backdating** or **process mismanagement**.

## **Case ID: 1003**  
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. **Release Payment** *(Before receiving goods and invoice)*  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case  

###  **Anomalies identified:**
1. **Payment released before receiving goods and invoice**:  
   - Payment is issued **before** the invoice is received and **before** the goods are delivered.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - This skips the **three-way match**, which is essential to confirm that the invoice corresponds to the actual goods received and the original purchase request.  
     - This could result in **payment for goods not received** or **overpayment**.  
     - It may also be a sign of **lack of controls** or **intentional fraud**.

## **Case ID: 1004**  
**Sequence:**
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. **Receive Goods** *(Before PO issuance)*  
4. **Issue Purchase Order** *(After goods received)*  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

###  **Anomalies identified:**
1. **Receive Goods before issuing PO**:  
   - This is **not a standard practice**.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - A PO is typically issued **before** goods are received to ensure that the purchase is authorized and that the vendor is legally bound to deliver the goods.  
     - Receiving goods before issuing a PO could indicate **unauthorized purchases**, **lack of controls**, or **poor process discipline**.

2. **Issue PO after goods received**:  
   - This is **logically inconsistent** with the standard P2P process.  
   - **Why it's problematic**:  
     - It may suggest that the goods were received without proper authorization, or that the PO was issued as a **retroactive justification** for the purchase.  
     - This could be a **red flag** for **fraud** or **non-compliance**.

##  **Summary of Anomalies Across All Cases:**

| Case ID | Anomaly | Explanation |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1002 | PO issued before approval | Skips critical approval step, increasing risk of fraud and unauthorized spending |
| 1002 | Payment released before receiving goods and matching invoice | Skips three-way match, increasing risk of overpayment or payment for goods not received |
| 1002 | Approval after payment and goods received | Logically inconsistent and undermines approval process |
| 1003 | Payment released before goods received and invoice received | Skips three-way match, increasing risk of overpayment or fraud |
| 1004 | Goods received before PO issued | Unusual and potentially unauthorized; may indicate lack of controls or fraud |

---

##  **Recommendations:**

- **Implement stronger process controls** to ensure that approvals happen before PO issuance.
- **Enforce the three-way match** (requisition, PO, and invoice) before releasing payment.
- **Audit and monitor** for cases where goods are received before a PO is issued.
- **Review internal controls** and ensure that all P2P process steps are followed in the correct order to prevent fraud and errors.

These anomalies suggest that while most of the process steps are present, the **order and sequence** of those steps are often **not in line with best practices**, which can lead to **financial and compliance risks**.
