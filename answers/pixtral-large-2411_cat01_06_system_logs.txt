### Explanation

1. **Case Identification:**
   - Each case represents a logical unit of work, such as editing a specific document, handling an email, or reviewing a PDF. The Case ID is derived from the `Window` attribute in the system log, which identifies the specific document or task being worked on.
   - Transitions between different applications and documents are marked as separate cases to maintain a coherent narrative of user activities.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Raw low-level actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH") are translated into higher-level process steps. For example, "FOCUS" on a document is interpreted as "Start Editing Document," and "TYPING" is simply labeled as "Typing."
   - Actions like "SAVE" and "CLOSE" are directly mapped to "Save Document" and "Close Document," respectively.
   - Switching between applications is labeled as "Switch to [Application/Document]," indicating a transition in the user's workflow.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event includes a **Case ID**, **Activity Name**, and **Timestamp**. Additional attributes such as typed keys, actions, and directions are included where relevant to provide context.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The event log tells a story of user work sessions, starting from editing a document in Microsoft Word, switching to handling emails in Google Chrome, reviewing a PDF in Adobe Acrobat, updating a budget in Microsoft Excel, and returning to editing documents in Microsoft Word.

By following this logic, the event log provides a clear and analyst-friendly representation of user activities, suitable for process mining analysis.
