Below is a structured, end-to-end approach to analyze Speedy Parcels’ operations with process mining and to turn insights into measurable improvements.

1) Process discovery and conformance checking

Data preparation and integration
- Unify identifiers and case notions:
  - Primary case: Vehicle-Day (e.g., V12-20241205) for end-to-end shift flow, including travel, stops, and depot return.
  - Secondary case: Package (Package ID) for parcel-level flow (Scan at Depot  Arrive Customer  Delivery Success/Failed  Reattempts).
  - Maintain links between package and the Vehicle-Day that handled it, and to planned route-stop IDs from dispatch.
- Normalize timestamps and timezones; resolve clock drift:
  - NTP-align sources; fix daylight saving; detect impossible sequences (negative durations).
- Harmonize activity taxonomy and lifecycles:
  - Define canonical activities per lens:
    - Depot: Start Shift, Route Assigned, Depart Depot, Arrive Depot, End Shift.
    - Stop lifecycle: Arrive Customer, Service Start (if available), Delivery Success/Failed, Depart Customer.
    - Driving: Drive Segment (inferred from GPS), Traffic Slowdown/Idle (speed <= threshold with ignition on).
    - Exceptions: Unscheduled Stop, Maintenance Start/End, Breakdown.
- GPS preprocessing and enrichment:
  - Map-match GPS points to road network; derive drive segments, distances, average speeds.
  - Infer parking search/dwell: time within a radius of the customer with low speed before Arrive Customer scan.
  - Enrich with external signals: historic traffic speed profiles, weather, school zones, low emission zones.
- Dispatch integration:
  - Join planned route (ordered stop list with expected arrival times and time windows, capacity, package list) to actual events using stop IDs or geofencing and nearest-timestamp logic.
- Maintenance logs:
  - Join maintenance events to Vehicle-Day; flag overlap with shift; mark breakdowns as blocking interruptions.
- Data quality challenges (and mitigations):
  - Missing or sparse GPS: interpolate cautiously; label uncertainty.
  - Scanner latency: align “Arrive” with GPS proximity; correct obvious handover delays.
  - Duplicates/inconsistent package scans: deduplicate by Package ID and timestamp windows.
  - Multi-stop locations (e.g., high-rises): cluster deliveries at same coordinates; identify floor/time penalties via prolonged service times.

Process discovery
- Choose the right discovery algorithms:
  - Inductive Miner (IMf/IMd) for precise, sound models at Vehicle-Day and Package level.
  - Fuzzy/Simplified heuristics or Split Miner to visualize frequent paths and concurrent behaviors (e.g., mixing deliveries with unscheduled breaks).
- Views to build:
  - Vehicle-Day flow: Start Shift  Route Assigned  [Drive Segment  Arrive Customer  Service  Depart Customer] × N  Return to Depot  End Shift, with exception paths (Failed Delivery, Unscheduled Stop, Maintenance).
  - Package flow: Scan at Depot  Out for Delivery  Arrive  Success/Failed  Reattempt/Return.
  - Travel-service alternation map with performance overlays (median times, 90th percentile).
- Derived composite events:
  - Travel time between consecutive stops (Depart previous  Arrive next).
  - Parking search time (arrival area entry  Arrive Customer scan).
  - Service time (Arrive  Deliver/Depart).
  - Idle-in-traffic and idle-at-depot time segments.

Conformance checking to planned routes
- Build a reference model from dispatch:
  - Activity sequence equals planned stop order, with allowed flexibility (e.g., swaps within a micro-cluster).
  - Planned timing (ETA, time windows), service-duration assumptions, and no unscheduled stops.
- Alignment-based conformance:
  - Compute alignment cost per Vehicle-Day: insertions (unplanned stops), deletions (skipped stops), substitutions (order change), timing penalties (lateness/earliness to windows, large deviations from ETA).
  - Metrics to extract: percent of stops performed in planned order; median stop-order deviation; frequency and duration of unplanned stops; proportion of time outside planned time windows; time lost to exceptions.
- Geospatial conformance:
  - Compare actual path to planned path; quantify detour distance/time; flag systematic rerouting hotspots.

2) Performance analysis and bottleneck identification

KPIs and how to compute them
- On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR): deliveries completed within customer time window / total deliveries with windows. From scanner events and dispatch windows.
- Average Time per Stop: (Arrive  Depart), report median and tail percentiles. From scanner timestamps.
- Travel vs. Service Time Ratio: total driving time / total service time per Vehicle-Day. From GPS-derived drive segments and stop lifecycles.
- Fuel Consumption per km/package:
  - If telematics fuel is available, aggregate directly.
  - Else, estimate using distance, speed profile, and idle time with a vehicle-type-specific model (e.g., base L/100km by speed band; idle burn per hour).
- Vehicle Utilization Rate: productive time (driving + service) / shift time; also capacity utilization (packages or weight delivered / capacity).
- Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration: time in congestion (speed below threshold vs. expected for that segment/time-of-day) / total driving time.
- Failed Delivery Rate: failed stops / total stops; plus reattempt rate and extra km/time due to reattempts.
- Idling Rate and Time: ignition on with speed ~0 outside service intervals / shift time.
- Maintenance Impact: Vehicle-Days impacted by unscheduled maintenance; mean time to repair; breakdowns per 10k km.

Techniques to identify bottlenecks
- Performance overlays on discovered models: highlight edges (travel) and nodes (stops) with high median/95th percentile durations.
- Variant analysis:
  - Compare high-OTDR vs low-OTDR Vehicle-Days, or top vs bottom quartile drivers, vehicles, and routes; identify activity frequency/timing differences (e.g., more unplanned stops, longer parking search).
- Spatiotemporal hotspotting:
  - Hex-bin or road-segment heatmaps for recurrent delay; filter by time-of-day/day-of-week.
- Dotted charts/timelines:
  - Visualize each Vehicle-Day to spot long idle blocks, prolonged service outliers, late depot returns.
- Conformance drivers:
  - Correlate alignment cost with OTDR, fuel per km, overtime; drill down into high-cost cases to see common deviation types.
- Quantification of impact:
  - Attribute the proportion of total delay to categories: traffic, parking search, service variability, failed deliveries, maintenance, unplanned breaks.
  - Compute marginal impact: e.g., if stops at postcodes X add +5 minutes median parking search, quantify weekly time/fuel cost.

3) Root cause analysis for inefficiencies

Likely root causes and how to validate with process mining
- Suboptimal routing (static vs dynamic):
  - Evidence: frequent sequence deviations, high detours in certain periods; significant gap between planned and actual ETA that shrinks when drivers re-sequence stops.
  - Validation: compare conformance by timeslot; simulate historical dynamic routing using observed traffic; A/B variants with lower alignment cost have higher OTDR.
- Inaccurate travel time estimates:
  - Evidence: systematic positive residuals (actual > planned) by corridor/time-of-day.
  - Validation: regress actual segment times on planned times + features (weekday, hour, weather); large bias by cluster indicates outdated matrices.
- Traffic congestion patterns:
  - Evidence: concentrated low-speed periods on specific corridors and hours.
  - Validation: overlay historic traffic speeds; quantify delay vs uncongested baseline; produce weekly profiles.
- High variability in service time at customer locations:
  - Evidence: heavy-tailed ArriveDepart durations for particular customer types/buildings.
  - Validation: cluster stops by land-use, building access, package count/size; compare distributions; identify parking search subcomponent.
- Frequent breakdowns or maintenance needs:
  - Evidence: Unscheduled Stop with engine warnings; rising breakdown rate after certain mileage or duty cycle.
  - Validation: survival analysis (time-to-failure) using mileage, idle ratio, harsh events; hazard spikes signal predictive maintenance opportunity.
- Driver behavior differences:
  - Evidence: idling time, harsh acceleration, parking strategy differences across drivers on similar routes.
  - Validation: compare drivers on matched route archetypes; control for package mix and traffic; use mixed-effects models to isolate driver effect.
- Failed delivery issues:
  - Evidence: high “Customer Not Home” by area/time; high reattempt loops.
  - Validation: correlate time-of-day and notification usage with success; variant comparison where pre-call/SMS sent vs not; quantify reattempt cost (extra km/time).

4) Data-driven optimization strategies

Strategy A: Dynamic routing and ETA recalibration
- Targeted inefficiency: delays from congestion and inaccurate ETAs; detours and overtime.
- Root cause addressed: static routing and stale travel-time matrices.
- Data/process-mining support:
  - Conformance shows frequent re-sequencing and high alignment cost during peak times.
  - Segment residuals identify corridors/time bands with systematic underestimation.
- What to implement:
  - Introduce intra-shift dynamic resequencing when predicted lateness exceeds a threshold (e.g., 10 minutes to next two stops) while respecting time windows, capacity, and legal hours.
  - Continuously recalibrated ETA model using historic observed speeds by segment/time-of-day and weather.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - +5–10% OTDR, -3–7% driving time, -2–5% fuel/km, -15% alignment cost; fewer late depot returns.

Strategy B: Parking-aware stop sequencing and micro-zoning
- Targeted inefficiency: long parking search and variable service times in dense zones.
- Root cause addressed: route order ignores micro-scale access/parking constraints.
- Data/process-mining support:
  - Identified hotspots with high Arrive-area-entry  Arrive scan times; service durations heavy-tailed by blockface.
- What to implement:
  - Build a parking difficulty score per stop from historical dwell and circling patterns; prefer sequences that minimize total parking search during peak curb occupancy.
  - Create micro-territories with known loading zones; embed “curb window” preferences into planning (e.g., deliver to Market St before 9:30).
- Expected KPI impact:
  - -10–20% parking search time, -5–8% average stop time, -3–6% fuel/package in urban cores.

Strategy C: Proactive customer time-window management and communication
- Targeted inefficiency: failed deliveries and reattempt costs.
- Root cause addressed: customers not home; overly tight or misaligned windows; lack of notifications.
- Data/process-mining support:
  - High failed-delivery rate clustered by time-of-day and customer segment; variants with notifications show better first-attempt success.
- What to implement:
  - Predict optimal arrival windows for each customer using historical patterns; offer dynamic day-of delivery slots.
  - Automated pre-arrival SMS with live ETA; enable safe-drop/neighbor authorization where permitted; in-app reschedule if predicted lateness.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - -30–50% failed deliveries, +5–8% OTDR, -2–4% km per package, -10–20% reattempt workload.

Strategy D: Predictive maintenance and vehicle assignment
- Targeted inefficiency: unscheduled stops, breakdowns mid-route, cascading delays.
- Root cause addressed: maintenance based on fixed intervals rather than usage/condition.
- Data/process-mining support:
  - Survival models show increased hazard after certain idle ratios/mileage; Vehicle-Days with warnings have large downstream delay and overtime.
- What to implement:
  - Predict failure risk per vehicle using mileage, duty cycles, idle time, diagnostic codes; schedule maintenance before risk threshold, assign low-risk vehicles to tight-window routes.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - -40–60% unscheduled-maintenance events, +2–4% OTDR, -1–3% fuel from fewer detours/idling; improved vehicle availability.

Strategy E: Targeted driver coaching and SOPs
- Targeted inefficiency: excessive idling, inefficient parking/search tactics, handling time variance.
- Root cause addressed: behavioral differences and lack of micro-SOPs.
- Data/process-mining support:
  - After controlling for route mix, some drivers show 20–30% higher idle and longer service times.
- What to implement:
  - Personalized coaching on idling reduction, approach routes to tough stops, use of loading zones; micro-learning with feedback loops; in-cab nudges when idle > X minutes.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - -15–25% idle time, -5–10% service variance, -2–4% fuel/km; fewer late returns.

5) Operational constraints and continuous monitoring

Accounting for constraints
- Driver hours and breaks:
  - Add hard constraints to dynamic routing: maximum shift/drive time, mandatory breaks; monitor compliance via timeline conformance views.
- Vehicle capacities and package mix:
  - Capacity and volumetric constraints enforced in routing; avoid dynamic assignments that exceed capacity; visualize capacity utilization by route.
- Customer time windows and service requirements:
  - Hard/soft windows modeled; penalize early/late arrivals differently; ensure dynamic resequencing respects SLA priority customers first.
- Regulatory and access constraints:
  - Low-emission zones, delivery curfews, turn restrictions embedded in routing; annotate stops with building access rules.
- Risk and change management:
  - Pilot new strategies on select depots/regions; A/B test with clear guardrails and rollback.

Continuous monitoring plan
- Dashboards (updated daily, with real-time widgets where available):
  - Service KPIs: OTDR by depot/route/driver; first-attempt success; reattempt rate and cost.
  - Time decomposition: average stop time (parking search vs service), travel vs service ratio, idle time share.
  - Conformance: alignment cost trends; sequence deviations; unplanned stop frequency; detour distance.
  - Fuel and sustainability: fuel per km/package; idle fuel burn; CO2 per package.
  - Traffic and hotspot maps: delay heatmaps by hour/weekday; top 20 problematic corridors and blocks.
  - Maintenance: predicted risk, scheduled vs unscheduled events, MTBF, impact on operations.
- Alerts and controls:
  - SLA breach risk alerts (routes predicted to miss >X% of windows).
  - Anomaly detection: sudden spike in failed deliveries or idle time in a zone.
  - Control charts for key metrics with seasonality adjustments; weekly exception review.
- Feedback loops:
  - Monthly model recalibration for ETA and travel-time matrices using latest logs.
  - Quarterly territory/sequence re-optimization using updated parking and service-time profiles.
  - Driver scorecards with fair comparisons (case-mix adjusted), coaching follow-up, and measurable goals.

Implementation notes
- Start with a robust data pipeline: automated daily ETL, map-matching, feature engineering (segments, dwell, parking search), and event-log generation in both Vehicle-Day and Package case views.
- Use process cubes to slice by depot, weekday, season, and weather.
- Run pilots:
  - Pilot 1 (4 weeks): dynamic ETA + resequencing in two urban zones; success metric: +7% OTDR, -5% drive time vs control.
  - Pilot 2 (8 weeks): parking-aware sequencing; success metric: -15% stop time in target hexes.
  - Pilot 3 (12 weeks): predictive maintenance; success metric: -50% unscheduled downtime.

By integrating and mining the multi-source event data, you will discover the true operational flow, quantify where time and fuel are lost, validate root causes, and deploy targeted interventions. The combination of dynamic routing with accurate ETAs, parking-aware planning, proactive customer engagement, predictive maintenance, and driver coaching—implemented within operational constraints and monitored continuously—should materially improve on-time performance, reduce fuel and overtime, and stabilize maintenance costs.
