### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Best Practices)**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Desideratum Violation 1:**  
  - *Credit Check* occurred **after** *Risk Assessment*  
  - **Issue:** This violates the recommended best practice of completing the Credit Check **within a short time window** (e.g., within 24 hours) after the application is received.  
  - **Note:** This is not a serious violation, but it is suboptimal.

- **Desideratum Violation 2:**  
  - *Inform Applicant* occurred **after** the *Loan Decision (Rejected)*, but the timing is not explicitly mentioned.  
  - **Assumption:** The *Inform Applicant* activity occurred on the same day as the *Loan Decision*, so it is likely within the recommended 48-hour window.  
  - **However**, the *Finalize Documentation* activity occurred **immediately** after the *Loan Decision (Rejected)*, which is not ideal.

- **Desideratum Violation 3:**  
  - **No Follow-up Call** was conducted before closing the case.  
  - **Issue:** This violates the recommended best practice of performing a **Follow-up Call** before closing the case.

#### **Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation 1:**  
  - *Credit Check* occurred **more than 24 hours** after *Application Received* (on 2024-01-12 vs. 2024-01-14).  
  - **Issue:** This violates the recommended best practice of completing the Credit Check **within a short time window** (e.g., 24 hours) after the application is received.

- **Desideratum Violation 2:**  
  - *Inform Applicant* occurred **more than 48 hours** after the *Loan Decision (Approved)* (on 2024-01-14 vs. 2024-01-16).  
  - **Issue:** This violates the recommended best practice of informing the applicant **promptly** (e.g., within 48 hours of the decision).

- **Desideratum Violation 3:**  
  - **No Follow-up Call** was conducted before closing the case.  
  - **Issue:** This violates the recommended best practice of performing a **Follow-up Call** before closing the case.

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications for Observed Behaviors**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This may be due to a system error, a misconfigured workflow, or a human error in task assignment.  
  - **Justification:** While the rule is strict, the process can be interpreted as having a "recovery" mechanism, where the Credit Check was completed after the Risk Assessment, but **not before**. This is **not compliant** with the normative rules.

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This could be due to a lack of awareness of the rule, or a system error that allowed the activity to be performed.  
  - **Justification:** This is a **clear violation** of the normative rules and should be corrected immediately.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This may be due to oversight or a lack of enforcement of the desideratum.  
  - **Justification:** While not a serious issue, this is a missed opportunity for improving customer experience and alignment.

#### **Case 3:**
- **Delayed Credit Check:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This may be due to a backlog or system delay, or the case may have been deprioritized.  
  - **Justification:** While not a violation of the normative rules, it is **suboptimal** and could be improved by better resource allocation or prioritization.

- **Delayed Inform Applicant:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This may be due to delays in processing the loan decision or a delay in internal communication.  
  - **Justification:** While not a violation of the normative rules, it is **suboptimal** and could be improved with better time management or automation.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  - **Interpretation:** This may be due to oversight or lack of training on the desideratum.  
  - **Justification:** This is a **missed opportunity** for ensuring alignment and customer satisfaction, but it is not a serious violation of the rules.
