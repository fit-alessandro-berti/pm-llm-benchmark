# 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

**Approach**:  
To perform robust process mining analysis, the heterogeneous data—GPS tracking, scanner events, dispatch system records, and maintenance logs—must be combined into a single, cohesive event log. Each event should be clearly linked to a unique "case," ideally defined as a specific vehicle-day combination (e.g., Vehicle ID + date).

Key preprocessing steps include:

- **Event Log Extraction and Cleaning:**
  - **Timestamp Synchronization:**  
    Align timestamps from all sources to the same time zone and format.
  - **Case Construction:**
    - Clearly define each case as "vehicle-day", capturing all activities occurring during a shift.
    - Merge dispatch planning events (intended route/stops) with associated GPS tracking and scanner events.
  - **Event Granularity Correction:**
    - For GPS: aggregate frequent location pings into meaningful activity ("travel between stops", "idle", "traffic delay", etc.)
    - For Scanner: map "Arrive Customer", "Delivery Success", "Failure" clearly to each stop.
  - **Missing or Inconsistent Data Handling:**
    - Identify and reconcile gaps or overlaps (e.g., discrepancies between scanner event and GPS arrival).
    - Correct or flag anomalies, such as missing scans or inconsistent timestamps.

**Potential Challenges:**  
- **Identity matching across systems:** Linking vehicle-days, drivers, and packages consistently.
- **Missing GPS data:** Gaps due to signal loss in urban canyons.
- **Temporal granularity differences**: GPS intervals differ significantly from scanner or dispatch events.
- **Alignment of activity labels**: Ensuring consistent naming conventions across event categories (dispatch vs. actual activities).

### **Process Discovery:**

**Methods:**  
Utilize automated process discovery algorithms (e.g., Disco, Celonis, ProM – process mining tools) to visualize the actual delivery processes:

- Generate a detailed "as-is" delivery process model.
- Identify patterns including normal delivery sequences (depot departure  customer arrival  delivery  departure  next customer/stop  depot return).
- Capturing exceptional or unexpected events (failed deliveries, unexpected maintenance stops, lengthy idling).

**Insights Visualized:**  
- Frequent paths and rare deviations.
- Visualize which steps have high performance variability or frequent deviations.

### **Conformance Checking:**

**Approach:**  
Conduct alignment analysis between discovered “as-is” process and the planned routes from the dispatch system:

- **Sequence Deviations:**  
  Identify when vehicles deviate from assigned stop orders.
- **Unplanned Stops:**  
  Highlight occurrences of vehicle stops not listed in dispatch (parking, fuel, lunch breaks, unscheduled customer revisit attempts).
- **Temporal Deviations:**  
  Analyze consistent delayed arrivals or extended dwell times relative to dispatch schedule.

# 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

Clearly define measurable metrics based on the integrated event log, including:

- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** % deliveries made within promised customer windows.
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Duration from arrival to departure at each customer location.
- **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio:** Proportion of time spent driving vs. servicing customer locations.
- **Fuel Consumption per km or per Package:** linking vehicle movement data to fuel usage logs.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** % of available vehicle hours actively transporting or delivering.
- **Traffic Delay Frequency/Duration:** occurrence and severity identified via low-speed or idle GPS indicators.
- **Failed Delivery Rate:** proportion of attempted deliveries unsuccessful (customer absent, access problem).

### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

- **Performance-oriented Process Mining Tools (e.g. Celonis, Disco, PM4Py):**
  - Utilize enhanced visualization using replay animations of GPS paths.
  - "Heat maps" identifying prolonged dwell times or excessive idle periods.
- **Root-cause drill-down analysis** using filtering on routes, drivers, times, vehicle types to pinpoint recurring congestion patterns, slow activities at customer stops, high driver idle times.
- **Quantitative Impact Analysis:**  
  Calculate impact of delays & inefficiencies (additional fuel costs, overtime, vehicle utilization decrease) directly from integrated event logs.

# 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### **Possible Root Causes & Validation:**

Potential inefficiencies:

1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Static routing failing to adapt to daily changes (e.g. traffic, customer cancelations).
   - Validate by comparing historical planned routes vs. actual deviations.

2. **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
   - Timing expectations too optimistic (dispatch predictions systematically shorter than reality).
   - Statistical analysis on planned vs. actual travel times.

3. **Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
   - GPS prolonged low-speed events correlated with external traffic patterns (time-of-day analysis).

4. **Customer Service Time Variability:**
   - High variability of scanner "arrival"  "departure" durations across customers or regions.
   - Variant analysis comparing customer stops durations.

5. **Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance Events:**
   - Cross-referencing maintenance logs and unscheduled stops to identify recurrent problematic vehicles.

6. **Driver Behavioral Differences:**
   - Comparative Variant Analysis between individual drivers:
     - Delivery success vs. driver efficiency in dwell and driving times.

7. **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
   - Impact of re-delivery attempts—time lost and increased operational costs.
   - Identify patterns (customers, routes, drivers) associated with high fail rates.

# 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

### **Operational Constraints Consideration:**
- Optimization strategies must respect driver working-hour regulations and allowed overtime, vehicle load capacity limits, and customer service windows.
- Adjustments integrated into dispatch algorithms ensuring legal & operational adherence.

### **Continuous Monitoring (Process Mining Dashboards):**

Implement live process mining dashboards monitoring:

- **Real-time and historical KPI tracking:**
  - On-time percentage, failed delivery trends, idle time tracking.
- **Visual Dashboards showing delivery plan vs. actual routes** with real-time deviations highlighted.
- **Predictive alerts** set up for:
  - Emerging bottlenecks, frequent deviation activities or locations.
  - Early indicators of maintenance issues.
- **Driver performance comparison dashboards** to continuously track adherence to optimized processes and best practice adoption.
