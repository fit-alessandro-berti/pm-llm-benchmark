Here is one concrete example of an invalid—but model-accepted—trace, and why it breaks the real Order-to-Cash logic:

1. Specific “allowed” trace  
   • Receive_Order  
   • Check_Inventory  
   • Ship_Order  
   • Package_Items  
   • Authorize_Payment  
   • Close_Order  

2. Why this trace is problematic  
   - In the process tree, the three activities  
     **Authorize_Payment**, **Package_Items**, and **Ship_Order** sit under a SINGLE PARALLEL node.  
     That means the model will happily execute them in *any* order before the final Close_Order.  
   - Domain rule #1: you cannot ship goods before they’ve even been packaged—shipping must strictly follow packaging.  
   - Domain rule #2: you cannot ship goods before payment has been authorized—otherwise you risk sending product without securing payment.  
   - Yet in this trace you see **Ship_Order** immediately after inventory check, *then* the two preparatory steps.  
     This is blatantly impossible in a real Order-to-Cash: you can’t put a box on a truck until it’s packed, nor dispatch it before you’ve authorized the customer’s payment.  
   - The root cause is underfitting of the PARALLEL operator: it simply says “do A, B, and C in any order,” whereas the true business logic is a strict sequence:  
     Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Ship_Order.  

By allowing those three steps to interleave arbitrarily, the model admits traces (like the one above) that violate the essential preconditions of shipping and payment in the Order-to-Cash process.
