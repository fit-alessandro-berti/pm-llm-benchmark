To identify the main differences in the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze both the process variants and their execution times. Here are the key differences:

### 1. **Rejection Frequency and Performance:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - More frequent rejections occur at various stages, with a notable number of rejections before extensive screening. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a frequency of 1036 and a performance of 270000.477.
     - Rejections after extensive screening are also common, but the performance times are longer, indicating a more thorough and time-consuming process.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Rejections are more frequent and occur at earlier stages, particularly after the initial viewing. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" has a frequency of 674 and a performance of 240000.654.
     - Rejections after extensive screening are less frequent but still present, with slightly longer performance times compared to the protected group.

### 2. **Process Length and Complexity:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - There are more complex and longer process variants, especially those involving multiple rent payments before cancellation. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" has a frequency of 11 and a performance of 1349975.636.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - The process variants are generally shorter and less complex, with fewer instances of multiple rent payments before cancellation. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" has a frequency of 103 and a performance of 960002.670.

### 3. **Performance Times:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Performance times are generally longer, especially for variants involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments. This suggests that the process for the protected group is more thorough and time-consuming.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Performance times are generally shorter, indicating a faster and possibly less thorough process. This could suggest that the unprotected group is processed more quickly, potentially leading to quicker rejections and less extensive screening.

### 4. **Frequency of Long-Term Tenant Retention:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - There are fewer instances of long-term tenant retention, as evidenced by the lower frequencies of variants involving multiple rent payments before cancellation. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" has a frequency of 12.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - There are more instances of long-term tenant retention, as evidenced by the higher frequencies of variants involving multiple rent payments before cancellation. For example, the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Appartment" has a frequency of 103.

### 5. **Eviction Processes:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - There is only one variant involving eviction, which is "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Miss Rent Payment -> Issue Warning -> Evict Tenant" with a frequency of 6 and a performance of 990084.833.
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - No variants involving eviction are reported, which could suggest that evictions are less common or not as rigorously documented for the unprotected group.

### Conclusion:
The main differences suggest that the protected group is subject to more thorough and time-consuming processes, with a higher frequency of rejections and longer performance times, especially for more complex variants involving multiple rent payments. The unprotected group, on the other hand, is processed more quickly with shorter performance times and fewer instances of long-term tenant retention. These differences could indicate potential biases or disparities in the treatment of the two groups.
