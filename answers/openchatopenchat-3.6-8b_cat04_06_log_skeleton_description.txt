The process described by the Log Skeleton model consists of several declarative constraints, each representing different relationships between activities. The process involves multiple actors such as ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, EMPLOYEE, and BUDGET OWNER. Here is a summary of the process:

1. Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR: The SUPERVISOR declares an item for approval.
DIRECTLY-FOLLOWS CONSTRAINT: This activity is followed directly by 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' or 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'.
2. Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER: The PRE_APPROVER declares an item for approval.
3. Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION: The ADMINISTRATION declares an item for approval.
4. Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR: The SUPERVISOR finally approves an item.
ACTIVITY OCCURRENCES: This activity can occur up to 4 times.
5. Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION: The ADMINISTRATION approves an item.
6. Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER: The PRE_APPROVER approves an item.
