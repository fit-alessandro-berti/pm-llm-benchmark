MAIN FLOW (happy-day path)  

(01) Start Event  “Invoice received by email”                        [S-Message from Supplier  AP Clerk]

(02) Task  “Check invoice for valid PO number”                      [AP Clerk]

(03) Exclusive Gateway  “PO present?”  
—No (03a) Task “Return invoice – request PO/better details”    [AP Clerk  Supplier]  
       Intermediate Event “Corrected invoice received”          [Supplier  AP Clerk] (loop back to 02)  
—Yes continue to 04

(04) Task  “Log invoice in Accounting System”                       [AP Clerk]  
Data object “Invoice” attached, created in system

(05) Task  “Forward invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation” [AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer]  
Message Flow (Invoice, PO no.)

(06) Task  “Verify goods/services received & compare to PO”         [Purchasing Officer]  
Data objects used: Invoice, PO, Goods-Receipt

(07) Exclusive Gateway  “Invoice matches PO & receipt?”  
—No (07a) Task “Contact supplier / ask AP to hold invoice”     [Purchasing Officer]  
       Data object “Discrepancy Note” created  
       Intermediate Event “Corrected invoice or clarification” [Supplier or AP] (loop back to 06)  
       Escalation: after repeated failures  (E1) “Escalate to AP Supervisor” (see Exception Path A)  
—Yes (08) Message “Confirmation OK” to AP Clerk                [Purchasing Officer  AP Clerk]

(08) Task  “3-way match in system (Invoice–PO–Receipt)”            [AP Clerk]

(09) Exclusive Gateway  “Discrepancy after 3-way match?”  
—Yes (09a) Task “Email Purchasing for clarification”          [AP Clerk]  
       Intermediate Event “Clarification received”             [Purchasing Officer] (return to 08)  
       If still unresolved  Escalate to AP Supervisor (Exception Path A)  
—No continue to 10

(10) Service Task  “Trigger Manager approval request (system email)” [Accounting System]  
     Message Flow to Department Manager

(11) Task  “Review & approve invoice”                               [Department Manager]

(12) Exclusive Gateway  “Manager decision”  
—Reject / Hold (12a) Message “Invoice rejected / put on hold” [Department Manager  AP Clerk]  
        AP Clerk revisits Step 08 or escalates (Exception Path B)  
—Approve continue to 13

(13) Task  “Schedule invoice for payment run”                       [AP Clerk]  
     Data object “Approved Invoice” updated in Accounting System

(14) End Event  “Invoice queued for payment”                        [Process End]

---------------------------------------------------------------------
EXCEPTION PATH A – Escalation to AP Supervisor  

(E1) Intermediate Event “Escalation from AP Clerk or Purchasing”    [AP Supervisor]

(E2) Task  “Investigate discrepancy / coordinate departments”        [AP Supervisor]  
Possible Sub-tasks:  
• Contact Supplier                        [AP Supervisor / SRM]  
• Create retrospective PO if none exists  [AP Supervisor + Dept. Head]  

(E3) Exclusive Gateway  “Issue resolved?”  
—No (E3a) Task “Reject invoice”  End Event “Invoice rejected”  
—Yes (E3b) “Return invoice to normal flow”  jump back to Step 06 or 08 as appropriate

---------------------------------------------------------------------
EXCEPTION PATH B – Manager Rejects  

(B1) Task  “AP Clerk investigates manager’s concerns”               [AP Clerk]  
(B2) Same resolution logic as Exception Path A (may involve Supervisor or SRM)  
(B3) Once resolved  Manager re-approves  return to Step 13

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES / AMBIGUITIES IDENTIFIED  

• Timing of the “match” activity: Mary indicates she matches after Purchasing confirms; Dan implies AP may match earlier. Model assumes main 3-way match after Purchasing confirmation; adjust if logs show earlier matching.  
• Some invoices for informal services arrive without any PO. Handling is modelled in Exception Path A (retrospective PO or rejection).  
• Number of re-attempts before escalation to Supervisor is not specified by interviewees. Represented as implicit in “Issue resolved?” gateways.  
• Automated email notifications are generated by the Accounting System; precise message content/layout not covered.

This textual specification provides all elements—activities, sequence flows, gateways with conditions, roles, data objects, and exception paths—needed to draw an unambiguous BPMN diagram of the invoice-approval process described in the interviews.
