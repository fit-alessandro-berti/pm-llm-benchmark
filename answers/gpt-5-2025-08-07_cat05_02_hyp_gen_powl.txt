Here’s a concise, actionable breakdown.

1) What’s anomalous in the provided POWL model

- Loop semantics (E,P):
  - The LOOP[E,P] means: do E once, then optionally repeat pairs of P then E: sequence E (P E)* and then exit. You can leave the loop after any E, so the model allows exiting without any approval (P) at all, and it also allows multiple approvals (P) interleaved with evaluations (E). The last step inside the loop is always E, not P.
- XOR on notification:
  - XOR between N and skip allows customer notification to be omitted entirely.
- Partial order enabling premature or concurrent closing:
  - Edges: R -> A, A -> loop, loop -> XOR, and A -> C. There is no constraint between XOR and C, nor between loop and C.
  - Because C is only ordered after A, C can occur concurrently with the loop and XOR. That permits closing the claim:
    - before any evaluation (E) or approval (P),
    - before or without notifying the customer (N),
    - while evaluation/approval is still ongoing (events after C).

2) Plausible hypotheses for why these anomalies exist

- Partially implemented policy changes:
  - e.g., “fast-close” or “reject-early” paths intended for obviously invalid claims, but only A -> C was added without gating by E/P.
- Miscommunication in process design:
  - The modeler intended a do–redo loop for reassessment, but mislabeled P as redo, which unintentionally made approval optional or repeatable.
  - Notification intended to be mandatory post-approval, but modeled as optional XOR for an alternate channel (e.g., portal self-service) without enforcing timing.
- Technical/workflow tooling constraints:
  - Limited support for expressing “must have P before exit” or “N must happen after P and before C” led to underconstrained partial order edges.
- System/data quality issues:
  - Event timestamps out of order (clock skew, async writes) or use of P for “request approval” and E for “re-evaluate” can produce repeated or misordered P/E.
- Operational shortcuts:
  - High workload leading to premature closures; or closures used as an administrative stop before finalizing the work, with later events still posted.

3) How to verify using the database (PostgreSQL queries)

Preparation and general notes
- Ensure a deterministic order by using event_id as a tiebreaker when timestamps are equal.
- Helpful index: CREATE INDEX ON claim_events (claim_id, activity, timestamp, event_id);

A. Claims closed without evaluation and/or without approval before close

A1) Closed without any evaluation (E)
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') = 0;

A2) Closed without any approval (P)
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') = 0;

A3) Closed before first approval (P) — i.e., P exists but occurs after C or doesn’t exist
WITH ctime AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM ctime c
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT 1
  FROM claim_events e
  WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'P'
    AND e.timestamp <= c.ts_c
  LIMIT 1
) p ON true
WHERE p IS NULL;

A4) Closed before any evaluation step (E)
WITH ctime AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM ctime c
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT 1
  FROM claim_events e
  WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
    AND e.activity = 'E'
    AND e.timestamp <= c.ts_c
  LIMIT 1
) e ON true
WHERE e IS NULL;

B. Approvals and evaluations pattern checks (loop anomalies)

B1) Multiple approvals per claim
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS approvals
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY approvals DESC;

B2) Approval occurs before any evaluation (P precedes E)
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS first_e,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS first_p
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, first_p, first_e
FROM firsts
WHERE first_p IS NOT NULL AND (first_e IS NULL OR first_p < first_e);

B3) P without a directly preceding E (detects P…P or P after non-E in sequence)
WITH ep AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp, event_id,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp, event_id) AS prev_activity
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity IN ('E','P')
)
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS p_without_previous_e
FROM ep
WHERE activity = 'P' AND prev_activity <> 'E'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY p_without_previous_e DESC;

C. Notification anomalies (XOR skip and ordering vs. close)

C1) Share of approved claims with no notification at all
WITH per_claim AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS p_count,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'N') AS n_count
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_count > 0 AND n_count = 0) AS approved_without_notification,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_count > 0 AND n_count > 0) AS approved_with_notification,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_count > 0 AND n_count = 0) / NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_count > 0), 0), 2) AS pct_approved_without_notification
FROM per_claim;

C2) Notification skipped between last approval and close
WITH extremes AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS ts_p_last,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id
FROM extremes e
WHERE ts_p_last IS NOT NULL AND ts_c IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = e.claim_id
      AND ce.activity = 'N'
      AND ce.timestamp BETWEEN e.ts_p_last AND e.ts_c
  );

C3) Notification after close (should not happen)
WITH ctime AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.timestamp AS ts_n, c.ts_c
FROM claim_events e
JOIN ctime c USING (claim_id)
WHERE e.activity = 'N' AND e.timestamp > c.ts_c;

D. Premature or concurrent closing indicators

D1) Any events logged after close (C)
WITH c AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT e.claim_id, e.activity, e.timestamp
FROM claim_events e
JOIN c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE e.timestamp > c.ts_c
ORDER BY e.claim_id, e.timestamp;

D2) Close occurred before any E/P (i.e., loop never started)
WITH loop_start AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_loop_start
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity IN ('E','P')
  GROUP BY claim_id
),
c AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS ts_c
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT c.claim_id, c.ts_c, l.ts_loop_start
FROM c
LEFT JOIN loop_start l USING (claim_id)
WHERE l.ts_loop_start IS NULL OR c.ts_c < l.ts_loop_start;

E. Assignment ordering checks (A vs. loop and close)

E1) Evaluation or approval before assignment (A)
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS first_a,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity IN ('E','P')) AS first_loop
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, first_a, first_loop
FROM firsts
WHERE first_loop IS NOT NULL AND (first_a IS NULL OR first_a > first_loop);

E2) Assignment after close
WITH firsts AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'A') AS first_a,
         MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') AS first_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, first_a, first_c
FROM firsts
WHERE first_c IS NOT NULL AND first_a IS NOT NULL AND first_a > first_c;

F. Optional resource–specialization sanity check (if claim_events.resource holds adjuster_id)
This tests whether evaluations/approvals are performed by an adjuster with matching specialization.

SELECT e.claim_id, e.activity, e.timestamp, a.adjuster_id, a.specialization, c.claim_type
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claims c ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = e.resource::int
WHERE e.activity IN ('E','P')
  AND (
    CASE
      WHEN c.claim_type ILIKE '%home%' THEN 'home'
      WHEN c.claim_type ILIKE '%auto%' THEN 'auto'
      ELSE a.specialization -- treat unknown types as pass-through
    END
  ) <> a.specialization;

How to use the results to confirm hypotheses

- If many claims have C before any E/P or events after C, the underconstrained A -> C edge is likely being exploited in practice (premature or concurrent close).
- If P before E or multiple P without interleaving E is frequent, the loop is mis-specified or P is overloaded (e.g., “request approval” vs “final approval”).
- High rates of approved_without_notification or N after C indicate the XOR skip and missing xor -> C constraint are misaligned with policy.
- If ordering anomalies correlate with specific periods, teams, or regions (add filters by resource, adjuster.region, submission_date), that supports organizational or rollout hypotheses.
- If mismatched specializations are common, it suggests assignment logic issues that could drive rework loops.

If you want, I can tailor these queries with your actual resource semantics (e.g., whether resource is an adjuster_id or a username) and produce summary dashboards (rates by month, region, claim_type).
