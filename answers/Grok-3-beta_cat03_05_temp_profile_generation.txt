I'll create a temporal profile for the global supply chain process based on reasonable estimates for average times and standard deviations between activities. Since the process follows a general sequence (SS → OP → RC → QI → CA → PT → PK → WS → DT → AS), I'll include pairs that are both directly connected and separated by multiple steps, reflecting real-world variability in a high-tech electronics supply chain. Times will be in seconds, with averages and standard deviations based on typical supply chain dynamics (e.g., days for procurement, hours for assembly/testing, etc.).
Here's the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:
python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct consecutive pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (43200, 10800),    # 12 hours avg, 3 hours std (supplier selection to order placement)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),  # 7 days avg, 2 days std (order placement to receiving components)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 21600),    # 1 day avg, 6 hours std (receiving to quality inspection)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (172800, 43200),   # 2 days avg, 12 hours std (inspection to assembly)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 28800),    # 1 day avg, 8 hours std (assembly to testing)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 14400),    # 12 hours avg, 4 hours std (testing to packaging)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 7200),     # 6 hours avg, 2 hours std (packaging to storage)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (129600, 43200),   # 1.5 days avg, 12 hours std (storage to distribution)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 864000), # 30 days avg, 10 days std (distribution to after-sales support)

    # Non-consecutive pairs (spanning multiple steps)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (648000, 172800),  # 7.5 days avg, 2 days std (supplier selection to receiving)
    ('SS', 'CA'): (907200, 216000),  # 10.5 days avg, 2.5 days std (supplier selection to assembly)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1209600, 302400), # 14 days avg, 3.5 days std (supplier selection to distribution)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (691200, 194400),  # 8 days avg, 2.25 days std (order placement to inspection)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (950400, 259200),  # 11 days avg, 3 days std (order placement to testing)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),   # 3 days avg, 1 day std (receiving to testing)
    ('QI', 'PK'): (259200, 72000),   # 3 days avg, 20 hours std (inspection to packaging)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (259200, 86400),   # 3 days avg, 1 day std (assembly to distribution)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2764800, 907200), # 32 days avg, 10.5 days std (testing to after-sales support)
}
Explanation of Estimates:
Direct Pairs: These reflect the typical sequence of activities. For example:
SS to OP (12 hours): Time to finalize supplier contracts and place an order.
OP to RC (7 days): Supplier lead time for component delivery.
DT to AS (30 days): Time until customers start needing support post-delivery.
Non-Consecutive Pairs: These account for cumulative delays across multiple steps. For example:
SS to DT (14 days): From supplier selection to final distribution, spanning the entire process.
PT to AS (32 days): From testing to after-sales, including distribution and customer usage time.
Standard Deviations: These are proportional to averages, reflecting variability (e.g., supplier delays, inspection thoroughness). Larger standard deviations are assigned to steps with higher uncertainty (e.g., OP to RC has a 2-day std due to shipping variability).
This dictionary provides a representative subset of pairs, balancing direct and indirect relationships, and captures the complexity of a global supply chain for high-tech electronics. Let me know if you'd like me to refine or expand it further!
