Anomalies in the DECLARE model  
1. non–coexistence(E, C) vs. existence(C)  
   • “E” and “C” are forbidden to appear together, yet “C” must appear in every trace  any trace that ever has an “E” is immediately invalid. In practice this bans evaluation altogether.  
2. responded_existence(E  A)  
   • Imposes that every Evaluate must be followed by an Assign. This reverses the intended Assign  Evaluate ordering and makes “E” unexecutable unless you assign after evaluating.  
3. precedence(C  R) only  
   • “C” is only required to be preceded by “R,” ignoring the critical steps A, E, P, N in between. This both weakens the intended full chain and allows shortcircuits (skip assignment, evaluation, approval, notification).  

Hypotheses for how these anomalies crept in  
• Misinterpretation of DECLARE semantics (confusing “precedence” vs. “responded existence,” swapping directionality).  
• Evolving business rules (e.g. fasttrack/auto-approve lowvalue claims) only partially reflected in the model.  
• Gaps or noise in the event log (missing “A” or “E” events) led to over-generalized constraints.  
• Pressure to close claims quickly  modelers dropped enforcement of evaluation but didn’t realign all constraints.  
• Incremental edits by multiple stakeholders, without end-to-end consistency checks.  

SQL–based Investigations  
Below are example queries you can run against your `claims` and `claim_events` tables to detect whether—and how—these anomalies manifest in the data.

1. Find claims that were closed without any evaluation (violates intended E before C):  
```sql
SELECT
  ce_c.claim_id,
  MIN(ce_c.timestamp) AS close_time
FROM claim_events ce_c
WHERE ce_c.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY ce_c.claim_id
HAVING NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM claim_events ce_e
  WHERE ce_e.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
    AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
    AND ce_e.timestamp < MIN(ce_c.timestamp)
);
```

2. Find traces where both E and C occur (directly contradicts non-coexistence(E, C) in the model):  
```sql
SELECT
  claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E','C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;
```

3. Find evaluation events not preceded by an assignment (tests correct A  E ordering):  
```sql
SELECT
  e.claim_id,
  e.timestamp   AS evaluate_time
FROM claim_events e
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events a
    WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
      AND a.activity = 'A'
      AND a.timestamp < e.timestamp
  );
```

4. Identify claims closed “too early” (only preceded by Receive, skipping A, E, P, N):  
```sql
WITH first_close AS (
  SELECT claim_id, MIN(timestamp) AS close_time
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity = 'C'
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT
  fc.claim_id
FROM first_close fc
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = fc.claim_id
  AND ce.timestamp < fc.close_time
  AND ce.activity IN ('A','E','P','N')
GROUP BY fc.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(ce.event_id) = 0;
```

5. Check whether every Evaluate is eventually followed by a later Assign (exposes the reversed responded_existence):  
```sql
SELECT
  e.claim_id,
  e.timestamp   AS evaluate_time
FROM claim_events e
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events a
    WHERE a.claim_id = e.claim_id
      AND a.activity = 'A'
      AND a.timestamp > e.timestamp
  );
```

6. (Bonus) Full sequence conformance check: list all claims missing any of the six steps RAEPNC  
```sql
WITH steps AS (
  SELECT
    claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_r,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_a,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_e,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_p,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='N' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_n,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity='C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT
  claim_id,
  has_r, has_a, has_e, has_p, has_n, has_c
FROM steps
WHERE has_r*has_a*has_e*has_p*has_n*has_c <> 1;
```

Running these queries will tell you, for example, how many claims got closed without evaluation, how often Evaluate and Close co-occur, and whether the reversed “EA” constraint actually holds in the log. Those insights can guide you in cleaning up the DECLARE model’s anomalies and realigning it with your true business process.
