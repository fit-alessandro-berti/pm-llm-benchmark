First, the user wants two POWL models based on the hiring process description.

1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:** This should include an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch is a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other is a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that gives an advantage.

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness:** This should have no special branch; all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation.

From the description, the process includes:

- Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: This might involve a loop for data completeness.

- Preliminary Skill Assessment: A sequential step.

- Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check: In the first model, this has an XOR.

- Managerial Review & Final Decision: Follows after.

Key elements in POWL:

- Activities: Like Transition with labels, e.g., "ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck", etc.

- Loops: For the data completeness check.

- XOR: For the choice in the first model.

- Partial Order: To sequence the steps.

I need to structure this using the POWL classes: Transition, SilentTransition, StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL.

Let me outline the first model (with unfairness):

- Start with receiving the application.

- Then, a loop for data completeness: If data is missing, request more info and loop back.

- After that, Skill Assessment.

- Then, XOR: One path for standard Cultural Fit Check, another for CommunityAffiliationCheck.

- After the XOR, proceed to Managerial Review and Final Decision.

The description says: "after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other to a “CommunityAffiliationCheck”."

So, precisely:

- Sequence: ReceiveApplication  DataCompletenessLoop  SkillAssessment  XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck)  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

In POWL, I'll use StrictPartialOrder to connect these.

For the loop: The data completeness is a loop, so that should be an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator.

Specifically: "Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details."

So, perhaps: A loop between "CheckData" and "RequestMoreInfo".

From the example: * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B then A again.

For data completeness: A could be "ParseResume", B could be "RequestMoreInfo" and then back to A.

But to keep it simple, let's define it as per the instructions.

Now, for the second model: No XOR; just a straight CulturalFitCheck for everyone.

So, sequence: ReceiveApplication  DataCompletenessLoop  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision.

Alright, let's define the activities:

- ReceiveApplication: Transition("ReceiveApplication")

- For the loop: Let's say A = Transition("ParseResume"), B = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")

  So, loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])  // This means execute A, then loop or B then A, etc.

- SkillAssessment: Transition("SkillAssessment")

- For the first model: XOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition("CulturalFitCheck"), Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")])

- ManagerialReview: Transition("ManagerialReview")

- FinalDecision: Transition("FinalDecision")

Then, in the StrictPartialOrder, connect them in order.

For the first model:

Root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, XOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

Add edges: ReceiveApplication --> loop --> SkillAssessment --> XOR --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

For the second model:

Root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

Add edges: ReceiveApplication --> loop --> SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

I need to ensure the loop is properly defined.

In the POWL definition, the loop is between two sub-models, so for the data completeness, I need to define what A and B are.

Perhaps A is the parsing and checking, and B is requesting more info.

To match the description, let's say:

First, ReceiveApplication.

Then, the loop for data completeness: So, after ReceiveApplication, go to the loop.

The loop might be part of the initial check.

I need to be more precise.

From the description: "Applicants first submit their resumes... Then, Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: An automated system scans... If missing, loop to ask for more."

So, perhaps: ReceiveApplication  * (ParseResume, RequestMoreInfo)  SkillAssessment  etc.

Yes.

One more thing: In the description, the XOR is specifically for the cultural fit part.

Alright, let's write the code snippets.

First, import the necessary:

import pm4py

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition

from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

Now, for the first model:

# Define activities

receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")

parse_resume = Transition(label="ParseResume")

request_more = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the loop for data completeness

data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[parse_resume, request_more])

# Create the XOR for cultural fit

xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# Now, the root partial order

nodes_first_model = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, xor_cultural, managerial_review, final_decision]

root_first = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_first_model)

# Add edges

root_first.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)

root_first.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)

root_first.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cultural)

root_first.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, managerial_review)

root_first.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

That should be it for the first model.

For the second model:

nodes_second_model = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, managerial_review, final_decision]  # Note: using the same receive_app and data_loop

root_second = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_second_model)

root_second.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)

root_second.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)

root_second.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)

root_second.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)

root_second.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

I'm reusing the variables, but in code, that's fine as long as I present them separately.

In the response, I need to present both models.

Finally, output them as per the user's request.

Below is the implementation of the two POWL models based on the provided textual description of the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. I'll first explain the key differences between the models, then provide the Python code snippets to define each one using the `pm4py` library.

### Key Differences Between the Models:
1. **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**:
   - This model includes an XOR operator after the "SkillAssessment" activity. The XOR represents the branching described in the process: one branch leads to a standard "CulturalFitCheck," while the other leads to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck." This introduces the potential for unfairness, as the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" could subtly favor applicants with certain affiliations (e.g., local community groups or specific clubs).
   - The overall structure maintains the sequential flow and the loop for data completeness, as described.

2. **POWL Model Without Unfairness**:
   - This model removes the XOR branching entirely. Instead, all applicants proceed directly to a single "CulturalFitCheck" activity after "SkillAssessment." This ensures a uniform process, eliminating the potential bias introduced by the alternative branch.
   - The rest of the structure (e.g., the loop for data completeness) remains the same to reflect the core process.

Both models use the following elements from the description:
- **Loop**: For the "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check," which involves a loop to handle missing information (e.g., * (ParseResume, RequestMoreInfo)).
- **Sequence**: Activities are connected via a partial order to enforce the sequential flow (e.g., ReceiveApplication  Loop  SkillAssessment  etc.).
- **Activities**: Labels are derived directly from the description, such as "ReceiveApplication," "ParseResume," "RequestMoreInfo," "SkillAssessment," "CulturalFitCheck," "CommunityAffiliationCheck," "ManagerialReview," and "FinalDecision."

Now, let's define the models in Python code. I'll use the `pm4py` library as specified, importing the necessary classes.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define common activities used in both models
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")  # Initial receipt of applications
parse_resume = Transition(label="ParseResume")  # Part of the data completeness loop
request_more = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")  # Part of the data completeness loop
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")  # Preliminary skill assessment
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Standard cultural fit evaluation
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")  # Human review of candidates
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")  # Final approval or rejection

# Create the loop for data completeness (common to both models)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[parse_resume, request_more])
# This loop means: Execute ParseResume, then either exit or execute RequestMoreInfo and loop back to ParseResume until data is complete.
```

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model represents the workflow with the XOR branching after "SkillAssessment." The XOR includes two options: "CulturalFitCheck" (standard path) and "CommunityAffiliationCheck" (biased path that could favor certain applicants).

```python
# Define the XOR for cultural fit with potential bias
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # Biased check for community affiliations
xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])
# This XOR means: After SkillAssessment, choose exclusively between CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck.

# Create the root partial order for the model with unfairness
nodes_with_unfairness = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, xor_cultural, managerial_review, final_decision]
root_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_with_unfairness)

# Add edges to enforce the partial order (sequential flow)
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)  # ReceiveApplication must precede the data loop
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)  # Data loop must precede SkillAssessment
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(skill_assess, xor_cultural)  # SkillAssessment must precede the XOR branch
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(xor_cultural, managerial_review)  # XOR branch must precede ManagerialReview
root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)  # ManagerialReview must precede FinalDecision

# The model is now complete. Unfairness arises in the XOR branch, where CommunityAffiliationCheck could introduce bias.
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model ensures a fair workflow by removing the XOR branching. All applicants go through the same "CulturalFitCheck" after "SkillAssessment," eliminating any selective advantages based on affiliations.

```python
# Create the root partial order for the model without unfairness
nodes_without_unfairness = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, managerial_review, final_decision]

root_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_without_unfairness)

# Add edges to enforce the partial order (sequential flow, no XOR)
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)  # ReceiveApplication must precede the data loop
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)  # Data loop must precede SkillAssessment
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)  # SkillAssessment must precede CulturalFitCheck
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, managerial_review)  # CulturalFitCheck must precede ManagerialReview
root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)  # ManagerialReview must precede FinalDecision

# The model is now complete. This version removes the potential for bias by standardizing the cultural fit process.
```

### Summary of the Models:
- **Model with Potential Unfairness**: Demonstrates the process as described, with the XOR operator introducing a point of subtle bias (e.g., in the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" branch). This aligns with the description's warning about preferential treatment for certain affiliations.
- **Model Without Unfairness**: A revised, fairer version where the XOR is eliminated, ensuring all candidates experience the same steps. This promotes transparency and equity while retaining the essential structure (e.g., the loop for data completeness and sequential ordering).
