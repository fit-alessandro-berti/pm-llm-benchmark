### **Process Mining Analysis: Inferring Manufacturing Activities from Sensor Data**

Below is the segmentation of the event log into distinct **activities** based on sensor patterns, along with explanations for each inferred phase.

---

### **1. Activity Segmentation & Labels**

#### **A. Initialization / Setup Phase (Events 1–3)**
- **Events:** 1, 2, 3
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Temperature:** Stable (~20–21°C)
  - **Pressure:** Constant (~1 bar)
  - **Vibration:** Zero
  - **Material Flow:** Zero
  - **Tool Position:** At rest (0 mm)
  - **Energy:** Low (~0.4–0.5 kWh)
- **Inferred Activity:** **"Preparation / Machine Startup"**
  - **Rationale:** The machine is idle, with no material being processed. This likely represents the initial setup phase before any active operations begin.

---

#### **B. Cutting Phase (Events 4–8)**
- **Events:** 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Temperature:** Sharp increase to **50–58°C** (likely due to friction/heat from cutting).
  - **Pressure:** Slight rise (~1–1.5 bar), possibly due to material resistance.
  - **Vibration:** High (~30–38 Hz), indicating mechanical stress from cutting.
  - **Material Flow:** Moderate (~5 units/s at first, then drops to 2 units/s).
  - **Tool Position:** Moves from **5 mm  15 mm** (active cutting motion).
  - **Energy:** Peaks at **3.0 kWh** (high power consumption for cutting).
- **Inferred Activity:** **"Cutting Metal"**
  - **Rationale:** The combination of **high vibration, rising temperature, and tool movement** strongly suggests material removal (cutting). The energy spike aligns with power-intensive operations.

---

#### **C. Welding Phase (Events 9–10)**
- **Events:** 9, 10
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Temperature:** Sudden spike to **80°C** (likely from welding heat).
  - **Pressure:** Stable (~2 bar), possibly due to gas flow in welding.
  - **Vibration:** High (~50 Hz), indicating intense mechanical activity.
  - **Material Flow:** Zero (no material being fed during welding).
  - **Tool Position:** Remains at **15 mm** (stationary for welding).
  - **Energy:** Extremely high (**5.0 kWh**), consistent with welding power requirements.
- **Inferred Activity:** **"Welding"**
  - **Rationale:** The **sharp temperature rise, high vibration, and energy consumption** are characteristic of welding. The lack of material flow suggests fusion rather than cutting.

---

#### **D. Post-Processing / Cooling Phase (Events 11–12)**
- **Events:** 11, 12
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Temperature:** Drops to **25°C** (cooling phase).
  - **Pressure:** Stable (~1 bar).
  - **Vibration:** Low (~5 Hz), indicating reduced mechanical stress.
  - **Material Flow:** Slight (~1 unit/s), possibly for final adjustments.
  - **Tool Position:** Moves to **20 mm** (possibly for finishing touches).
  - **Energy:** Moderate (~1.5–1.6 kWh).
- **Inferred Activity:** **"Quality Inspection / Finishing"**
  - **Rationale:** The **cooling trend, reduced vibration, and slight material flow** suggest a transition from active processing to inspection or minor adjustments. The tool moves slightly, indicating final touches.

---

#### **E. Reset / Idle Phase (Events 13–15)**
- **Events:** 13–15
- **Key Observations:**
  - **Temperature:** Returns to baseline (~20–21°C).
  - **Pressure:** Stable (~1 bar).
  - **Vibration:** Zero.
  - **Material Flow:** Zero.
  - **Tool Position:** Returns to **0 mm** (reset).
  - **Energy:** Low (~0.4–0.5 kWh).
- **Inferred Activity:** **"Machine Reset / Cycle Completion"**
  - **Rationale:** The machine returns to its initial state, indicating the end of a full cycle. This likely represents a **reset phase** before the next operation begins.

---

### **2. Summary of Process Flow**
The inferred process follows this sequence:
1. **Preparation / Machine Startup** (Idle, no material flow).
2. **Cutting Metal** (High vibration, temperature, energy).
3. **Welding** (Sudden temperature spike, high energy).
4. **Quality Inspection / Finishing** (Cooling, minor adjustments).
5. **Machine Reset / Cycle Completion** (Return to baseline).

### **3. Validation & Potential Improvements**
- **Strengths:**
  - The segmentation aligns well with known manufacturing phases (cutting, welding, inspection).
  - Sensor patterns (vibration, temperature, energy) strongly support the inferred activities.
- **Limitations:**
  - Some transitions (e.g., between cutting and welding) could be ambiguous without additional context.
  - A longer log would help confirm if this pattern repeats consistently.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Use **machine learning** (e.g., clustering or sequence mining) to automate activity inference.
  - Incorporate **contextual metadata** (e.g., machine type, part specifications) for better labeling.

This analysis demonstrates how **process mining** can extract meaningful activities from raw sensor data, even without explicit labels. The key was identifying **sensor-based patterns** that correspond to known manufacturing operations.
