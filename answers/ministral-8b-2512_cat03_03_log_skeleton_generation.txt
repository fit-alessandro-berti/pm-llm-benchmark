Here’s a Python dictionary representing the **Log Skeleton** for the given order fulfillment process, incorporating the declarative constraints based on the typical workflow and logical dependencies between activities:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No activities are strictly equivalent in this process
    'always_before': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),      # Receive Order must occur before Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),      # Check Availability must occur before Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),      # Reserve Items must occur before Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),      # Pick Items must occur before Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),      # Quality Check must occur before Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Pack Order must occur before Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),      # Generate Shipping Label must occur before Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),       # Dispatch must occur before Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')       # Invoice Customer must occur before Record Payment
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),      # Receive Order implies Check Availability follows
        ('CA', 'RI'),      # Check Availability implies Reserve Items follows
        ('RI', 'PI'),      # Reserve Items implies Pick Items follows
        ('PI', 'QC'),      # Pick Items implies Quality Check follows
        ('QC', 'PO'),      # Quality Check implies Pack Order follows
        ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Pack Order implies Generate Shipping Label follows
        ('GSL', 'D'),      # Generate Shipping Label implies Dispatch follows
        ('D', 'IC'),       # Dispatch implies Invoice Customer follows
        ('IC', 'RP')       # Invoice Customer implies Record Payment follows
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # No activities are mutually exclusive in this process
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},         # Receive Order occurs exactly once per case
        'CA': {1},         # Check Availability occurs exactly once per case
        'RI': {1},         # Reserve Items occurs exactly once per case
        'PI': {1},         # Pick Items occurs exactly once per case
        'QC': {1},         # Quality Check occurs exactly once per case
        'PO': {1},         # Pack Order occurs exactly once per case
        'GSL': {1},        # Generate Shipping Label occurs exactly once per case
        'D': {1},          # Dispatch occurs exactly once per case
        'IC': {1},         # Invoice Customer occurs exactly once per case
        'RP': {1}          # Record Payment occurs exactly once per case
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),      # Receive Order is immediately followed by Check Availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),      # Check Availability is immediately followed by Reserve Items
        ('RI', 'PI'),      # Reserve Items is immediately followed by Pick Items
        ('PI', 'QC'),      # Pick Items is immediately followed by Quality Check
        ('QC', 'PO'),      # Quality Check is immediately followed by Pack Order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),     # Pack Order is immediately followed by Generate Shipping Label
        ('GSL', 'D'),      # Generate Shipping Label is immediately followed by Dispatch
        ('D', 'IC'),       # Dispatch is immediately followed by Invoice Customer
        ('IC', 'RP')       # Invoice Customer is immediately followed by Record Payment
    }
}
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Equivalence**: No activities are strictly equivalent in this process (e.g., no two activities must occur the same number of times).
2. **Always Before/Always After**: The process is linear, so each activity must occur before the next one, and the next activity must follow the current one.
3. **Never Together**: No activities are mutually exclusive (e.g., no parallel branches where two activities cannot coexist in the same case).
4. **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity occurs exactly once per case (except if there are optional steps, which are not present here).
5. **Directly-Follows**: The process is strictly sequential, so each activity is directly followed by the next one.

### Notes:
- If there were optional steps (e.g., "Handle Backorder" if an item is unavailable), they would be added to `never_together` or `activ_freq` as needed.
- If parallel activities existed (e.g., "Pack Order" and "Generate Shipping Label" could happen concurrently), they would be added to `never_together` or adjusted in `activ_freq`. However, this scenario assumes a strict sequential workflow.
