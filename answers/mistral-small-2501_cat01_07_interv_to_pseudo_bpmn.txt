#### Sequence Flow:
1. **Start**: Receive Invoice
2. **Check PO Number** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **No PO**: Send Back to Supplier
   - **PO Present**: Log Invoice (Accounts Payable Clerk)
3. **Forward to Purchasing** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
4. **Confirm Receipt** (Purchasing Officer)
   - **No Confirmation**: Send Back to Supplier for Clarification
5. **Match Invoice to PO** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **Match**: Send to Manager for Approval
   - **Discrepancy**: Request Clarification (Accounts Payable Clerk)
     - **Clarified**: Send to Manager for Approval
     - **Unresolved**: Escalate to Supervisor (Accounts Payable Supervisor)
       - **Resolved**: Send to Manager for Approval
       - **Reject Invoice**: Reject Invoice (Accounts Payable Supervisor)
6. **Send to Manager for Approval** (Accounts Payable Clerk)
7. **Manager Approval** (Department Manager)
   - **Approved**: Schedule for Payment (Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - **Rejected**: Send Back to Accounts Payable Clerk for Investigation

#### Gateways/Decision Points:
1. **Check PO Number**
   - Decision: **Invoice has a PO** vs. **Invoice does not have a PO**
2. **Confirm Receipt**
   - Decision: **Receipt Confirmed** vs. **Receipt Not Confirmed**
3. **Match Invoice to PO**
   - Decision: **Match** vs. **Discrepancy**
4. **Request Clarification**
   - Decision: **Clarified** vs. **Unresolved**

#### Roles/Participants:
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk**
2. **Purchasing Officer**
3. **Department Manager**
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor**
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager**

#### Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
1. **Invoice**
2. **Purchase Order (PO)**
3. **Confirmation Email**
4. **Notification for Manager Approval**
5. **Approval/Rejection Email**

#### Exceptions/Variations:
1. **No PO Number**: Send Back to Supplier
2. **Discrepancy in Invoice**: Request Clarification
3. **Unresolved Discrepancy**: Escalate to Supervisor
4. **Supplier Relationship Manager Involvement**: Assist in resolving discrepancies
5. **Retrospective PO Creation**: For services contracted informally

#### Notes:
- In some cases, after **Request Clarification**, the process might involve **Supplier Relationship Manager** to resolve issues.
- If the invoice is missing the PO number, the process might loop back to **Check PO Number** after the supplier provides the necessary information.
- The **Accounts Payable Supervisor** ensures problem invoices are cleared and do not remain stuck indefinitely.
- The Department Manager may reject an invoice if there are significant discrepancies or suspicious items, which will loop back to **Send Back to Accounts Payable Clerk for Investigation**.

This structured textual representation captures the key elements of the invoice approval process as described by various stakeholders. It can be easily converted into a BPMN diagram for visualization and further analysis.
