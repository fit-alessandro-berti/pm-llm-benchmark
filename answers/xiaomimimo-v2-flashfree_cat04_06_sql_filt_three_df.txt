Here is the DuckDB SQL query that satisfies the requirements.

### Assumptions
*   **Direct Succession**: The query assumes that the events are strictly consecutive in the timestamp order for a given case. If there are other events occurring at the exact same millisecond, the definition of "direct succession" might vary, but generally, `ROW_NUMBER()` ensures a strict timeline order.
*   **Performance**: This solution uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to first identify the specific sequence and timing, and then filters the main table. This approach is readable and robust.

### The SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    -- 1. Establish the exact chronological order of events per case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_matches AS (
    -- 2. Join the table to itself to find the specific triad of activities
    -- We join current row (step 1) with next row (step 2) and next next row (step 3)
    SELECT 
        t1.case_id,
        t1.timestamp as start_ts,
        t3.timestamp as end_ts
    FROM ordered_events t1
    JOIN ordered_events t2 
        ON t1.case_id = t2.case_id AND t1.rn + 1 = t2.rn
    JOIN ordered_events t3 
        ON t2.case_id = t3.case_id AND t2.rn + 1 = t3.rn
    WHERE 
        t1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND t2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND t3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    -- 3. Filter for the timing condition (> 5 days) and extract distinct Case IDs
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence_matches
    WHERE end_ts - start_ts > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- 4. Final Selection: Return everything, EXCEPT the cases identified above
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation of Logic

1.  **`ordered_events` CTE**:
    We assign a row number (`rn`) to every event within a `case_id` based on the `timestamp`. This allows us to mathematically guarantee that `rn`, `rn+1`, and `rn+2` represent consecutive events.

2.  **`sequence_matches` CTE**:
    We perform a self-join on the ordered events.
    *   `t1` represents the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event.
    *   `t2` is the immediate next event (`t1.rn + 1`), which must be 'Create Order'.
    *   `t3` is the immediate next event after that (`t2.rn + 1`), which must be 'Confirm Order'.
    *   This strictly enforces the "direct succession" rule.

3.  **`cases_to_exclude` CTE**:
    We calculate the time difference between the 'Confirm Order' (`t3.timestamp`) and the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' (`t1.timestamp`). If the difference is greater than 5 days, we mark this `case_id` for exclusion. We use `DISTINCT` because a single case might theoretically contain this sequence multiple times (though rare), but we only need to exclude the case once.

4.  **Final `SELECT`**:
    We select all columns from the original `event_log`. The `WHERE` clause ensures that if a `case_id` appears in our exclusion list, none of its events are returned. The result is ordered by case and time for readability.
