1. How can the R&D team’s early design decisions better account for downstream supply-chain constraints—such as component lead times, geopolitical risks, and environmental regulations—without stifling innovation?  

2. What strategies could the company adopt to diversify or near-shore critical component sourcing (e.g., microprocessors or OLED screens) to reduce geopolitical exposure and transportation risk?  

3. How might advanced demand-sensing analytics be integrated with suppliers’ production schedules to shorten overall lead time while avoiding over-reliance on volatile short-term forecasts?  

4. In what ways could collaborative forecasting and inventory-visibility platforms improve trust and alignment among international suppliers, logistics partners, and regional distribution centers?  

5. What contingency plans should be in place if a single-source component (such as the camera module from Japan) becomes unavailable due to natural disaster, export controls, or factory shutdowns?  

6. How might the company quantify and reduce its total supply-chain carbon footprint—from raw-material extraction through last-mile delivery—while still meeting aggressive cost and time-to-market targets?  

7. What role could modular product architecture play in enabling late-stage customization for different markets, thereby balancing economies of scale with local consumer preferences?  

8. How can the firm ensure consistent labor and environmentalcompliance standards across geographically dispersed suppliers and its own assembly operations in Malaysia?  

9. Which advanced quality-assurance methodologies (e.g., in-line AI-powered visual inspection) could further reduce defect rates without slowing the 24/7 assembly lines?  

10. How could dynamic pricing of transportation modes (air vs. ocean) be optimized in real time to balance service levels, cost, and sustainability goals?  

11. What new supply-chain risks emerge from increased geopolitical tensions around semiconductor export controls, and how can the company build strategic buffer inventory without tying up excessive working capital?  

12. How might distributed ledger (blockchain) technologies enhance end-to-end traceability for conflict-minerals compliance, warranty validation, and counterfeit prevention?  

13. In regions with slower demand, what alternative fulfillment models (e.g., hub-and-spoke consolidation, postponement packaging, or regional refurbish-and-resell programs) could improve inventory turns and reduce write-offs?  

14. How can machine-learning models that forecast demand also incorporate promotions, product-lifecycle stages, and macroeconomic indicators to improve accuracy across diverse markets?  

15. What metrics beyond traditional KPIs (like on-time delivery or cost per unit) should be tracked to capture customer experience, sustainability impact, and resilience?  

16. How could the company leverage digital twins of its supply network to run scenario analyses for disruptions such as port closures, sudden demand spikes, or currency fluctuations?  

17. In managing multiple currencies, what financial-hedging strategies best protect margins without adding excessive complexity or cost?  

18. How can after-sales support data (e.g., warranty claims, repair trends) be fed back into design and supplier selection to create a virtuous cycle of quality improvement?  

19. What collaborative frameworks with logistics partners could streamline customs clearance and regulatory compliance, especially for products that cross multiple trade blocs and free-trade agreements?  

20. How should the company balance the speed advantages of just-in-time replenishment for high-demand markets with the need for safety stock to cushion against sudden supply disruptions?
