This analysis groups the low-level machine and operator events into five distinct, high-level process steps, reflecting common phases in a material transformation workflow.

## Aggregated High-Level Process Steps

The low-level events are grouped based on the primary objective of the activity (e.g., preparation, transformation, inspection, finishing) and the consistency of the resources involved during that phase.

| # | High-Level Step Name | Rationale for Grouping | Low-Level Events Grouped |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Material Staging & Identification** | This initial phase focuses entirely on introducing the raw material into the system, validating its identity, and positioning it correctly for further processing. These steps are typically performed sequentially by the same operator (Operator A) at the very start of the case. | `Retrieve raw metal sheet`, `Scan barcode`, `Place metal sheet on table` |
| **2** | **Component Conditioning** | This step encompasses the immediate preparatory actions needed to bring the material to the required physical state (position and temperature) immediately before the core manufacturing action (welding) occurs. It involves both robotic alignment and thermal preparation. | `Align metal sheet`, `Preheat metal sheet` |
| **3** | **Core Assembly (Welding)** | This is the primary functional stage where the structural transformation takes place. It begins with acquiring the necessary tool and is dominated by the sequence of welding actions performed by the specialized operator (Operator B). | `Pick up welding tool`, `Weld corner A`, `Weld corner B` |
| **4** | **In-Process Quality Check & Surface Finishing** | This phase combines the immediate quality assessment of the core assembly (the weld integrity) with the subsequent mandatory surface treatment steps (coating and drying). These actions transition the product from a structural state to a coated/finished state, often using automated equipment. | `Measure weld integrity`, `Apply protective coating`, `Dry coating` |
| **5** | **Final Product Verification** | This final stage represents the concluding quality gate before the case is released. In this sample, it is represented by a final manual inspection performed by a different resource (Operator C), signifying closure of the processing workflow for this product instance. | `Visual check` |

## Detailed Justification and Mapping

The grouping strategy relies on identifying logical state changes in the product:

### 1. Material Staging & Identification
**Goal:** Ensure the correct, traceable component is physically in place.
*   **Evidence:** The sequence involves handling the raw input (`Retrieve`), verifying identity (`Scan barcode`), and securing the position (`Place on table`). All are performed by **Operator A** within the first 10 seconds.

### 2. Component Conditioning
**Goal:** Adjust the physical environment (geometry and heat) for the main operation.
*   **Evidence:** These events (`Align` and `Preheat`) are crucial precursors to welding. They involve resources specifically dedicated to precision positioning (**Robot Arm #2**) and thermal management (**Heating Unit #1**), indicating a distinct setup phase separate from handling and welding.

### 3. Core Assembly (Welding)
**Goal:** Execute the primary structural joining process.
*   **Evidence:** The introduction of the `welding tool` followed by multiple sequential `Weld` activities performed by **Operator B** clearly demarcates the main manufacturing activity. This block is self-contained in its objective.

### 4. In-Process Quality Check & Surface Finishing
**Goal:** Assess the structural integrity created in Step 3 and immediately apply necessary protective/cosmetic layers.
*   **Evidence:** The event `Measure weld integrity` is placed *before* the coating process but *after* the welding. Grouping the measurement immediately before the coating step suggests this check determines if coating can proceed or is necessary. The subsequent application and drying of the coating form a logical finishing sequence driven by external processing units.

### 5. Final Product Verification
**Goal:** Conclude the process with a holistic review.
*   **Evidence:** The `Visual check` stands alone temporally and functionally. It is the final sign-off event, typically performed by a dedicated QA resource (**Operator C**) after all mechanical and chemical processes are complete.
