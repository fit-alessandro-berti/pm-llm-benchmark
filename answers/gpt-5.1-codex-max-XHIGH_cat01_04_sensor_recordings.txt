Looking at the sequence of sensor readings, there are clear shifts in operating mode – periods of essentially no activity, periods of elevated temperature/vibration with material flow, a spike of heat with no flow, and a return to baseline. One way to segment and label these phases is:

- **Idle/Standby (Events 1–3 and 13–15)**  
  Temperature and pressure sit at ambient, vibration and material flow are zero, tool position is at home (0mm), and energy draw is just the base 0.4–0.5kWh. This looks like the machine powered on but not working.

- **Material Cutting/Machining (Events 4–6)**  
  There’s a sustained rise in temperature (50–58°C), vibration jumps into the 30–38Hz range, and material flow is a steady 5units/s while the tool advances from 5 to 10mm. Energy consumption more than quadruples. That combination of heat, vibration and feed suggests a cutting or milling operation.

- **Part Positioning/Assembly (Events 7–8)**  
  Temperature drops back to ~40°C, vibration is low (~10Hz), material flow reduces to 2units/s, and the tool holds around 15mm. This looks like a calmer phase where parts are being moved into place or assembled rather than aggressively machined.

- **Welding/Joining (Event 9)**  
  A sharp spike in temperature to 80°C and vibration to 50Hz with zero material flow, at the same tool position, and a high 5kWh draw is characteristic of a localized heatintensive operation such as welding or spot joining.

- **Cooling/Inspection (Event 10)**  
  Immediately after the weld, readings drop: 30°C, minimal vibration, no flow, same tool position, and low energy. This could be a brief cooling period or a quick visual/quality check while the tool is stationary.

- **Light Handling/Packaging (Events 11–12)**  
  The machine is at low temperature (25°C) with slight vibration (~5Hz), a trickle of material flow (1unit/s), tool position moves out to 20mm, and energy is modest (1.5kWh). That pattern fits lowintensity handling such as placing the finished part into a bin or packaging.

These phases together describe a plausible process: from idle, through cutting, positioning, welding, a quick check, some final handling, and back to idle.
