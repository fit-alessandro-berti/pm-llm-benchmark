Below is a case-by-case assessment.  Cases 1 and 4 conform to the normative model; cases 2, 3 and 5 deviate.  

1. Compliant Cases  
   - Case 1:  
     Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
     Follows the “sufficient-inventory” path exactly.  
   - Case 4:  
     Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
     Follows the “insufficient-inventory” path exactly.  

2. Violating Cases  
   • Case 2 (2023-10-06)  
     – Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
     – Violation: “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment.”  
       • Norm: payment must be authorized before packaging (“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping”).  
       • Here, the warehouse prepared goods without knowing payment was approved, reversing the required order.  

   • Case 3 (2023-10-07)  
     – Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
     – Violations:  
       1. A cancellation happens after payment authorization.  
          • Norm: “If inventory is insufficient, Cancel should follow Check; if sufficient, Cancel shouldn’t occur at all.”  
          • Here, they authorized payment (implying sufficient stock) then immediately canceled—contradictory branching.  
       2. “Ship order” occurs after a cancellation.  
          • Norm: shipping must never follow a cancellation (“Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation”).  
          • Here, goods are shipped even though the order was canceled.  

   • Case 5 (2023-10-09)  
     – Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
     – Violations:  
       1. “Package items” is entirely skipped.  
          • Norm: packaging is required before shipping (“Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping”).  
       2. “Ship order” occurs immediately after authorization.  
          • Norm: must first package; shipping un-packaged goods is out of sequence.  

3. Summary of Key Rule Breaches  
   - Authorize payment must come before packaging (breached in case 2).  
   - Packaging must precede shipping (breached in cases 2 and 5).  
   - Cancellation should only follow Check and preclude any fulfillment steps (breached in case 3).  
   - Shipping must never occur after a cancellation (breached in case 3).
