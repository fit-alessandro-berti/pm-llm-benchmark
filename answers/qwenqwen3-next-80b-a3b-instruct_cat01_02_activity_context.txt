### **Justification for Renaming Choices**

#### **1. “Verify Documents”  “Verify Initial Documents” and “Verify Resubmitted Documents”**
- **Contextual Clue**:  
  The first occurrence of “Verify Documents” always happens right after initiation and is based on the *original submission*. The second occurrence occurs *after* a customer has submitted additional or corrected documents, typically following a request or adjustment.
- **Rationale**:  
  Distinguishing between *initial* and *resubmitted* verification clarifies whether this is the first pass (baseline validation) or a re-validation after a correction loop. This is critical for process analytics (e.g., measuring rework rates).

#### **2. “Call Customer”  Three distinct variants**
- **a. “Call Customer for Missing Docs” (C001)**  
  - Triggered by *incomplete documentation*.  
  - Goal: Request missing evidence.  
  - Contextual clue: Follows failed document verification; precedes customer self-service upload.

- **b. “Call Customer for Account Clarification” (C002)**  
  - Triggered by *discrepancy in account data*, not documents.  
  - Contextual clue: Precedes an *Adjust Account* activity — indicates the call is for data correction, not documentation.

- **c. “Call Customer to Confirm Adjustment” (C002)**  
  - Follows an internal adjustment.  
  - Contextual clue: Purpose is *confirmation and closure*, not problem identification. This is a *service recovery* or *validation* call.

- **d. “Call Customer to Return to Branch” (C003)**  
  - Unique to branch-based case.  
  - Contextual clue: Customer is physically present but stepped away; call is to *resume in-person interaction*.  
  - This is not about data or documents — it’s a *logistics* call to complete the service.

>  **Key Insight**: “Call Customer” is not a single activity — it represents **three distinct process roles**:  
> - **Information Request** (missing docs)  
> - **Data Clarification** (account discrepancy)  
> - **Service Completion** (confirming adjustment or resuming in-person service)

#### **3. “Adjust Account”  “Adjust Account Based on Call” and “Adjust Account Due to Missing Info”**
- **Contextual Clue**:  
  In C002, the adjustment follows a customer call — implying the agent acted on *customer-provided information*.  
  In C003, the adjustment occurs after a call *to return the customer*, but before re-verification — suggesting the adjustment was made based on *internal discovery* (e.g., system mismatch).
- **Rationale**:  
  The *source of the adjustment trigger* matters for process ownership and root-cause analysis.  
  - “Based on Call”  Customer-driven correction  
  - “Due to Missing Info”  Internal discovery (possibly system or process gap)

>  This disambiguation helps identify whether adjustments are proactive (customer-initiated) or reactive (internal error correction).

### **Summary of Naming Strategy**
| Original Activity       | New Activity Names                                                                 | Purpose of Distinction |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Verify Documents        | Verify Initial Documents, Verify Resubmitted Documents                             | Distinguish first vs. follow-up verification |
| Call Customer           | Call Customer for Missing Docs, Call Customer for Account Clarification, Call Customer to Confirm Adjustment, Call Customer to Return to Branch | Differentiate call intent: documentation, data, confirmation, logistics |
| Adjust Account          | Adjust Account Based on Call, Adjust Account Due to Missing Info                   | Differentiate trigger source: customer vs. internal |

### **Impact of Renaming**
- **Process Mining**: Enables accurate discovery of process variants (e.g., “Document Re-Submission Path” vs. “Account Clarification Path”).
- **Performance Analysis**: Allows tracking of rework loops, call-to-correction ratios, and branch vs. digital efficiency.
- **User Experience**: Clearer activity names improve transparency for analysts, auditors, and system designers.

This renaming transforms ambiguous, generic activity labels into **semantically rich, context-aware process steps**, aligning the event log with real-world workflow semantics.
