The visualization is a **process flow / process map** (similar to a process mining “happy path + variants” diagram) showing how different business objects move through an order-to-cash / procure-to-pay style workflow.

Key elements:

- **Sources at the top**: five object types with volumes:
  - *VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)*
  - *ReturnOrderItem (0.8M objects)*
  - *PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)*
  - *SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects)*
  - *PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)*  
  Each feeds into a **Start** node.

- **Activities as boxes**: steps such as:
  - *Create Requisition* (Overall: 3.0M)
  - *Approve Requisition* (Overall: 5.7M)
  - *Send Order* (Overall: 5.2M)
  - *Check Stock* (Overall: 1.0M)
  - *Approve Payment* (Overall: 1.5M)
  - *Create Invoice* (Overall: 2.0M)
  - *Process Return* (Overall: 0.8M)
  - A main fulfillment chain on the right: *Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order* (with overall counts around 8.5M down to 1.7M).

- **Connections and timing**:
  - Directed arrows connect activities; many arrows are labeled with **durations in milliseconds** (e.g., 300ms, 400ms, 650ms), indicating typical/average transition times between steps.
  - Multiple colored lines represent **different process variants or object sources** converging on shared steps (notably *Approve Requisition* and *Create Invoice*).

- **End states**:
  - Several **End** nodes at the bottom indicate different completion points depending on the path (e.g., ending after sending an order, after invoicing, or after closing an order).

Overall, it depicts **multiple intertwined process paths** across procurement, sales, invoicing, and returns, with **event volumes (“Overall”)** per activity and **transition latencies** along the edges.
