This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the process for **"Dispatch of goods"** at a **"Computer Hardware Shop"**. The process involves three main participants, represented by lanes: **Logistics**, **Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

Here is a step-by-step description of the process flow:

1.  **Process Start:** The process begins with a start event labeled **"Ship goods"** in the Secretary's lane.

2.  **Parallel Tasks:** Immediately after starting, a parallel gateway splits the process into two simultaneous paths:
    *   **Secretary's Path:** The Secretary begins to **"Clarify shipment method"**.
    *   **Warehouse's Path:** The Warehouse starts to **"Package goods"**.

3.  **Warehouse Activities:**
    *   The "Package goods" task has a 48-hour timer attached. If this task is not completed within 48 hours, a separate task is triggered to **"Notify customer about delay"**.
    *   Once packaging is complete, this branch of the process waits at an inclusive gateway for other tasks to finish.

4.  **Secretary's Activities & Decisions:**
    *   After clarifying the shipment method, an exclusive gateway poses the question: **"Special handling?"**.
    *   **If YES (Special Handling):** The Secretary must **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies"** and then **"Select logistic company and place order"**.
    *   **If NO (No Special Handling):** The process continues to **"Check if insurance is required"**. This task uses "Order details" and "Customer information" data.
        *   An inclusive gateway follows. The path to **"Write package label"** is always taken.
        *   If the check determines that **"insurance [is] necessary"**, a concurrent task is performed by the **Logistics** department to **"Insure parcel"**.
        *   Both the insurance path and the standard path merge before proceeding.

5.  **Merging and Synchronization:**
    *   All the potential paths within the Secretary's lane (special handling, standard shipping, and label writing) eventually converge.
    *   A parallel gateway then synchronizes the completed work from the **Secretary's lane** with the completed work from the **Warehouse's lane** (i.e., the goods are packaged).

6.  **Final Steps:**
    *   Once both main branches are complete, the process moves back to the **Warehouse** lane.
    *   The warehouse staff **"Fill out Shipment paperwork"**.
    *   Next, they **"Move package to pickup area"**.

7.  **Process End:** The process concludes with the end event **"Shipment prepared"**, indicating that the goods are ready for collection by the logistics company.
