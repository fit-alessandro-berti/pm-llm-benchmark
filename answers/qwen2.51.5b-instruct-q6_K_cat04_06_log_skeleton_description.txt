The provided dataset describes various activities related to a declaration, including approval, submission, and finalization processes. Each activity has an associated action that can result in one or more subsequent actions. A clear direct-follows constraint among these events indicates that if an event occurs (like submission), it may lead another event to happen directly following the first.

### Summary

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**:
   This is an initial activity where someone submits a declaration for approval.

2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**, **FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**, or some other final process can follow depending on its state after submission, including scenarios such as being rejected at that stage and then getting approved or finalized later.

3. **Request Payment** may be triggered directly from this event if the declaration involves monetary transactions but doesn’t change any of the aforementioned states.

4. **DECLARATION SAVED by EMPLOYEE** happens when an employee saves a declaration after it has been saved, possibly due to actions like making corrections before submission or finalizing after review.

5. **Payment Handled**: This is typically triggered if there is a transaction process tied to this event.

6. **DECLARATION FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR**, **FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER**, and others imply that the declaration needs approval by some level of supervisor depending on its initial state after submission.

7. **Approval, rejection**: Different processes may happen when someone handles this declaration:

   - When rejected by "EMPLOYEE", next events might include being reconsidered.
  
   - When "APPROVED OR REJECTED" during review (by superiors like "ADMINISTRATION", the final "SUPERVISOR"), it leads to a finalized state or further approval/rejection depending on the initial rejection rate.

8. **Some declarations may go into states where they are "REJECTED", indicating that handling could be either by specific departments such as BUDGET OWNER for budget constraints, ADMINISTRATION for administrative checks, etc., but then the next step in direct followed processes might not lead to further approval if a higher process layer rejects it.

It is noted that **missing information** (not directly provided here) can change state and therefore could also have an impact on indirect actions. All these activities are driven by initial submission from any user, through review processes at different levels of management, up until final completion or rejection. This structure describes the flow of declaration handling in terms of initial input -> approval/rejection -> potential further processing depending on current status of submitted documents/requests.
