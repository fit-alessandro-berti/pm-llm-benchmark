To infer case groupings from this interleaved sequence of hospital process events, we need to analyze the attributes—timestamp, activity, resource, department, patient_age, patient_gender, and additional_info—and identify logical patient journeys. The key is to link events that likely belong to the same patient based on consistent patient attributes (age and gender), sequential activities typical of hospital workflows, and timing/department coherence. Since there’s no explicit case ID, we’ll deduce cases by assuming each patient follows a distinct path through the hospital system.
Analysis Approach
Patient Attributes: Group events by matching patient_age and patient_gender, as these are likely unique per patient within this short timeframe.
Activity Sequence: Hospital processes typically follow a logical order (e.g., registration → triage → consultation → tests → treatment → discharge). We’ll use this to connect events.
Timestamp Continuity: Events for the same patient should occur in a plausible chronological sequence, allowing for interleaving of multiple patients.
Department Consistency: Events for a patient often stay within related departments (e.g., ER or Surgery), though some (like Radiology or Laboratory) serve multiple departments.
Additional Info: Details like diagnosis or procedure can reinforce connections between events.
Let’s examine the data and group the events into cases.
Event Breakdown by Patient Attributes
Patient 1: Age 45, Gender M
08:05:13, Register patient, ER
08:10:50, Initial triage, ER
08:15:42, X-ray imaging, Radiology
08:23:10, Doctor consultation, ER
08:30:05, Patient discharged, ER
Patient 2: Age 62, Gender F
08:07:02, Register patient, ER
08:12:29, Initial triage, ER
08:16:10, Lab test requested, ER
08:20:27, Lab test completed, Laboratory
08:22:54, Doctor consultation, ER
08:27:00, Prescription created, ER
08:35:29, Patient discharged, ER
Patient 3: Age 28, Gender M
08:07:15, Register patient, Surgery
08:13:00, Doctor consultation, Surgery
08:16:45, Surgery preparation, Surgery
08:25:19, Surgery performed, Surgery
08:31:37, Recovery room, Surgery
08:40:13, Patient discharged, Surgery
Reasoning
Patient 1 (45, M, Case 1)
Starts with registration in ER (event 1).
Proceeds to triage in ER (event 4), matching age and gender.
Requires an X-ray (event 7), a common follow-up to triage, and Radiology serves ER patients. The left_leg in additional_info aligns with a later fracture diagnosis.
Doctor consultation in ER (event 12) follows imaging, diagnosing a hairline_fracture, consistent with the X-ray.
Discharged from ER (event 15) with outpatient follow-up, completing the journey.
Timeline: 08:05:13 → 08:30:05 (25 minutes), a reasonable ER visit duration.
Patient 2 (62, F, Case 2)
Begins with registration in ER (event 2).
Triage in ER (event 5) matches age and gender.
Doctor requests a lab test (event 8), logical after triage, with Dr. Smith in ER.
Lab test completed (event 10) in Laboratory, matching patient details and following the request.
Doctor consultation (event 11) with Dr. Smith again, diagnosing a minor_infection, consistent with blood panel results.
Prescription created (event 14) by Dr. Smith, aligning with the diagnosis.
Discharged from ER (event 17) with pharmacy follow-up.
Timeline: 08:07:02 → 08:35:29 (28 minutes), plausible for an ER case with lab work.
Patient 3 (28, M, Case 3)
Registers in Surgery (event 3), distinct from ER cases.
Doctor consultation in Surgery (event 6) with Dr. Lee for a scheduled_knee_surgery, indicating a planned procedure.
Surgery preparation (event 9) follows, matching the surgical context.
Surgery performed (event 13) by Dr. Lee, an arthroscopy (knee surgery), consistent with earlier events.
Moves to recovery room (event 16), a standard post-surgery step.
Discharged from Surgery (event 18) with physiotherapy follow-up, fitting a surgical case.
Timeline: 08:07:15 → 08:40:13 (33 minutes), reasonable for a quick surgical procedure and recovery.
Validation
No Overlaps: Each event is assigned to exactly one case, with no conflicts in resource use (e.g., Dr. Lee works on Patient 3 in Surgery while appearing briefly in ER for Patient 1, which is feasible).
Logical Flows: Each case follows a typical hospital process: ER (registration → triage → tests → consult → discharge) or Surgery (registration → consult → prep → surgery → recovery → discharge).
Department Alignment: Patient 1 and 2 stay within ER (with Radiology/Laboratory support), while Patient 3 is confined to Surgery.
Final Case Groupings
Case 1 (Patient 45, M): Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
ER journey: Registration → Triage → X-ray → Consultation → Discharge
Case 2 (Patient 62, F): Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
ER journey: Registration → Triage → Lab Test Request → Lab Test → Consultation → Prescription → Discharge
Case 3 (Patient 28, M): Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
Surgery journey: Registration → Consultation → Preparation → Surgery → Recovery → Discharge
These groupings reflect distinct patient journeys inferred from the interleaved sequence, leveraging patient attributes, activity order, and hospital workflow logic.
