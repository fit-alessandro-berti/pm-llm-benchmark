Based on the interview transcripts, I'll create a structured BPMN-like process model for the invoice approval process.

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Participants/Swim Lanes:**
- Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk
- Purchasing Officer
- Department Manager
- AP Supervisor
- Supplier Relationship Manager
- System (automated actions)

**Start Event:** Invoice received via email

**Main Process Flow:**

1. **Initial Invoice Check** (AP Clerk)
   - Input: Incoming invoice
   - Task: Check for PO number
   - Gateway: PO number present?
     - If No: Send back to supplier for PO number
     - If Yes: Continue to next step

2. **Invoice Logging** (AP Clerk)
   - Task: Log invoice into accounting system
   - Output: Logged invoice record

3. **Purchase Verification** (Purchasing Officer)
   - Input: Logged invoice
   - Task: Compare invoice against PO
   - Task: Verify goods/services received
   - Gateway: Does everything match?
     - If Yes: Send confirmation to AP
     - If No: Trigger exception handling

4. **Invoice-PO Matching** (AP Clerk)
   - Task: Match invoice line items against PO
   - Gateway: Match successful?
     - If Yes: Continue to manager approval
     - If No: Trigger exception handling

5. **Manager Approval** (Department Manager)
   - Input: Matched invoice and PO
   - System Task: Send automatic approval request
   - Task: Review invoice details
   - Gateway: Approve?
     - If Yes: Continue to payment scheduling
     - If No: Return to exception handling

6. **Payment Scheduling** (AP Clerk)
   - Task: Schedule invoice for payment
   - End Event: Invoice approved for payment

**Exception Handling Sub-Process:**
1. **Initial Exception Assessment** (AP Clerk)
   - Gateway: Can be resolved at clerk level?
     - If Yes: Contact supplier directly
     - If No: Escalate to AP Supervisor

2. **Supervisor Resolution** (AP Supervisor)
   - Task: Assess exception type
   - Gateway: Exception type?
     - Missing Information: Contact supplier via Supplier Relationship Manager
     - Pricing Discrepancy: Verify with Supplier Relationship Manager
     - No PO Match: Work with department heads for retrospective PO
   
3. **Exception Resolution**
   - Task: Implement correction
   - Task: Return to main process flow
   - Gateway: Return point?
     - Return to Invoice Logging if new invoice needed
     - Return to Purchase Verification if correction verified
     - Return to Invoice-PO Matching if matches resolved

**Business Rules:**
1. All invoices must have a valid PO number
2. Both goods receipt and PO matching must be confirmed before manager approval
3. Any discrepancies must be resolved before proceeding to payment
4. Manager approval is required for all invoices
5. Escalation to AP Supervisor is required for unresolved discrepancies

**Artifacts:**
- Purchase Order (PO)
- Invoice
- Goods Receipt Confirmation
- System Approval Notifications
- Exception Documentation

This model represents the core process while accommodating the various exceptions and alternative paths described by the interviewees. The process maintains clear handoffs between departments and includes the necessary verification steps before payment approval.
