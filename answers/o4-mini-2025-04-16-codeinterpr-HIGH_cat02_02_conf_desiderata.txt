Below is a per-case breakdown of normative (hard) violations vs. desiderata (soft) deviations, together with possible explanations or mitigation ideas.

1. Normative Rule Violations  
  
• Case 1 (ID 1)  
  – No violations. The events follow exactly the prescribed sequence.  
  
• Case 2 (ID 2)  
  – **Risk Assessment before Credit Check.**  
    • Credit Check logged at 09:00 but Risk Assessment happened at 08:20.  
  – **Missing “Inform Applicant” step.**  
    • After the Rejection decision there is no “Inform Applicant” event.  
  – **Finalize Documentation after Rejection.**  
    • Finalizing docs is forbidden once a loan is rejected.  
  – **Sequence breach:** several steps out of order and one required step omitted.  
  
• Case 3 (ID 3)  
  – No violations. All mandatory activities appear in correct order for an Approved loan.

2. Desiderata (Recommended) Deviations  
  
• Case 1 (ID 1)  
  – **No Follow-up Call.**  
    • A brief check-in before closing is encouraged but missing here.  
  
• Case 2 (ID 2)  
  – **No Follow-up Call.**  
    • Same “nice-to-have” call omitted.  
  – (Timing recommendations are moot once normative rules are broken, but the Credit Check was still done quickly.)  
  
• Case 3 (ID 3)  
  – **Late Credit Check:** 2024-01-14 10:00 is ~49 hours after 01-12 09:00 (>24 h target).  
  – **Late Inform Applicant:** 16-Jan 15:00 is ~51 h after the 14-Jan 12:00 decision (>48 h target).  
  – **No Follow-up Call.**

3. Possible Interpretations & Suggestions  
  
Case 1  
 • This is your textbook “perfect” run—consider adding the follow-up call (e.g. a 5-minute check-in) as a final customer-care touch.  
  
Case 2  
 • **Why?**  
   – The team may have initiated a high-level risk view on partial data, then backfilled the formal Credit Check.  
   – “Finalize Documentation” may be an automated archival step that wasn’t gated on decision outcome.  
   – “Inform Applicant” may have been done verbally or in an unlogged channel.  
 • **Fixes:**  
   – Enforce a hard dependency: Credit Check  Risk Assessment in your BPM/workflow engine.  
   – Remove or condition the Finalize-Docs task for rejected cases.  
   – Make “Inform Applicant” a non-skippable activity immediately after any Decision.  
  
Case 3  
 • **Why delays?**  
   – Possibly low staffing or waiting for a slow third-party data feed.  
   – Informing the customer may have been deprioritized on a busy day.  
 • **Improvements:**  
   – Automate reminders:  
     • 24 h after Application Received  alert credit-check owner.  
     • 48 h after Decision  alert loan officer to inform the applicant.  
   – Build the optional Follow-up Call into the standard case-closing checklist.

Summary  
– Only Case 2 breaks the hard (normative) rules and must be remediated.  
– Cases 1 and 3 comply but show room for process-performance improvements (timing and customer-care steps).  
– Instituting automated gating and reminders will help lock down the normative sequence while nudging the team toward the desiderata.
