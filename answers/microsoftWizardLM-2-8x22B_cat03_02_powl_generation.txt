 Here is the Python code to construct the POWL model for the described complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the transitions for each task in the process
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
DnR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Define the silent transition for the process completion
completion = SilentTransition()

# Define the loop for the network configuration phase
config_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DnR])

# Define the exclusive choice for the deployment method
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define the partial order for the final tasks
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
final_tasks.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
final_tasks.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Define the main partial order for the entire process
process_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, config_loop, deployment_choice, final_tasks, completion])
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must come before CS
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, DA)  # CS must come before DA
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # CS must come before ACI
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(DA, config_loop)  # DA must come before BNC (inside the loop)
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(ACI, config_loop)  # ACI must come before BNC (inside the loop)
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_choice)  # Loop must come before deployment choice
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, QA)  # Deployment choice must come before QA
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, SA)  # Deployment choice must come before SA
process_partial_order.order.add_edge(final_tasks, completion)  # Final tasks must come before completion

# The process_partial_order now represents the entire POWL model for the scenario
```

This code constructs the POWL model for the digital service provisioning process as described. It includes all the necessary transitions, silent transitions, partial orders, and operator nodes for loops and exclusive choices. The `process_partial_order` variable holds the entire model, which can be used for further analysis or visualization with the `pm4py` library.
