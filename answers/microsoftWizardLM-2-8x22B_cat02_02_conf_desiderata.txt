 ### Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)

**Identification of Normative Violations:**

- **Case 1:** This case follows the normative process behavior correctly. There are no violations of the sequence or the ordering rules. The application was received, followed by a credit check, risk assessment, loan decision, informing the applicant, finalizing documentation (since the loan was approved), and finally closing the case.

- **Case 2:** This case violates the normative rules in multiple ways:
  - The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check, which is a reversal of the required sequence.
  - Finalize Documentation was performed after the loan was rejected, which contradicts the rule that documentation should not be finalized after a rejection.

- **Case 3:** This case has a violation related to timing, which is part of the desiderata rather than the strict rules:
  - The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received, which is a deviation from the recommended best practice but not a strict rule violation.

### Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)

**Identification of Desiderata Failures:**

- **Case 1:** All desiderata conditions appear to have been met.

- **Case 2:** While the main focus is on the normative rules violations, the case also fails to meet the desideratum of informing the applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision, as the decision was made on the 11th at 09:30 and the applicant was informed at 10:00 on the same day. However, this is a minor deviation considering the more severe violations present.

- **Case 3:** This case fails to meet several desiderata conditions:
  - The Credit Check was not completed within 24 hours after the application was received.
  - The applicant was informed of the loan decision more than 48 hours after the decision was made (the decision was made on the 14th at 12:00, and the applicant was informed on the 16th at 15:00).
  - There was no Follow-up Call recorded before closing the case, which is an encouraged but not required action.

### Interpretations or Justifications

- **Case 2:** The violations in Case 2 are significant and suggest a misunderstanding or disregard for the established process. The reversal of the Credit Check and Risk Assessment steps could indicate a miscommunication or a break in the process flow. The finalization of documentation after a loan rejection is a more severe error, as it suggests a failure in the decision logic that guides the process. This could potentially lead to legal or financial implications if not addressed.

- **Case 3:** The deviations in Case 3 are less severe and may be attributed to operational challenges or resource constraints. The delayed Credit Check could be due to a high volume of applications, staff shortages, or technical issues. The delayed notification to the applicant might be explained by an attempt to resolve a complex scenario before informing the applicant, or it could simply be an oversight. The lack of a Follow-up Call could be due to a desire to close cases quickly to manage the workload, or it might have been overlooked in the process.

In summary, Case 1 is compliant with both the normative rules and desiderata, Case 2 has serious violations of the normative rules, and Case 3 has minor deviations from the desiderata that do not break the strict process rules but indicate areas for process improvement. It is important to address these issues through process redesign, training, or the introduction of automated checks to ensure adherence to both the strict rules and the recommended best practices.
