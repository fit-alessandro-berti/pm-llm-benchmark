### Overview
This is a **flowchart depicting an e-commerce order fulfillment process**, likely for an online retail system. It shows multiple interconnected workflows (Purchase Order, Sales Order, Return Order) starting from "Start" points and converging toward various "End" points. Arrows indicate sequential steps, decisions, and subprocesses, with different colored lines representing distinct paths or actions (e.g., blue for purchase-related, orange for sales/delivery). The diagram is divided into vertical swimlanes for organizational clarity.

### Key Swimlanes (Left to Right)
1. **Purchase Order** (leftmost): Handles vendor purchasing.
2. **Sales Order** (center-right): Manages customer orders and fulfillment.
3. **Return Order** (top-right, overlapping): Processes customer returns.

### Main Flows and Steps
#### Purchase Order Flow (Blue/Purple Lines)
- **Start**  **Create Purchase Order** (purple)  **Send Purchase Order** (purple, 2 days)  **Check Stock** (purple)  **Process Goods** (green).
- Branches:
  - From **Check Stock**  **Approve Payment** (purple)  **Create Invoice** (green)  **End**.
  - From **Process Goods**  **Pack Goods** (orange, shared with Sales)  **Step 4**? (flows into shared delivery).
- Additional loop: **Vendor Lead Time** (2 days, bottom) feeds back into the flow.

#### Sales Order Flow (Orange/Green Lines)
- **Start**  **Create Sales Order** (orange)  **Pack Goods** (orange)  **Step 5**?  **Customer Delivery** (orange)  **Close Order** (orange)  **End**.
- Shared elements:
  - **Apply Return** (green, from Returns) loops into **Create Sales Order**.
  - **Approve Shipment** (purple)  **Step 3** (green)  **Process Shipment** (green).
- Payment/Invoice: **Approve Payment**  **Create Invoice** (green).

#### Return Order Flow (Mixed Colors, Top)
- **Start**  **Create Return** (purple?)  **Return Goods** (connects to **Apply Return** in Sales)  Loops back to Sales for reprocessing.

### Shared Elements and Decisions
- **Central Hubs**:
  - **Pack Goods** and **Customer Delivery** (orange boxes) are shared across flows.
  - Multiple **End** nodes (bottom-right) for completion of orders, invoices, shipments, etc.
- **Time Estimates** (labeled on arrows):
  - 2 days (e.g., Vendor Lead Time, Send PO).
  - 4 days (e.g., some shipment steps).
- **Decision/Loop Points**:
  - Arrows show approvals (e.g., **Approve Payment**, **Approve Shipment**), checks (e.g., **Check Stock**), and closures (e.g., **Close Order**).
  - Loops for returns: **Return Order**  **Apply Return**  Restart Sales flow.

### Visual Style
- **Boxes**: Rectangular nodes for actions (e.g., "Create Invoice"), ovals for Start/End.
- **Arrows**: Colored and labeled with durations (e.g., "2d", "4d"); dashed/solid lines differentiate paths.
- **Layout**: Hierarchical top-down with left-to-right progression; some cross-swimlane connections for integrations (e.g., purchases feeding sales).

This flowchart models a complete order-to-cash cycle, including procurement, fulfillment, shipping, invoicing, payments, and returns, emphasizing efficiency with timed steps and error-handling loops.
