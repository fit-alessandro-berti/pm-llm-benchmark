To identify the main anomalies in your process variants, we can focus on both the frequency and performance metrics. Here are some key observations:

### 1. **High Frequency with High Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection
     - **Frequency**: 56482
     - **Performance**: 59591524.946
   - This variant has a very high frequency but also a very high performance time, indicating that it is both common and takes a long time to complete. This could be an anomaly if the process should be faster or if there are bottlenecks.

### 2. **Low Frequency with Extremely High Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture
     - **Frequency**: 9
     - **Performance**: 131155200.000
   - This variant has a very low frequency but an extremely high performance time, which is significantly higher than most other variants. This could indicate a significant issue or bottleneck in this specific process path.

### 3. **High Frequency with Low Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Payment
     - **Frequency**: 46371
     - **Performance**: 889688.400
   - This variant has a very high frequency and a relatively low performance time, which is expected for a straightforward process. However, if the performance time is significantly lower than similar processes, it might be worth investigating to ensure there are no errors or shortcuts that could lead to issues.

### 4. **Low Frequency with High Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Send for Credit Collection
     - **Frequency**: 11
     - **Performance**: 82040727.273
   - This variant has a low frequency but a very high performance time, which could indicate that the process is complex and takes a long time to complete. However, if this is significantly higher than other similar variants, it might be an anomaly.

### 5. **Consistently High Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Payment
     - **Frequency**: 135
     - **Performance**: 55173760.000
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Fine Notification -> Appeal to Judge -> Add penalty -> Send for Credit Collection
     - **Frequency**: 108
     - **Performance**: 90716800.000
   - Both of these variants have consistently high performance times, which could indicate that the appeal process is particularly time-consuming or has bottlenecks.

### 6. **Consistently Low Performance (Time)**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Payment
     - **Frequency**: 3131
     - **Performance**: 10147598.595
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Payment -> Payment
     - **Frequency**: 12
     - **Performance**: 12614400.000
   - These variants have consistently low performance times, which is expected for simple processes. However, if they are significantly lower than similar processes, it might be worth investigating to ensure there are no errors or shortcuts.

### 7. **Anomalies in Specific Steps**
   - **Process Variant**: Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Add penalty -> Send Appeal to Prefecture -> Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture -> Notify Result Appeal to Offender -> Payment
     - **Frequency**: 61
     - **Performance**: 40763803.279
   - This variant has a moderate frequency but a high performance time, which could indicate that the appeal process is particularly slow or complex.

### Conclusion:
The main anomalies in your process variants are:

1. **High Frequency with High Performance (Time)**: The most common variant taking an unexpectedly long time.
2. **Low Frequency with Extremely High Performance (Time)**: A rare variant with extremely high performance times, indicating potential bottlenecks.
3. **Consistently High Performance (Time)**: Variants involving the appeal process consistently take a long time, which might indicate inefficiencies in this part of the process.

These anomalies suggest that there are specific areas in your process where optimization or further investigation is needed to improve efficiency and reduce processing times.
