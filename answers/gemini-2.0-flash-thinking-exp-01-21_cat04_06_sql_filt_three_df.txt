**Explanation:**

1. **Outer Query (Selecting Events):**
   - `SELECT el.* FROM event_log el`: This part selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table, aliased as `el`. This is our base selection, from which we will exclude certain events.
   - `WHERE NOT EXISTS (...)`: This is the core filtering mechanism. It checks if a certain condition (defined by the subquery inside `EXISTS`) is *not* true for each event in the outer query. If the subquery finds a matching condition for a given `case_id`, `EXISTS` returns true, and `NOT EXISTS` makes the `WHERE` clause false, thus excluding the events from that `case_id`.

2. **Subquery (Identifying Cases with Sequence and Time Condition):**
   - **Window Functions for Sequence Detection:**
     - `LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1`:  This window function looks at the `activity` of the *next* event within the same `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.  `LEAD(activity, 2)` does the same but looks two events ahead.
     - `LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_1`, `LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_2`: Similarly, these window functions get the timestamps of the next and next-to-next events, respectively.
     - `PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp`: This crucial clause ensures that `LEAD()` operates within each `case_id` and respects the temporal order of events.

   - **Filtering for the Specific Sequence and Time:**
     - `WHERE sequenced_events.case_id = el.case_id`: This correlates the subquery with the outer query.  For each event `el` in the outer query, the subquery is evaluated for events with the same `case_id`.
     - `AND sequenced_events.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`:  This checks if the current event's activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.
     - `AND sequenced_events.next_activity_1 = 'Create Order'`: This checks if the *next* event's activity is 'Create Order'.
     - `AND sequenced_events.next_activity_2 = 'Confirm Order'`: This checks if the event after the next one is 'Confirm Order'.
     - `AND (sequenced_events.next_timestamp_2 - sequenced_events.next_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL '5 days'`: This calculates the time difference between the timestamp of 'Confirm Order' (`next_timestamp_2`) and 'Create Order' (`next_timestamp_1`). It then checks if this difference is greater than 5 days. `INTERVAL '5 days'` is DuckDB's syntax for representing a time interval of 5 days.

**How it works together:**

The subquery identifies cases that contain the specified sequence of activities with the time condition. If the subquery finds such a sequence for a given `case_id` (correlated via `sequenced_events.case_id = el.case_id`), the `EXISTS` clause returns true.  The `NOT EXISTS` then negates this, making the `WHERE` clause of the outer query false.  Therefore, events from cases that *do* meet the criteria are excluded.

Conversely, if the subquery does not find the sequence and time condition for a `case_id`, `EXISTS` returns false, `NOT EXISTS` becomes true, and the `WHERE` clause of the outer query is true.  Thus, events from cases that *do not* meet the criteria are included in the final result.

**In summary, this query efficiently identifies and excludes events from cases that exhibit the specified activity sequence with a time delay exceeding 5 days between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.**
