To identify root causes for performance issues in this process, we'll analyze the provided process flows, focusing on **frequency** (how often a path is taken) and **performance** (the time/measured value associated with each path). The goal is to highlight process and data-specific considerations that might be contributing to these performance issues.

### Observations and Potential Root Causes:

1. **High Rejection Rates Leading to Looped Processes**:
	* Many paths involve repeated rejections by various roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR) followed by resubmission. This looping back increases the overall process time.
	* **Root Cause**: Inefficient initial submission quality or overly stringent approval criteria might be causing high rejection rates. **Data Needed for Confirmation**: Quality metrics of initial submissions and reasons for rejections.

2. **Divergent Path Performances with Similar Starting Points**:
	* Paths starting with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" diverge significantly in performance (e.g., one path takes 9110508.000 units, while another takes 13805869.200 units).
	* **Root Cause**: Different approval routes or variable efficiency among approvers (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) could explain these discrepancies. **Data Needed for Confirmation**: Approver-specific processing times and workload distributions.

3. **ADMINISTRATION's Role in Bottlenecking**:
	* Paths involving "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION" show notably high performance values (indicative of time consumed), and this role appears frequently across different paths.
	* **Root Cause**: ADMINISTRATION might be a bottleneck, possibly due to heavy workload, stringent criteria, or inefficiencies in their approval process. **Data Needed for Confirmation**: Time-to-approve/reject metrics specifically for ADMINISTRATION, comparing against other roles.

4. **PRE_APPROVER's Impact on Process Efficiency**:
	* Paths with "Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER" followed by "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" show relatively better performance (e.g., 1377215.500 units) compared to those without this sequence.
	* **Root Cause**: Efficient pre-approval might streamline the process, suggesting that strengthening or replicating PRE_APPROVER's effectiveness could enhance overall process performance. **Data Needed for Confirmation**: Comparative analysis of process times with and without PRE_APPROVER involvement.

### Recommended Actions for Improvement:

1. **Enhance Initial Submission Quality**:
	* Provide clearer guidelines to EMPLOYEE.
	* Implement a preliminary check before formal submission.

2. **Analyze and Standardize Approver Efficiencies**:
	* Monitor and compare approval times across roles.
	* Develop training or process adjustments to harmonize efficiency.

3. **Streamline ADMINISTRATION’s Approval Process**:
	* Evaluate workload distribution for potential redistribution.
	* Introduce time-limit targets for approvals/rejections.

4. **Replicate PRE_APPROVER’s Success (If Data Confirms)**:
	* Study the PRE_APPROVER's process for best practices.
	* Consider introducing similar pre-approval steps elsewhere in the process.

### Next Steps:
- **Data Collection**: Gather specific metrics as outlined above to validate these hypothesized root causes.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Discuss preliminary findings with involved roles to gather insights and buy-in for proposed improvements.
- **Pilot Implementations**: Test selected improvements on a small scale before full rollout.
