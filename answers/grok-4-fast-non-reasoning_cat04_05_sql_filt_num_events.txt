Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this task:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) as event_count
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
INNER JOIN case_counts cc ON e.case_id = cc.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) `case_counts`**: 
   - Groups the `event_log` by `case_id` 
   - Counts the total number of events per case using `COUNT(*)`
   - Uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter for cases with 6 or fewer events (note: `HAVING` is used instead of `WHERE` because we're filtering on an aggregate)

2. **Main Query**:
   - Joins the original `event_log` table (`e`) with the filtered `case_counts` CTE (`cc`) on `case_id`
   - The `INNER JOIN` ensures we only get events from cases that passed the filter ( 6 events)
   - Selects all columns from the original events (`e.*`)
   - Orders the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` for logical sequence (though this is optional based on your needs)

This approach is efficient because it first identifies the valid cases (in the CTE), then retrieves only the events belonging to those cases. The result will contain all columns from the original `event_log` table, but only for cases with 6 or fewer total events.
