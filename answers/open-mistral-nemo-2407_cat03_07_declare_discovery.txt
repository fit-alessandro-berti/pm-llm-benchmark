Based on the provided process variants, I'll create a DECLARE model with the given constraints. I'll assume that the activities are case-insensitive and remove any leading/trailing whitespaces for consistency. Here's the DECLARE model:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Fine Notification': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Add penalty': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send for Credit Collection': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Appeal to Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Notify Result Appeal to Offender': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Appeal to Judge': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {},
    'precedence': {},
    'succession': {},
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

This model includes the existence, absence, exactly one, and initialization constraints for the activities present in the process variants. Since the other constraints require specific activity pairs or sequences, and the provided variants do not consistently exhibit any particular patterns, I've left them empty in this initial model.

To create a more specific DECLARE model, you would need to analyze the process variants for patterns and relationships between activities that can be represented by the other constraints (e.g., response, precedence, succession, etc.). You can then add these constraints to the model accordingly.
