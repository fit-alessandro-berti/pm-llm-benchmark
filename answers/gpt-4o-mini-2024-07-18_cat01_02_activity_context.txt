To address the requirements, we will analyze the provided event log and rename the recurring activities to clarify their context. 

### Analyzing the Events
1. **Initiate Request**: This activity captures the beginning of a support request in different contexts—via the web portal or at a branch. The meaning remains consistent across cases.
  
2. **Verify Documents**: This occurs at different points:
   - Initial identity checks after the request (first instance).
   - Re-verification after additional documents have been provided or after other adjustments have occurred (second instance).
   
3. **Call Customer**: This is also repeated:
   - The first call is often seeking additional information/documents.
   - The second call serves to clarify discrepancies or confirm adjustments.
   
4. **Adjust Account**: This activity reflects internal adjustments to customer accounts and appears unique enough to retain its name.

5. **Approve Request**: This is consistently the final step of approval and doesn't need renaming.

### Proposed Revised Activity Names
Based on the analysis, here are the new names:

1. **Initiate Request** -> **Submit Support Request**
   - This maintains clarity that it comes from the customer in different contexts.

2. **Verify Documents** -> 
   - **Initial Document Verification** (context of first verification after the request).
   - **Re-Verification of Documents** (context of re-checking provided documents).

3. **Call Customer** -> 
   - **Request Additional Information Call** (context of the first call to request missing documents).
   - **Follow-Up Confirmation Call** (context of the second call to confirm adjustments).

4. **Adjust Account** remains unchanged.

5. **Approve Request** remains unchanged.

### Justification
- The new names are chosen to be descriptive and contextually relevant, allowing any stakeholder involved in the support process to understand at a glance what each activity entails.
- The initial and re-verification distinctions clarify the sequence of checks being done.
- The specific naming for calls helps clarify the intent behind each communication—whether it is for gathering information or confirming details. 

This structured naming approach enhances the readability of the event log and supports better documentation of the support processes.
