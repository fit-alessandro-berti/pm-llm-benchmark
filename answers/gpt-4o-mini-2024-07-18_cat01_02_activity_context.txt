### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Submit Request**: This term is used consistently across all cases to indicate the initiation of the support request process. It underscores the submission action from the customer either via a web portal or in-person.

2. **Initial Document Verification**: Difference established from subsequent verification; it signifies the first round of checking, setting the stage for any further actions.

3. **Request Missing Documents**: In C001, this refers to the specific need to contact the customer for additional information which had not been provided initially.

4. **Upload Additional Documents**: This term is specific to C001, emphasizing the action taken by the customer to submit the documents after a request.

5. **Final Document Verification**: Changes from the 'Verify Documents' term to indicate this is a conclusive step after additional documents have been provided or adjustments have been made.

6. **Clarify Account Issue**: Found in C002, this captures the call's intent to resolve discrepancies, distinct from standard verification.

7. **Confirm Adjustments**: This renames the follow-up call in C002 to reflect its purpose, ensuring clarity around its role in verifying changes made.

8. **Return Call to Customer**: This is specific to C003 and differentiates the call to a customer who had left, rather than general customer interaction.

9. **Adjust Account Details**: Used in both C002 and C003 but indicates an internal action following a customer interaction requiring correction.

10. **Request Approval**: This is a consistent naming for cases needing administrative approval, making operational success clear in tracking workflow completion.

These renamed activities enhance clarity and specificity, helping stakeholders understand the context and flow of the process better.
