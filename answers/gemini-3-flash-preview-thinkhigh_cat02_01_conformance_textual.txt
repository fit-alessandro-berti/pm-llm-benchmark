Based on the normative process description provided, here is the analysis of the event log to identify and explain the violations.

### Summary of Deviant Cases

### Detailed Analysis of Violations

#### **Case 2**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ **Package items** $\rightarrow$ **Authorize payment** $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."
*   **Explanation:** The normative description explicitly states that "'Package items' should only occur after authorization." Furthermore, it clarifies that payment authorization must be performed to ensure the customer's method is valid before preparing the items for shipment. In this case, the order was packaged before the payment was secured, reversing the required logical order.

#### **Case 3**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Cancel order** $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Violations:**
    1.  **Shipping after Cancellation:** The order was shipped after it had already been canceled. The text explicitly states: "'Ship order' should... never [occur] after a cancellation."
    2.  **Inconsistent Pathing:** According to the description, if a cancellation occurs, the process should "directly proceed" to "Cancel order" after checking inventory and then move to "Close order." This case mixed fulfillment steps (Authorize, Ship) with a cancellation step.
    3.  **Missing Packaging:** The order was shipped without the "Package items" activity, violating the rule that "Ship order should only occur after packaging."

#### **Case 5**
*   **Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ **Ship order** (Missing "Package items") $\rightarrow$ Close order.
*   **Violation:** The activity "Package items" was skipped entirely.
*   **Explanation:** The normative description states that "items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'" By shipping the order immediately after payment authorization without a recorded packaging step, the process fails to ensure the items were properly prepared as required by the "Sufficient Inventory" sequence.

### Valid Cases (For Reference)
*   **Case 1:** Follows the full "Sufficient Inventory" path (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Authorize $\rightarrow$ Package $\rightarrow$ Ship $\rightarrow$ Close) exactly as described.
*   **Case 4:** Follows the "Insufficient Inventory" path (Receive $\rightarrow$ Check $\rightarrow$ Cancel $\rightarrow$ Close) exactly as described.
