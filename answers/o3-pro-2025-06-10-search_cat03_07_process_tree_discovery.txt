Final process-tree model (structural description only)

-> (                                         main sequence (Operator.SEQUENCE)  
    'RA',                                    Receive Application  
    'VF',                                    Validate Form  
    'AE',                                    Assess Eligibility  

    X (                                       after the assessment, choose either … (Operator.XOR)  
        ,                                    … continue directly (no missing information)  

        -> (                                  … or handle missing information before continuing  
            * (                                 repeat “Request Missing Info” any number of times  
                'RMI',                           (A) body of the loop  
                                                (B) silent step — lets the loop repeat or finish  
            ),  
            'VF'                                re-validate the form once after all requests  
        )  
    ),  

    'AD',                                    Approval Decision  
    'SC',                                    Send Confirmation  
    'AC'                                     Archive Case  
)

How the tree reproduces the observed behaviour  
• Basic happy-path trace (Case 2): RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC  
  (takes the branch of the XOR, skipping the loop).  
• Single round of missing-info handling (Case 1):  
  RA  VF  AE  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC  
  (loop executes once, then exits).  
• Multiple requests before the final re-validation (Case 3):  
  RA  VF  AE  RMI  RMI  …  RMI  VF  AD  SC  AC  
  (‘RMI’ can repeat any number of times inside the loop before the single closing ‘VF’).  

Thus the tree balances
• fitness – every trace in the log is replayable;  
• precision – it does not allow behaviour that contradicts the business rule  
  (re-validation happens exactly once, after all missing-info requests);  
• simplicity – a single XOR choice and a simple *-loop capture the only variation.
