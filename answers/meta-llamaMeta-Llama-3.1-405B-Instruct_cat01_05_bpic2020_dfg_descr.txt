Based on the provided data, I will attempt to describe the underlying process.

The process appears to be a workflow related to expense declarations or reimbursement requests within an organization. The workflow involves multiple stages, approvals, and potential rejections. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Submission**: An employee submits a declaration (e.g., expense report) to the system ( frequency = 8202  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).
2. **Pre-approval**: The submitted declaration might go through a pre-approval stage by a pre-approver ( frequency = 685  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`).
3. **Administration Approval**: The declaration is then sent to the administration for approval ( frequency = 8202  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).
4. **Budget Owner Approval**: If necessary, the declaration is sent to the budget owner for approval ( frequency = 2820  `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`).
5. **Supervisor Approval**: The declaration is then sent to the supervisor for final approval ( frequency = 5133  `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, frequency = 2788  `Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
6. **Payment Processing**: Once the declaration is finally approved, a payment request is initiated ( frequency = 10038  `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment`), and the payment is eventually handled ( frequency = 10037  `Request Payment -> Payment Handled`).

However, there are also potential rejection paths:

* A declaration can be rejected by the administration ( frequency = 952  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`), pre-approver ( frequency = 86  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`), budget owner ( frequency = 59  `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`), or supervisor ( frequency = 60  `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`, frequency = 190  `Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`).
* If a declaration is rejected, it can be resubmitted by the employee ( frequency = 108
