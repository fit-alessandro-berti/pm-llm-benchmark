# Bias Analysis of the Decision Process

## 1. The Explicit Bias: Community Group Score Adjustment

The most visible source of bias is the **+10 "Community" score adjustment** awarded during `PreliminaryScoring` to applicants affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club**. This bonus is applied systematically to C001 and C004, while C002, C003, and C005 receive no adjustment.

This adjustment is not based on financial behavior or creditworthiness — it is based on **social affiliation**. Membership in a particular civic club becomes a proxy advantage, raising the question: *why should belonging to a darts club make someone more creditworthy?*

## 2. The Most Damning Comparison: C003 vs. C004

This is where the bias produces a clearly inequitable outcome:

| Attribute | C003 | C004 |
|---|---|---|
| **LocalResident** | FALSE | TRUE |
| **CommunityGroup** | None | Highland Civic Darts Club |
| **Preliminary Score** | **715** | **690** |
| **Score Adjustment** | 0 | +10 |
| **Final Working Score** | **715** | **700** |
| **Decision** | **Rejected** | **Approved** |

C003 has a **higher raw score** (715 vs. 690) *and* a **higher final working score** (715 vs. 700) than C004 — yet C003 is **rejected** while C004 is **approved**. This means an applicant with objectively stronger underlying creditworthiness received a worse outcome. The only distinguishing factors are local residency and community club membership.

This is not a marginal difference. C003 outperforms C004 on every financial metric the system itself generated, yet loses.

## 3. The Compound/Hidden Bias: Local Residency in Manual Review and Final Decision

Beyond the explicit +10 adjustment, there appears to be a **second layer of bias** operating during `ManualReview` or `FinalDecision` that is tied to the `LocalResident` attribute. Consider the implied approval thresholds:

| Applicant Profile | Lowest Approved Score | Outcome Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Local + Community Group | **700** (C004) | Approved |
| Local + No Group | **720** (C002) | Approved |
| Non-Local + No Group | **740** (C005) | Approved at 740, **Rejected at 715** (C003) |

This suggests a **tiered, unwritten threshold** that is more lenient for local residents and even more lenient for those with community affiliations. Non-local applicants without community ties appear to need a substantially higher score (somewhere between 715 and 740) to clear the same bar.

Because this threshold difference is **not captured in the ScoreAdjustment column**, it likely operates through:
- **Reviewer discretion** during `ManualReview` (where different reviewers may apply subjective judgment influenced by residency/affiliation cues visible in the case file), or
- **Implicit rules** in the `Rules Engine` at `FinalDecision` that weight local residency beyond what is reflected in the score.

Either way, it is a form of **undocumented, opaque bias** — harder to detect and challenge than the explicit +10 adjustment.

## 4. Structural Fairness Implications

### Who benefits?
- **Local residents** who belong to **recognized community groups** receive both an explicit score boost and apparently more favorable review treatment. They can be approved with raw scores as low as **690**.

### Who is disadvantaged?
- **Non-local applicants** and anyone **without community affiliations** — regardless of their actual financial profile. They must demonstrate significantly stronger creditworthiness to achieve the same outcome.

### Why this is problematic:

| Concern | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Proxy discrimination** | Community group membership and local residency can correlate with race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, immigration status, or age. Favoring a specific civic club effectively favors the demographic profile of that club's membership. |
| **Circular exclusion** | People who are new to an area, socially isolated, from minority backgrounds, or simply not joiners are structurally penalized — not for financial risk, but for social characteristics. |
| **Opacity** | The +10 adjustment is at least visible in the log. But the apparent local-residency threshold bias in manual review/final decision is **invisible** in the score columns, making it nearly impossible for an affected applicant to identify or contest. |
| **Compounding** | The two biases reinforce each other: non-local applicants are unlikely to belong to local community groups, so they miss *both* advantages simultaneously. |

## 5. Summary of Bias Mechanisms

```
Layer 1 (Explicit):   CommunityGroup  +10 Score Adjustment  Favors affiliated locals
Layer 2 (Implicit):   LocalResident   Lower effective approval threshold  Favors locals
Layer 3 (Compound):   Non-local + No group  No bonus + higher bar  Systemic disadvantage
```

**The core finding**: An applicant with a preliminary score of **715 and no affiliations** is rejected, while an applicant with a score of **690 and the right affiliations** is approved. The process rewards social belonging over financial merit, and does so through both visible scoring rules and invisible decision-stage biases. Any applicant who cannot or does not participate in recognized local community structures faces a materially unfair process.
