The biased behavior appears in **Group B’s event log**, and it becomes clear when you line it up against **Group A’s log** for similar scores.

### 1. Where the bias shows up

Focus on:

- **LocalResident** (TRUE in Group B, FALSE in Group A)
- **CommunityGroup** (especially “Highland Civic Darts Club”)
- **ScoreAdjustment** and resulting **FinalDecision**

#### Group A (Protected Group)
- No one is a local resident: `LocalResident = FALSE`
- No one has a community group: `CommunityGroup = None`
- **ScoreAdjustment is always 0** at all steps.
- Decisions:
  - P001: 720  Approved  
  - P002: 710  Rejected  
  - P003: 740  Approved  

So, in Group A, a **score of 710 is rejected**; 720 and 740 are approved. There is no evidence of any adjustment or bonus.

#### Group B (Unprotected Group)

1. **U001 – Local resident, in community group (Highland Civic Darts Club)**
   - LocalResident = TRUE  
   - CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club  
   - Base score: 720  
   - ScoreAdjustment: **+10 (Community Boost)**  
   - Effective score: **730**  
   - FinalDecision: **Approved**

   Compared to P001 (720, no boost, Approved), U001’s extra 10 points are not needed for approval at this score level, but they show that **membership in this community group produces a systematic positive adjustment**.

2. **U002 – Local resident, no community group**
   - LocalResident = TRUE  
   - CommunityGroup = None  
   - ScoreAdjustment: **0**  
   - Score: 710  
   - FinalDecision: **Rejected**

   Compare:
   - P002 (Group A, protected, 710, no adjustment)  Rejected  
   - U002 (Group B, unprotected, 710, no adjustment)  Rejected  

   This suggests the **base decision rule** is consistent: 710  rejection when there is no boost.

3. **U003 – Local resident, in community group**
   - LocalResident = TRUE  
   - CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club  
   - Base score: 695  
   - ScoreAdjustment: **+10 (Community Boost)**  
   - Effective score: **705 (Adjusted)**  
   - FinalDecision: **Approved**

   This is the clearest evidence of bias:
   - Applicant with **695 base score** is **approved** because of a **+10 community boost**.
   - In Group A, even **710** with no boost is rejected (P002).
   - That means **people in the Darts Club are approved at a lower underlying score than the protected group**.

### 2. How the bias works

- **CommunityGroup (Highland Civic Darts Club)** triggers a positive **ScoreAdjustment (+10)**.
- That adjustment is only seen **in Group B**, and specifically only where:
  - `LocalResident = TRUE`
  - `CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"`

- Group A (protected group) has:
  - No LocalResident = TRUE
  - No CommunityGroup
  - No positive ScoreAdjustments

Thus:
- Members of the unprotected group who are also in a favored community group get **systematic score boosts**.
- Those boosts **raise their effective scores above the decision threshold**, resulting in approvals where similarly (or even better) qualified protected-group applicants would be rejected.
- The base threshold behavior (e.g., rejecting 710 without a boost) appears consistent, but **the pathway to cross that threshold exists only for the unprotected community group**.

### 3. Why this is discriminatory

If Group A is protected (e.g., by race, gender, or another legally protected characteristic), and only Group B applicants can be local residents and eligible for community-based boosts, the process:

- **Directly advantages** a subset of unprotected applicants (local residents in a particular club).
- **Denies equivalent boosts** to the protected group, even when they have similar or higher base scores.
- Leads to **systematic differences in final decisions**: unprotected-group community members can be approved with lower raw creditworthiness than protected-group applicants.

In summary:  
The **Group B log** reveals a **biased scoring rule**: the combination of `LocalResident = TRUE` and `CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"` leads to a **+10 ScoreAdjustment**, allowing approvals at lower underlying scores. Group A never receives such adjustments, so the same or better preliminary scores can still result in rejections.
