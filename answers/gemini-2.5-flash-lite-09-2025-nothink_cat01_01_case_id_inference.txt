The events must be grouped by matching patient characteristics (Age, Gender) and the typical flow of care within distinct departments. A new case is initiated whenever a new set of patient attributes appears, especially when combined with a distinct starting activity (like registration in a different department).

Here is the inferred grouping:

---

### **Case 1 Analysis (Patient A)**

This case involves a 45-year-old Male, starting in the ER, undergoing imaging, and concluding with discharge from the ER.
