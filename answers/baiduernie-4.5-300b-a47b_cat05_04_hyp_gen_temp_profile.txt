### **Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**  
1. **R (Receive)  P (Approve) Avg. ~25 hours, STDEV ~1 hour**: Suspiciously consistent approval times may indicate rigid automated approvals or preferential handling.  
2. **P (Approve)  N (Notify) Avg. 7 days, STDEV ~2 days**: Extremely long and variable delays between approval and customer notification suggest backlogs or lack of prioritization.  
3. **E (Evaluate)  N (Notify) Avg. 5 minutes, STDEV ~1 minute**: Unrealistically rapid notification post-evaluation suggests skipping steps (e.g., approval) or premature closure.  
4. **A (Assign)  C (Close) Avg. 2 hours, STDEV ~1 hour**: Claims close suspiciously fast after assignment, possibly due to premature closures or missing evaluation/approval steps.

### **Hypothesized Causes**  
1. **RP**:  
   - Automated approval workflows bypassing human review.  
   - Target-based performance metrics incentivizing rapid approvals.  
2. **PN**:  
   - Manual notification steps delayed due to resource shortages.  
   - Notification system bottlenecks or ad-hoc prioritization.  
3. **EN**:  
   - Overlapping steps (e.g., approval and notification triggered simultaneously).  
   - System errors skipping required activities.  
4. **AC**:  
   - Assigned claims are prematurely closed without evaluation/approval.  
   - Data entry errors falsely marking claims as closed.
