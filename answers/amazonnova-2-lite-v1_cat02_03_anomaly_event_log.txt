### **Analysis of the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log for Anomalies**

The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process typically follows a logical, sequential flow to ensure proper control, compliance, and financial accountability. A standard P2P process typically follows this sequence:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods/Services**  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
6. **Match Invoice to PO and Receipt (3-way match)**  
7. **Release Payment**  
8. **Close Case**

Any deviation from this sequence—especially in the order of **approval**, **PO issuance**, **goods receipt**, and **invoice handling**—can indicate **anomalies** that may point to **fraud, inefficiency, or process breakdown**.

##  **Identified Anomalies**

### **Case 1002: Payment Released Before Goods Received and Approval Completes**

#### **Sequence of Activities:**
1. `Create Purchase Requisition`  
2. `Issue Purchase Order` **(Missing Approval)**  
3. `Vendor Invoice Received`  
4. `Release Payment`  
5. `Approve Purchase Requisition`  
6. `Receive Goods`  
7. `Match Invoice to PO`  
8. `Close Case`

#### **Anomalies:**
- **Payment Released Before Receiving Goods**  
  The payment is released **before** goods are received (`Release Payment` at 2024-02-03 07:15, `Receive Goods` at 2024-02-04 09:00).  
  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  This violates the principle of **matching goods receipt with invoice and PO before payment**. Paying before receiving goods exposes the company to **fraud or erroneous payments**, especially if the goods were never delivered.

- **Payment Released Before Purchase Requisition is Approved**  
  The `Approve Purchase Requisition` activity occurs **after** payment (`Approve Purchase Requisition` at 2024-02-03 08:00, `Release Payment` at 2024-02-03 07:15).  
  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  Approving a purchase **after** payment defeats the purpose of a **pre-approval control**, which is a **key internal control** in P2P. This could indicate **unauthorized or rushed payments**, or **post-hoc justification** for payments.

- **Invoice Received Before Goods Received**  
  `Vendor Invoice Received` occurs on **2024-02-03 07:00**, and `Receive Goods` occurs on **2024-02-04 09:00**.  
  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  While not always illegal, this sequence can be a **red flag** if the invoice is paid **before** goods are received. It increases the risk of **paying for undelivered goods**.

### **Case 1003: Invoice Received After Payment Released**

#### **Sequence of Activities:**
1. `Create Purchase Requisition`  
2. `Approve Purchase Requisition`  
3. `Issue Purchase Order`  
4. `Release Payment` **(Before Invoice or Goods Receipt)**  
5. `Vendor Invoice Received`  
6. `Receive Goods`  
7. `Match Invoice to PO`  
8. `Close Case`

#### **Anomalies:**
- **Payment Released Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**  
  Payment is released on **2024-02-08 11:00**, while:
  - Invoice is received on **2024-02-09 12:00**
  - Goods are received on **2024-02-10 13:00**

  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  Releasing payment **without** confirming the **validity of the invoice** or **actual receipt of goods** removes a critical **control point**. This can lead to:
  - **Fraudulent payments**
  - **Overpayment**
  - **Payment for goods that were never delivered**

- **Matching Invoice to PO After Payment**  
  The `Match Invoice to PO` occurs **after** payment (`2024-02-11 14:00` vs. `2024-02-08 11:00`).  
  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  The **3-way match** (PO, goods receipt, invoice) should occur **before** payment. Doing it afterward **defeats the purpose** of this control and may allow **invalid or duplicate invoices** to be paid.

### **Case 1004: Purchase Order Issued After Goods Received**

#### **Sequence of Activities:**
1. `Create Purchase Requisition`  
2. `Approve Purchase Requisition`  
3. `Receive Goods`  
4. `Issue Purchase Order`  
5. `Vendor Invoice Received`  
6. `Match Invoice to PO`  
7. `Release Payment`  
8. `Close Case`

#### **Anomalies:**
- **Goods Received Before PO Issued**  
  `Receive Goods` occurs on **2024-02-06 09:00**, and `Issue Purchase Order` occurs on **2024-02-06 09:15**.  
  **Why it’s problematic:**  
  This suggests that goods were **delivered and accepted** **before** a formal **PO was created**.  
  This is a **major control failure** because:
  - It implies **no formal contract or agreement** existed at the time of delivery.
  - It opens the door to **unauthorized purchases**, **overcharging**, or **fraudulent vendors**.
  - It bypasses **budgeting**, **approval**, and **contractual obligations**.

- **PO Issued After Goods Receipt Could Enable Fraud**  
  This sequence could allow a vendor to **deliver goods** and **demand payment** without a PO, especially if someone in the organization **retroactively** creates a PO to justify the payment.

---

##  **Case 1001: Normal Process**

### **Sequence of Activities:**
1. `Create Purchase Requisition`  
2. `Approve Purchase Requisition`  
3. `Issue Purchase Order`  
4. `Receive Goods`  
5. `Vendor Invoice Received`  
6. `Match Invoice to PO`  
7. `Release Payment`  
8. `Close Case`

 **No anomalies detected**. This case follows the standard P2P process with logical timing and proper controls.

| **1002** | Invoice before goods receipt                      | May indicate premature invoice handling; risk of paying for undelivered goods         |
| **1003** | Payment before invoice and goods receipt          | No validation of invoice or delivery; high fraud risk                                |
| **1003** | Match after payment                               | Control bypassed; invalid invoices may be paid                                        |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued                   | No contractual agreement at time of delivery; potential fraud or unauthorized spend |

##  **Conclusion**

### **Key Anomalies Identified:**
1. **Premature Payment** (Cases 1002, 1003): Payments made before goods receipt or invoice validation.
2. **Reverse Approval Logic** (Case 1002): Approval occurs after payment.
3. **PO After Goods Receipt** (Case 1004): Goods accepted without a PO, bypassing critical controls.
4. **Invoice Before Receipt** (Case 1002): Invoice received before goods, increasing risk of payment for undelivered items.

### **Potential Impacts:**
- **Financial Loss** due to fraudulent or duplicate payments
- **Compliance Violations** (e.g., lack of audit trail, violated procurement policies)
- **Operational Inefficiency** from rework or disputes
- **Reputational Risk** from vendor disputes or regulatory scrutiny

### **Recommended Actions:**
- **Enforce Workflow Rules**: Ensure that **PO must be created before goods receipt** and **payment must follow the 3-way match**.
- **Automate Controls**: Use Procure-to-Pay automation tools to **block payments** until all required steps are completed.
- **Audit Regularly**: Conduct regular audits of P2P logs to detect and correct anomalous behavior early.
- **Training & Governance**: Train staff on procurement policies and enforce **segregation of duties** to prevent control bypass.

--- 

**In summary**, Cases **1002, 1003, and 1004** exhibit **anomalous behavior** that deviates from standard P2P best practices and should be investigated for **control weaknesses or potential fraud**.
