# DuckDB SQL Query Solution

To filter out cases with more than six events and return only events from cases with six or fewer events, you can use the following DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
```

## Explanation:

This query works in two steps:

1. The inner subquery:
   - Groups the events by `case_id`
   - Counts the number of events in each group
   - Uses `HAVING` to keep only the `case_id`s with 6 or fewer events

2. The outer query:
   - Returns all columns for all events
   - But only for cases that passed the filter in the inner query

## Alternative approaches:

You could also solve this with a JOIN:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
WHERE c.event_count <= 6
```

Or with a window function:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
)

SELECT *
FROM case_event_counts
WHERE event_count <= 6
```

All three approaches will produce the same result - returning all events from cases that have 6 or fewer events.
