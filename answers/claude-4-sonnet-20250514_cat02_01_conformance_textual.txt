Looking at each case against the normative process description, I'll analyze the event sequences to identify violations.

## Analysis of Cases

**Case 1: COMPLIANT**
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
- This follows the expected fulfillment flow perfectly when inventory is sufficient.

**Case 2: VIOLATION**
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  **Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order
- **Violation**: Activities are performed in wrong order. The normative description clearly states that "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and **before packaging**" and "Package items should only occur **after authorization** and before shipping."
- Here, packaging occurs before payment authorization, which violates the required sequence.

**Case 3: MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS**
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close order
- **Violation 1**: Shipping after cancellation. The description explicitly states "Ship order should only occur after packaging and **never after a cancellation**" and that "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)" after cancellation.
- **Violation 2**: Missing packaging step. If the process was going to proceed with fulfillment (before the cancellation decision), packaging should have occurred between payment authorization and shipping.
- **Violation 3**: Inconsistent process logic. The case appears to start a fulfillment path (with payment authorization) but then switches to cancellation, creating a hybrid that violates the clear branching logic described in the normative process.

**Case 4: COMPLIANT**
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order
- This follows the expected cancellation flow when inventory is insufficient.

**Case 5: VIOLATION**
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  **Ship order**  Close order
- **Violation**: Missing packaging step. The normative description states "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping" and "Ship order should only occur after packaging." This case skips the mandatory packaging activity that must occur between payment authorization and shipping.

## Summary of Violations

- **Case 2**: Wrong activity sequence (packaging before payment authorization)
- **Case 3**: Shipping after cancellation + missing packaging + inconsistent process logic
- **Case 5**: Missing mandatory packaging activity before shipping

Cases 1 and 4 are compliant with the normative process, representing proper fulfillment and cancellation flows respectively.
