So I've got this big flow of processes, and it seems like it's related to some kind of declaration or request system, probably in a corporate setting where there are employees making requests, and those requests go through various approval stages involving different roles like supervisors, administrators, budget owners, and pre-approvers. There are also steps for requesting payments and handling them. The data provides frequencies and performance metrics for each transition between states, which I think represent how often a particular transition happens and some measure of time or efficiency associated with that transition.

First, I need to make sense of all these different states and transitions. Let's list out all the unique states and the roles involved in transitioning between them.

States:

- Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE

- Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION

- Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR

- Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE

- Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION

- Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER

- Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER

- Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER

- Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER

- Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR

- Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE

- Request Payment

- Payment Handled

- Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR

- Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER

- Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION

- Declaration REJECTED by MISSING

Roles:

- EMPLOYEE

- SUPERVISOR

- ADMINISTRATION

- BUDGET OWNER

- PRE_APPROVER

It looks like "EMPLOYEE" is the one initiating declarations, which can then be approved or rejected by other roles like ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, or PRE_APPROVER. There are also states where declarations are submitted, saved, or set for approval by certain roles.

The process seems to involve several stages:

1. **Initiation:** An employee submits or saves a declaration.

2. **Approval Workflow:** The declaration goes through various approvals, possibly in a sequence or based on conditions.

3. **Payment Request and Handling:** Once approved, a payment request is made, which is then handled.

4. **Rejections and Resubmissions:** If declarations are rejected, they might be resubmitted or handled differently.

Given the complexity, let's try to outline a high-level flow:

- Employee submits a declaration.

- The declaration is reviewed by administration, pre-approver, or directly by the supervisor.

- Depending on the review, it can be approved, rejected, or sent for further approval.

- If approved, it might need final approval from the supervisor.

- Once finally approved, a payment request is made and handled.

- There are also cases where declarations are rejected at various stages, leading to resubmission or other actions.

Let's look at some key transitions:

1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION**

   - Frequency: 8202

   - Performance: 99860.580

   This is a major path where submissions are approved by administration.

2. **Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**

   - Frequency: 5133

   - Performance: 164330.770

   After admin approval, it goes to supervisor for final approval.

3. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**

   - Frequency: 1536

   - Performance: 81928.554

   Some submissions go directly to supervisor for final approval without admin approval.

4. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION**

   - Frequency: 952

   - Performance: 489246.007

   Some submissions are rejected by administration.

5. **Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE**

   - Frequency: 928

   - Performance: 176566.949

   After rejection by admin, it goes back to the employee.

6. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER**

   - Frequency: 685

   - Performance: 107260.731

   Some submissions are approved by a pre-approver.

7. **Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**

   - Frequency: 674

   - Performance: 163158.794

   After pre-approval, it goes to supervisor for final approval.

8. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Request Payment**

   - Frequency: 10038

   - Performance: 273266.628

   Employees can directly request payment after submitting the declaration.

9. **Request Payment -> Payment Handled**

   - Frequency: 10037

   - Performance: 308848.058

   Most payment requests are handled.

10. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment**

    - Frequency: Not directly shown, but implied.

    After final approval, a payment request is made.

From this, it seems there are multiple paths:

- Direct path: Submit -> Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

- Via Administration: Submit -> Admin Approved -> Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

- Via Pre-Approver: Submit -> Pre-Approved -> Final Approved -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled

- Rejection path: Submit -> Rejected by Admin -> Rejected by Employee (possibly resubmit)

There are also some less frequent transitions, like rejection by budget owner, supervisor, or missing approvals, which add complexity to the flow.

It's important to note that there are states like "FOR_APPROVAL by [role]", which might be intermediate states before actual approval or rejection.

Also, there's a state "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" which might mean the employee saves a draft before submitting.

Given the frequencies and performances, it seems that the majority of submissions are approved by administration and then go to supervisor for final approval. There are also paths where submissions are approved by pre-approver or directly go to supervisor.

The performance metrics might represent time taken in milliseconds or some other unit. For example, a performance of 99860.580 for the transition from submitted to admin approved might mean it takes around 99 seconds on average.

Looking at rejection paths, there are transitions like Rejected by Admin -> Rejected by Employee, which might indicate that after being rejected by admin, the employee has to handle or resubmit the declaration.

There are also some unusual transitions, like Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, with a high performance of 952809.512. This might be an error or a special case that needs investigation.

Similarly, there are transitions from Payment Handled back to Declaration Rejected by Employee, which seems odd and might indicate a feedback loop or an error in the process.

Given all this, here's a possible high-level description of the process:

1. **Employee Action:**

   - Saves a declaration (possibly as a draft).

   - Submits the declaration for approval.

2. **Initial Review:**

   - Administration reviews the submitted declaration.

     - If approved, it goes to the supervisor for final approval.

     - If rejected, it goes back to the employee.

   - Pre-approver reviews the submission.

     - If approved, it goes to the supervisor for final approval.

     - If rejected, it goes back to the employee.

3. **Final Approval:**

   - Supervisor reviews the declaration (after admin or pre-approver approval).

     - If approved, the declaration is finally approved.

     - If rejected, it might go back to the employee or other stages.

4. **Payment Request:**

   - After final approval, a payment request is made.

   - The payment is then handled.

5. **Rejection and Resubmission:**

   - If declarations are rejected at any stage, they can be resubmitted by the employee after addressing the issues.

6. **Less Frequent Paths:**

   - Some submissions might be approved by budget owners.

   - There are cases where declarations are rejected by missing approvals or other roles.

This is a generalized flow based on the provided data. The actual process might have more nuances and conditions based on specific scenarios or declaration types.

To better visualize this, creating a flowchart with states and transitions would be helpful. Each transition can be annotated with frequency and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks or areas needing improvement.

In terms of process improvement, looking at the performance metrics can highlight where delays occur. For example, if the transition from Declaration Submitted to Declaration Approved by Administration has a high performance metric, it might indicate that administration approval takes a long time, which could be a bottleneck.

Similarly, frequent resubmissions due to rejections can indicate issues with initial submissions or lack of clarity in requirements.

Overall, this data provides a detailed view of the declaration and payment request process, allowing for analysis and potential optimizations.
