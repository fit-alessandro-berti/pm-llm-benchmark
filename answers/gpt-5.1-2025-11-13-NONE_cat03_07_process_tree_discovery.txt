Here is a compact process tree that captures the main flow plus the optional, repeatable “missing info + revalidation” loop:

```text
-> (
  'RA',
  -> (
    'VF',
    -> (
      'AE',
      -> (
        * (
          -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ),      // loop body: request missing info, then re-validate
          tau                      // exit option
        ),
        -> ( 'AD', 'SC', 'AC' )    // approval, confirmation, archival
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Explanation of structure (in words):

1. `RA` (Receive Application)  
2. `VF` (initial Validate Form)  
3. `AE` (Assess Eligibility)  
4. Loop: zero or more repetitions of  
   - `RMI` (Request Missing Info)  
   - `VF` (re-Validate Form)  
5. Then, once the loop is exited:  
   - `AD` (Approval Decision)  
   - `SC` (Send Confirmation)  
   - `AC` (Archive Case)  

This tree allows:
- cases without missing info (loop skipped), and  
- cases with one or multiple RMI–VF cycles before the final decision and completion.
