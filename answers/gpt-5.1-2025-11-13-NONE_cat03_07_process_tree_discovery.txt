Here is a compact process tree that captures the main flow, the optional repeating loop of requesting missing info and re-validation, and the final decision and closure:

```text
-> (
  'RA',
  -> (
    'VF',
    * (
      X ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) ),
      'tau'
    ),
    'AE',
    'AD',
    'SC',
    'AC'
  )
)
```

Explanation of the structure:

- The whole process is a sequence (`->`) starting with:
  - `'RA'` (Receive Application),
  - then another sequence (`->`) of:
    - `'VF'` (initial Validate Form),
    - then a loop (`*`) that:
      - executes its first child
        - `X ( 'tau', -> ( 'RMI', 'VF' ) )`  
        which means: either do nothing (`tau`) or do `RMI` followed by `VF` once,
      - and may repeat this (by taking the loop back-edge), allowing multiple repetitions of `RMI -> VF`,
      - and finally exits via the second child `'tau'` (silent exit),
    - then `'AE'` (Assess Eligibility),
    - then `'AD'` (Approval Decision),
    - then `'SC'` (Send Confirmation),
    - and finally `'AC'` (Archive Case).

This model:

- Enforces the global order: `RA -> VF -> ... -> AE -> AD -> SC -> AC`.
- Allows zero or more repetitions of the pattern `RMI -> VF` between the first `VF` and `AE`.
- Keeps the control-flow simple and faithful to the log.
