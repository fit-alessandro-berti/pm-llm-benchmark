Here's an analysis of the provided event log, focusing on identifying long resolution times and their potential causes:

**1. Identifying Long Resolution Times:**

To identify long resolution times, we need to calculate the total time taken for each case, from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket."

*   **Case 101:** 2 hours 15 minutes
*   **Case 102:** 1 day, 1 hour, 10 minutes
*   **Case 103:** 1 hour 20 minutes
*   **Case 104:** 1 day, 30 minutes
*   **Case 105:** 2 days, 1 hour, 5 minutes

Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times compared to cases 101 and 103.

**2. Potential Root Causes:**

*   **Escalations:** Cases 102 and 105 both involve escalations to a Level-2 Agent. This is a strong indicator of increased complexity and likely contributes to the longer resolution times.
*   **Long Waiting Times:**
    *   **Case 102:** There's a significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:00) and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30), suggesting a potential bottleneck or lack of progress at the Level-1 stage. Also, a very long delay between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30 on day 1) and "Investigate Issue" (14:00 on day 1) and also between "Investigate Issue" (14:00 on day 1) and "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 on day 2).
    *   **Case 104:** A noticeable delay exists between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30) and "Investigate Issue" (13:00). Also, a long delay between "Investigate Issue" (13:00 on day 1) and "Resolve Ticket" (08:00 on day 2).
    *   **Case 105:** A large gap exists between "Investigate Issue" (09:10) and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (10:00) and "Investigate Issue" (14:00 on day 2) and "Resolve Ticket" (09:00 on day 3).
*   **Investigation and Resolution Delays:** In several cases, there are extended periods between the "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" activities. This could point to difficulties in finding solutions, backlogs in the resolution process, or dependencies on external factors.

**3. Insights and Recommendations:**

*   **Escalations:** While escalations are sometimes necessary, the data suggests they significantly impact resolution time. Analyzing the reasons for escalations could reveal opportunities to improve Level-1 agent training or provide them with better resources to handle more complex issues, reducing the need for escalation.
*   **Waiting Times:** The long waiting times between activities, particularly before investigation and resolution, suggest potential bottlenecks. This could be due to resource constraints, inefficient workflows, or a lack of clear service level agreements (SLAs).  Implementing workflow automation and monitoring tools could help identify and address these bottlenecks.  Clearer SLAs could also be established and monitored.
*   **Investigation and Resolution Delays:** The delays between investigation and resolution could be addressed by improving knowledge management systems, providing agents with better diagnostic tools, or streamlining the resolution process.  Root cause analysis of the delays could be beneficial.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Understanding the workload distribution across agents and levels could help optimize resource allocation and prevent bottlenecks.

By addressing these factors, the customer support team can likely reduce resolution times, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall efficiency.  Further analysis with a larger dataset would provide more robust insights and support more specific recommendations.
