### Deviations from the Normative Process

After analyzing the event log against the normative process description, the following cases include deviations:

#### **Case 2**

- **Violation:** "Package items" occurred before "Authorize payment."
- **Reasoning:** The normative process states that "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items." In Case 2, "Package items" was performed at 10:00 AM, before "Authorize payment," which happened at 10:30 AM.

#### **Case 3**

- **Violation 1:** "Ship order" occurred after "Cancel order."
- **Reasoning:** The normative process specifies that "Ship order" should never occur after "Cancel order," as cancellation implies the order will not be fulfilled. In Case 3, "Ship order" was performed at 10:00 AM, and "Cancel order" was performed at 09:40 AM.
- **Violation 2:** "Close order" occurred after "Ship order" in a canceled scenario.
- **Reasoning:** Once an order is canceled, the process should proceed directly to "Close order." However, in Case 3, "Close order" happened at 11:00 AM, after "Ship order."

#### **Case 4**

- **Violation:** "Close order" occurred after "Cancel order" without any intervening activities.
- **Reasoning:** While the normative process allows a direct transition from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order," the transition to "Close order" should still reflect the completion of the cancellation process. In Case 4, "Close order" was performed at 09:50 AM immediately after "Cancel order" at 09:20 AM, without any activities confirming the cancellation was finalized.

#### **Case 5**

- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurred before "Authorize payment," and "Close order" occurred after "Ship order."
- **Reasoning:** According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items," and "Ship order" should only occur after packaging. In Case 5, "Package items" (10:30 AM) happened before "Authorize payment" (10:00 AM). Additionally, "Close order" (11:30 AM) occurred after "Ship order" (11:00 AM), which is acceptable but worth noting for process efficiency.
