This data represents a **declaration process**, likely for expenses, reimbursements, or approvals within an organization. Let's break down the process based on the provided flow and frequencies:

**Key Stages and Paths:**

1. **Declaration Origination:**
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:**  This is the primary starting point for most declarations (high frequency).
   - **Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE:** Suggests a draft stage before submission (very low frequency).
   - **Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE:**  Indicates an employee can cancel or retract a declaration (moderate frequency) before it progresses.

2. **Initial Approvals (Multiple Paths):**
   - **Direct to SUPERVISOR:** Some declarations are directly submitted to the supervisor for final approval (moderate frequency).
   - **To ADMINISTRATION:** Most declarations go through the administration for initial review (high frequency).
   - **To PRE_APPROVER:** A subset is routed to a pre-approver before reaching the supervisor (lower frequency).

3. **Approval by ADMINISTRATION:**
   - **Approved:** Leads to further approvals by the Budget Owner or directly to the Supervisor (varying frequencies).
   - **Rejected:** Can lead to rejection by the employee or resubmission by the employee.

4. **Budget Owner Approval:**
   - **Approved:** Usually leads to final approval by the Supervisor (moderate frequency).
   - **Rejected:** Typically results in employee rejection (low frequency).

5. **Pre-Approver Approval:**
   - **Approved:** Primarily leads to final approval by the Supervisor (moderate frequency).
   - **Rejected:** Usually results in employee rejection (low frequency).

6. **Final Approval by SUPERVISOR:**
   - **Approved:** Triggers the "Request Payment" step (high frequency).
   - **Rejected:** Can lead to employee rejection or resubmission (lower frequencies).

7. **Request Payment:**
   - Leads to "Payment Handled" (very high frequency), indicating successful processing.
   - Occasionally results in "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" (very low frequency), suggesting potential issues.

8. **Payment Handled:**
   - Marks the successful completion of the payment process (high frequency).
   - In a rare case, it led to "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE", possibly indicating a post-payment issue.

9. **Rejections:**
   - Rejections can occur at multiple stages (Administration, Pre-Approver, Budget Owner, Supervisor, Missing).
   - Most rejections eventually lead back to "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" (various frequencies) for correction or cancellation.

**Observations and Insights:**

* **Main Flow:** The most common path appears to be Employee Submission -> Administration Approval -> Supervisor Final Approval -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled.
* **Variations:** Multiple paths and stakeholders (Pre-Approver, Budget Owner) suggest varying levels of complexity and approval requirements based on the declaration type or amount.
* **Rejections as Feedback Loops:** Rejections serve as crucial feedback loops, allowing employees to revise and resubmit their declarations.
* **Error Handling:** "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" suggests a mechanism for handling incomplete or erroneous submissions, though the details are unclear.
* **Performance Metrics:** The "performance" values indicate the average time (in unspecified units) spent at each stage. Higher performance values might indicate bottlenecks or complexities in those stages.

**Unclear Aspects:**

* **Declaration Type:**  The nature of the declarations (e.g., expenses, travel reimbursements, project approvals) is not explicitly mentioned.
* **Missing Reason:** The reason for "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" is undefined. It could represent missing information, documentation, or other issues.
* **Units of Performance:** The units for the "performance" metric are not provided, making it difficult to fully interpret the time durations.

**In Summary:** This data depicts a complex, multi-step declaration process with various approval paths and rejection feedback loops. The high frequency of successful payment handling suggests an efficient system, although understanding the specific declaration types and the reasons for "missing" rejections would provide further clarity. Analyzing the "performance" metrics with the appropriate units would also offer valuable insights into process efficiency and potential bottlenecks.
