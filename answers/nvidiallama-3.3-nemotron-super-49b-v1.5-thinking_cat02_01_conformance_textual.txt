Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process described and then compare each case in the event log against it to find deviations.

The normative process starts with "Receive order". Then, "Check inventory" must happen next. Depending on inventory availability, there are two paths:

1. **Sufficient Inventory**: The sequence should be Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package  Ship  Close.
2. **Insufficient Inventory**: The sequence should be Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.

Key constraints from the description:
- "Authorize payment" must come after "Check inventory" and before "Package".
- "Package" must be after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship".
- "Ship" should never come after "Cancel".
- "Close" must be the last activity in all cases.

Now, let's examine each case:

**Case 1**:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.
This follows the sufficient inventory path correctly. All steps are in order. No violations here.

**Case 2**:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Here, "Package" happens before "Authorize payment". According to the process, "Package" should only occur after authorization. So this is a violation. The order of Package and Authorize is swapped.

**Case 3**:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close.
First, after Check, they did Authorize, which is allowed if inventory was sufficient. But then they Cancel, which should only happen if inventory is insufficient. However, once Cancel is done, they shouldn't proceed to Ship. The normative process says after Cancel, it should go to Close. Shipping after Cancel is a violation. Also, Authorize before Cancel might be an issue if the inventory was insufficient. Wait, the process says if inventory is insufficient, after Check, it should go to Cancel. But here, they did Authorize before Cancel. That's a problem because if inventory was insufficient, they shouldn't have proceeded to Authorize. So two issues: Authorize before Cancel when it should be Check  Cancel, and then Ship after Cancel.

**Case 4**:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
This follows the insufficient inventory path correctly. No violations.

**Case 5**:
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close.
Missing "Package" between Authorize and Ship. The process requires Package after Authorize and before Ship. So skipping Package is a violation.

So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5.

Now, explaining each violation:

- **Case 2**: Package before Authorize. The normative process states that Package should only occur after payment authorization. Here, they packaged before authorizing, which violates the order.

- **Case 3**: 
  1. Authorize after Check but before Cancel. If inventory was insufficient, they should have gone directly to Cancel after Check. Authorizing payment when inventory is insufficient is incorrect.
  2. Ship after Cancel. The process states that after Cancel, the next step should be Close. Shipping after cancellation is illogical and violates the process.

- **Case 5**: Missing Package step. After Authorize, they should Package before Shipping. Skipping Package violates the required sequence.

I need to make sure there are no other issues. Let me double-check each case again.

Case 1: All steps in order. Correct.

Case 2: Check  Package  Authorize. Yes, Package before Authorize is wrong.

Case 3: Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship. The Authorize here is problematic if inventory was insufficient. Also, Ship after Cancel is wrong.

Case 4: Correct for cancellation.

Case 5: Missing Package. Correct.

Yes, that seems right.

### **1. Cases Violating the Normative Process**

The following cases deviate from the normative process:

- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

### **2. Explanation of Violations**

#### **Case 2**  
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  

**Violation:**  
- **Activity Order:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
  - **Normative Rule:** "Package items" should only occur *after* "Authorize payment" (since items must be prepared only after payment is confirmed).  
  - **Explanation:** The process requires payment authorization to precede packaging. By packaging before authorizing payment, the case violates the logical dependency between these steps.  

---

#### **Case 3**  
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  

**Violations:**  
1. **Premature Authorization:**  
   - **Activity Order:** "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order."  
   - **Normative Rule:** If inventory is insufficient (leading to cancellation), "Cancel order" should immediately follow "Check inventory" without intermediate steps like authorization.  
   - **Explanation:** Authorization implies inventory was sufficient, but the subsequent cancellation contradicts this. The process expects a direct transition to cancellation when inventory is lacking.  

2. **Illogical Shipping After Cancellation:**  
   - **Activity Order:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."  
   - **Normative Rule:** "Ship order" should *never* follow a cancellation, as canceled orders are not fulfilled.  
   - **Explanation:** Shipping after cancellation is logically inconsistent and violates the process’s requirement that fulfillment steps (e.g., packaging, shipping) are skipped in cancellation scenarios.  

---

#### **Case 5**  
**Sequence:**  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  

**Violation:**  
- **Missing Activity:** "Package items" is skipped between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."  
  - **Normative Rule:** "Package items" must occur after authorization and before shipping.  
  - **Explanation:** Skipping packaging violates the explicit sequence requirement. Items cannot be shipped without prior preparation.

| 3        | Premature authorization and illogical shipping after cancellation                  | Authorization should not precede cancellation; shipping is invalid post-cancellation     |
