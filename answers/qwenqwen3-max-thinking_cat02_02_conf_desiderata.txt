### **Analysis of Loan Application Process Compliance**

---

## **1. Normative Rule Violations (Strict Constraints)**

Normative rules define **mandatory** sequencing and conditional logic. Violations indicate **non-compliant** process executions.

### **Case 1:  Compliant**
- **Sequence:**  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- **All ordering and conditional rules are satisfied:**
  - Credit Check precedes Risk Assessment.
  - Risk Assessment precedes Loan Decision.
  - Applicant is informed after decision.
  - Documentation is finalized (as required for approved loans) before closing.
- **No normative violations.**

---

### **Case 2:  Multiple Normative Violations**

#### **Violation 1: Incorrect Activity Order**  
- **Observed:** Risk Assessment occurs **before** Credit Check.  
- **Rule Broken:** *"Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."*  
- **Impact:** This reverses a mandatory dependency, potentially compromising risk evaluation integrity.

#### **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Rejection**  
- **Observed:** Loan Decision = Rejected  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- **Rule Broken:** *"If the loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."*  
- **Impact:** Unnecessary and prohibited action; contradicts the conditional logic of the process.

> **Conclusion for Case 2:** This case **violates two core normative constraints** and is **non-compliant**.

---

## **2. Desiderata Violations (Recommended Best Practices)**

Desiderata are **soft constraints**—violations are **not severe** but indicate **suboptimal performance**.

### **Case 1:  Meets Desiderata**
- Credit Check completed **30 minutes** after application  within 24-hour window   
- Applicant informed **2 hours** after decision  within 48-hour window   
- **Follow-up Call:** Not present, but **optional** (only "encouraged")  no violation.

> **Note:** Absence of Follow-up Call is acceptable per desiderata definition.

---

### **Case 2:  Desiderata Not Assessed (Due to Normative Failure)**
- While timing could be evaluated, **normative violations dominate**.  
- However, for completeness:
  - Credit Check: 20 min after application  **within 24h**   
  - Inform Applicant: 30 min after decision  **within 48h**   
  - No Follow-up Call  acceptable.  
- **But:** Since the case is already non-compliant, desiderata are secondary.

---

### **Case 3:  Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal but Permissible)**

#### **Violation 1: Delayed Credit Check**  
- Application Received: **2024-01-12 09:00**  
- Credit Check: **2024-01-14 10:00**  **~55 hours later**  
- **Exceeds recommended 24-hour window**  **desideratum violation**  
- **Not a normative breach** (sequence is correct), but reflects **slow initiation**.

#### **Violation 2: Delayed Notification**  
- Loan Decision (Approved): **2024-01-14 12:00**  
- Inform Applicant: **2024-01-16 15:00**  **~51 hours later**  
- **Exceeds recommended 48-hour window**  **desideratum violation**  
- Again, **not a hard rule**, but may affect customer satisfaction.

#### **Violation 3: Missing Follow-up Call**  
- No "Follow-up Call" activity recorded before Close Case.  
- Since this is **only encouraged**, its absence is **not a violation**, but represents a **missed best practice**.

> **Conclusion for Case 3:** **Fully normatively compliant**, but **suboptimal** due to timing delays and lack of follow-up.

## **3. Interpretations & Justifications**

### **Case 2: Possible Explanations (Though Not Excusable)**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** May indicate a system error, manual override, or misrouting (e.g., agent assumed credit data was pre-loaded).  
- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Could stem from a flawed workflow template that always includes documentation, regardless of decision—suggesting a need for **conditional branching** in process automation.

> **Recommendation:** Audit system logic to enforce mandatory sequencing and decision-based activity gating.

---

### **Case 3: Plausible Justifications**
- **Delayed Credit Check (55h):** Possibly due to weekend/holiday gap (Jan 12–14 includes a weekend). If Jan 12 was a Friday, the check on Monday (Jan 14) might reflect **business-day-only processing**.  
  - **Suggestion:** Clarify whether desiderata windows refer to **calendar hours** or **business hours**.
- **Delayed Notification (51h):** Similarly, may span a weekend. If decision was Friday afternoon and notification Monday, it aligns with operational realities.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** May be omitted for low-risk or digital-only applications where verbal confirmation isn’t deemed necessary.

> **Recommendation:** Refine desiderata to specify **business hours** vs. **calendar time**, and define **risk-tier-based** follow-up policies.

## **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Key Issues |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1    |  Yes               |  Yes                 | None |
| 2    |  No                |  (timing OK)         | 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br>2. Finalize Documentation after Rejection |
| 3    |  Yes               |  No (suboptimal)     | 1. Credit Check >24h delay<br>2. Notification >48h delay<br>3. No Follow-up Call (optional but missed) |

### **Final Recommendations**
- **Enforce normative rules** via process engine constraints (e.g., BPMN gateways, validation rules).
- **Monitor desiderata** as KPIs (e.g., “% of cases with Credit Check within 24h”) for continuous improvement.
- **Clarify timing definitions** (business vs. calendar time) to avoid unfair desiderata penalties.
- **Implement conditional logic** to suppress “Finalize Documentation” when decision = Rejected.
