To determine which event log exhibits bias and how it manifests, let’s compare the two logs—Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group)—focusing on the attributes `LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`, and `ScoreAdjustment`, and their impact on the `FinalDecision`. Bias in this context refers to systematic differences in treatment or outcomes between groups that cannot be justified by objective differences in merit (e.g., PreliminaryScore alone).

### Key Observations from the Event Logs

#### Group A (Protected Group)
- **LocalResident**: All cases (P001, P002, P003) have `LocalResident = FALSE`.
- **CommunityGroup**: All cases have `CommunityGroup = None`.
- **PreliminaryScore**: Ranges from 710 to 740.
- **ScoreAdjustment**: Consistently 0 (no adjustments applied).
- **FinalDecision**: 
  - P001 (720): Approved
  - P002 (710): Rejected
  - P003 (740): Approved
- **Pattern**: Decisions appear to be based solely on the `PreliminaryScore`, with no adjustments. A score of 710 is rejected, while scores of 720 and 740 are approved, suggesting a threshold around 715–720.

#### Group B (Unprotected Group)
- **LocalResident**: All cases (U001, U002, U003) have `LocalResident = TRUE`.
- **CommunityGroup**: Two cases (U001, U003) are part of "Highland Civic Darts Club," one (U002) has `CommunityGroup = None`.
- **PreliminaryScore**: Ranges from 695 to 720.
- **ScoreAdjustment**: 
  - U001 (720): +10 (Community Boost), adjusted to 730
  - U002 (710): 0 (no adjustment)
  - U003 (695): +10 (Community Boost), adjusted to 705
- **FinalDecision**: 
  - U001 (730 adjusted): Approved
  - U002 (710): Rejected
  - U003 (705 adjusted): Approved
- **Pattern**: Decisions are influenced by both `PreliminaryScore` and `ScoreAdjustment`. The "Community Boost" of +10 is applied only to members of "Highland Civic Darts Club," impacting the final score and decision.

### Comparison and Bias Identification

#### Systematic Differences
1. **ScoreAdjustment Mechanism**:
   - **Group A**: No score adjustments are applied (`ScoreAdjustment = 0` for all cases).
   - **Group B**: Adjustments are applied selectively based on `CommunityGroup`. Cases U001 and U003 receive a +10 boost for being part of "Highland Civic Darts Club," while U002 (no community affiliation) receives no boost.
   - **Impact**: This adjustment is unavailable to Group A, as none of its members are local residents or part of a community group.

2. **LocalResident and CommunityGroup Influence**:
   - **Group A**: All cases are non-residents (`LocalResident = FALSE`) with no community affiliation (`CommunityGroup = None`), disqualifying them from any score boosts.
   - **Group B**: All cases are local residents (`LocalResident = TRUE`), and two out of three are part of a community group, enabling score adjustments for those cases.
   - **Impact**: The system favors Group B by offering an adjustment opportunity tied to residency and community involvement, attributes that Group A lacks entirely.

3. **Effect on Final Decisions**:
   - Compare P002 (Group A) and U003 (Group B):
     - P002: PreliminaryScore = 710, no adjustment, final score = 710, Rejected.
     - U003: PreliminaryScore = 695, +10 adjustment, final score = 705, Approved.
     - **Observation**: Despite P002 having a higher initial score (710) than U003’s adjusted score (705), P002 is rejected while U003 is approved. This suggests the adjustment mechanism can override raw merit (PreliminaryScore).
   - Compare P001 (Group A) and U001 (Group B):
     - P001: PreliminaryScore = 720, no adjustment, final score = 720, Approved.
     - U001: PreliminaryScore = 720, +10 adjustment, final score = 730, Approved.
     - **Observation**: Both are approved, but U001’s higher final score is due to the boost, giving Group B an edge in perceived qualification.

#### Which Log Exhibits Bias?
- **Group B’s Log Exhibits Bias**: The bias manifests in the `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism, which systematically favors Group B (Unprotected Group) over Group A (Protected Group). The "Community Boost" is applied only to Group B members who are local residents and part of a community group, inflating their scores and increasing their likelihood of approval. Group A, lacking these attributes, is evaluated solely on `PreliminaryScore`, with no opportunity for adjustment.

#### How Bias Manifests
- **Unequal Access to Score Boosts**: The adjustment policy is tied to `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`, attributes that disproportionately (or exclusively) benefit Group B. Group A, as non-residents with no community ties, is structurally excluded from this advantage.
- **Outcome Disparities**: 
  - U003 (Group B) with a PreliminaryScore of 695 is approved after a +10 boost (705), while P002 (Group A) with a higher PreliminaryScore of 710 is rejected due to no boost. This indicates that the adjustment can lead to approvals for Group B candidates who would otherwise fall below the approval threshold.
  - The approval threshold appears to be around 715–720 (based on P002’s rejection at 710 and P001’s approval at 720). The +10 boost pushes Group B applicants over this line, even if their initial scores are lower than Group A’s.
- **Systematic Favoritism**: The process embeds a preference for local residents and community group members, attributes that define Group B but not Group A. This creates an unfair advantage, as Group A’s outcomes depend entirely on raw scores, while Group B’s outcomes can be enhanced by external factors.

### Discussion: Factors Leading to Systematic Differences
1. **`LocalResident` Attribute**:
   - Group B’s universal status as local residents may correlate with eligibility for community-based benefits, such as the "Community Boost." Group A’s non-resident status excludes them from this, potentially reflecting a policy favoring locals over non-locals.

2. **`CommunityGroup` Attribute**:
   - Membership in "Highland Civic Darts Club" triggers the score adjustment in Group B. Since Group A has no such affiliations, this suggests the system rewards community involvement—an opportunity not extended to or feasible for Group A, possibly due to their non-resident status.

3. **`ScoreAdjustment` Policy**:
   - The +10 boost acts as a tiebreaker or threshold-crossing mechanism for Group B. For example, U003’s approval at 705 (from 695) shows how the adjustment can salvage a sub-threshold score, an option unavailable to Group A’s P002 at 710. This policy introduces bias by amplifying Group B’s scores without a corresponding mechanism for Group A.

4. **Potential Intent**:
   - The bias may reflect an intentional design to prioritize local residents or community contributors (Group B), possibly for social or economic reasons (e.g., supporting local engagement). However, this disadvantages Group A, the "Protected Group," which is counterintuitive if "protected" implies safeguards against unfair treatment.

### Conclusion
The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits bias due to the selective application of the `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism, which systematically advantages Group B over Group A. This bias manifests through unequal access to score boosts tied to `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`, leading to disparities in final decisions that favor Group B—sometimes approving lower-scoring applicants (e.g., U003 at 695) over higher-scoring Group A applicants (e.g., P002 at 710). The system’s design creates a structural preference for Group B, undermining fairness for Group A despite its "protected" label.
