1.What a “normal” Hire-to-Retire flow looks like (simplified linear view)  
   1. Post Job Ad  2. Screen Candidates  3. Conduct Interviews  4. Make Hiring Decision  
   5. Onboard Employee  6. Add employee to Payroll  7. Close Case  
   • Each step is executed exactly once.  
   • A later step never starts before all earlier steps are finished.  
   • No step that creates legal or financial obligations (payroll) may be skipped.


2.Anomalies in the two POWL models
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 1 (partial-order only)

A-1Decision can be taken before interviews are finished (or even before they start)  
Reason: Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide are the only relevant edges; there is **no edge Interview  Decide**.  
Impact: A hire could be approved without ever talking to the applicant (severe logical error).

A-2Interviews are not synchronized with any later activity  
Once Screen is done, Interview may float to any point in time—including after onboarding, after payroll, or even after the case is closed.  
Impact: Creates inconsistent or impossible states (employee already on the payroll while interviews are still going on).

A-3No possibility to skip legally required steps, no loops, no choices  
(That part is actually correct; all main steps are mandatory and executed once.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 2 (partial order + LOOP + XOR)

B-1Screening and interviewing may start in parallel  
Edges: Post  Screen and Post  Interview.  
Impact: Interviews can begin before résumés have been screened. This violates a good-practice order, but screening still happens, so the logical damage is moderate.

B-2The hiring decision depends on interviews only, not on screening  
Edge: Interview  Decide, but no Screen  Decide.  
Impact: A decision may be made while screening is still in progress (moderate anomaly).

B-3Payroll is optional  
Operator XOR = {Payroll, skip}. If the skip branch is chosen, the employee is never added to payroll.  
Impact: Severe violation—the company would have an on-boarded employee who cannot legally be paid or taxed.

B-4Unlimited repetition of “Onboard Employee”  
LOOP(Onboard, ) executes Onboard once, then may repeat it any number of times (because  lets the model return to the loop body).  
Impact: Mild anomaly—unlikely in practice but does not break the fundamental order of business-critical steps.


3.Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?

•  Model 1 keeps every mandatory step and never allows payroll to be skipped; its sequence from Decision onward (Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close) is perfectly in line with the standard flow.  
•  Its single major defect is that the hiring decision is not forced to wait for the interviews. While serious, it still produces a hire that can legally work and be paid.

•  Model 2, in contrast, can finish the process without ever paying the new hire (Payroll skip path). This is a hard compliance error: taxes, benefits, and labor-law obligations are violated.  
•  It also contains the less-critical loop and the parallel Screen/Interview issue.

Because omitting payroll is a business-critical, regulatory breach—arguably more damaging than making a decision too early—Model 1 is the variant that more closely matches a correct Hire-to-Retire process.


4.Summary of judgement

Closer to normative flowModel 1

Rationale  
• All mandatory activities are executed exactly once and in the right downstream order.  
• The only severe anomaly (Decision before Interviews) harms decision quality but not legal/payroll compliance.  
• Model 2, by contrast, allows the process to end with an on-boarded employee who is not in the payroll system, a fatal compliance error, and also contains further structural oddities (loop, out-of-order Screen/Interview).
