# Analysis of POWL Insurance Claims Process Model

## 1. Identified Anomalies

### **Anomaly 1: Evaluate-Approve Loop**
```python
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[E, P])
```
- **Issue**: The loop allows E (Evaluate) and P (Approve) to repeat indefinitely
- **Problem**: A claim could be evaluated and approved multiple times, creating redundant or contradictory states
- **Expected**: Single linear E  P sequence per claim

### **Anomaly 2: Skippable Customer Notification**
```python
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[N, skip])
```
- **Issue**: The XOR choice between N (Notify) and a silent transition allows claims to proceed without ever notifying the customer
- **Problem**: Violates customer service standards and may indicate missing communication
- **Expected**: N should be mandatory after approval

### **Anomaly 3: Premature Claim Closure**
```python
root.order.add_edge(A, C)  # Allows closing claim directly after assignment
```
- **Issue**: Direct edge from A (Assign Adjuster) to C (Close Claim) bypasses evaluation, approval, and notification
- **Problem**: Claims could be closed without substantive processing
- **Expected**: C should only follow N, ensuring full evaluation and customer notification first

### **Anomaly 4: Incomplete Partial Ordering**
```python
# Missing explicit ordering: xor -> C
root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)  # Added
# root.order.add_edge(xor, C)   # NOT added - allows concurrent/out-of-order execution
```
- **Issue**: No guarantee that notification/skipping completes before closure
- **Problem**: Enables race conditions where claims close before notification decisions are finalized

## 2. Hypotheses for Anomaly Origins

### **Hypothesis A: Legacy System Migration**
**Rationale**: When migrating from an older claims system, the new POWL model may have incorporated legacy execution paths
- Multiple evaluation-approval cycles might reflect manual re-reviews in the old system
- Customer notification XOR could stem from a legacy "auto-notify" flag that was sometimes disabled
- **Supporting Evidence**: Different claim types or time periods might show different anomaly frequencies

### **Hypothesis B: Business Rule Changes**
**Rationale**: Process model reflects partial implementation of new policies
- New business decision: allow adjusters to request re-evaluation (explaining the loop)
- Policy change to support expedited claim closure for certain claim types (explaining AC edge)
- New optional notification channel implementation (explaining XOR)
- **Supporting Evidence**: Anomalies might correlate with specific claim types, regions, or date ranges

### **Hypothesis C: Inadequate Tool Configuration**
**Rationale**: Process design tool lacked proper constraint enforcement
- Designer may have intended strict sequencing but tool defaults allowed partial ordering
- Loop may have been added as a "temporary" placeholder never properly replaced
- XOR skipping option may have been a testing configuration left in production
- **Supporting Evidence**: Anomalies might appear suddenly at a specific deployment date

### **Hypothesis D: Departmental Miscommunication**
**Rationale**: Different departments designed different sections without integration
- Adjusters team created the E-P loop for their workflow autonomy
- IT added the AC shortcut to support "quick-close" requests without consulting operations
- Customer service wasn't consulted on the N skip option
- **Supporting Evidence**: Anomalies might cluster by adjuster specialization or region

### **Hypothesis E: Error Handling Gone Wrong**
**Rationale**: Anomalies represent exception handling that leaked into the main model
- Loop could be an unfinished "retry" mechanism for failed evaluations
- Skip path might be for handling auto-claims or fraud cases
- Premature closure might support "withdraw claim" scenarios
- **Supporting Evidence**: Additional info fields in claim_events might reference error codes or special statuses

## 3. Verification Queries Against the Database

### **Query 1: Identify Claims Closed Without Evaluation**
```sql
-- Claims that reached "Close" without ever having "Evaluate" activity
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.submission_date,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) as evaluate_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) as close_count,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) as close_timestamp
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
)
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, c.submission_date
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) = 0
ORDER BY close_timestamp DESC;
```

**What it detects**: Anomaly 3 (premature closure via AC edge)

---

### **Query 2: Identify Claims Closed Without Approval**
```sql
-- Claims that reached "Close" without "Approve" activity
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) as approve_count,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ce.activity ORDER BY ce.activity, ',') as activities_performed,
    COUNT(ce.event_id) as total_events
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'C'
)
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) = 0
ORDER BY total_events DESC;
```

**What it detects**: Multiple anomalies (premature closure, skipped approval steps)

---

### **Query 3: Identify Multiple Approve Events (Loop Evidence)**
```sql
-- Claims with multiple "Approve" events for the same claim
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) as approve_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) as evaluate_count,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) as first_approve,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) as last_approve,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM 
        MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - 
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END)
    ) / 3600 as approve_span_hours
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) > 1
ORDER BY approve_count DESC, approve_span_hours DESC;
```

**What it detects**: Anomaly 1 (E-P loop causing multiple approvals)

---

### **Query 4: Identify Claims Without Customer Notification**
```sql
-- Claims that were approved but never notified customer (XOR skip)
SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN 1 END) as notify_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) as approve_count,
    MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) as approve_timestamp,
    COUNT(ce.event_id) as total_events,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT ce.activity ORDER BY ce.activity, ',') as all_activities
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE c.claim_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT claim_id 
    FROM claim_events 
    WHERE activity IN ('P', 'C')  -- Approved or closed
)
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN 1 END) > 0
    AND COUNT(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN 1 END) = 0
ORDER BY approve_timestamp DESC;
```

**What it detects**: Anomaly 2 (skippable notification via XOR)

-- Identify claims where activities occur in unexpected order
-- E.g., Close before Evaluate, or Notify before Assign
WITH event_sequence AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq_num,
        LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity
    FROM claim_events
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY seq_num, ' -> ') as activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN prev_activity IN ('C') AND activity NOT IN ('C') THEN 1 END) as post_close_activities,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN prev_activity IN ('A', 'P', 'N') AND activity = 'E' THEN 1 END) as late_evaluations,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN prev_activity IN ('P', 'N', 'C') AND activity = 'A' THEN 1 END) as reassignments
FROM event_sequence
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN prev_activity IN ('C') AND activity NOT IN ('C') THEN 1 END) > 0
    OR COUNT(CASE WHEN prev_activity IN ('P', 'N', 'C') AND activity = 'A' THEN 1 END) > 0

## Summary Table: Mapping Anomalies to Queries

| Anomaly | Primary Query | Expected Findings |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **E-P Loop** | Query 3 | Multiple P events per claim with repeated E-P-E-P patterns |
| **Skippable Notification** | Query 4 | Approved claims with zero N events |
| **Premature Closure** | Query 1, 5 | Claims closed before E or P; C appearing early in sequences |
| **Incomplete Ordering** | Query 5 | Activities after C; N and C simultaneous or reversed |
| **Root Cause** | Query 6, 7 | Patterns by type/region/time revealing systematic issues |

This comprehensive approach combines structural analysis of the POWL model with evidence-based database queries to both confirm anomalies and identify their origins.
