To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, we need to integrate data from all the provided tables. Each row in the final event log will represent an event in the lifecycle of an order, with columns for `Case ID`, `Activity Name`, `Timestamp`, `Resource/Actor`, and any other relevant attributes.

### Steps to Create the Event Log:

1. **Identify Cases**: The `order_id` serves as the unique identifier for each case (process instance).
2. **Derive Activities**: Convert key steps into events:
   - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table.
   - "Items Picked" from the `Order Lines` table.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table.
   - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table.
   - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table.
3. **Map Timestamps**: Use the timestamps provided in each table to ensure chronological correctness.
4. **Combine Data**: Link events using `order_id` and other keys (e.g., `invoice_id`, `delivery_id`).
5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: Include information about who performed the activity (e.g., `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`).

### Assumptions:
- If an order has multiple items, each item picking is treated as a separate event.
- If an order has multiple deliveries or invoices, each delivery or invoice issuance is treated as a separate event.
- Payments are linked to invoices, which are then linked back to orders.

### Explanation:
- Each row represents a single event in the lifecycle of an order.
- Events are ordered chronologically within each `order_id`.
- Resources (e.g., salespersons, warehouse staff, carriers) are mapped using the `Resources` table.
- Additional attributes (e.g., customer type, payment method) provide context for analysis.
