# Integrated Event Log for Process Mining

Below is the comprehensive event log derived from the provided ERP tables. Each row represents a single event in the lifecycle of an order, with consistent case identifiers (`order_id`), descriptive activity names, accurate timestamps, and enriched resource/actor information.

**Assumptions Made**:
- **Case ID**: `order_id` is used as the case identifier, as instructed.
- **Activity Granularity**: 
  - Each item-picking event is treated as a separate "Item Picked" activity (since timestamps and resources differ per line).
  - Each delivery record generates two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
  - Each invoice generates one "Invoice Issued" event.
  - Each payment generates one "Payment Received" event.
- **Resource Mapping**: Resource IDs (e.g., `SP-001`, `WH-001`) are replaced with actual names from the `Resources` table for clarity.
- **Missing Data**: 
  - Order 1004 has no invoice or payment records, so its process ends at delivery arrival.
  - No explicit "Order Completed" event is added; the process naturally ends with the last recorded event per order.
- **Chronology**: All events are ordered by timestamp within each case.
