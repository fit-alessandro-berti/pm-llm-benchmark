### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive  Approve (R  P)**  
   - Average: ~25 hours  
   - Standard Deviation: Only 1 hour  
    Suspiciously consistent timing. Real-world claim approvals typically involve variable review times; such low variance suggests artificial scheduling or batch processing rather than organic workflow.

2. **Approve  Notify (P  N)**  
   - Average: 7 days  
   - Standard Deviation: 2 days  
    Extremely long and highly variable delay. Indicates systemic lag, possibly due to manual handoffs, communication bottlenecks, or prioritization issues.

3. **Assign  Close (A  C)**  
   - Average: 2 hours  
   - Standard Deviation: 1 hour  
    Claims closing rapidly after assignment, potentially skipping critical steps like evaluation or approval. Suggests premature closures or automated shortcuts.

4. **Evaluate  Notify (E  N)**  
   - Average: 5 minutes  
   - Standard Deviation: 1 minute  
    Unrealistically fast transition. Implies either automation skipping human review, mislabeled events, or missing intermediate steps (e.g., no approval recorded).

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P Consistency**  
   - Approval may be batched at fixed daily intervals (e.g., end-of-day auto-approvals for low-risk claims), creating artificial uniformity.  
   - Could also indicate system-generated timestamps not reflecting actual human decision time.

2. **P  N Delay**  
   - Notification may be manually triggered by staff only after compiling documents or scheduling customer calls, leading to backlog accumulation.  
   - Could reflect regional or adjuster-specific delays due to workload imbalance.

3. **A  C Premature Closure**  
   - Adjusters may be closing claims without proper documentation due to performance pressure.  
   - Could also indicate system errors where “Close” is auto-triggered after assignment for certain claim types (e.g., duplicates or test claims).

4. **E  N Speed**  
   - Evaluation and notification may be conflated in the system — e.g., “Notify” is logged immediately upon system-generated evaluation without human intervention.  
   - May also indicate missing “Approve” events due to logging errors, making it appear that evaluation directly triggers notification.

### Verification SQL Queries

#### 1. Identify claims with unusually fast RP transitions (low variance cluster)
```sql
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM 
    claim_events r
JOIN 
    claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE 
    r.activity = 'R' 
    AND p.activity = 'P'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600  -- 24–26 hours
ORDER BY 
    r_to_p_seconds;
```

#### 2. Flag claims with extreme PN delays (>9 days or <5 days)
```sql
SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    p.timestamp AS approve_time,
    n.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_to_notify,
    c.claim_type,
    a.region,
    a.name AS adjuster_name
FROM 
    claim_events p
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON n.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE 
    p.activity = 'P' 
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND (
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 777600  -- >9 days
        OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) < 432000 -- <5 days
    )
ORDER BY 
    days_to_notify DESC;
```

#### 3. Detect claims closed shortly after assignment (potential skipped steps)
```sql
SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    a.timestamp AS assign_time,
    c.timestamp AS close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_to_close,
    COUNT(e.event_id) FILTER (WHERE e.activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N')) AS intermediate_steps
FROM 
    claim_events a
JOIN 
    claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    claim_events e ON a.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.timestamp > a.timestamp AND e.timestamp < c.timestamp
WHERE 
    a.activity = 'A'
    AND c.activity = 'C'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200  -- <2 hours
GROUP BY 
    a.claim_id, a.timestamp, c.timestamp
HAVING 
    COUNT(e.event_id) FILTER (WHERE e.activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N')) = 0  -- No intermediate steps
ORDER BY 
    hours_to_close;
```

#### 4. Investigate claims with EN transitions under 6 minutes
```sql
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    e.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
    n.timestamp AS notify_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_seconds,
    c.claim_type,
    a.specialization
FROM 
    claim_events e
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON e.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE 
    e.activity = 'E' 
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 360  -- <6 minutes
ORDER BY 
    e_to_n_seconds;
```

#### 5. Correlate anomalies with adjuster or claim type (example: PN delays by region)
```sql
SELECT 
    a.region,
    COUNT(*) AS delayed_notifications,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400) AS avg_days_to_notify
FROM 
    claim_events p
JOIN 
    claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN 
    adjusters a ON p.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
WHERE 
    p.activity = 'P' 
    AND n.activity = 'N'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800  -- >7 days
GROUP BY 
    a.region
ORDER BY 
    avg_days_to_notify DESC;
```

These queries can isolate anomalous cases, correlate them with operational variables (adjuster, region, claim type), and help determine whether the timing irregularities are systemic, role-specific, or data-logging artifacts.
