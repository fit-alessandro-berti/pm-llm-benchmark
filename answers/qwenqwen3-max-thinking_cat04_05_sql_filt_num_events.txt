Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subquery**: The inner query groups all events by `case_id` and uses `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to filter only those cases that have 6 or fewer events total.

2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects all events from the original `event_log` table where the `case_id` is in the filtered list from the subquery.

3. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `case_id` and then by `timestamp` to maintain logical sequence within each case (this is optional but helpful for readability).

**Alternative approach using window functions** (more efficient for large datasets):

```sql
SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp
FROM (
    SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as case_event_count
    FROM event_log
) filtered_events
WHERE case_event_count <= 6
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

Both queries will produce the same result, but the window function approach may perform better on larger datasets since it avoids the potential overhead of the `IN` subquery with a large list of case IDs.
