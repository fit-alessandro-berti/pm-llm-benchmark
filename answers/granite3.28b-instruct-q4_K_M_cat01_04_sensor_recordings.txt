**Analysis and Labeled Activities:**

1. **Phase 1: Initialization (Events 1-3)**
   - Description: Machine initialization with gradual increase in temperature.
   - Rationale: Temperature rises slowly from 20°C to 21°C, indicating the machine warming up. Vibration and material flow remain low, suggesting no active operations yet.

   **Label:** Initialization

2. **Phase 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)**
   - Description: Sudden spikes in temperature, pressure, vibration, and energy consumption accompanied by material flow.
   - Rationale: The quick rise in temperature from 50°C to 58°C, coupled with a significant increase in pressure (from 1 bar to 1.5 bar), vibration (from 30 Hz to 38 Hz), and energy consumption (from 2 kWh to 3 kWh), suggests the start of a cutting operation as material is being processed.

   **Label:** Cutting Metal

3. **Phase 3: Stabilization/Assembling Parts (Events 7-10)**
   - Description: Steady, moderate conditions with consistent material flow and tool movement.
   - Rationale: A stable temperature around 40°C, pressure at 2 bar, vibration at around 10 Hz, constant material flow of 2 units/s, and slowly changing tool position (from 5 mm to 15 mm) suggest an assembling or preparation phase. The low energy consumption also supports this interpretation as less intensive operations are likely taking place.

   **Label:** Assembling Parts

4. **Phase 4: Welding (Events 11-12)**
   - Description: Elevated temperature, pressure, vibration, and material flow with a slight increase in energy consumption.
   - Rationale: The sustained high levels of temperature (around 25°C), pressure (at 1 bar), vibration (5 Hz), and material flow (1 unit/s) alongside moderate energy usage (from 1.5 kWh to 1.6 kWh) indicate a welding operation, where parts are joined together under controlled conditions.

   **Label:** Welding

5. **Phase 5: Cooling Down/Final Adjustments (Events 13-15)**
   - Description: Gradual decrease in temperature, pressure, and vibration back to baseline levels with minimal material flow and energy usage.
   - Rationale: The return to lower temperatures (20°C), pressures (1 bar), and vibrations (0 Hz), alongside reduced material flow and energy consumption (0.5 kWh), suggests the machine is cooling down or performing final minor adjustments post-operation, ready for the next cycle.

   **Label:** Cooling Down/Final Adjustments

This process mining analysis infers high-level manufacturing activities from raw sensor data by identifying distinct patterns and changes in various parameters over time, attributing each phase to a plausible operation based on typical behavior associated with cutting, assembling, welding, and post-operation phases.
