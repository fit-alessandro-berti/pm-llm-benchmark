**Analysis of POWL Model 1:**

In the first model, we see the following sequence:

1. **Post Job Ad**  **Screen Candidates**  **Conduct Interviews** (in parallel with **Screen Candidates**)  **Make Hiring Decision**  **Onboard Employee**  **Add to Payroll**  **Close Case**

**Anomalies in Model 1:**
- **Parallel Execution of Screen Candidates and Conduct Interviews:** This suggests that interviews are conducted while candidates are still being screened. In a standard Hire-to-Retire process, one would typically screen candidates first before conducting interviews. Conducting interviews concurrently with screening may lead to inefficiencies or misalignment if decisions about candidates are made based on incomplete information.
- **Linear Flow Without Choices or Loops:** This model lacks any form of choice (e.g., deciding whether to conduct interviews) or looping (e.g., repeating the screening process if no suitable candidates are found). In real hiring processes, there are often decision points and potential loops for re-evaluation.

**Analysis of POWL Model 2:**

In the second model, the sequence is:

1. **Post Job Ad**  **Screen Candidates** (in parallel with **Conduct Interviews**)  **Make Hiring Decision**  **Onboard Employee (Loop)**  **Add to Payroll (Choice)**  **Close Case**

**Anomalies in Model 2:**
- **Parallel Execution of Screen Candidates and Conduct Interviews:** Similar to Model 1, this anomaly implies interviews are conducted simultaneously with screening, which may not be efficient or logical.
- **Loops for Onboarding:** The presence of a loop on the **Onboard Employee** activity suggests that onboarding could be repeated, which is unusual for a standard hiring process. Typically, onboarding is a one-time process once an employee is hired.
- **Choice for Payroll Addition:** The **Add to Payroll** activity is represented as a choice, suggesting that it may or may not occur. This deviation implies uncertainty or variability that might not be typical in a well-structured hiring process, where adding an employee to the payroll should follow logically from the hiring decision.

**Comparison and Normative Alignment:**

- **Model 1** has a linear flow with no explicit choices or loops, which deviates from real-world hiring processes that often involve decision points and iterative steps. Its anomaly is primarily in the parallel execution of screening and interviews, which violates the expected sequence of events.
  
- **Model 2**, while also having the same parallel execution anomaly, introduces additional irregularities with the loop for onboarding and choice for payroll addition. These anomalies deviate more significantly from the normative Hire-to-Retire process, making it less aligned with typical hiring practices.

**Conclusion:**

Model 1 is closer to a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process despite having an anomaly related to parallel execution of screening and interviews. The deviations in Model 2—specifically the loop for onboarding and choice for payroll addition—introduce more fundamental issues that affect the integrity and correctness of the hiring process. These anomalies in Model 2 could lead to operational inefficiencies and legal or compliance concerns.

Therefore, **Model 1** is considered more aligned with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process due to fewer and less severe deviations from expected hiring practices.
