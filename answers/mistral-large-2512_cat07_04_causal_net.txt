The provided diagram is a process model, specifically a workflow net, illustrating the handling of a request through various stages. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Main Workflow Diagram:
1. **Start (a: register request)**
   - The process begins with registering a request.

2. **Examination (b, c, d)**
   - **b: examine thoroughly**
     - The request can be examined thoroughly.
   - **c: examine casually**
     - Alternatively, the request can be examined casually.
   - **d: check ticket**
     - Another path involves checking the ticket.

3. **Decision Point (e: decide)**
   - After examination, a decision is made:
     - **g: pay compensation**
       - If approved, compensation is paid, leading to the end of the process (z: end).
     - **h: reject request**
       - If rejected, the request ends here or may be redirected.

4. **Reinitiation (f: reinitiate request)**
   - If further action is needed, the request can be reinitiated, looping back to the examination stages.

5. **End (z: end)**
   - The process concludes either after paying compensation or rejecting the request.

### Workflow Patterns (Inset):
The inset in the diagram illustrates common workflow patterns used in process modeling:

1. **Split Patterns:**
   - **XOR-split:**
     - A point where only one of several branches is chosen based on a condition.
   - **AND-split:**
     - A point where all outgoing branches are executed simultaneously.
   - **OR-split:**
     - A point where one or more branches can be executed based on conditions.

2. **Join Patterns:**
   - **XOR-join:**
     - A point where multiple incoming branches converge into a single path, but only one of the incoming branches was active.
   - **AND-join:**
     - A point where multiple parallel branches converge, and all must be completed before proceeding.
   - **OR-join:**
     - A point where one or more active incoming branches converge, and the process continues once all active branches have completed.

### Summary:
The main diagram represents a structured process for handling requests, involving registration, examination (thorough, casual, or ticket check), decision-making (pay or reject), and potential reinitiation. The inset explains fundamental workflow patterns that can be used to manage branching and merging within such processes.
