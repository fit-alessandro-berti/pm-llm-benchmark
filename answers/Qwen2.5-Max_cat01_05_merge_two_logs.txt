### Merged Event Log

Below is the integrated event log, combining events from **Log A** and **Log B**. Each merged event includes all available attributes from both logs. Events that could not be confidently matched are included as-is, with their origin noted.

### **Reasoning for Merging Decisions**

1. **Event Matching Criteria**:
   - Events were matched based on a combination of `order_id` and timestamp proximity (within ±2 seconds).
   - Event names in **Log A** and **Log B** were mapped based on semantic similarity:
     - "Order Received" ↔ "OrderReceived"
     - "Order Validated" ↔ "OrderValidation"
     - "Payment Processed" ↔ "PaymentCheck"
     - "Item Shipped" ↔ "Shipping"

2. **Handling Timestamp Differences**:
   - If timestamps differed by less than 2 seconds, the events were considered the same occurrence.
   - For example:
     - **Order Validated**: Log A (`10:01:30`) and Log B (`10:01:29`) differ by 1 second → merged.
     - **Item Shipped**: Log A (`10:05:00`) and Log B (`10:05:02`) differ by 2 seconds → merged.

3. **Attribute Integration**:
   - For merged events, attributes from both logs were combined. Missing attributes in one log were left blank (`-`).
   - Example:
     - **Payment Processed**: Combined attributes from Log A (`timestamp`, `event_type`, `order_id`) and Log B (`user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`).

4. **Unmatched Events**:
   - Events present in only one log were included as-is, with their origin noted.
   - Example:
     - **Quality Check**: Only in Log B → included as-is.
     - **Order Received (Log A)**: No exact match in Log B → included as-is.

5. **Chronological Ordering**:
   - Events were sorted chronologically based on the primary timestamp (`timestamp` field). If timestamps were identical, Log A's event was prioritized.

### **Key Observations and Decisions**

1. **Duplicate Events**:
   - Some events appear slightly offset in time but represent the same activity (e.g., "Order Received" in Log A and Log B). These were merged into a single record.
   - For clarity, both timestamps were preserved where relevant.

2. **Non-Overlapping Events**:
   - Events like "Quality Check" (Log B) and "Item Delivered" (Log A) had no counterpart in the other log. These were retained separately.

3. **Semantic Mapping**:
   - Event names were normalized to ensure consistency across logs. For example, "PaymentCheck" in Log B was mapped to "Payment Processed" in Log A.

4. **Timestamp Tolerance**:
   - A tolerance of ±2 seconds was used to account for minor discrepancies in recording times between systems.

### **Final Notes**

This merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, enriched with attributes from both systems. The approach ensures minimal data loss while maintaining clarity about the origin of each event. Any ambiguities or unmatched events are explicitly documented for further investigation if needed.
