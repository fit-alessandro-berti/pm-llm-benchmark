The picture is a Petri-net-style process model (often called a workflow net) that shows how an insurancetype “request for compensation” case can proceed, together with a small legend that explains the routing constructs that are used.

1. Graph elements  
   • White rounded rectangles (a … z) = transitions / activities of the process.  
   • Black dots = places; they hold the tokens that indicate the current state of a case.  
   • Directed arcs connect places and transitions, forming the causal flow.

2. Main process (upper-left to lower-right)  
   a  register request  (Start – a single token is assumed to be in the input place of a.)  

   From a an OR-split fires: one, two or all three of the following activities may be taken  
   • b  examine thoroughly  
   • c  examine casually  
   • d  check ticket  

   After whichever paths were chosen finish, their tokens are synchronised in an OR-join and the case continues with  

   e  decide  

   • If the information is incomplete, e can send the case back to  
     f  re-initiate request, which in turn loops back to d (check ticket) so the examination cycle can restart.  
   • Otherwise e performs an XOR-split: exactly one of the two outcomes is selected  
     g  pay compensation  or  h  reject request  

   Both g and h end in a simple place that leads to  

   z  end, where the final token is consumed and the case is finished.

3. Legend (bottom-right grey panel)  
   The six mini-nets illustrate how the different control-flow connectors are encoded with places and arcs:  
   • XOR-split / XOR-join (exclusive choice)  
   • AND-split / AND-join  (parallelism)  
   • OR-split / OR-join    (inclusive choice / synchronisation)

4. Reading the net  
   • A token leaves the start place, fires transition a, and then is routed according to the OR-split.  
   • Tokens generated by an AND-split must all be produced and later collected by a matching AND-join.  
   • For an XOR-split exactly one branch is taken; for an OR-split any non-empty subset may be taken and the matching OR-join waits for whichever branches were actually started.  
   • When the token finally reaches z, the case is complete.

In short, the visualisation is a Petri-net representation of a request-handling workflow that shows three types of branching (exclusive, parallel, inclusive) and a loop for re-initiating the request if additional information is needed.
