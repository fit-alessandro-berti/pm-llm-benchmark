Anomalies observed
1) R  P: Mean ~25 hours with very low stdev (1 hour). Unusually tight distribution suggests clocked/overnight batch approvals or timestamp rounding/defaults.
2) P  N: Mean 7 days with high stdev (2 days). Large and variable lag implies backlog, manual outreach delays, or dependency on customer response.
3) A  C: Mean 2 hours, implying frequent closure shortly after assignment, potentially bypassing E/P or representing auto-closures.
4) E  N: Mean 5 minutes with low stdev. Near-instant notifications suggest automation; may conflict with expected approval-before-notify sequence.

Hypotheses
- R  P tight timing:
  - Batch job runs at a fixed schedule.
  - Approval timestamp reflects scheduled time rather than actual decision.
  - Data import rounding to the nearest hour.
- P  N long/variable:
  - Manual notification or external channel queue causing backlog.
  - Wait for customer documents before notifying.
  - Resource/region-based staffing gaps; weekends/holidays.
- A  C rapid closure:
  - Auto-close for duplicate/invalid claims after triage.
  - Workflow skipping due to business rules (e.g., small claims auto-denied).
  - Mis-ordered events or missing E/P events.
- E  N immediate:
  - Automated notifications triggered at evaluation completion.
  - Missing approval event for certain claim types/thresholds.
  - Parallel paths where N follows E for “no-approval-required” cases.

Verification via SQL
Notes:
- Replace intervals and thresholds as needed.
- Use DISTINCT ON to get first/last events per claim/activity.
- Add filters by claim_type, region, resource for segmentation.

Helper CTEs to get key event timestamps per claim
WITH first_events AS (
  SELECT
    ce.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS t_r,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS t_a,

    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS t_p,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS t_n,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS t_c
  FROM claim_events ce
  GROUP BY ce.claim_id
)
-- Use the CTE below in subsequent queries:
SELECT * FROM first_events LIMIT 1;

1) Check R  P unusually tight distribution and schedule alignment
-- Distribution summary and stdev
SELECT

FROM first_events
WHERE t_r IS NOT NULL AND t_p IS NOT NULL;

-- Are approvals clustered at fixed clock times? (e.g., on the hour)
SELECT

GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY approvals DESC
LIMIT 24;

-- Difference to nearest hour to detect rounding
SELECT
  ROUND(EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM t_p)) AS minute_mark,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM first_events
WHERE t_p IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

-- By claim_type/region to see segmentation

  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (f.t_n - f.t_p))/3600 AS hours_delay
FROM first_events f
WHERE f.t_p IS NOT NULL AND f.t_n IS NOT NULL
  AND f.t_n > f.t_p

3) Identify A  C rapid closures and missing E/P
-- Claims closed within 2 hours of assignment
SELECT f.claim_id, f.t_a, f.t_c,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (f.t_c - f.t_a))/3600 AS hours_a_to_c,

WHERE f.t_a IS NOT NULL AND f.t_c IS NOT NULL
  AND f.t_c - f.t_a <= INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY n DESC;

4) Evaluate E  N immediate transitions and approval ordering

)
SELECT d.claim_id, d.sec_rp, (d.sec_rp - s.mu)/NULLIF(s.sigma,0) AS z
FROM diffs d CROSS JOIN stats s
WHERE s.sigma IS NOT NULL AND ABS((d.sec_rp - s.mu)/s.sigma) >= 3
ORDER BY ABS((d.sec_rp - s.mu)/s.sigma) DESC
LIMIT 200;

6) Flow conformance checks
-- Count claims missing E or P entirely before C
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN f.t_e IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS claims_missing_e,
  SUM(CASE WHEN f.t_p IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS claims_missing_p
FROM first_events f
WHERE f.t_c IS NOT NULL;

-- Cases where N occurs before P
SELECT f.claim_id, f.t_n, f.t_p
FROM first_events f
WHERE f.t_n IS NOT NULL AND f.t_p IS NOT NULL AND f.t_n < f.t_p
LIMIT 200;

7) Resource and region correlation for anomalies
-- PN > 5 days by adjuster region
SELECT a.region,
  COUNT(*) AS n_delayed
FROM first_events f
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = f.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE f.t_p IS NOT NULL AND f.t_n IS NOT NULL
  AND f.t_n - f.t_p > INTERVAL '5 days'
GROUP BY a.region
ORDER BY n_delayed DESC;

-- AC <= 2 hours by adjuster specialization
SELECT a.specialization,
  COUNT(*) AS n_fast_closures
FROM first_events f
JOIN claim_events ce ON ce.claim_id = f.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE f.t_a IS NOT NULL AND f.t_c IS NOT NULL
  AND f.t_c - f.t_a <= INTERVAL '2 hours'
GROUP BY a.specialization
ORDER BY n_fast_closures DESC;

These queries will help pinpoint anomalous cases, reveal whether anomalies cluster by claim type, amount, region, adjuster/resource, or time-of-week, and test whether steps are being skipped or batched.
