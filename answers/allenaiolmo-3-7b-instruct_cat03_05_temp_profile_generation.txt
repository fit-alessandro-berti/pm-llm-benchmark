**Notes for the model or user:**
- The `average_time` and `standard_deviation` values are plausible estimates based on typical supply chain workflows in high-tech manufacturing. These are illustrative and should be adjusted based on real process data or domain knowledge.
- Pairs included are not only immediate but also those that could be realized in longer, non-optimal executions (e.g., with delays at each step).
- The standard deviations reflect the typical variability in such processes.
- The dictionary structure matches the required format: `{(activity1, activity2): (avg_time, std_dev)}`.
