Here’s a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process, accounting for realistic delays between activities (including indirect pairs like `('SS', 'AS')` via multiple steps). The values reflect estimated average times and standard deviations based on industry benchmarks, process complexity, and variability in supply chain operations.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs (immediate transitions)
    ('SS', 'OP'): (7200, 1800),          # Supplier selection  order placement (avg: 2h, std: 30min)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (43200, 7200),         # Order placement  receiving components (avg: 12h, std: 2h)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 900),           # Receiving  quality inspection (avg: 1h, std: 15min)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 1800),          # Inspection  assembly (avg: 2h, std: 30min)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (10800, 2700),         # Assembly  testing (avg: 3h, std: 45min)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),          # Testing  packaging (avg: 2h, std: 30min)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 3600),         # Packaging  warehouse storage (avg: 1 day, std: 1h)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (100800, 21600),       # Storage  distribution (avg: 3 days, std: 6h)

    # Indirect pairs (e.g., via multiple steps)
    ('SS', 'WS'): (168000, 33600),       # SS  WS (avg: 4.6 days, std: 1d)
    ('SS', 'AS'): (259200, 51840),       # SS  AS (avg: 7 days, std: 1.4d)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (216000, 43200),       # OP  AS (avg: 6 days, std: 1.2d)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (145800, 29160),       # RC  DT (avg: 4 days, std: 0.8d)
    ('QI', 'AS'): (181440, 36288),       # QI  AS (avg: 5 days, std: 1d)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (100800, 21600),       # CA  WS (avg: 3 days, std: 6h)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (181440, 36288),       # PT  AS (avg: 5 days, std: 1d)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (181440, 36288),       # PK  AS (avg: 5 days, std: 1d)
    ('WS', 'AS'): (100800, 21600),       # WS  AS (avg: 3 days, std: 6h)

    # Longer chains (e.g., full cycle with variability)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (259200, 51840),       # SS  DT (avg: 7 days, std: 1.4d)
    ('OP', 'AS'): (216000, 43200),       # OP  AS (avg: 6 days, std: 1.2d)
    ('RC', 'AS'): (216000, 43200),       # RC  AS (avg: 6 days, std: 1.2d)
}
```

### Key Assumptions:
1. **Supplier Selection (SS)  Order Placement (OP)**:
   - Fast (2 hours avg) due to digital catalogs/quotations, but variability from supplier response times.

2. **Order Placement (OP)  Receive Components (RC)**:
   - Longer (12 hours avg) due to procurement lead times, but standard deviation reflects delays from supplier capacity or customs.

3. **Indirect Pairs (e.g., `SS`  `AS`)**:
   - Account for the full supply chain duration (e.g., 7 days avg) with high variability (1.4 days std) due to dependencies like supplier reliability, inspection delays, or distribution bottlenecks.

4. **Warehouse Storage (WS)  Distribution (DT)**:
   - High variability (6 hours std) due to inventory management, shipping schedules, or last-mile delays.

5. **After-Sales Support (AS)**:
   - Longer delays (5–7 days avg) due to product returns, warranty claims, or field service coordination.

### Notes:
- Values are **approximate** and scaled for a high-tech manufacturing environment.
- For real-world use, these should be **calculated from actual event logs** (e.g., using tools like [PetriNet](https://petrinet.github.io/) or [Temporal Process Mining](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/temporal-process-mining)).
- Adjust `ZETA` (e.g., `ZETA=2`) to define stricter/tighter thresholds for deviations.
