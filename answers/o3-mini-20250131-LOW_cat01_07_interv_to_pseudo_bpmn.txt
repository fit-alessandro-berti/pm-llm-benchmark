Below is a structured BPMN-like textual model of the invoice approval process as derived from the interview accounts. Note that where accounts differ or include uncertainty, these ambiguities are explicitly noted.

  
Process: Invoice Approval Process  
  
Roles:  
• Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
• Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
• Department Manager (Carlos)  
• Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
• Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  

  
Start Event: Invoice Received (usually via email)

  
1. Task: Check Invoice for PO Number  
   – Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   – Artifact: Received Invoice  
   – Gateway (Decision Point): Is PO number present?  
       • If NO:  
           a. Task: Return Invoice to Supplier requesting additional details  
              – May involve looping back once PO info is provided  
              – Input: Supplier response (Possibly revised invoice)  
       • If YES:  
           a. Task: Log Invoice into Accounting System  
              – Artifact: Logged Invoice (data record)

  
2. Task: Forward Invoice to Purchasing  
   – Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   – Artifact: Forwarded Invoice with PO info  
   – Note: In some cases, since PO absence delays further flow, this step only occurs with a valid PO.

  
3. Task: Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services and Verify Invoice Details Against PO  
   – Performed by: Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   – Artifacts: Purchase Order, Invoice details  
   – Activities:  
       • Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges, and presence of PO number  
       • If the invoice amount/line-items match the PO:
            – Outcome: Send confirmation (via email or system confirmation) back to Accounts Payable  
       • If there is a discrepancy (e.g., extra units, billing errors, or pricing discrepancies):
            – Gateway (Decision Point): Can discrepancy be resolved easily?  
                 If YES:  
                    – Task: Contact Supplier (Karen involvement optional) or request corrected invoice  
                    – Note: May inform Mary to hold the invoice  
                 If NO:  
                    – Task: Escalate issue to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)

  
4. Subsequent Flow from Purchasing:  
   – When confirmation is sent and discrepancies (if any) are resolved, the process flows to the manager approval phase.  
   – Uncertainty Note: In some accounts, after resolution or confirmation from Purchasing, the invoice proceeds directly to the manager step. In other cases, the resolution loop may vary in duration.

  
5. Task: Manager Approval  
   – Performed by: Department Manager (Carlos)  
   – Trigger: Notification from system after confirmation from Purchasing and successful matching of Invoice to PO  
   – Artifacts: Invoice details, PO, and confirmation evidence  
   – Gateway (Decision Point):  
       • If Manager approves:  
           – Proceed to scheduling payment  
       • If Manager finds an issue (e.g., budget concerns, unexpected items):  
           – Outcome: Reject invoice or request additional information/investigation; then (after resolution) resubmit for approval

  
6. Task: Exception Handling (if issues remain unresolved at Purchasing or Manager level)  
   – Performed by: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
   – Activities:  
       • Contact supplier (with assistance from Supplier Relationship Manager, Karen)  
       • Coordinate with appropriate departments (e.g., create retrospective PO for informal agreements)  
       • Once exceptions are resolved, reintroduce invoice into the normal flow:  
           – Confirmation from Purchasing  Manager Approval  Payment scheduling

  
7. Task: Schedule Invoice for Payment  
   – Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) [or the Accounts Payable Team/System]  
   – Occurs after final Manager approval  
   – Artifact: Payment Scheduling Entry in the system  
   – End Event: Invoice included in next Payment Cycle

  
Additional Notes on Artifacts and Inputs/Outputs:  
• Main documents include:  
   – Invoice received from supplier  
   – Purchase Order (PO)  
   – Matching report between Invoice and PO line items  
   – Confirmation emails and system notifications  
• Exception cases may involve additional artifacts such as retrospective POs or supplier contract documents (checked by Karen).

  
Sequence Flow Overview:  
Start  [Check Invoice for PO]  (PO present?)  
 [If NO: Return Invoice to Supplier]  (Revised Invoice Received?) – Loop until valid PO  
 [If YES: Log Invoice]  [Forward Invoice to Purchasing]  [Confirm Receipt/Match Invoice with PO]  
 (If discrepancy?)  [Resolve Discrepancy]  
 (If cannot resolve)  [Escalate to Supervisor]  [Resolution]  
 Upon successful confirmation  [Manager Approval]  
 (If issues)  [Manager Rejects and requests further action] – Loop until resolution  
 [Manager Approval achieved]  [Schedule Payment]  End Event (Payment Cycle)

  
Ambiguities and Points of Variation:  
• The process for handling missing PO numbers or discrepancies varies slightly between Accounts Payable and Purchasing perspectives.  
• Exception escalation may take different paths to resolution before returning to the standard flow  
• While the system triggers the Manager Approval automatically once confirmations are in place, manual interventions (either by Mary, Dan, or Rita) may occur as needed.
