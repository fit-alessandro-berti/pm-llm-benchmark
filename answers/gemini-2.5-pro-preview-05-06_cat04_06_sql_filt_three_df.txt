Okay, this is a classic process mining type of query that can be solved effectively using window functions in SQL.

Here's the DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
-- CTE to add lead activities and timestamps for sequence detection
WITH event_log_with_leads AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Get the next activity and its timestamp within the same case
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_1,
        -- Get the activity after next and its timestamp within the same case
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity_2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp_2
    FROM
        event_log
),

-- CTE to identify cases that match the sequence and timing criteria
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        event_log_with_leads
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity_1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_activity_2 = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Check the time difference between 'Create Order' (next_timestamp_1)
        -- and 'Confirm Order' (next_timestamp_2)
        AND (next_timestamp_2 - next_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

-- Final SELECT statement:
-- Retrieve all events from the original event_log
-- for cases NOT IN the cases_to_exclude list.
SELECT
    el.case_id,
    el.activity,
    el.timestamp
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT cte.case_id FROM cases_to_exclude cte)
ORDER BY
    el.case_id, el.timestamp; -- Optional: order the final result for readability
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`event_log_with_leads` CTE:**
    *   This CTE takes the original `event_log` table.
    *   It uses the `LEAD()` window function.
        *   `LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)`: For each event, this looks at the *next* event within the same `case_id` (due to `PARTITION BY case_id`) when ordered by `timestamp`. It retrieves the `activity` of that next event.
        *   `LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (...)`: Similarly, this retrieves the `timestamp` of the next event.
        *   `LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (...)` and `LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (...)`: These retrieve the activity and timestamp of the event *two steps ahead* within the same case.
    *   The result is that for each row in `event_log`, we now also have columns (`next_activity_1`, `next_timestamp_1`, `next_activity_2`, `next_timestamp_2`) that tell us about the immediately following two events in that case.

2.  **`cases_to_exclude` CTE:**
    *   This CTE queries `event_log_with_leads`.
    *   It filters for rows where:
        *   The current `activity` is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'.
        *   `next_activity_1` (the directly succeeding activity) is 'Create Order'.
        *   `next_activity_2` (the activity directly succeeding 'Create Order') is 'Confirm Order'.
        *   This ensures the **direct succession** of the three specified activities.
    *   Then, it applies the timing condition:
        *   `(next_timestamp_2 - next_timestamp_1) > INTERVAL '5 days'`: This calculates the duration between the timestamp of 'Create Order' (`next_timestamp_1`) and the timestamp of 'Confirm Order' (`next_timestamp_2`). If this duration is greater than 5 days, the condition is met.
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT case_id`: We only need the `case_id` of cases that meet these criteria. `DISTINCT` is used because a case might have this pattern multiple times, but we only need to identify the case once for exclusion.

3.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   `SELECT el.case_id, el.activity, el.timestamp FROM event_log el`: We select all original columns from the `event_log` table (aliased as `el`).
    *   `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT cte.case_id FROM cases_to_exclude cte)`: This is the crucial part. It filters the `event_log` to include only those events whose `case_id` is *not present* in the list of `case_id`s identified by the `cases_to_exclude` CTE.
    *   `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp`: This is an optional step to make the final output more readable, ordering events by case and then by time.

This query structure efficiently identifies the problematic cases using window functions and then excludes all events belonging to those cases from the final result.
