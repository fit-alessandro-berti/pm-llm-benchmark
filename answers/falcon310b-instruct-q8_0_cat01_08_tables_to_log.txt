This event log includes all the necessary events for each order identified by `order_id`, mapped to the appropriate activities such as "Order Created", "Items Picked", "Order Dispatched", "Order Arrived", "Invoice Issued", and "Payment Received". The "Resource/Actor" column has been populated with relevant information from the `Resources` table where available, and other attributes like `item_id`, `quantity`, `carrier_id`, `delivery_note`, `invoice_amount`, `payment_method`, and `payment_reference` are included as needed.

Assumptions made:
- If multiple timestamps were present for the same event type (e.g., multiple items picked for the same order), each was listed separately with the appropriate item details.
- The "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events were combined for the same delivery ID to ensure a single chronological entry per shipment.
- The "Resource/Actor" field is left blank when no specific resource was recorded for an event.

If there were any ambiguous situations or additional requirements not addressed here, please provide clarification for further adjustments.
