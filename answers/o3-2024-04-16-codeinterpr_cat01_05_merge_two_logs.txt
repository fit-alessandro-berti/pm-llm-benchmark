Merged, enriched event log for Order #1234  
(primary timestamp = System A when available; secondary timestamp(s) shown when a matching System B record was merged)

Explanation of matching & conflict-resolution decisions
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Timestamp tolerance  
   • A window of ±2 s was adopted; events 1, 2 and 5 were within this window.  
   • For Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck the gap was 5 s. Although outside the strict window, the names, order_id and perfect sequential position indicated they describe the same payment action, so we relaxed the rule (documented).

2. Activity name mapping  
   OrderReceived  Order Received, OrderValidation  Order Validated, PaymentCheck  Payment Processed, Shipping  Item Shipped were treated as synonyms based on domain knowledge of the fulfilment process.

3. Attribute merging  
   • All attributes from both systems were retained.  
   • Where System A lacked attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) they were filled from System B when available.  
   • Both original event names are kept to preserve lineage.

4. Primary vs secondary timestamp  
   • System A is considered the “primary” timeline, so its timestamp is shown first.  
   • The System B timestamp is retained as “secondary_ts” to allow later audits of recording latency.

5. Non-overlapping events  
   • “Quality Check” (10:03:00Z) appears only in System B – kept as-is with source_systems = B.  
   • “Item Delivered” (10:20:00Z) appears only in System A – kept with source_systems = A.

Result
------

The merged log now provides a single, chronologically ordered view of Order #1234 with richer context (user/resource assignments and notes) while preserving provenance and handling slight timing discrepancies transparently.
