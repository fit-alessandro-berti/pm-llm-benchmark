I need to analyze three cases based on the strict normative rules and the more flexible desiderata guidelines. For Case 1, everything looks great—no violations of normative rules or problems with the timeline. Moving on to Case 2, I notice some issues: the Risk Assessment happens before the Credit Check, which violates a key normative rule. Plus, they finalize documentation after a rejection, which is not allowed. Overall, I’ll summarize these findings clearly!

I need to assess some problematic cases, starting with how timelines can violate norms, like when Risk Assessment happens before Credit Check. This is a serious violation. There's also the issue of Finalize Documentation after rejection, which definitely goes against the rules. For Case 3, the credit check is delayed beyond 24 hours, and the applicant is informed later than expected. Additionally, there’s a missing Follow-up Call, which is a soft violation but not as severe. Overall, I’ll clearly summarize these issues!

I’m noticing some significant normative violations, particularly the "No prior Credit Check" issue, which is a critical problem. Additionally, I see that they finalized documentation after a rejection, which goes against established rules. For timing, the credit check happened after 4 days and 5 hours, which is a big delay, while informing the applicant took 3 days and 3 hours—also too long. I’ll ensure I keep things straightforward and clarify these points in my analysis!

I’ve noticed that the loan decision process has too many normative violations, which are not allowed. Now, for the desiderata, the credit check was completed after 4 days and 1 hour, and the applicant was informed after 3 days and 3 hours—both of which exceed the recommended timeframes. I’ll summarize these findings clearly and ensure I avoid heavy formatting while possibly using bullet lists for clarity. Keeping everything straightforward is key!

I’m all set to create a structured summary of the findings. First, I’ll compile the normative violations for each case, making sure to keep it simple and clear. For example, in Case 2, I’ll mention that the Risk Assessment occurs before the Credit Check and Finalize Documentation is after rejection—both violating the rules. Then, I’ll identify desiderata violations and suggest interpretations, especially for the Follow-up Call, which isn’t strictly required. This will help in presenting a clear overview!

### 1) Normative (strict) rule violations

- Case 2
  - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (violates “Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment”).
  - Finalize Documentation performed after a “Rejected” decision (violates “If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case”).

No other cases violate strict rules:
- Case 1 follows the mandated sequence and decision logic.
- Case 3 follows the mandated sequence and decision logic.

### 2) Desiderata (recommended but nonstrict) misses

- Case 2
  - Timing not applicable because the process already breaks strict rules.

- Case 3
  - Credit Check occurs more than 24 hours after Application Received (recommended window missed).
  - Inform Applicant occurs more than 48 hours after Loan Decision (recommended window missed).
  - No Followup Call before Close Case (recommended but not required).

Case 1 meets all desiderata.

### 3) Suggested interpretations/justifications (consistent with constraints)

- Case 2
  - The outoforder sequence and postrejection finalization indicate procedural errors rather than plausible exceptions. No interpretation within the stated constraints can justify these deviations.

- Case 3
  - Timing deviations are consistent with operational backlogs, resource constraints, or prioritization of higherurgency cases, without compromising the required sequence or decision logic. The lack of a Followup Call may reflect a policy that relies on written confirmation and formal documentation, making the call optional.
