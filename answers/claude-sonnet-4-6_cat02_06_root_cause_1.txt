# Customer Support Ticket Resolution — Process Performance Analysis

---

## Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Times

First, I'll compute the elapsed time from **Receive Ticket** to **Close Ticket** for each case.

| Case ID | Received             | Closed               | Total Duration       |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | **~2 hours 15 min**  |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | **~25 hours 10 min** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | **~1 hour 20 min**   |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | **~24 hours 10 min** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | **~49 hours 5 min**  |

**Average resolution time (all cases):**  20 hours 26 min

###  Outliers (Significantly Longer Than Average):
| Case | Duration           | vs. Fast Cases (101, 103) |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 102  | ~25 hours 10 min   | ~11–12× longer            |
| 104  | ~24 hours 10 min   | ~11× longer               |
| 105  | ~49 hours 5 min    | ~22–37× longer            |

Cases **102**, **104**, and **105** are the clear performance outliers.

## Step 2: Granular Activity-Level Analysis

To find root causes, I'll break down the waiting time **between each activity** for every case.

### Case 101 —  Fast (Baseline)
| From  To                          | Wait Time   |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| Receive  Triage                   | 10 min      |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1         | 10 min      |
| Assign  Investigate               | 40 min      |
| Investigate  Resolve              | 60 min      |
| Resolve  Close                    | 15 min      |

**No delays. Smooth, linear flow with no escalation.**

---

### Case 103 —  Fast (Baseline)
| From  To                          | Wait Time   |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| Receive  Triage                   | 5 min       |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1         | 15 min      |
| Assign  Investigate               | 15 min      |
| Investigate  Resolve              | 30 min      |
| Resolve  Close                    | 15 min      |

**No delays. The fastest case overall — likely a straightforward issue.**

---

### Case 102 —  Slow (~25 hrs)
| From  To                          | Wait Time        | Flag              |
|------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Receive  Triage                   | 25 min           |                   |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1         | 30 min           |                   |
| Assign  **Escalate** to Level-2   | 2 hrs 30 min     |  Long pre-escalation wait |
| Escalate  Investigate             | 2 hrs 30 min     |  Level-2 pickup delay |
| Investigate  Resolve              | **19 hrs**       |  Overnight gap  |
| Resolve  Close                    | 15 min           |                   |

**Key issues:**
- Escalation introduced a multi-hour handoff delay
- Investigation started late in the day (14:00), pushing resolution to the next morning

---

### Case 104 —  Slow (~24 hrs)
| From  To                          | Wait Time        | Flag              |
|------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Receive  Triage                   | 40 min           |  Slow triage    |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1         | 30 min           |                   |
| Assign  Investigate               | **3 hrs 30 min** |  Major bottleneck |
| Investigate  Resolve              | **19 hrs**       |  Overnight gap  |
| Resolve  Close                    | 30 min           |                   |

**Key issues:**
- No escalation occurred, yet the ticket took ~24 hours
- There was a **3.5-hour gap** between assignment and investigation start (agent unavailability or workload?)
- Investigation began at 13:00, causing resolution to spill into the next day

---

### Case 105 —  Slowest (~49 hrs)
| From  To                              | Wait Time         | Flag              |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Receive  Triage                       | 10 min            |                   |
| Triage  Assign to Level-1             | 25 min            |                   |
| Assign  Investigate (Level-1)         | 10 min            |                   |
| Investigate  **Escalate** to Level-2  | 50 min            |                   |
| Escalate  Investigate (Level-2)       | **~28 hrs**       |  Critical delay |
| Investigate (Level-2)  Resolve        | **19 hrs**        |  Overnight gap  |
| Resolve  Close                        | 30 min            |                   |

**Key issues:**
- Escalated at 10:00 on March 1, but Level-2 didn't begin investigation until **14:00 on March 2** — a nearly **28-hour wait**
- After Level-2 picked it up, resolution still required an additional 19 hours (another overnight gap)
- The compounding of two multi-day delays produced the worst total duration

## Step 3: Root Cause Identification

Based on the analysis above, three distinct root causes emerge:

###  Root Cause 1: Escalation Handoff Delays
**Affected Cases:** 102, 105

When tickets are escalated to Level-2, there is a significant lag before the specialized team begins working on them. In Case 102, the Level-2 team took **2.5 hours** to start. In Case 105, the same handoff took nearly **28 hours** — spanning an entire business day. This suggests:

- Level-2 agents may have **insufficient capacity** or are overloaded
- There is **no SLA or urgency protocol** enforced at the point of escalation
- Escalations may be **queued and processed slowly**, especially if they arrive near the end of a working day

---

###  Root Cause 2: Long Waiting Times Before Investigation
**Affected Cases:** 102, 104, 105

Even without escalation, Case 104 shows a **3.5-hour gap** between assignment and the start of investigation. This pattern suggests:

- Level-1 agents may be **overloaded or managing multiple tickets** simultaneously
- There may be **insufficient staffing** during peak hours
- Ticket assignment may not be directly triggering agent action (e.g., no notification system)

---

###  Root Cause 3: End-of-Day Investigation Start  Overnight Resolution Gap
**Affected Cases:** 102, 104, 105

In all three slow cases, investigation begins in the **afternoon (13:00–14:00)**, and resolution occurs the **following morning (~08:00–09:00)**. This creates an unavoidable ~19-hour gap if the process runs only during business hours. Fast cases (101, 103) had investigation starting before 09:15, allowing same-day resolution.

This is a **scheduling and workload distribution problem**: tickets accumulating delays earlier in the process end up missing the "same-day resolution window."

---

## Step 4: Summary of Root Causes

| Root Cause                                     | Cases Affected | Estimated Delay Added  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Escalation handoff delays (Level-2 slow pickup)| 102, 105       | 2.5 hrs  28 hrs       |
| Long wait before investigation post-assignment | 102, 104       | 2.5 – 3.5 hrs          |
| Late investigation start  overnight gap       | 102, 104, 105  | ~19 hrs per occurrence |
| Cascading delays (multiple factors combined)   | 105            | ~47 hrs of added time  |

---

## Step 5: Recommendations

###  Recommendation 1: Establish SLAs for Level-2 Escalation Response
Define a **maximum response time** (e.g., 1–2 hours) for Level-2 agents to acknowledge and begin investigation after an escalation. Implement automated alerts to team leads if this SLA is breached. This directly targets the most severe bottleneck observed in Case 105.

###  Recommendation 2: Monitor and Reduce Assignment-to-Investigation Lag
Track the time between "Assign to Agent" and "Investigate Issue" as a dedicated KPI. If this gap exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1 hour), trigger a supervisor notification. Consider **capacity balancing** to ensure agents aren't overloaded when new tickets are assigned.

###  Recommendation 3: Prioritize Tickets That Risk Missing the Same-Day Window
Implement a **time-of-day priority rule**: tickets that haven't reached the investigation stage by a cutoff time (e.g., 12:00) should be flagged and fast-tracked to prevent overnight delays. This creates a proactive buffer against end-of-day spillover.

###  Recommendation 4: Review Escalation Criteria and Level-1 Empowerment
Case 104 took ~24 hours **without escalation**, suggesting the Level-1 agent may have been stuck or under-resourced. Review whether Level-1 agents have adequate tools, knowledge base access, and authority to resolve a broader category of issues without escalation. Unnecessary or premature escalations compound the delays seen in Cases 102 and 105.

###  Recommendation 5: Consider Extended Coverage or Async Handoffs for Complex Cases
For tickets likely to require Level-2 involvement, introduce **shift coverage or on-call protocols** to avoid leaving escalated tickets unattended overnight. Even a brief evening check-in by Level-2 staff could prevent an entire business day of delay.

---

## Conclusion

The primary performance bottlenecks in this process are:
1. **Slow Level-2 pickup after escalation** (most severe — up to 28 hours in Case 105)
2. **Idle time between ticket assignment and investigation start** (up to 3.5 hours in Case 104)
3. **Afternoon investigation starts that push resolution past business hours** (adding ~19 hours per occurrence)

Cases 101 and 103 demonstrate that when the process flows without interruption and investigation begins early in the day, tickets can be resolved in under 2.5 hours. Addressing the three identified bottlenecks — particularly around escalation responsiveness and proactive scheduling — would dramatically reduce cycle times for complex tickets and bring overall performance closer to this benchmark.
