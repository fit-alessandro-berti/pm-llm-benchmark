### Notes:
- **Resource/Actor**: For each event, the resource or actor involved was identified from the respective tables. In cases where no specific person or entity was mentioned (like for payments), the resource column is left blank with a dash.
- **Activity Names**: Activities were inferred from the context of each table. For example:
  - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table.
  - "Item Picked" events were created for each line in the `Order Lines` table.
  - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events correspond to dispatch and arrival dates from the `Delivery` table.
  - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table.
  - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table.
- **Timestamps**: All events are sorted chronologically per case ID to ensure the process flow is correctly represented.
- **Other Attributes**: Relevant details like quantity, invoice amount, delivery notes, etc., are included where applicable to provide more context to each event.
- **Assumptions**: 
  - The order of events within an order ID follows the timestamp, and when multiple events occur on the same timestamp, they are listed in the order they appear in their respective tables.
  - For orders with multiple deliveries, each delivery is treated as a separate event for clarity in process mining analysis.

This event log should provide a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, suitable for process mining analysis.
