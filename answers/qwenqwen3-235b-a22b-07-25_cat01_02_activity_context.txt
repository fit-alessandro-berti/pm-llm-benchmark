### **Analysis and Renaming of Activities**

In the provided event log, the activities **"Verify Documents"**, **"Call Customer"**, and to a lesser extent **"Adjust Account"**, appear multiple times within individual cases. While the activity names are identical, their **context, purpose, and position** in the process differ significantly. To improve clarity and process understanding, we must rename these activities to reflect their **distinct roles** in the workflow.

---

### **1. Key Observations**

#### **A. "Verify Documents"**
- Appears **twice** in **C001**, **C003**, and once in **C002**.
- In **C001**:
  - First: Initial verification with incomplete documents.
  - Second: Re-verification after customer submits additional documents.
- In **C003**:
  - First: Initial physical verification at branch.
  - Second: Re-verification after internal adjustment.
- In **C002**: Only one verification, and it's initial, no rework.

 **Insight**: The first instance is **initial verification**, the second is **re-verification after correction**.

#### **B. "Call Customer"**
- Appears **twice** in **C002**, **once** in **C001**, **once** in **C003**.
- In **C001**: Outbound call to request **missing documents**.
- In **C002**: First call to **clarify discrepancy**, second to **confirm resolution**.
- In **C003**: Call to **summon customer back** after they left.

 **Insight**: Calls serve different purposes:
  - **Information Gathering** (request docs, clarify issue)
  - **Notification/Confirmation** (confirm changes)
  - **Logistical Coordination** (call to return)

#### **C. "Adjust Account"**
- Appears once per case where used.
- In **C002**: After call to clarify discrepancy.
- In **C003**: After customer leaves, internal correction made.

 While it appears only once per case, the **trigger** differs:
  - C002: Based on customer input during call.
  - C003: Based on missing info after customer left.

But since it doesn’t repeat within a case, we keep the name or slightly refine it for clarity.

### **4. Justification of Naming Choices**

#### **"Verify Documents (Initial)" vs. "Verify Documents (Recheck)"**
- **Contextual Clue**: The first verification often occurs with incomplete data (C001), or before any intervention. The second occurs **after** a corrective action (document upload, account adjustment).
- **Purpose**: Distinguishes **first-pass screening** from **validation post-correction**.
- **Improves Process Clarity**: Makes rework loops explicit.

#### **"Call Customer (For Info)"**
- **Contextual Clue**: Precedes submission of additional info (C001) or clarification of discrepancies (C002).
- **Purpose**: Used to **gather missing data** or **resolve ambiguity**.
- **Differentiation**: Not just a call — it’s **diagnostic**.

#### **"Call Customer (For Confirmation)"**
- **Contextual Clue**: Follows an internal action (adjustment), and aims to **notify** or **verify understanding**.
- **Purpose**: **Closure-oriented**, ensures customer is aware of changes.

#### **"Call Customer (To Return)"**
- **Contextual Clue**: Unique logistical need — customer left the branch.
- **Purpose**: Purely **operational coordination**, not information exchange.
- **Distinctive**: Only occurs in branch setting; different from support calls.

#### **"Adjust Account (Internal Update)"**
- **Contextual Clue**: Always performed by BackOfficeAgent, not customer-facing.
- **Purpose**: Highlights that this is a **backend correction**, not a customer-requested change.
- **Clarity**: Prevents confusion with customer-initiated adjustments.

### **Conclusion**

By renaming recurring activities based on **context, intent, and process position**, the revised log now clearly reflects:
- **Rework loops** (e.g., verification  correction  re-verification)
- **Different types of customer interaction** (info gathering vs. confirmation)
- **Channel and role-specific actions**

This disambiguation supports better **process mining**, **compliance auditing**, and **workflow optimization** by making implicit logic explicit.
