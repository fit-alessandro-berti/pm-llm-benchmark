To solve this problem, we need to:

1. **Group by `case_id`** and aggregate the activities in chronological order (`ORDER BY timestamp`) to form the **process variant** (i.e., the sequence of activities).
2. **Count the number of cases per variant**.
3. **Identify the top K variants** by frequency.
4. **Filter the original `event_log`** to return only events from cases whose variant is among the top K.

We'll use DuckDB’s window functions, `STRING_AGG`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to achieve this efficiently.

Let’s assume **K = 5** (you can replace `5` with any desired value). We'll make it parameterizable in the final query by using a subquery or CTE for clarity.

###  Final DuckDB SQL Query:

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' > ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT 5  -- Replace 5 with desired K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants cv
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv
        ON cv.variant_sequence = tkv.variant_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc
    ON el.case_id = fc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

###  Explanation of Each Step:

#### 1. `case_variants` CTE:
- Groups events by `case_id`.
- Uses `STRING_AGG(activity, ' > ' ORDER BY timestamp)` to create a string representation of the activity sequence, sorted by timestamp.
- This string uniquely identifies the **process variant**.

#### 2. `variant_counts` CTE:
- Counts how many `case_id`s share each variant sequence.
- This gives us the frequency of each variant.

#### 3. `top_k_variants` CTE:
- Selects the top K variant sequences by descending `case_count`.
- `LIMIT 5` — change this to your desired K (e.g., `LIMIT 10` for top 10).

#### 4. `filtered_cases` CTE:
- Joins the original case variants with the top K variants to get the list of `case_id`s that belong to top K variants.

#### 5. Final SELECT:
- Joins the original `event_log` with `filtered_cases` to return **only events from cases in the top K variants**.
- Orders by `case_id` and `timestamp` to preserve original temporal order.

---

###  Output:
Returns all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` belongs to one of the **top K most frequent process variants**, preserving original order within each case.

###  Notes:
- **Delimiter**: `' > '` is used for readability in the variant string. DuckDB doesn't require a specific delimiter, but it helps human readability and avoids ambiguity (e.g., if activities are multi-character).
- **Performance**: This query is efficient in DuckDB as it uses standard SQL with CTEs and avoids expensive self-joins.
- **Scalability**: For very large datasets, ensure `case_id` and `timestamp` are indexed.
- **Parameterization**: If you're embedding this in code, replace `5` with a parameter (e.g., `$K` in application code).

###  Example (with sample data):

**Input event_log:**
| case_id | activity | timestamp           |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| C1      | A        | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| C1      | B        | 2023-01-01 11:00:00 |
| C2      | A        | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| C2      | B        | 2023-01-01 11:05:00 |
| C2      | C        | 2023-01-01 12:00:00 |
| C3      | A        | 2023-01-01 10:02:00 |
| C3      | B        | 2023-01-01 11:02:00 |
| C4      | A        | 2023-01-01 09:50:00 |
| C4      | C        | 2023-01-01 11:50:00 |

**Variant counts:**
- `A > B`  2 cases (C1, C3)
- `A > B > C`  1 case (C2)
- `A > C`  1 case (C4)

Top K=2 variants: `A > B` and `A > B > C`

**Output:** All events from C1, C2, C3 (since they belong to top 2 variants).

 This matches the requirement perfectly.
