### Assumptions Made
- **Case ID**: Using `order_id` as the primary case identifier, as specified. All events for an order are grouped under this case.
- **Activities**: 
  - "Order Created" is derived from the `Orders` table (one event per order, using `order_date`).
  - "Item Picked" events are derived from the `Order Lines` table. Since picking is item-specific and may involve different resources/timestamps, I create one event per line item to capture granularity (e.g., multiple rows for orders with multiple items). Activity name includes the item description for descriptiveness.
  - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" are derived from the `Delivery` table. For orders with multiple deliveries (e.g., order 1002), I create separate events per delivery record to reflect split shipments, appending the `delivery_id` to the activity name for uniqueness.
  - "Invoice Issued" is derived from the `Invoice` table (one event per invoice, even if multiple per order).
  - "Payment Received" is derived from the `Payments` table (one event per payment, linked via invoice to order).
- **Timestamps**: Used directly from the source tables. Events are listed in chronological order per case (sorted by timestamp within each `order_id`). If timestamps overlap or are ambiguous (none in this data), the earliest relevant timestamp is prioritized.
- **Resources/Actors**: 
  - For "Order Created": Used `sales_person_id` mapped to names from `Resources` table.
  - For "Item Picked": Used `picker_id` mapped to names.
  - For "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived": Used `carrier_id` mapped to names.
  - For "Invoice Issued": Used `billing_person_id` mapped to names.
  - For "Payment Received": No direct resource in `Payments`; defaulted to "Accounting System" as a generic actor for payments.
- **Other Attributes**: Included item details (e.g., quantity, description) for picking events, and invoice/payment details (e.g., amount, method) where relevant. Customer info from `Orders` is added to the first event per case for context.
- **Missing Data**: 
  - Order 1004 has no delivery or invoice records in the provided tables, so its process ends at picking (assumed incomplete or data gap).
  - No payment for order 1004 (no invoice). No picking for order 1004 items beyond what's listed (only one item shown).
  - No resources table entries for payment actors, so generic.
- **Chronological Correctness**: Events are sorted by timestamp within each case. Cross-case sorting is not applied, but all events are included.
- **Enrichment**: Used `Products` and `Resources` tables to add descriptive names where possible.
