We are going to create a temporal profile for the given supply chain process.
 The activities are: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.

 We need to consider every pair of activities (i, j) such that i and j are in the same trace (eventually following each other).
 For example, for a trace [SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS], we consider:
 (SS, OP), (SS, RC), (SS, QI), ... (QI, CA), ... (DT, AS)

 We are to estimate the average time and standard deviation for each pair.

 Since the prompt does not provide explicit numbers, we must estimate based on typical supply chain operations.

 Let's think about the typical time gaps:

 1. Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP): 
    - This is usually a quick step, as once the supplier is selected, the order is placed.
    - Average: maybe 1 day? (86400 seconds) but let's think in seconds for consistency.

 However, note the example used seconds (86400 seconds = 1 day). So we'll express in seconds.

 We'll break down the activities and estimate gaps:

  - SS to OP: Can be same day? Let's say average gap: 1 day (86400 seconds) with a std dev of 0.5 days (43200 seconds) because sometimes there might be internal approvals.

  - OP to RC: This is the order lead time. For high-tech electronics, this might take days to weeks.
    Let's assume average 10 days (10 * 86400 seconds) with a std dev of 2 days (2 * 86400 seconds).

  - RC to QI: Receiving components and then inspects. This can be done within a day? Maybe same day or next day.
    Average: 1 day (86400 seconds), std dev 0.2 days (0.2 * 86400) because sometimes inspections are delayed.

  - QI to CA: If inspection passes, assembly can start quickly. But if failed, there might be rework or wait. But in temporal profile, we look at the time from QI to CA for the same product. So after inspection, assembly might start in 1 day? 
    Average: 1 day (86400 seconds), std dev 0.5 days (43200 seconds).

  - CA to PT: Assembly then testing. The time depends on the assembly complexity. Let's say average 3 days (259200 seconds) with std dev 1 day (86400 seconds).

  - PT to PK: After testing, packaging. This is quick: average 1 day (86400 seconds), std dev 0.2 days.

  - PK to WS: Packaging done, then stored in warehouse. Usually immediate, but might wait for space? Let's say average 1 day (86400 seconds), std dev 0.2 days.

  - WS to DT: Storage to distribution. This depends on shipping schedules. Let's assume average 2 days (172800 seconds) with std dev 1 day (86400 seconds).

  - DT to AS: This is tricky because after-sales support might start after the product is shipped and delivered. But note: the event log might record the completion of distribution and then the start of after-sales support. However, the after-sales support might start long after the product is delivered. But the process execution might record when the after-sales support activity is initiated for that product. In many processes, after-sales support is initiated when the product is handed over to the customer, which is at distribution. So the time between DT and AS might be very short if the handover includes the initiation of support. Alternatively, it might be long because after-sales support is triggered by issues later. However, the problem states "eventually following each other", meaning the pair (DT, AS) must have been recorded in at least one trace. We assume that for the purpose of this exercise, we are modeling the time between the distribution event and the first after-sales support activity (like initial setup assistance). 

    But note: in the list of activities, DT is distribution and then AS is after-sales support. It is possible that after the product is distributed, the after-sales support might be initiated within a day (for example, setting up the product with the customer) or it might be weeks later. We have to average over many instances. Let's assume that for the majority, the first support call or setup is done within a week? But that might be too long. Alternatively, we can model the gap as the time from the distribution event to the first support event, which might be very variable. 

    However, note the problem says: "the time between two activities in a particular execution". So in one process execution, we are looking at the time between the distribution activity and the first after-sales support activity for that order. 

    Let's assume that the after-sales support might be triggered shortly after distribution. But there is a lot of variability. We'll set:
    Average: 1 week (7 * 86400 seconds) with a std dev of 2 weeks (14 * 86400 seconds) because some products might have support triggered immediately and others after a long time.

 But note: the problem says "a representative subset". We don't have to do every pair. We can pick a subset that includes both adjacent and non-adjacent pairs.

 However, the example in the prompt included both adjacent and non-adjacent. We must consider all pairs that appear in any trace (i.e., that eventually follow each other). But the problem says "produce a dictionary" and it is complex, so we are to include a representative subset. We'll include a few adjacent and a few non-adjacent pairs.

 Let's choose:

 Adjacent pairs:
   (SS, OP)
   (OP, RC)
   (RC, QI)
   (QI, CA)
   (CA, PT)
   (PT, PK)
   (PK, WS)
   (WS, DT)
   (DT, AS)

 Non-adjacent pairs that are still in the same trace and might be separated by multiple steps:
   (SS, RC): time from supplier selection to component received? This would be the entire order placement and transit time.
   (SS, QI): from supplier selection to quality inspection? This includes order placement, receiving, and then inspection.
   (SS, CA): from supplier selection to assembly? This is a longer chain.
   (SS, PT): even longer? until the product is tested.
   (SS, DT): until the product is distributed? This is the entire process from start to finish.
   (OP, CA): from order placement to assembly? This skips receiving and inspection? But note: in a trace, CA only happens after QI (which requires RC). So the path is OP->RC->QI->CA. So the gap from OP to CA is the entire time from order placement to assembly.
   (RC, DT): from receiving components to distribution? This skips QI, CA, PT, PK, WS.

 We'll choose a representative subset that includes:

  - All the consecutive pairs (9 pairs: from SS to OP, OP to RC, ..., DT to AS)
  - And then a few non-consecutive that are common or important.

  Let's pick:
    (SS, RC)   - because it's the total lead time from selection to having the material
    (SS, CA)   - because it's the time to get to assembly
    (SS, DT)   - because it's the total cycle time from start to finish

  Also, (OP, CA) and (RC, DT) as mentioned.

  That gives 14 pairs.

 We'll assign estimated values:

  (SS, OP): 1 day (86400) ± 0.5 days (std dev: 43200)
  (OP, RC): 10 days (86400*10) ± 2 days (std dev: 172800)
  (RC, QI): 1 day (86400) ± 0.2 days (std dev: 17280)
  (QI, CA): 1 day (86400) ± 0.5 days (std dev: 43200) [because if failed, rework might add time, but we are averaging]
  (CA, PT): 3 days (259200) ± 1 day (86400)
  (PT, PK): 1 day (86400) ± 0.2 days (17280)
  (PK, WS): 1 day (86400) ± 0.2 days (17280)
  (WS, DT): 2 days (172800) ± 1 day (86400)
  (DT, AS): 7 days (604800) ± 14 days (1209600)   [1209600 seconds = 14 days]

 Non-adjacent:

  (SS, RC): This is the time from SS to RC. It includes SS->OP, OP->RC. So the average would be the sum of the average of (SS,OP) and (OP,RC). Similarly, the standard deviation would be the square root of the sum of squares? Actually, if the two steps are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of variances. But note: they are sequential. So the total time is the sum. Therefore, the average for (SS,RC) = (SS,OP).average + (OP,RC).average = 86400 + 864000 = 950400 seconds (about 11 days). The variance would be (SS,OP).stddev^2 + (OP,RC).stddev^2 = (43200)^2 + (172800)^2. Then standard deviation = sqrt(43200**2 + 172800**2) = sqrt(1866240000 + 29859840000) = sqrt(31716064000)  178200 (about 2.06 days). Alternatively, we can note that the total lead time is dominated by the OP->RC step. So we can set:

        average = 1 + 10 = 11 days = 950400 seconds
        stddev = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2) * (1 day) = sqrt(0.25+4)=sqrt(4.25)2.06 days -> 2.06 * 86400  178000 seconds.

    But note: the problem does not require exact propagation, so we can estimate. Alternatively, we can use independent estimation.

    However, to keep consistent, we'll use independent estimation with a little more for non-adjacent to account for variability:

        (SS, RC): average 11 days (950400 seconds), stddev 2.5 days (216000 seconds) [since the order placement and transit might have some common factors, we add a bit more]

  (SS, CA): This includes SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA. 
        Average = 1+10+1+1 = 13 days = 13*86400 = 1123200 seconds.
        Standard deviation: we can compute as the square root of the sum of squares of the standard deviations of each step? But note they are independent? We'll use:
        stddev = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2) days = sqrt(0.25+4+0.04+0.25)=sqrt(4.54)2.13 days -> 2.13 * 86400  184000 seconds.

        Alternatively, we might round to 2.2 days? 2.2 * 86400 = 190080 seconds.

  (SS, DT): This is the entire cycle. Steps: SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT.
        Average = 1+10+1+1+3+1+1+2 = 20 days = 20*86400 = 1728000 seconds.
        Standard deviation: sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2 + 1^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.2^2 + 1^2) = 
          = sqrt(0.25+4+0.04+0.25+1+0.04+0.04+1) = sqrt(6.62)  2.57 days -> 2.57 * 86400  222500 seconds.

  (OP, CA): Steps: OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA.
        Average = 10+1+1 = 12 days = 12*86400 = 1036800 seconds.
        Standard deviation: sqrt(2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(4+0.04+0.25)=sqrt(4.29)2.07 days -> 2.07*86400179000 seconds.

  (RC, DT): Steps: RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT.
        Average = 1+1+3+1+1+2 = 9 days = 9*86400=777600 seconds.
        Standard deviation: sqrt(0.2^2+0.5^2+1^2+0.2^2+0.2^2+1^2) = sqrt(0.04+0.25+1+0.04+0.04+1)=sqrt(2.37)1.54 days -> 1.54*86400133000 seconds.

 We'll create a dictionary with these pairs and values.

 Let's write the dictionary:

 Note: We are using seconds.

 We'll round the standard deviations to the nearest integer.

 Steps:

  1. (SS, OP): (86400, 43200)
  2. (OP, RC): (864000, 172800)
  3. (RC, QI): (86400, 17280)
  4. (QI, CA): (86400, 43200)
  5. (CA, PT): (259200, 86400)
  6. (PT, PK): (86400, 17280)
  7. (PK, WS): (86400, 17280)
  8. (WS, DT): (172800, 86400)
  9. (DT, AS): (604800, 1209600)

 Non-adjacent:

 10. (SS, RC): (950400, 216000)   [we set stddev to 2.5 days = 216000 seconds]
 11. (SS, CA): (1123200, 190080)  [we set stddev to 2.2 days = 2.2 * 86400 = 190080 seconds]
 12. (SS, DT): (1728000, 222528)  [2.57 days rounded to 222528 seconds? Actually 2.57*86400222528, but we'll use 222528]
 13. (OP, CA): (1036800, 179000)  [2.07 days: let's compute 2.07 * 86400 = 178968 -> round to 179000]
 14. (RC, DT): (777600, 133000)  [1.54 days: 1.54 * 86400 = 133000.8 -> round to 133000]

 However, note: the example in the prompt used (86400, 3600). We are free to choose.

 But we must note: the problem says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt", meaning we must estimate. The example values are just examples.

 We'll write the dictionary accordingly.

 Let's code the dictionary:

 Note: We are using integer seconds.

 We'll use the exact integer representations.

 However, note that the example had (3600) for standard deviation, which is 1 hour. But our values are in seconds and are large.

 We'll write:

 temporal_profile = {
     ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),
     ('OP', 'RC'): (864000, 172800),
     ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 17280),
     ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),
     ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),
     ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 17280),
     ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 17280),
     ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),
     ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 1209600),
     ('SS', 'RC'): (950400, 216000),
     ('SS', 'CA'): (1123200, 190080),
     ('SS', 'DT'): (1728000, 222528),
     ('OP', 'CA'): (1036800, 179000),
     ('RC', 'DT'): (777600, 133000)
 }

 But note: 222528 and 179000 and 133000 are not multiples of 86400? They are rounded. So we use integers.

 However, 222528 is 222528 seconds, which is 2.57 days? and 179000 is 179000 seconds, which is about 2.07 days? and 133000 is 133000 seconds, which is about 1.54 days.

 We can also express the standard deviations in integers without rounding, but the problem does not specify.

 We have rounded for simplicity.

 Alternatively, we can use the exact numbers:

  For (SS, CA): 
      average = 13 * 86400 = 1123200 seconds.
      stddev = sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2) days * 86400 seconds/day = sqrt(4.54) * 86400  2.13043 * 86400  184000 seconds? 
      Actually, let me compute exactly: 
          0.5^2 = 0.25
          2^2 = 4
          0.2^2 = 0.04
          0.5^2 = 0.25
          total variance = 4.54 -> stddev = sqrt(4.54)  2.13043 days
          seconds = 2.13043 * 86400  184000.0 seconds (if we round to 184000, that's 184000)

  But we used 190080 above. Let me adjust: I think I made a mistake in the non-adjacent: I set (SS, CA) stddev to 190080, but that was 2.2 days. We'll recalc to keep consistency.

  However, for the sake of time, we'll stick with the initial estimates that we made for non-adjacent (the rounded ones) or adjust to the calculated ones? 

  Since the problem requires an estimate, we can do:

      (SS, RC): 11 days average, and we said 2.5 days stddev -> 2.5*86400=216000 -> that's an estimate, not calculated from the steps.

  We are allowed to estimate. So we'll keep:

      (SS, RC): (950400, 216000)   [because 2.5 days seems reasonable for the variability in the entire lead time]

  Similarly, we can adjust others to be independent estimates if we wish.

  But to be consistent, we'll recalc the non-adjacent pairs by summing the variances of the steps? 

  However, the problem does not specify that the steps are independent. In fact, there might be correlations. So we can choose to set the non-adjacent pairs independently? 

  Since the problem asks for an estimate, we'll use the independent propagation for the standard deviation as an approximation, and then round to a reasonable number.

  Let's recalculate the non-adjacent pairs using the steps and the independent propagation (variance additivity):

    Steps for (SS, RC): 
        Steps: SS->OP and OP->RC.
        average = 1+10 = 11 days = 950400 seconds.
        variance = (0.5^2 + 2^2) = 0.25+4 = 4.25 -> standard deviation = sqrt(4.25)  2.0616 days -> 2.0616 * 86400  178000 seconds (we'll round to 178000)

    For (SS, CA): 
        Steps: SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA.
        average = 1+10+1+1 = 13 days = 13*86400 = 1123200 seconds.
        variance = (0.5^2+2^2+0.2^2+0.5^2) = 0.25+4+0.04+0.25 = 4.54 -> stddev = sqrt(4.54)2.1304 days -> 2.1304*86400184000 seconds.

    For (SS, DT): 
        Steps: SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT.
        average = 1+10+1+1+3+1+1+2 = 20 days = 20*86400=1728000 seconds.
        variance = (0.5^2+2^2+0.2^2+0.5^2+1^2+0.2^2+0.2^2+1^2) = 
            0.25+4+0.04+0.25+1+0.04+0.04+1 = 6.62
        stddev = sqrt(6.62)2.572 days -> 2.572*86400222528 seconds.

    For (OP, CA): 
        Steps: OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA.
        average = 10+1+1 = 12 days = 12*86400=1036800 seconds.
        variance = (2^2+0.2^2+0.5^2)=4+0.04+0.25=4.29 -> stddev = sqrt(4.29)2.070 days -> 2.070*86400178968 seconds -> round to 179000? or 179000 is too round? Let's compute exactly: 2.070 * 86400 = 178968 -> we can use 179000 or 178968. We'll use 178968.

    For (RC, DT): 
        Steps: RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT.
        average = 1+1+3+1+1+2 = 9 days = 777600 seconds.
        variance = (0.2^2+0.5^2+1^2+0.2^2+0.2^2+1^2)= 
            0.04+0.25+1+0.04+0.04+1=2.37
        stddev = sqrt(2.37)1.539 days -> 1.539*86400132950 seconds -> we can round to 132950? or 133000? Let's use 132950.

  However, note: 132950 is an integer. We'll use the exact numbers we calculated.

  But the problem does not specify, so we can round to the nearest thousand? or keep as integers.

  We'll create the dictionary with:

      (SS, RC): (950400, 178000)   [because 2.0616*86400178000? Actually 2.0616*86400 = 178000 approximately? Let me compute: 2.0616 * 86400 = 178000 approximately? Actually: 2.0616 * 86400 = 178000 is not exact. We computed 178000 from 2.0616*86400? 

  Actually, 2.0616 * 86400 = 178000.64 -> so we can use 178001? But we are rounding to the nearest integer. So 178001? Or we can round to the nearest 100? 

  However, to keep it simple, we'll use the numbers we get by exact calculation and round to the nearest integer.

  Steps for non-adjacent:

    (SS, RC): 
        average = 11 * 86400 = 950400
        stddev = round(sqrt(4.25)*86400) = round(2.0615528128088303 * 86400) = round(178000) -> 178000? 
        But 2.0615528128088303 * 86400 = 178000.64 -> so 178001? We'll use 178001.

    Similarly:

        (SS, CA): 
            average = 13 * 86400 = 1123200
            stddev = round(sqrt(4.54) * 86400) = round(2.1304347826086953 * 86400) = round(184000.0) -> 184000? Actually 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000 (exactly? because 0.1304347826086953 * 86400  11300? Let me compute: 
                2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000 (exactly 184000? 
                2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000.0 (exactly? let me do: 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000.0? 
            Actually: 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000.0? 
            We can compute: 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000.0? 
            Let me do: 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000 (exactly? because 0.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 11265.999... -> so 2*86400=172800, plus 11265.999172800+11266=184066 -> wait, I think I made a mistake.

            Correction: 
                variance = 4.54 -> stddev = sqrt(4.54) = 2.1304347826086953 days.
                stddev in seconds = 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000? 
                Actually: 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000? 
                Let me compute: 
                    2 * 86400 = 172800
                    0.1304347826086953 * 86400  0.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 11266.0 (exactly? 0.13*86400=11232, 0.0004347826086953*8640037.56, so total 11269.56 -> so 172800+11269.56=184069.56 -> so 184070 seconds? 

            We'll use 184070 seconds.

    This is getting messy. Since the problem does not specify, we'll use the exact integer seconds for the average and the standard deviation as integers, and we'll use the exact computed value for the standard deviation without rounding the decimal part.

    Alternatively, we can use the exact square roots and then multiply by 86400 and round to the nearest integer.

    We'll do:

        (SS, RC): 
            average = 11 * 86400 = 950400
            stddev = round(sqrt(4.25) * 86400) = round(2.0615528128088303 * 86400) = round(178000.64) = 178001

        (SS, CA): 
            average = 13 * 86400 = 1123200
            stddev = round(sqrt(4.54) * 86400) = round(2.1304347826086953 * 86400) = round(184000.000?) -> wait, we computed 184069.56? 

        Actually, we have:
            variance for (SS,CA) = 0.5^2+2^2+0.2^2+0.5^2 = 0.25+4+0.04+0.25=4.54
            stddev_days = sqrt(4.54)  2.1304347826086953
            stddev_seconds = 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184000? 

        Let me compute in Python: 

            sqrt(4.54) * 86400 = sqrt(4.54) * 86400

            import math
            math.sqrt(4.54) * 86400   # 2.1304347826086953 * 86400 = 184069.56 -> so we round to 184070.

        So we'll use 184070.

    This is too time-consuming and the problem does not require this level of precision. We'll instead round the standard deviation of non-adjacent pairs to the nearest thousand.

    We'll change our approach: for non-adjacent pairs, we will use independent estimates that are integers and rounded to the nearest 1000 seconds? 

    Alternatively, we can note that the standard deviations we calculated for adjacent pairs are all round numbers (like 43200, 172800, etc.). For consistency, we might round the non-adjacent standard deviations to the nearest 1000 seconds.

    We'll do:

        (SS, RC): 178000 seconds -> round to 178000 (which is already a round number) [but 178000 is 178000, which is round to 1000]
        (SS, CA): 184070 -> round to 184000? or 184100? -> we'll round to 184000? 
        (SS, DT): 222528 -> round to 223000? or keep as 222500? -> we'll round to 223000.
        (OP, CA): 178968 -> round to 179000
        (RC, DT): 132950 -> round to 133000

    But then we are inconsistent because we used exact numbers for adjacent.

    Considering the complexity and the fact that the problem says "estimate", we'll use the rounded values we first set for non-adjacent (the ones we independently estimated: 216000, 190080, 222528, 179000, 133000) and for adjacent we used exact multiples.

    However, to keep it simple, we'll use the following for non-adjacent (in seconds, rounded to the nearest 1000):

        (SS, RC): 178000 
        (SS, CA): 184000   (rounding 184070 down to 184000? or up to 184000? Actually 184000 is round, but 184070 is closer to 184000 than to 185000? But 184070 is 70 above 184000, so we can leave it at 184070? But then we are not rounding to 1000. We'll keep as integers without additional rounding.)

    Given the time, we'll present the dictionary as initially planned with the independent estimates for non-adjacent, but we'll use the exact calculated standard deviations for non-adjacent (without rounding) as integers.

    But note: the example in the prompt used 3600, which is exact. So we should use integers.

    We'll recalc the non-adjacent standard deviations to integers without any rounding beyond the exact calculation:

        (SS, RC): round(sqrt(4.25)*86400) = round(178000.64) -> 178001
        (SS, CA): round(sqrt(4.54)*86400) = round(184000.000?) -> actually we got 184069.56 -> round(184069.56) = 184070
        (SS, DT): round(sqrt(6.62)*86400) = round(222528.01) -> 222528
        (OP, CA): round(sqrt(4.29)*86400) = round(178968.01) -> 178968
        (RC, DT): round(sqrt(2.37)*86400) = round(132950.0) -> 132950   [sqrt(2.37)=1.539222) * 86400 = 132950.0 approximately?]

    But let's compute exactly for (RC,DT): 
        variance = 2.37
        stddev_days = sqrt(2.37) = 1.539222 
        stddev_seconds = 1.539222 * 86400 = 132950.4928 -> round to 132950

    So we'll use:

        (SS, RC): (950400, 178001)
        (SS, CA): (1123200, 184070)
        (SS, DT): (1728000, 222528)
        (OP, CA): (1036800, 178968)
        (RC, DT): (777600, 132950)

 However, note that the problem says "representative subset", so we can also choose to use fewer non-adjacent pairs to avoid complexity.

 Given the time, we'll present the dictionary with the consecutive pairs and the non-adjacent pairs using the propagated standard deviation rounded to the nearest integer.

 We'll now write the code.

To address the prompt, I'll construct a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process. This profile will include estimated average times and standard deviations (in seconds) for pairs of activities, covering both directly consecutive and non-consecutive pairs. The estimates are based on typical supply chain operations:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Consecutive activity pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 43200),        # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: 1 day ± 0.5 days
    ('OP', 'RC'): (864000, 172800),      # Order Placement to Receive Components: 10 days ± 2 days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 17280),        # Receive Components to Quality Inspection: 1 day ± 0.2 days
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200),        # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly: 1 day ± 0.5 days
    ('CA', 'PT'): (259200, 86400),       # Component Assembly to Product Testing: 3 days ± 1 day
    ('PT', 'PK'): (86400, 17280),        # Product Testing to Packaging: 1 day ± 0.2 days
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 17280),        # Packaging to Warehouse Storage: 1 day ± 0.2 days
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),       # Warehouse Storage to Distribution: 2 days ± 1 day
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 1209600),     # Distribution to After-Sales Support: 7 days ± 14 days

    # Non-consecutive activity pairs (selected representative examples)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (950400, 178001),      # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: 11 days ± 2.06 days
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1123200, 184070),     # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly: 13 days ± 2.13 days
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1728000, 222528),     # Supplier Selection to Distribution: 20 days ± 2.57 days
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1036800, 178968),     # Order Placement to Component Assembly: 12 days ± 2.07 days
    ('RC', 'DT'): (777600, 132950)       # Receive Components to Distribution: 9 days ± 1.54 days
}
```

### Explanation of Key Estimates:
1. **Consecutive Pairs**:
   - **Short-term transitions** (e.g., `('RC', 'QI')`, `('PT', 'PK')`): Estimated at 1 day (86,400 seconds) with low variability (0.2 days or 4,320 seconds), reflecting efficient internal handoffs.
   - **Supplier-dependent transitions** (e.g., `('OP', 'RC')`): Longer at 10 days (864,000 seconds) with higher variability (2 days or 172,800 seconds), accounting for external lead times.
   - **Long-term dependencies** (e.g., `('DT', 'AS')`): 7 days (604,800 seconds) with significant variability (14 days or 1,209,600 seconds), reflecting variable times for after-sales engagement.

2. **Non-Consecutive Pairs**:
   - **End-to-End Chains** (e.g., `('SS', 'DT')`): Total cycle time (20 days or 1,728,000 seconds) with moderate variability (2.57 days or 222,528 seconds), aggregating uncertainties across all intermediate steps.
   - **Long-Intermediate Chains** (e.g., `('SS', 'CA')`): 13 days (1,123,200 seconds) with 2.13 days (184,070 seconds), combining supplier, receiving, inspection, and assembly delays.
   - **Material-Throughput Focus** (e.g., `('RC', 'DT')`): 9 days (777,600 seconds) with lower variability (1.54 days or 132,950 seconds), as this skips supplier selection but includes manufacturing and logistics.

### Calculation Notes:
- **Standard Deviation Propagation**: For non-consecutive pairs, standard deviations were calculated using variance addition (assuming independence: _total = (² + ² + ...)) and converted to seconds.
- **Units**: All times are in seconds for consistency, but comments include day-based descriptions for clarity.
- **Representativeness**: The subset covers critical paths (e.g., `SSDT`) and key process segments (e.g., manufacturing: `CAPTPKWSDT`).

This dictionary provides a realistic foundation for anomaly detection using the ZETA-based deviation model described in the prompt.
