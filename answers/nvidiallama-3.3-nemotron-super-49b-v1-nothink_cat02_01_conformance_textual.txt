| 5                   |

**2. Explanation of Violations with Reference to the Normative Process:**

### **Case 2**

* **Violation:** Incorrect Sequence - "Package items" before "Authorize payment"
* **Normative Expectation Reference:** "...payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging..."
* **Explanation:** In Case 2, after checking the inventory, the process incorrectly proceeds to "Package items" without first authorizing the payment. The correct sequence should have been "Receive order"  "Check inventory"  "Authorize payment"  "Package items"  ... 

### **Case 3**

* **Violation:** Two-fold:
  1. **Incorrect Sequence after Cancellation:** "Ship order" after "Cancel order"
  2. **Logical Inconsistency:** Attempting to ship an order after it has been canceled
* **Normative Expectation Reference:** "...if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process must branch into a cancellation scenario.... Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)..."
* **Explanation:**
  1. After "Cancel order", the process should directly lead to "Close order", not "Ship order".
  2. Shipping a canceled order contradicts the logical flow outlined in the normative process.

### **Case 5**

* **Violation:** Missing "Package items" before "Ship order"
* **Normative Expectation Reference:** "...items must be prepared before they can be shipped" (implying "Package items" must precede "Ship order")
* **Explanation:** The sequence in Case 5 skips the "Package items" activity, going directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order". This violates the requirement that items must be packaged before shipping.
