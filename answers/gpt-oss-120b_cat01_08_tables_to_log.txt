We need to produce event log integrating tables. Steps: Identify cases = order_id. Derive activities: Order Created, Item Picked (maybe per line), Order Dispatched (per delivery), Order Arrived (per delivery), Invoice Issued (per invoice), Payment Received (per payment). Also could include "Order Delivered" maybe combine dispatch+arrival as separate events. Resource column: map sales_person_id for order created, picker_id for picking, carrier_id for dispatch/arrival? For arrival maybe same carrier. Billing person for invoice, payment method maybe resource? Use resource table to map names.

We need to output markdown table with columns: Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, Resource, Other Attributes (maybe order_priority, item_id, quantity, delivery_note, invoice_amount, payment_method, etc). Provide one row per event.

We must ensure chronological order per case. For each order, list events sorted by timestamp.

We need to handle multiple items: could create separate events per item picking. That's fine.

Multiple deliveries: each delivery has dispatch and arrival events.

Multiple invoices and payments: each invoice event and each payment event.

Assumptions: If multiple items picking same order, separate events. If multiple deliveries, each dispatch/arrival separate.

Now construct data.

First, parse each order.

Now produce event log rows.

Columns: Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, Resource, Other Attributes.

We'll include resource name (mapped). For other attributes, include maybe order_priority for Order Created, item_id, quantity for picking, delivery_note for dispatch/arrival, invoice_amount for invoice, payment_method for payment.

Now generate rows sorted per case.

We'll need to list all events across all cases, but overall log can be sorted by case then timestamp.

Let's construct rows.

1. Order Created - 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z - Resource: Alice Brown (sales) - order_priority High, customer_id CUST-ABC, customer_type Retail.

7. Payment Received PAY-2005 - 2024-01-15T12:00:00Z - Credit Card.
Now produce markdown table with columns: Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, Resource, Attributes.

We'll map resource names using Resources table.

Resources mapping:


- SP-001 Alice Brown
- SP-002 Bob Smith
- SP-003 Charlie Kim
- WH-001 David Lin
- WH-002 Eva Johnson
- WH-003 Frank Miller
- CR-01 GlobalTransport
- CR-02 FastShip
- CR-03 AirExpress
- BL-001 Gina Carter
- BL-002 Harry Lee
- BL-003 Irene Park
For payment method, we could put method as resource column (or attribute). We'll put method in Attributes, and maybe resource column as "Payment System" but better to keep resource column blank for payments, and include method in attributes.

Now construct table.

Will need to ensure proper markdown formatting.

Let's produce rows.

*Assumptions & notes*  

- **Resource names** are taken from the *Resources* table; where a resource is not applicable (e.g., payments) the column is left blank.  
- For **order‑creation events** the order priority, customer ID and type are added as attributes.  
- **Item‑picking** events are recorded per line item, preserving the distinct picker and quantity.  
- **Delivery** events are split into separate “Dispatched” and “Arrived” activities; the carrier is used as the resource.  
- **Invoice** events include the invoice identifier and amount; the billing clerk is the resource.  
- **Payment** events list the payment method and reference as attributes; no explicit resource is assigned.  
- If a step is missing in the source data (e.g., no delivery for order 1004, no payment for order 1003), the event is omitted and the gap is noted in the assumptions.
