### Identified Anomalies in Temporal Profile

*   **Receive to Approve ('R', 'P'):** The average time is approximately 25 hours, but the standard deviation is unusually low (1 hour). This suggests a highly consistent, possibly rigid, time lag between claim submission and approval, which might not naturally occur in a dynamic process.
*   **Approve to Notify ('P', 'N'):** The average delay is a substantial 7 days, with a large standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates significant variability in when customers are notified after claim approval, suggesting potential delays or inefficiencies in the notification process.
*   **Assign to Close ('A', 'C'):** An average of 2 hours between assigning an adjuster and closing a claim, without explicitly including evaluation or approval steps in this direct interval, raises suspicion. It might imply that some claims are being closed very rapidly after assignment, potentially skipping crucial processing stages.
*   **Evaluate to Notify ('E', 'N'):** The average time of only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification is extremely short. This rapid transition might indicate an automated, potentially rushed, notification process, or that intermediate steps are being bypassed.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

*   **R to P (Receive to Approve) - Low STDEV:** This could be due to a hardcoded system rule that triggers an approval status after a fixed period, regardless of the actual evaluation progress. Alternatively, it might indicate a highly automated approval workflow where claims are batched and processed at specific intervals, leading to consistent delays.
*   **P to N (Approve to Notify) - High Average & STDEV:** The long average delay and high variability might be caused by manual notification processes, customer contact issues, or a backlog in the customer service department responsible for sending out notifications. Inconsistent availability of personnel or system issues with the notification channel could also contribute.
*   **A to C (Assign to Close) - Short Interval:** This pattern might occur if there's a process where claims are automatically closed upon assignment if certain criteria are met (e.g., low value, pre-approved categories), or if there's an error in event logging where the "Close" event is recorded prematurely. It could also point to fraud where claims are staged to appear closed quickly.
*   **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) - Very Short Interval:** This could be an indication of an automated system that immediately triggers a notification upon completion of the evaluation, potentially skipping a review or approval stage. It might also reflect an issue with how "Evaluate" and "Notify" events are logged, perhaps conflating them or logging them in rapid succession due to system automation.

### SQL Query Verification Approaches

To verify these anomalies, we can analyze the actual time differences between consecutive relevant activities for each claim and compare them to the established temporal profile. We will focus on identifying claims where these durations deviate significantly.

**1. Verify 'R' to 'P' anomaly (suspiciously low STDEV):**
We want to find claims where the time difference between 'R' and 'P' is consistently near the average, or perhaps even shorter than the expected processing time.

```sql
WITH ClaimRTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS r_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'R'
),
ClaimPTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS p_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
RP_Durations AS (
    SELECT
        c_r.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_p.p_timestamp - c_r.r_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimRTime c_r
    JOIN ClaimPTime c_p ON c_r.claim_id = c_p.claim_id
    WHERE c_p.p_timestamp > c_r.r_timestamp
)
SELECT
    claim_id,
    duration_seconds,
    AVG(duration_seconds) OVER () AS overall_avg_rp,
    STDDEV(duration_seconds) OVER () AS overall_stdev_rp
FROM RP_Durations
ORDER BY ABS(duration_seconds - (SELECT AVG(duration_seconds) FROM RP_Durations)) ASC;
```

**2. Verify 'P' to 'N' anomaly (long average and high STDEV):**
We will identify claims where the time between 'P' and 'N' is exceptionally long, or falls far outside the typical range (e.g., > average + 2*STDEV).

```sql
WITH ClaimPTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS p_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
ClaimNTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS n_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
),
PN_Durations AS (
    SELECT
        c_p.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_n.n_timestamp - c_p.p_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimPTime c_p
    JOIN ClaimNTime c_n ON c_p.claim_id = c_n.claim_id
    WHERE c_n.n_timestamp > c_p.p_timestamp
)
SELECT
    claim_id,
    duration_seconds,
    (SELECT AVG(duration_seconds) FROM PN_Durations) AS avg_pn,
    (SELECT STDDEV(duration_seconds) FROM PN_Durations) AS stdev_pn
FROM PN_Durations
WHERE duration_seconds > (SELECT AVG(duration_seconds) + 2 * STDDEV(duration_seconds) FROM PN_Durations)
ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC;
```

**3. Verify 'A' to 'C' anomaly (short interval possibly skipping steps):**
This query aims to find claims where 'C' follows 'A' very quickly, potentially without an intervening 'E' or 'P'. We'll also check the direct 'A' to 'C' duration.

```sql
WITH ClaimATime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS a_timestamp,
        resource AS a_resource -- Include resource for later correlation
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'A'
),
ClaimCTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS c_timestamp,
        resource AS c_resource
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'C'
),
AC_Durations AS (
    SELECT
        c_a.claim_id,
        c_a.a_resource,
        c_c.c_resource,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_c.c_timestamp - c_a.a_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimATime c_a
    JOIN ClaimCTime c_c ON c_a.claim_id = c_c.claim_id
    WHERE c_c.c_timestamp > c_a.a_timestamp
)
-- Find claims where C is very close to A, and check for intervening steps
SELECT
    ad.claim_id,
    ad.duration_seconds,
    ad.a_resource,
    ad.c_resource,
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = ad.claim_id AND ce.activity IN ('E', 'P') AND ce.timestamp BETWEEN ad.a_timestamp AND ad.c_timestamp) THEN 'Intervening steps present'
        ELSE 'No intervening E or P'
    END AS intermediate_steps_check
FROM AC_Durations ad
WHERE ad.duration_seconds < 7200 -- Using the profile's average of 7200 seconds
ORDER BY ad.duration_seconds ASC;
```

**4. Verify 'E' to 'N' anomaly (suspiciously short interval):**
We will look for claims where the time between 'E' and 'N' is close to zero or very small, indicating a potentially rushed process.

```sql
WITH ClaimETime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS e_timestamp,
        resource AS e_resource
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'E'
),
ClaimNTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS n_timestamp,
        resource AS n_resource
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
),
EN_Durations AS (
    SELECT
        c_e.claim_id,
        c_e.e_resource,
        c_n.n_resource,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_n.n_timestamp - c_e.e_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimETime c_e
    JOIN ClaimNTime c_n ON c_e.claim_id = c_n.claim_id
    WHERE c_n.n_timestamp > c_e.e_timestamp
)
SELECT
    claim_id,
    duration_seconds,
    e_resource,
    n_resource
FROM EN_Durations
WHERE duration_seconds < 300 -- Using the profile's average of 300 seconds
ORDER BY duration_seconds ASC;
```

**5. Correlate anomalies with claim types or adjusters:**
To further investigate, we can join with the `claims` and `adjusters` tables to see if these timing issues are specific to certain claim types, adjusters, or regions.

Example for 'P' to 'N' anomaly, correlating with `claim_type`:

```sql
WITH ClaimPTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS p_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
ClaimNTime AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        timestamp AS n_timestamp
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
),
PN_Durations AS (
    SELECT
        c_p.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_n.n_timestamp - c_p.p_timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM ClaimPTime c_p
    JOIN ClaimNTime c_n ON c_p.claim_id = c_n.claim_id
    WHERE c_n.n_timestamp > c_p.p_timestamp
)
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    AVG(pd.duration_seconds) AS average_pn_duration,
    STDDEV(pd.duration_seconds) AS stdev_pn_duration,
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_claims
FROM PN_Durations pd
JOIN claims c ON pd.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE pd.duration_seconds > (SELECT AVG(duration_seconds) + 2 * STDDEV(duration_seconds) FROM PN_Durations)
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY average_pn_duration DESC;
```
