The task involves processing an event log in DuckDB to find process variants and filter events to only those from the top K variants.


## Processing event log

- The task focuses on analyzing an event log using DuckDB to identify process variants.
- The goal is to filter events to include only those from the top K process variants based on frequency or significance.
- The event log table, named `event_log`, contains key columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`.

## Processing event log
- Process variants are defined as the ordered sequence of activities for each case, sorted by timestamp.
- To identify variants, first aggregate activities per case using STRING_AGG, ordered by timestamp, in a CTE or subquery.

## Building query steps
- Group cases by their activity sequences to count occurrences and identify unique variants.
- Select the top K variants based on frequency, then filter events to include only cases belonging to these variants.

## Building query steps  
- Create a CTE named `variants` to aggregate activities per case using STRING_AGG, ordered by timestamp, grouping by `case_id`.  
- Use another CTE, `top_variants`, to count variant frequencies, order by frequency, and limit to top K variants, treating K as a parameter.  
- Filter cases to include only those whose variants match the top K by joining or using IN with the `top_variants` CTE.  
- Finally, select from the `event_log` where `case_id` belongs to the filtered cases, ensuring all events from relevant cases are included.

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(*) AS freq
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY freq DESC
    LIMIT 5  -- Replace 5 with the desired value of K
),
relevant_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_variants
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_k_variants)
)
SELECT 
    case_id, 
    activity, 
    timestamp
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM relevant_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
``` 

### Explanation:
- **case_variants CTE**: Computes the ordered sequence of activities (variant) for each `case_id` using `STRING_AGG` with ordering by `timestamp`.
- **variant_counts CTE**: Groups by variant and counts the frequency (number of cases) per variant.
- **top_k_variants CTE**: Selects the top K variants by frequency (replace `5` with your desired K).
- **relevant_cases CTE**: Identifies `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants.
- **Main SELECT**: Filters the original `event_log` to include only events from the relevant cases, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity. The result includes all original columns as specified. 

This query ensures the sequence is correctly ordered, variants are aggregated and counted, and only events from top-K-variant cases are returned. If K is dynamic, it can be parameterized in DuckDB.
