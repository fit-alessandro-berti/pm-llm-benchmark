Let's walk through this step by step, analyzing the event log carefully to disambiguate recurring activities based on their contextual differences.

---

###  **Step 1: Identify Recurring Activities and Their Contexts**

The following activities appear **more than once in the same case**:
- **`Verify Documents`**  Appears twice in **C001**, **C003**
- **`Call Customer`**  Appears twice in **C002**
- (Note: `Adjust Account` and `Approve Request` appear once per case, so no ambiguity within a case.)

We focus on `Verify Documents` and `Call Customer`.

---

####  `Verify Documents`
| Case | Occurrence | Context |
|------|------------|--------|
| C001 | 1st | Initial verification with submitted documents (via portal) |
| C001 | 2nd | Re-verification after customer uploads missing ID scan |
| C003 | 1st | Initial physical verification during walk-in at branch |
| C003 | 2nd | Re-verification after account was adjusted internally |

 **Pattern**: First instance = initial verification. Second instance = re-verification after an intervening action (document upload or account adjustment).

Thus, we should distinguish:
- **Initial Document Verification**
- **Post-Correction Document Verification**

---

####  `Call Customer`
| Case | Occurrence | Context |
|------|------------|--------|
| C002 | 1st | Outbound call to *clarify* a discrepancy |
| C002 | 2nd | Follow-up call to *confirm* adjustments were made and accepted |

 **Pattern**: First call = fact-finding / clarification. Second call = confirmation / closure.

So we rename:
- **Clarify Information via Call**
- **Confirm Resolution via Call**

(Note: In C001 and C003, it's used only once and contextually clear — for missing docs or customer absence — but we’ll keep consistency in naming if applicable.)

###  **Step 2: Revised Event Log with Disambiguated Activity Names**

```plaintext
| Case ID | Activity                             | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

| C002    | Initial Document Verification         | 2024-05-02 08:15:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Identity verification.                                     |

```

> Note: I also slightly specialized the `Call Customer` in **C003** to reflect its unique context — not clarification or confirmation, but a logistical request for the customer to come back. So it got a distinct name accordingly.

###  **Step 3: Justification of Naming Decisions**

| Original Activity | New Name(s) | Reason |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Verify Documents** | - Initial Document Verification<br>- Post-Submission Document Verification (C001)<br>- Post-Adjustment Document Verification (C003) | The re-verification occurs after new data (either uploaded docs or after system changes). Distinguishing *why* verification happens again adds clarity. |
| **Call Customer** | - Clarify Missing Documents via Call (C001)<br>- Clarify Account Discrepancy via Call (C002)<br>- Confirm Adjustment via Call (C002)<br>- Request Customer Return via Call (C003) | The purpose differs: gathering info, confirming actions, or logistical coordination. Using verbs like *Clarify*, *Confirm*, or *Request* captures intent precisely. |

These names preserve the core concept ("call" or "verify") but add **intent** and **timing relative to process events**, which enables accurate process analysis (e.g., in process mining), SLA tracking, and automation design.

---

###  Summary

Renaming repeated activities based on **contextual intent**, **sequence**, and **triggering conditions** transforms an ambiguous log into a semantically rich process record. This supports:
- Better process discovery and conformance checking
- Clearer role-based dashboards
- Targeted automation (e.g., auto-calls for confirmation vs. escalation for clarification)
