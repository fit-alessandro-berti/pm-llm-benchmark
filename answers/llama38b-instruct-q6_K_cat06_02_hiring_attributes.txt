The goal of fairness analysis is to identify attributes that have a potential impact on the outcome or performance of a process. In your case, based on the event log and directly-follows graph provided, I can highlight some attributes that may be relevant for fairness analysis:

1. **case:gender**: This attribute has a frequency distribution among different values (True/False). If there is a significant difference in the outcome or performance between these values, it might indicate gender bias.
2. **case:citizen**: Similarly, this attribute has a frequency distribution among different values (True/False), which could potentially impact the fairness of the process.
3. **concept:name**: This attribute describes the type of application (e.g., Hand In Job Application, Application Rejected). The frequency distribution of these concepts might influence the performance or outcome of the process.
4. **resource**: The role of the resource involved in the process (e.g., HR-dummy, Senior Partner, Coding Interviewer) could impact the fairness of the decision-making process.
5. **start_timestamp** and **time**: These attributes represent the timing and duration of the process, which might influence the outcome or performance.

To perform a fairness analysis, you would need to:

1. Define the outcome or performance metric(s) you want to analyze (e.g., frequency of job offers, time-to-hire, etc.).
2. Calculate the distribution of these metrics across different values of the sensitive attributes mentioned above.
3. Analyze whether there are significant differences in these distributions that could indicate unfairness.
4. Identify potential causes for these differences and consider possible explanations or mitigations.

Keep in mind that fairness analysis is a complex topic, and this answer provides only a high-level overview of the potential sensitive attributes. A more thorough analysis would require a deeper understanding of your specific use case and process.
