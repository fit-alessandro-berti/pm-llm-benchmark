**Short answer:**  
The **bias appears in the process that benefits GroupB (unprotected group)**. It is caused by the *ScoreAdjustment* step, which gives a +10 “Community Boost” to applicants who are **LocalResident = TRUE** and/or belong to a **CommunityGroup**. GroupA never receives this adjustment (LocalResident = FALSE, CommunityGroup = None), so GroupB systematically gains extra points and higher approval chances even when their raw scores are lower.

###  How the bias manifests

**GroupA (Protected)**
- LocalResident = **FALSE**
- CommunityGroup = **None**
- ScoreAdjustment = **0** in all cases  
- Decisions depend only on raw score  

Example:
- **P002**: Score 710  **Rejected**

**GroupB (Unprotected)**
- LocalResident = **TRUE**
- CommunityGroup = **Highland Civic Darts Club**
- **ScoreAdjustment +10** for community members  
- Decisions use *adjusted* scores  

Example:
- **U003**: Score 695 + 10 = **705  Approved**  
- Yet **P002** in GroupA was rejected at **710** (higher raw score)

---

###  Why this is bias
- The **Community Boost** is effectively a **privilege tied to residency/community membership**, which aligns with the unprotected group.
- The protected group **never receives the same advantage**, so they are **systematically disadvantaged**.
- This creates **disparate impact**: GroupB gets approvals at lower raw scores, while GroupA is rejected despite higher scores.

###  Conclusion
The log shows **preferential treatment of GroupB** through score adjustments based on **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup**. This produces **systematic differences in final decisions**, disadvantaging GroupA and indicating **bias in the scoring/decision process**.
