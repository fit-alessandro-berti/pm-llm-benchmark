### Analysis of POWL Models for Hire-to-Retire Process

**1. Standard Hire-to-Retire Process Flow:**
- **Post Job Advertisement**
- **Screen Candidates**
- **Conduct Interviews**
- **Make Hiring Decision**
- **Onboard New Employee**
- **Add to Payroll**
- **Close Case**

#### POWL Model 1 Analysis:

**Anomalies Identified:**

- **Order Issue:** The model allows `Interview` to start after `Screen`, but there's no direct order ensuring that `Interview` must come after `Screen`. This can lead to interviews happening before screening, which is illogical.
  
- **Lack of Parallelism:** There's no indication that screening and interviewing could happen in parallel or that there's any choice involved in the process, which might not be realistic in larger organizations where multiple candidates are processed simultaneously.

**Impact on Process:**
- **Severity:** The anomaly with the order of screening and interviewing could lead to significant inefficiencies or errors in candidate selection. 
- **Integrity:** This model lacks flexibility in terms of process flow, potentially missing out on common practices like parallel processing or candidate rejections at different stages.

#### POWL Model 2 Analysis:

**Anomalies Identified:**

- **Post-Interview Flow:** The model allows `Post_Job_Ad` to directly precede `Interview`, implying interviews can start before or in parallel with screening, which is not standard practice.

- **Loop in Onboarding:** The loop between `Onboard` and a silent transition (`skip`) allows for potential endless loops where onboarding might not lead to payroll addition, which seems unusual for a hire-to-retire process.

- **XOR with Payroll:** The exclusive choice (`xor_payroll`) between adding to payroll and skipping this step means that an employee might not be added to payroll, which could be a significant issue if this represents a choice to not pay the employee.

**Impact on Process:**
- **Severity:** The potential for endless onboarding loops and the option to not add an employee to payroll are severe anomalies that could disrupt the fundamental purpose of hiring.
- **Integrity:** The model introduces unnecessary complexity with loops and choices that do not align well with the goal of a streamlined hire-to-retire process.

### Decision:

**Which Model More Closely Aligns with Normative Process:**

- **Model 1:** Despite its lack of flexibility for parallel activities, **Model 1** ensures a more logical sequence of steps where screening precedes interviews, and all steps are followed in a somewhat standard manner. The main issue is the lack of explicit order between screening and interviewing, which could be resolved with additional ordering constraints.

- **Model 2:** While it attempts to introduce flexibility with loops and choices, these elements introduce severe anomalies that could undermine the entire hiring process. The potential for not onboarding or paying an employee or creating an endless loop in onboarding makes this model less aligned with a normative hire-to-retire process.

**Justification:**
- **Model 1** is chosen because its anomalies are less severe and can be easily corrected. The process flow, though somewhat rigid, ensures that each step logically follows the previous one, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the hiring process. The issues in Model 2, particularly the loop and payroll decision, could fundamentally break the process flow, making it less suitable for a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.
