Below is the result of checking every trace in the log against the intent expressed in the textual description.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Normative logic distilled from the text
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The first activity must always be RECEIVE ORDER.  
2. CHECK INVENTORY must come immediately after the receive step and must precede every
   other business-relevant activity (it is the “gateway” activity).  
3. If the inventory is sufficient (the “fulfilment path”) the only legal
   continuation is  

   RECEIVE  CHECK  AUTHORISE PAYMENT  PACKAGE ITEMS  SHIP ORDER  CLOSE ORDER
   (no cancellations are allowed on this path).

4. If the inventory is insufficient (the “cancellation path”) the only legal
   continuation is  

   RECEIVE  CHECK  CANCEL ORDER  CLOSE ORDER  
   (no authorisation, packaging, or shipping is allowed once we cancel).

5. Derived ordering constraints (taken directly from the narrative):
   • Authorise Payment must be AFTER Check Inventory and BEFORE Package Items.  
   • Package Items must be AFTER Authorise Payment and BEFORE Ship Order.  
   • Ship Order must be AFTER Package Items and must NEVER follow Cancel Order.  
   • Close Order must be the final step in every trace.

Assessment of every case in the log
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Case 1  
Trace: Receive  Check  Authorise  Package  Ship  Close  
Conforms completely to the “fulfilment path”.  
 NO VIOLATION.

Case 2  
Trace: Receive  Check  Package  Authorise  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
• Package Items occurs before Authorise Payment (breaks rule 3 & rule 5).  
• Consequently Authorise Payment is not “between” Check and Package as required.  
 VIOLATING CASE.

Case 3  
Trace: Receive  Check  Authorise  Cancel  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
• Cancel Order appears after Authorise Payment (mixes the two mutually exclusive
  paths; breaks rule 3 and rule 4).  
• Ship Order occurs after a cancellation (explicitly disallowed by rule 4 & 5).  
• Ship Order also happens without any Package Items beforehand.  
 VIOLATING CASE.

Case 4  
Trace: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
Matches the “cancellation path” exactly.  
 NO VIOLATION.

Case 5  
Trace: Receive  Check  Authorise  Ship  Close  
Violations:  
• Package Items is missing; Ship Order is executed without packaging (breaks rule 5).  
 VIOLATING CASE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Cases that deviate from the normative process: **2, 3, and 5**.

• Case 2 packages before payment is authorised.  
• Case 3 mixes fulfilment and cancellation paths and ships after cancelling.  
• Case 5 skips the packaging step and ships directly after payment authorisation.
