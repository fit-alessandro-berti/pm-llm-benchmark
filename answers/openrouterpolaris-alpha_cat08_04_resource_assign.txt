Great scenario. I’ll stay concrete and pragmatic, grounded in process mining concepts and what TechSolve can actually do with its event log.

SECTION 1 – Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

1.1. Metrics and views for agents and tiers

Using the event log, build views at three levels: overall process, by tier (L1/L2/L3), and by individual agent.

Key metrics:

- Workload distribution:
  - Tickets handled per agent, per tier, per day/week.
  - Active handling time vs. waiting/queue time per ticket stage.
  - Concurrent work (how many tickets in-progress per agent).
  - Outcome: detect overloaded vs. underutilized agents and unbalanced tiers.

- Processing time and efficiency:
  - Average/median:
    - Time from Assign X to Work X Start (agent responsiveness).
    - Time from Work X Start to Work X End (handling time).
    - Time in each queue per tier.
  - Stratify by:
    - Priority (P1–P4).
    - Category.
    - Required Skill.
    - Agent / Tier.
  - Outcome: see which agents/tiers are slower or faster for specific work types.

- First-contact / first-tier resolution:
  - L1 First-Tier Resolution Rate:
    - % of tickets assigned to L1 that are resolved without escalation.
    - By category, required skill, and priority.
  - L2/L3 First-Owner Resolution Rate:
    - % resolved by first specialist they’re assigned to (no further reassign).
  - Outcome: see where L1 is effective vs. escalating too much; see if specialists get “clean” assignments.

- Ticket-type specialization:
  - For each agent:
    - Volume and performance by category and required skill.
    - Example: Agent B12’s App-CRM tickets: avg handling time, rework, SLA hit rate.
  - Outcome: discover natural specializations and misalignments (who is actually good at what).

- Reassignments and escalations:
  - # of reassignments per ticket, per category, per priority.
  - Time added by each reassignment (delta between last end and next start).
  - Escalation rate from L1 to L2/L3 by category / required skill.
  - Downward reassignment (L2/L3 back to L1 or across skills).
  - Outcome: patterns of “ping-pong” tickets and incorrect first assignment.

1.2. Process mining techniques to reveal actual patterns

- Process discovery:
  - Build a process model from the event log (e.g., using Inductive Miner / Heuristic Miner).
  - Highlight:
    - Typical flows: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Resolve.
    - Problematic flows: Created  Assign L1  Work L1  Escalate L2  Assign L2  Reassign  Assign L2/L3  …
  - Compare against the intended process (L1 triage with skill-based escalation).
  - Outcome: evidence of deviations like unnecessary hops or late escalations.

- Resource interaction / handover-of-work analysis:
  - Construct handover networks: edge from Agent X to Agent Y if Y receives the ticket after X.
  - Analyze at:
    - Agent level: who hands off to whom.
    - Role/tier level: L1L2, L2L3, L2L2, etc.
  - Outcome:
    - Identify “ping-pong” patterns (XYX).
    - Identify central bottlenecks (a few specialists receiving too many handovers).
    - Spot informal roles (L1 acting as pseudo-L2 for certain categories).

- Role discovery:
  - Use clustering on:
    - Activities performed.
    - Ticket types handled.
    - Skills listed vs. skills implied by work done.
  - Outcome:
    - Actual roles vs. HR-defined roles.
    - Example: Some L1 agents consistently and successfully handle App-CRM  they can be expanded as “L1-Advanced App-CRM.”

1.3. Analyzing utilization of specific skills

- Skill utilization matrix:
  - For each Required Skill:
    - Which agents actually worked tickets with this skill?
    - How many, with what performance (handling time, SLA adherence, reassigns)?
  - Compare to declared Agent Skills:
    - Are declared experts not receiving those tickets?
    - Are non-experts handling them (with more reassignments or delays)?

- Skill-level efficiency:
  - For each skill:
    - Avg resolution time when handled by:
      - Certified/specialist agents.
      - Non-specialists.
    - Probability of escalation or reassign when first assigned to non-specialist.
  - Outcome:
    - Quantify cost of misrouted skills.
    - Find specialists spending time on generic tasks that L1 could handle.

SECTION 2 – Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Use the above analytics to systematically isolate issues. Examples:

2.1. Bottlenecks due to scarce skills

- Indicators:
  - Long queue times before Work Start for tickets requiring specific skills (e.g., Networking-Firewall, DB-SQL).
  - High SLA breach rate for those skill types.
  - A very small number of agents handling most of those tickets.
- Quantify:
  - “Tickets with Required Skill = DB-SQL: avg wait before L2 start = 3h vs. overall avg 45m; 28% SLA breaches vs. 9% overall.”

2.2. Delays from reassignments / escalations

- Indicators:
  - Tickets with 2 reassignments:
    - Compare cycle time vs. tickets with 0–1 reassignments.
  - Measure:
    - Added delay per reassignment:
      - For each reassignment: time from previous Work End/Escalate to next Work Start.
- Quantify:
  - “Each additional reassignment adds median 40 minutes waiting; tickets with 3 reassignments are 3.1x more likely to miss SLA.”

2.3. Impact of incorrect initial assignments

- Indicators:
  - Tickets first assigned to L1 that:
    - Are escalated without real work (short Work L1 duration, e.g., <2–5 minutes).
    - Always end up in the same L2 team/skill.
- Quantify:
  - “For P2 Network-Firewall tickets: 75% are escalated after <5 minutes at L1 and incur avg 25 minutes extra delay before hitting the correct L2.”
- Outcome:
  - Evidence that some patterns should skip or streamline initial steps.

2.4. Underperforming / overloaded agents and teams

- Overload:
  - Agents with:
    - High assigned volume.
    - Long queue times before they start work.
    - Good handling times once started.
  - Interpretation: queueing, not inefficiency.

- Underperformance:
  - Agents whose:
    - Handling times are consistently slower, controlling for ticket type and priority.
    - Tickets more often need reassignment or escalation.
- Team-level:
  - Compare L1 groups or L2 domains.
- Quantify:
  - “Agent B12 handles 3x average L2 volume; wait before B12 start: 50m vs. 20m L2 avg.”
  - “Tickets starting at L1 Team X are 40% more likely to be reassigned.”

2.5. Correlation with SLA breaches

- For each SLA breach:
  - Count:
    - Reassignments.
    - Escalation depth (L1L2L3).
    - Time spent at each stage.
  - Build:
    - Logistic regression or decision trees: predictors = #reassignments, required skill, initial category accuracy, initial tier, queue times.
- Outcome:
  - “Top predictors of SLA breach: (1) >2 reassignments, (2) DB-SQL skill, (3) initial miscategorization from Hardware  Software-App.”

SECTION 3 – Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Using findings, identify root causes (not just symptoms).

3.1. Deficient assignment rules

- Evidence:
  - Round-robin or simple queue within a tier ignoring:
    - Required Skill.
    - Current workload.
    - Historical performance.
- Consequences:
  - Misrouted tickets  reassignments.
  - Overloading of a subset of agents while others idle.
- Use decision mining:
  - Reconstruct “implicit rules” from historical successful assignments (who got which tickets when it went well).
  - Compare to current “explicit” round-robin rules  highlight misalignment.

3.2. Inaccurate or incomplete skill profiles

- Evidence:
  - Tickets of a skill type often resolved by agents not tagged with that skill.
  - Specialists not receiving matching tickets.
- Root cause:
  - Static HR skill matrix; not updated to reflect real capabilities.
- Use role/skill discovery:
  - Infer “operational skills” from event log and outcomes.
  - Compare to documented skills to see gaps.

3.3. Poor initial categorization or missing required skill identification

- Evidence:
  - High recategorization rates (Category changed mid-way).
  - Frequent change of Required Skill after L2 analysis.
- Root cause:
  - Weak intake triage, unclear forms, or insufficient guidance/tools for L1/dispatchers.
- Use variant analysis:
  - Compare:
    - Variant A: “Created  Correct Assign  Single Tier Resolve.”
    - Variant B: “Created  Mis-Category  Multiple Reassignments.”
  - Identify which attributes at creation (channel, free-text, dispatcher, category) predict path B.

3.4. Lack of real-time visibility into workload

- Evidence:
  - Assignments going to already overloaded agents while others idle.
- Root cause:
  - Dispatchers follow static rules/time-of-day, without system guidance on real-time queues.

3.5. Insufficient L1 training/empowerment

- Evidence:
  - Many escalations where:
    - Similar tickets are resolved successfully by some L1 agents but escalated by others.
- Use decision mining on L1:
  - Identify which ticket characteristics and L1 agents lead to “Resolved at L1” vs. “Escalated.”
  - Outcome:
    - Coaching and targeted knowledge for weaker L1s.
    - Define clearer decision rules when L1 should own vs. escalate.

SECTION 4 – Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Below are five concrete strategies (at least three requested), all leveraging process mining insights.

Strategy 1: Skill- and Proficiency-Based Routing Engine

- Issue addressed:
  - Misassignment, excessive reassignments, specialists doing generic work.
- Approach:
  - Build a routing rule set from mined data:
    - Map ticket attributes (Category, Required Skill, keywords, priority)  “effective resolver profiles” (who historically resolved fastest with few reassignments).
    - Use operational skill discovery to validate skill matrix.
  - Engine:
    - When a ticket is created:
      - Determine required skill(s) and tier.
      - Route to an agent who:
        - Has that skill (declared + inferred).
        - Has strong historical performance for similar tickets.
- Data needed:
  - Event log (ticket attributes, outcomes, agents).
  - Up-to-date skill matrix enriched by log-based inferences.
- Benefits:
  - Fewer reassignments.
  - Specialists focus on true specialist work.
  - Faster time-to-correct-owner, better SLA compliance.

Strategy 2: Workload- and Priority-Aware Assignment

- Issue addressed:
  - Uneven workloads, queues at certain agents, delayed starts while others idle.
- Approach:
  - Augment routing engine with real-time load metrics:
    - Current # of open tickets per agent, WIP limits, aging of assigned tickets.
    - Respect priorities: P1/P2 always preempted to least-loaded qualified agents.
  - Assignment algorithm:
    - Among qualified agents:
      - Score = f(current load, last activity time, performance for that ticket type).
      - Assign to best-scoring agent, not purely round-robin.
- Data needed:
  - Real-time event feed: new tickets, ongoing assignments.
  - Historical process data to calibrate thresholds (e.g., max WIP per agent).
- Benefits:
  - Balanced distribution.
  - Reduced waiting-to-start times.
  - Less burnout for top performers and better utilization of underused staff.

Strategy 3: Predictive Triage and Early Correct Escalation

- Issue addressed:
  - Incorrect L1 assignment, late escalation, and long “bouncing” before reaching the right specialist.
- Approach:
  - Train a classification model using historical data:
    - Input: ticket category, channel, description text, requester, CI, past incidents, time of day.
    - Output:
      - Likely required skill.
      - Likely tier needed for resolution.
      - Probability of “Resolved by L1” vs. “Needs L2/L3.”
  - Use this at creation:
    - Suggest correct Required Skill and tier.
    - For high-confidence “non-L1” tickets (e.g., complex firewall, critical DB incidents), bypass standard L1 or route to “expert-L1” or directly to L2.
- Data needed:
  - Rich historical event log, including text fields if possible.
  - SLA outcomes and escalation patterns.
- Benefits:
  - Cuts avoidable L1 hops.
  - Faster routing to true owners.
  - Reduced reassignments and SLA breaches, especially for P1/P2.

Strategy 4: L1 Empowerment and Tiered Skill Expansion

- Issue addressed:
  - Over-escalation to L2/L3 for solvable issues; specialists doing basic tasks.
- Approach:
  - From process mining:
    - Identify:
      - Frequent issues currently resolved by L2/L3 that are structurally simple.
      - L1 agents who already resolve such tickets successfully.
  - Actions:
    - Create “L1-Advanced” playbooks for those patterns.
    - Train selected L1s; update their formal skills.
    - Adjust routing so these tickets first go to empowered L1-Advanced.
- Data needed:
  - Incident patterns by resolution path and tier.
  - Historical success rates at each tier.
- Benefits:
  - More first-tier resolution.
  - L2/L3 capacity freed for complex incidents.

Strategy 5: Dynamic Role and Capacity Adjustment Based on Demand Patterns

- Issue addressed:
  - Time-based overload (e.g., Monday spikes), mismatch between staffing and incident arrival, persistent skill bottlenecks.
- Approach:
  - Use process mining to:
    - Analyze arrival patterns by hour/day/skill/priority.
    - Identify when specific domains (e.g., Network, CRM) peak.
  - Actions:
    - Time-boxed “virtual pools”:
      - During peak windows, temporarily shift cross-trained L1/L2 agents into certain skills or priority queues.
    - Rotational scheduling based on predicted demand.
- Data needed:
  - Time-series of incident arrivals and workloads.
  - Skill/cross-skill capabilities.
- Benefits:
  - Proactive coverage for known peaks.
  - Reduced queues and SLA risk without permanent headcount increases.

SECTION 5 – Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

5.1. Simulation before implementation

Use the mined models and resource parameters to test strategies safely.

Steps:

- Build an as-is simulation model:
  - From the event log:
    - Arrival rates by category/priority/skill over time.
    - Activity durations (per tier, per agent group).
    - Routing probabilities (e.g., L1L2 escalate likelihood).
    - Current resource calendars and capacities.
  - Validate:
    - Ensure simulated KPIs (cycle times, SLA rates, reassignments) match historical patterns.

- Define to-be scenarios:
  - Scenario A: Add skill-based routing.
  - Scenario B: Add skill + workload-based routing.
  - Scenario C: Predictive triage + L1 empowerment + dynamic pools.
  - For each:
    - Adjust routing rules, resource pools, WIP limits according to strategies above.

- Run simulations:
  - Compare:
    - Mean/95th percentile resolution times by priority.
    - SLA compliance per priority.
    - Reassignment counts.
    - Utilization per skill/resource group.
  - Choose the strategy mix that:
    - Improves KPIs significantly.
    - Is operationally realistic.

5.2. Implementation and continuous monitoring (using process mining dashboards)

After rollout, use continuous process mining for feedback. Key KPIs and views:

- Core KPIs:
  - SLA compliance by priority, category, required skill.
  - Average and 90th/95th percentile:
    - End-to-end resolution time.
    - Time to first meaningful response.
  - Reassignments:
    - Average # per ticket.
    - % tickets with >1, >2 reassignments.
  - Escalation metrics:
    - L1 first-tier resolution rate (by category/agent).
    - % direct-to-L2/L3 (and whether justified).
  - Queue/Wait times:
    - Wait from assign to work start per tier/skill.
  - Utilization:
    - Per agent and per skill group.
    - Highlight sustained overload or underuse.

- Diagnostic process views:
  - “Happy path” vs “problem paths”:
    - Visualize common flows for SLA-met vs. SLA-breached tickets.
  - Handover network:
    - Monitor whether ping-pong patterns reduce over time.
  - Skill usage view:
    - Tickets by Required Skill vs. actual resolving agents; verify alignment improves.

- Control and alerts:
  - Real-time or daily alerts for:
    - Spikes in reassignments.
    - Emerging bottlenecks for specific skills.
    - Drop in L1 resolution rates for targeted categories.
  - Monthly/quarterly reviews:
    - Re-mine roles and skills to keep routing rules aligned with reality.
    - Identify needs for training or capacity adjustments.

- Governance:
  - Treat this as a closed-loop:
    - Analyze  Design  Simulate  Implement  Monitor  Refine.
  - Involve operations leads:
    - Validate that algorithmic decisions match practical realities.

If you’d like, next step I can:
- Translate this into a concrete blueprint for TechSolve (e.g., fields needed in the log, example dashboards, and pseudo-logic for a routing engine), or
- Walk through a small worked example using your sample log structure.
