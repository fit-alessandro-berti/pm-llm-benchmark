Targeted, openended questions to deepen understanding of the propertyonboarding process

1. Intake & initiation  
• How does a landlord formally initiate an onboarding request, and what information must be provided up front before a coordinator becomes involved?  
• Are there servicelevel targets (e.g., response time, total onboarding duration) established for the initial contact phase, and how are they monitored?

2. Documentation review  
• What specific documents are considered mandatory versus optional, and who defines those requirements for each city or property type?  
• When documentation is incomplete or outdated, how is the followup with landlords tracked and escalated to ensure timely resolution?

3. Property coordinator’s role  
• Besides verifying documents, what other responsibilities does the coordinator own, and at what point does ownership transfer to the property manager?  
• How is data entry into the central property database validated for accuracy and completeness?

4. Selecting a dedicated property manager  
• Which criteria carry the most weight in the managerassignment decision (workload, geography, experience, landlord preferences, etc.), and who makes the final call?  
• If no suitable manager is available or a landlord rejects a proposed manager, what contingency steps are taken?

5. Manager–landlord alignment meeting  
• What key topics or decisions must be covered in the introductory meeting, and how are agreements from that meeting documented?  
• How are special landlord policies (pets, maintenance responsibilities, payment channels) enforced downstream in the process?

6. Scheduling photography and inspection  
• How are external vendors (photographers, inspectors, contractors) selected and scheduled, and what timelines are typical between request and visit?  
• What constitutes “passing” an inspection, and who signs off that any remediation work satisfies safety and habitability standards?

7. Marketing preparation  
• How is the asking rent set—what data or models inform pricing, and who has final approval?  
• Which marketing channels are used (company portal, thirdparty sites, print), and how is listing content kept consistent across those platforms?

8. Activation in systems  
• What specific system events or milestones signal that a property is officially “activated,” and who confirms that activation is complete?  
• How are errors discovered after activation (e.g., incorrect amenities or pricing) corrected, and what is the impact on tenants already applying?

9. Tenant screening & lease negotiation  
• What screening criteria are standard versus customizable per landlord, and how are exceptions handled to remain compliant with fairhousing laws?  
• When multiple qualified applicants exist, what factors influence the final tenant selection and potential rent or leaseterm negotiations?

10. Lease execution & movein  
• Do you use a standard lease template companywide, and under what circumstances is legal review required for custom clauses?  
• How are deposits, rent payments, and movein inspections coordinated among finance, operations, and the property manager?

11. Quality checks & internal audits  
• At which points in the onboarding timeline do compliance, finance, and IT teams perform their reviews, and how are findings tracked to closure?  
• Is the audit scope 100 % of properties or samplebased, and what triggers a deeper review?

12. Exception handling & special cases  
• What are the most common exceptions encountered (e.g., special insurance, landmarked buildings, furnished units), and how do they impact the standard timeline?  
• How is accountability defined when multiple teams must collaborate to resolve an exception?

13. Communication & information flow  
• Which tools (CRM, email, project management software) serve as the system of record for communications, and how is version control maintained?  
• How do regional offices share onboarding updates with headquarters and with one another to ensure visibility across the organization?

14. Metrics, KPIs, and continuous improvement  
• What key performance indicators do you track for property onboarding (cycle time, cost per property, landlord satisfaction, compliance defects, etc.)?  
• How is feedback from landlords, tenants, and internal teams gathered and fed back into process improvements?

15. Regional and regulatory variation  
• How does the onboarding workflow differ across cities with distinct housing regulations or market dynamics?  
• What mechanisms are in place to keep the process documentation current when local laws change?

16. Risk management and escalation  
• What are your primary risk areas during onboarding (legal, financial, reputational), and how are they mitigated?  
• When a risk materializes, what is the escalation path, and who has authority to pause or halt the onboarding?

17. Postonboarding handoff  
• Once the tenant has moved in, how is responsibility formally transferred from the onboarding team to ongoing property management and support functions?  
• Are there postonboarding reviews or debriefs to capture lessons learned for future properties?

These questions should help clarify decision criteria, roles, timing, exception handling, and overall governance of the propertyonboarding process.
