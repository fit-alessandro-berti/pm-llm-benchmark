Targeted, open-ended questions for clarifying the property-onboarding process:

INTAKE & DOCUMENT VERIFICATION  
1. How does the landlord’s initial request get logged and prioritized—do you use a queue, a CRM ticket, or another method?  
2. What specific documents are considered mandatory versus optional at this first stage, and who defines that list?  
3. What service-level targets (e.g., turnaround times) do you have for reviewing and approving submitted documents?  
4. When documentation is incomplete, how do you decide between pushing the landlord to supply it versus the company obtaining it on their behalf?

PROPERTY DATA CAPTURE  
5. Which data fields are required in the central property database before the record is considered “complete,” and who signs off on that completeness?  
6. How often are property details (e.g., expected rent) revisited or updated after the initial entry but before activation?

PROPERTY MANAGER ASSIGNMENT  
7. Can you describe the weighting or hierarchy among workload, geography, experience, and landlord requirements when assigning a property manager?  
8. What happens if no available manager meets all the desired criteria—do you escalate, redistribute workload, or delay onboarding?  
9. Are landlords ever given a choice of property managers, or is the assignment solely internal?

LANDLORD INTRODUCTORY MEETING  
10. What deliverables or artifacts come out of the initial call—e.g., a documented scope, a summary of special clauses, or a formal service agreement addendum?  
11. How do you capture and circulate any custom policies (pets, maintenance, payment channels) to downstream teams?

INSPECTION & PHOTOGRAPHY  
12. Who is responsible for sourcing and scheduling inspectors or contractors—central scheduling or the assigned property manager?  
13. How do you track and enforce remediation deadlines when inspection issues are found?  
14. What contingency plans exist if the landlord refuses or delays needed repairs?

MARKETING & PRICING  
15. At what point is the marketing team brought in, and what information must they receive before beginning their work?  
16. How do you reconcile differences between the marketing team’s pricing model and the landlord’s expected rent?  
17. Which marketing channels (own portal, third-party sites, social media) are prioritized, and who decides?

TENANT SCREENING & LEASE NEGOTIATION  
18. How do you balance speed of tenant placement with thoroughness of screening—are there explicit KPIs?  
19. In cases of multiple qualified applicants, what criteria drive the final selection (e.g., credit score, length of lease, landlord preference)?  
20. How are promotional discounts or lease incentives approved—does the property manager decide or is there a separate approval chain?

QUALITY CHECKS & AUDITS  
21. At what stages do compliance, finance, and IT each enter the workflow, and what are their specific sign-off requirements?  
22. How are audit findings fed back into the process to prevent future issues?  
23. Is there a “go/no-go” gate just before activation, and who has veto power?

TIMING & SEQUENCING  
24. Could you outline the typical end-to-end timeline from first landlord contact to tenant move-in, and where delays most often occur?  
25. Which steps can run in parallel versus strictly in sequence?

EXCEPTION & RISK HANDLING  
26. How do you document and manage exceptions such as special insurance needs or custom lease clauses?  
27. What escalation paths exist when the landlord’s demands conflict with company policies or regulations?  
28. How frequently do exceptions occur, and do you track their impact on cost or cycle time?

COMMUNICATION & VISIBILITY  
29. What tools are currently used for cross-team communication, and do you have pain points with information getting lost or duplicated?  
30. How do you provide status visibility to landlords during the onboarding journey—dashboard, periodic emails, direct calls?  

METRICS & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  
31. What key performance indicators do you monitor to judge the success of the onboarding process (e.g., days to activation, tenant satisfaction, retention of landlords)?  
32. Have you identified bottlenecks or recurring failure points, and what initiatives are in place to address them?
