The flow describes an internal management approval and payment processing chain.

1. The declaration is submitted to a supervisor.
2. If it's approved, then it goes to another supervisor for final approval. This usually requires more approvals and a longer period of time, as these supervisors have higher authority levels.
3. If the second supervisor approves it, it can be processed (payment handled).
4. If it's rejected, it can be re-submitted by the original submitter, who then can try to get another supervisor to approve or reject it.

So this process is a bit like a series of approvals and re-approvals as different supervisors take over in line with their authority levels.
The performance measures show that as the chain length increases, time taken per action increases. This makes sense, since more levels need to be reached for each approval. The more steps involved, the higher chance of it being rejected or needing further approvals.

The data does not describe what is being approved, but there appears to be a hierarchy with different supervisors holding different authority levels.

It's interesting how the processing flow and its performance measure changes according to the level of authority, which would indicate some form of organizational hierarchy. 

Overall this is quite detailed for such a short dataset, indicating it likely represents real data from a complex business process.
