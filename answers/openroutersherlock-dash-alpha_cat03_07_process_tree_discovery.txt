```python
-> (
    + (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        'Validate Form (VF)'
    ),
    * (
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            X (
                'Approval Decision (AD)',
                -> (
                    'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                    + (
                        'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                        'Validate Form (VF)'
                    )
                )
            )
        ),
        'Approval Decision (AD)'
    ),
    -> (
        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
        'Archive Case (AC)'
    )
)
```

This process tree captures:

1. **Initial sequence**: RA followed by VF (both always present)
2. **Core loop** after AE: 
   - Either go directly to AD (happy path, case 2)
   - Or enter loop body: RMI + (optional additional RMI or VF) which captures the repetitions seen in cases 1 and 3
3. **Final sequence**: Always SC  AC

The loop allows:
- Case 2: AE  AD (exit loop immediately)
- Case 1: AE  RMI  VF  AD  
- Case 3: AE  RMI  RMI  VF  AD

The `+ (RMI, RMI or VF)` in the loop body flexibly captures single/multiple RMI followed by optional VF re-execution.
