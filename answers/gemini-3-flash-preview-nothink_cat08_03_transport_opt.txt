This analysis outlines a process mining-driven approach to optimizing Speedy Parcels’ last-mile delivery operations. By integrating disparate data sources, we can move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive, data-driven management.

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

#### Data Preprocessing and Integration
To create a cohesive event log, we must align data around a common **Case ID**, which in this context is the **"Vehicle-Day"** (e.g., `V12-20241205`). This allows us to track the lifecycle of a single vehicle’s journey from start-of-shift to end-of-shift.

*   **The Stitching Process:**
    *   **GPS to Dispatch:** Map GPS coordinates to specific Stop IDs in the Dispatch system using "Geofencing." An "Arrive Customer" event is enriched with the distance from the vehicle to the actual delivery point.
    *   **Scanner to GPS:** Align timestamps of scanner events (e.g., "Delivery Success") with GPS speed and status to verify if the vehicle was indeed stationary and nearby.
    *   **Maintenance to Case:** Tag specific Vehicle-Days with "Maintenance Flag" attributes if an unscheduled repair occurred during or immediately after that shift.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Data Granularity:** GPS data is frequent (every few seconds), while Scanner data is sparse. We must "abstract" raw GPS pings into higher-level activities like "In Transit" or "Searching for Parking."
    *   **Clock Synchronization:** Discrepancies between the vehicle’s onboard computer, the driver’s handheld, and the central server can lead to negative durations if not normalized.

#### Discovery and Conformance
*   **Discovery:** Using algorithms like **Inductive Miner**, we visualize the *Actual* process. We expect to see a non-linear "spaghetti" model where drivers deviate from the sequence, perform "Unscheduled Stops," or circle blocks looking for parking.
*   **Conformance Checking:** We compare the discovered model against the **Planned Route**. 
    *   **Sequence Deviations:** Did the driver follow the Stop 1 -> Stop 2 -> Stop 3 sequence? If not, why? (e.g., avoiding a known school zone at drop-off time).
    *   **Unplanned Stops:** Identifying stops longer than 5 minutes that aren't associated with a package scan (potential unauthorized breaks or traffic bottlenecks).
    *   **Temporal Deviations:** Comparing "Planned Service Time" vs. "Actual Service Time."

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** Calculated by comparing the `Delivery Success` timestamp against the `Customer-Requested Window`.
*   **Dwell Time vs. Service Time:** `Dwell Time` (Arrive at Location to Depart) vs. `Service Time` (Actual scanning/interaction). High Dwell/low Service suggests parking difficulties.
*   **First-Time Hit Rate:** Percentage of "Delivery Success" vs. "Delivery Failed" per route.
*   **Fuel Efficiency Index:** Correlating GPS distance/idling time with fuel consumption data (if available) or distance-per-package.

#### Identifying Bottlenecks
*   **Technique - Dotted Chart Analysis:** By plotting events over time, we can see "vertical gaps" across the fleet. If multiple vehicles show "Low Speed" in the same area at 4:00 PM, we identify a **Systemic Traffic Bottleneck**.
*   **Activity Mining:** We look for bottlenecks in the "Scan at Depot" to "Depart Depot" phase. If vehicles are loaded but stationary for 45 minutes, the bottleneck is **Depot Outbound Logistics**, not the road.
*   **Quantification:** We calculate the "Waiting Time" attribute for each transition. For example, if "Arrive Customer" to "Delivery Success" takes 12 minutes in Zone A but 3 minutes in Zone B, the bottleneck is likely **High-Rise Building Access** in Zone A.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

We use **Variant Analysis** to compare high-performing routes (top 10% OTD) with low-performing ones.

*   **Suboptimal Planning:** If "Success" events often occur in a different order than "Planned" across all drivers, the dispatch algorithm's map data is likely outdated (e.g., ignoring one-way streets or new construction).
*   **Service Time Variability:** We correlate package type/volume with service time. Root cause: Is the driver delayed by heavy packages requiring a dolly, or by "Cash on Delivery" interactions?
*   **Vehicle Health:** By analyzing the "Unscheduled Stop" frequency, we can link rising costs to specific vehicle ages or models. If "Engine Warning Light" events correlate with high-idling routes, the root cause of maintenance costs is **Inefficient Routing leading to Engine Wear**.
*   **Driver Behavior:** We use **Social Network Analysis** to see if specific drivers consistently encounter "Failed Deliveries." Root cause: Are they not waiting long enough, or scanning from the van instead of the doorstep?

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy A: Dynamic Service-Time Buffering
*   **Target:** Late deliveries due to inaccurate time-window estimations.
*   **Insight:** Process mining reveals that deliveries in "Urban Center" take 8 minutes longer than "Suburban" deliveries due to parking/stairs.
*   **Action:** Update the Dispatch System to apply "Location-Specific Service Buffers" based on historical process data, rather than a flat 3-minute-per-stop average.
*   **Impact:** Improved OTD and more realistic driver schedules, reducing overtime costs.

#### Strategy B: Predictive Failed-Delivery Re-Routing
*   **Target:** High costs of re-delivery (failed attempts).
*   **Insight:** Analysis shows a 40% failure rate for residential deliveries between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM.
*   **Action:** Implement "Smart Sequencing" where residential stops are prioritized for early morning or late afternoon, while commercial stops (with receptionists) are handled mid-day.
*   **Impact:** Higher first-time hit rate, lower fuel consumption per successful delivery.

#### Strategy C: Telemetry-Based Maintenance "Pre-Symptom" Scheduling
*   **Target:** Unscheduled repairs and vehicle downtime.
*   **Insight:** GPS logs show that vehicles with high "Idling" and "Stop-and-Go" frequency trigger "Engine Warning Lights" 20% sooner.
*   **Action:** Move from mileage-based maintenance to "Operational Intensity" maintenance. Vehicles assigned to dense urban routes get serviced based on idle-hours discovered in the logs.
*   **Impact:** 15% reduction in mid-shift breakdowns, lowering towing costs and emergency vehicle rentals.

### 5. Operational Constraints and Monitoring

#### Addressing Constraints
*   **Labor Laws:** The process model will include "Hard Constraints" for Driver Working Hours. If the discovered process shows frequent overtime, the optimization will trigger a "Route Split" recommendation.
*   **Capacity:** Optimization strategies will respect vehicle volume limits identified in the Dispatch System data to prevent overloaded vehicles (which increases maintenance costs).

#### Continuous Monitoring & Dashboards
To ensure sustainability, we will implement a **Process Mining Dashboard** featuring:
1.  **Conformance Gauge:** Real-time percentage of routes following the planned sequence. A drop indicates the plan is becoming disconnected from reality.
2.  **The "Late Delivery Heatmap":** A geographic visualization of where "Delivery Success" timestamps exceed "Time Windows," allowing for immediate territory re-balancing.
3.  **Idle-Time Trendline:** Monitoring if the "Depart Depot" or "Unscheduled Stop" durations are increasing over time.
4.  **Process Evolution View:** Comparing the process model month-over-month to see if the new optimization strategies have simplified the "spaghetti" of the initial discovery phase.
