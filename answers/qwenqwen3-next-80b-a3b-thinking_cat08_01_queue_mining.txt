Okay, let me tackle this process mining problem for the outpatient clinic. The user is a process analyst needing to address patient waiting times using event log data. First, I need to recall how queue mining works in process mining context. 

Hmm, the key here is understanding that "waiting time" between activities isn't just the gap between start times. For consecutive activities A and B, the waiting time should be calculated as (B's start time - A's completion time). But only if B starts after A completes - if there's overlap, it's not waiting. Need to be precise here.

For metrics, average wait time is obvious, but in healthcare, medians might be better because outliers (like a 2-hour wait) skew averages. Also 90th percentile is crucial - that tells you how many patients experience "excessive" waits. And queue frequency - like how often a particular queue exists across all cases. 

Identifying critical queues... probably need to rank them by multiple factors. Maybe a weighted score: (average wait * frequency) + (90th percentile * impact factor). For example, if the "Nurse Assessment" queue has high average wait but only for urgent patients, that might be more critical than a common but short wait for follow-ups. Should also consider if the queue is a downstream bottleneck affecting other activities.

Root cause analysis... let's see. Resource utilization metrics from event logs: for a resource like "Nurse 1", I can calculate utilization rate = total active time / total available time. If utilization is >85%, that's a red flag. Also, comparing activity duration distributions - if some doctor consultations take 5 mins while others take 45 mins, that variability might cause queues. 

Variant analysis could show different patient flows. Like "New patients with Urgent" might take a different path than "Follow-up Normal" - maybe the urgent path has more steps causing bottlenecks. Resource allocation analysis: if all "ECG tests" are done by only one tech, that's a bottleneck. 

For optimization strategies... first idea: dynamic resource allocation. Like if data shows ECG tests have long waits during 10am-12pm, maybe assign a second tech during peak hours. But how to prove it? Look at historical resource utilization per time slot. 

Second idea: parallel processing. For example, if "Nurse Assessment" and "Registration" can happen simultaneously for some patients? But need to check if the current process allows that. Maybe variant analysis shows some patients skip registration? No, registration is usually first. Wait - maybe for follow-up patients, they could do nurse assessment while registration is happening? But that might not be feasible. Alternatively, pre-check-in for follow-ups to reduce registration time. 

Third idea: appointment scheduling adjustments. If data shows morning has high registration wait because all appointments are scheduled at 9am, maybe spread them out. Use arrival pattern analysis - how many patients arrive per hour? If 30% come between 8-9am, but only 2 clerks, that's a problem. 

Trade-offs... if I add more staff for ECG tests, cost increases. But maybe it reduces overall wait time enough to increase patient satisfaction and potentially more patients. Need to model cost vs benefit. Also, shifting bottleneck - if I fix ECG wait, maybe doctor consultation becomes the new bottleneck. So must monitor all queues. 

KPIs to measure success: average total visit time, average wait time per critical queue, percentage of patients exceeding X minutes wait (say 30 min for doctor consultation), resource utilization rates. Also patient satisfaction scores if available. 

Wait, the user said "without significantly increasing operational costs" so strategies must be cost-effective. Maybe reassigning existing staff rather than hiring new. Like if nurse utilization is low in afternoon, use them for registration during peak registration times. 

For root cause analysis using process mining: I'd use conformance checking to see if actual process matches designed process. But more importantly, resource analysis - for each activity, look at which resources are used and their throughput. Also, process mining can show "handover" delays - like when doctor consult ends, how long before check-out starts. 

Another thing: the event log has "Timestamp Type" (START/COMPLETE), so I can reconstruct the exact sequence. For each case, sort by timestamp, then for each consecutive pair, calculate wait time as next activity's start - previous activity's complete. 

Critical queue identification: maybe calculate for each activity pair (e.g., Registration -> Nurse Assessment), the average wait time across all cases. Then rank these pairs by average wait, but also by how many cases have that queue (some queues might not exist for all cases). For example, "ECG Test" only exists for some patients, so frequency matters. 

Perhaps create a matrix: rows are source activities, columns are target activities. Cells show average wait time. Then filter for high values. Also, segment by patient type - urgent new patients might have different queues than regular follow-ups. 

For strategy 1: if registration has long waits because clerks are overloaded, but clerks are underutilized at certain times, maybe stagger appointments. Use arrival rate analysis: aggregate arrivals per hour. If 100 patients arrive between 8-9am, but only 2 clerks can handle 40 per hour (assuming 15 min per registration), then they're overloaded. So spreading appointments more evenly. 

But how to quantify impact? If current average registration wait is 10 min, after spreading, maybe reduce to 5 min. But need to model based on historical data. 

Strategy 2: for nurse assessment, if the bottleneck is because nurses are waiting for doctors to finish, but actually doctors and nurses have different schedules. Maybe have nurses start assessments while doctors are finishing previous consults? But that depends on workflow design. 

Alternatively, if data shows that for follow-up patients, nurse assessment is often short, but they're waiting for doctor consultation, maybe move nurse assessment to after doctor consult? No, that doesn't make sense. Usually nurse does prep before doctor. 

Wait, perhaps for certain specialties, the nurse assessment can be done in parallel with other activities. But need to check process variants. 

Another idea: implement a "triage" step where urgent cases get expedited. But that might require new process step. 

For root cause analysis, process mining can show the "bottleneck" by resource utilization. For example, if all ECG tests are done by one tech, and that tech is busy 90% of the time, while other rooms are idle. 

Also, activity duration variability: if doctor consults have high variance (some 5 min, some 45), that causes queues. Maybe standardize time slots, but that's hard. 

For optimization strategy: if ECG wait is long, and tech utilization is high, maybe cross-train another staff member to do ECGs during peak times. But need to check if that's feasible. 

Alternatively, schedule ECG tests in batches when the tech is available, but that might not help. 

Another strategy: pre-assign resources based on predicted need. Like if a patient is scheduled for ECG, automatically book the tech slot during appointment scheduling. But that requires integration with scheduling system. 

But the question is about using existing event log data. So from data, see if ECG tests are often scheduled after doctor consult, but doctor consults run late, causing ECG waits. So maybe schedule ECG before doctor consult? But that might not be possible if doctor needs results. 

Hmm, need to think carefully. 

For trade-offs: if I increase staff for ECG, cost goes up but wait time down. But if I only do it during peak hours, cost impact is minimal. Also, staff might be overworked if not managed. 

KPIs: after implementation, track the specific queue wait times, total visit time, and also resource utilization to ensure it's not causing new bottlenecks. 

Also, patient satisfaction scores - but if not available, maybe use wait time as proxy. 

Okay, structuring the response:

1. Queue Identification: define wait time as (next activity start time - previous activity complete time). Metrics: avg, median, 90th percentile wait time per queue, frequency of queue occurrence, and segment by patient type/urgency. Critical queues identified by weighted score of avg wait * (1 + frequency factor) and impact on patient type (e.g., urgent patients have higher impact).

2. Root cause analysis: use resource analysis (utilization rates), bottleneck analysis (throughput), variant analysis (different paths), and activity duration distribution. For example, high variability in doctor consult times could be due to specialty or patient type.

3. Optimization strategies:
   - Dynamic resource allocation: for ECG tests, if data shows peak utilization at 10am-12pm, cross-train staff to handle during peaks. Target: ECG queue. Data shows high utilization of current tech. Expected 30% reduction in wait.
   - Appointment scheduling adjustment: if arrival data shows 40% of patients arrive between 8-9am, but registration can only handle 30 per hour, spread appointments. Target: registration queue. Expected 50% reduction in registration wait.
   - Parallel processing for follow-ups: for follow-up patients, allow nurse assessment to start while registration is happening (if process allows), or pre-check-in. Target: nurse assessment queue. Data shows follow-up registration is quick, so can overlap. Expected 25% reduction.

4. Trade-offs: adding staff increases cost but maybe offset by efficiency. Shifting bottleneck - if registration improves, nurse assessment might become new bottleneck. Need continuous monitoring. Balance by prioritizing high-impact queues and using existing resources first.

5. KPIs: per-queue wait times, total visit time, resource utilization rates, percentage of patients with wait >30 min. Monitor weekly with process mining dashboards.

Wait, for parallel processing: in current process, registration must complete before nurse assessment? If yes, can't do parallel. But maybe for follow-up patients, registration is very fast (e.g., 2 min), so if they arrive early, nurse can start while registration finishes. But that might not be standard. Alternatively, have a separate "check-in" step that's quick for follow-ups, then nurse assessment starts. But need to see if event log shows that for follow-ups, registration is short and nurse assessment starts immediately after. 

Actually, if registration for follow-ups is very quick, maybe the wait for nurse assessment is because of nurse availability, not registration. So the bottleneck is nurse, not registration. 

So for strategy 1: if nurse assessment has long waits, check if nurses are idle sometimes. If utilization is high, then need more nurses or better scheduling. If utilization is low but waits are high, maybe the nurses are not assigned properly. 

But in the event log, resource is "Nurse 1" etc., so I can see when they are busy. 

For example, if Nurse 1 is busy from 9-10am, but Nurse 2 is idle, maybe reassign. 

So dynamic resource allocation based on real-time data. But for the strategy, propose using historical data to predict peak times and allocate staff accordingly. 

Another strategy: if doctor consults have high variability, maybe set up a "buffer" time between appointments, but that might reduce throughput. Not ideal. Instead, use data to adjust appointment lengths per specialty. For example, cardiology consults take longer on average, so schedule longer slots. But that could reduce number of patients. 

Alternatively, for short consults, schedule more, for long ones, fewer. But need to know which specialties take longer. 

But the question is about queue times between activities, not the activity duration itself. 

Wait, the waiting time between activities is affected by the previous activity's duration and resource availability. 

For example, if doctor consults take longer than scheduled, then next activity (ECG) has to wait. So if doctor consult duration is longer than expected, the ECG starts late. 

So root cause might be inaccurate appointment scheduling. 

But for optimization, maybe adjust appointment lengths based on historical data. 

But the clinic might not want to change appointment lengths because patients expect certain times. 

Hmm. 

Let me structure the strategies more concretely:

Strategy 1: Target ECG Test queue. Data shows that 70% of ECG waits are due to single tech being overloaded. Current tech utilization is 92% during 10-12pm. Propose cross-training another staff member to handle ECGs during peak hours. Expected: reduce avg wait from 25 min to 12 min (52% reduction). Cost: minimal (existing staff trained), but need to check if staff has capacity.

Strategy 2: Registration queue. Data shows that 60% of registration waits occur when >3 patients arrive in 15 min. Current schedule has 80% of appointments between 8-10am. Propose staggered appointments: reduce morning peak by 30% by shifting some to afternoon slots. Expected: registration wait drops from 10 min to 4 min. Impact: may reduce total patients seen, but better flow.

Strategy 3: For nurse assessment, if data shows that for follow-up patients, the wait is because they're waiting for nurse availability, but nurses are idle during certain times. Propose assigning nurses to specific time blocks for follow-ups vs new patients. For example, mornings for new patients, afternoons for follow-ups. But need data on nurse utilization patterns. If nurses are underutilized in afternoon, this could help. Expected 20% reduction in follow-up nurse wait.

But need to justify with data. 

For trade-offs: shifting appointments to afternoon might reduce morning congestion but afternoon might get crowded. Need to monitor. 

Also, cross-training staff might increase their workload, so need to balance. 

KPIs: track the specific queues, total visit time, and also check if other queues have worsened. For example, if ECG wait reduced but check-out wait increased because clerks are busy with more ECG-related tasks. 

So continuous monitoring is key. 

I think that's solid. Now structure the response properly.

## Comprehensive Process Mining Approach for Outpatient Clinic Patient Flow Optimization

### 1. Queue Identification and Characterization  
**Defining Waiting Time**:  
In this context, "waiting time" is calculated as the time interval between the *completion* of one activity and the *start* of the next consecutive activity for the same patient visit. For example:  
- Waiting time for "Nurse Assessment" = `(Nurse Assessment START timestamp) - (Registration COMPLETE timestamp)`  
- Only intervals where the next activity starts *after* the prior activity completes are counted (i.e., no overlap). If activities overlap (e.g., Nurse Assessment starts before Registration completes), it indicates process deviation and is excluded from waiting time calculations.  

**Key Metrics for Queue Characterization**:  
- **Average/Median Waiting Time**: Median is preferred over mean to avoid skew from extreme outliers (e.g., a single 2-hour wait).  
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time**: Identifies "excessive waits" experienced by the most affected patients (e.g., 10% of patients wait longer than X minutes).  
- **Queue Frequency**: Percentage of patient visits experiencing this specific queue (e.g., 85% of visits have a "Registration  Nurse Assessment" queue).  
- **Excessive Wait Incidence**: % of cases where wait time exceeds clinical thresholds (e.g., >30 min for "Doctor Consultation" due to urgency guidelines).  
- **Segmented Metrics**: Break down metrics by:  
  - Patient type (New vs. Follow-up)  
  - Urgency level (Urgent vs. Normal)  
  - Resource type (e.g., "ECG Test" wait time by technician)  
  - Time of day (e.g., peak vs. off-peak hours)  

**Identifying Critical Queues**:  
Critical queues are prioritized using a **weighted severity score**:  
`Score = (90th percentile wait time × 0.4) + (Average wait time × 0.3) + (Excessive wait incidence × 0.3)`  
*Justification*:  
- **90th percentile** captures systemic issues affecting high-impact cases (e.g., urgent patients waiting hours).  
- **Excessive wait incidence** ensures we address queues where *many* patients experience unacceptable delays.  
- **Weighting** reflects operational reality: a queue with moderate average wait but high 90th percentile (e.g., "ECG Test" with 45-min 90th percentile for urgent patients) is more critical than a high-average but low-impact queue (e.g., "Check-out" with 15-min average but only 5% exceeding 30 min).  
- *Example*: If "Registration  Nurse Assessment" has:  
  - Avg wait: 12 min  
  - 90th percentile: 35 min  
  - 65% of cases exceed 20-min threshold  
  - *Score = (35×0.4) + (12×0.3) + (0.65×0.3) = 14 + 3.6 + 0.195 = 17.795*  
  Versus "Doctor Consultation  ECG Test" with:  
  - Avg wait: 8 min  
  - 90th percentile: 25 min  
  - 40% exceed 20-min threshold  
  - *Score = (25×0.4) + (8×0.3) + (0.4×0.3) = 10 + 2.4 + 0.12 = 12.52*  
  **Conclusion**: "Registration  Nurse Assessment" is more critical despite lower average wait due to higher 90th percentile and excessive wait incidence.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis  
**Beyond Queue Metrics: Process Mining Techniques for Root Causes**  
Using the event log, we apply advanced process mining to uncover systemic causes:  

| Root Cause Category | Process Mining Technique | How It Reveals Causes |  
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|  
| **Resource Bottlenecks** | Resource Utilization Heatmaps & Throughput Analysis | Calculate resource utilization = `(Total active time) / (Available time)`. For example:  
- If "Nurse 1" has 95% utilization during 9–11 AM but "Nurse 2" has 40%, this indicates uneven workload distribution.  
- Throughput analysis shows if a resource (e.g., ECG technician) processes <2 patients/hour while idle time is high elsewhere. |  
| **Activity Dependencies** | Conformance Checking & Handover Delay Analysis | Compare actual vs. planned workflow. If "Doctor Consultation" completion is often delayed, but "ECG Test" starts immediately after (without buffer), this causes cascading delays. Handover delay = `(Next activity start) - (Current activity completion)` across all cases. |  
| **Duration Variability** | Activity Duration Distribution & Process Variants | Analyze duration distribution per activity (e.g., "Doctor Consultation" times: 5–60 min with 35-min median). High variability (e.g., standard deviation >50% of median) suggests inconsistent workflows. Variant analysis identifies patterns: e.g., "New Cardiology patients" take 2× longer than "Follow-up Dermatology" due to specialty-specific steps. |  
| **Scheduling/Arrival Patterns** | Arrival Rate Analysis & Time-Based Aggregation | Plot patient arrivals per hour (e.g., 40% arrive between 8–9 AM). If registration clerks handle 30 patients/hour but 50 arrive hourly at peak, queues form. Also, check if urgent patients arrive at predictable times (e.g., 70% of urgent cases arrive between 8–10 AM). |  
| **Patient-Specific Factors** | Segmented Process Mining & Decision Trees | Filter data by patient type/urgency:  
- Urgent New patients may have 2× longer "Nurse Assessment" waits than Normal Follow-ups due to priority handling.  
- Decision trees reveal rules: e.g., "If patient type = New AND urgency = Urgent AND specialty = Cardiology, wait time >30 min in 80% of cases." |  

*Example Insight*:  
- Data shows "ECG Test" wait time averages 25 min, but 90th percentile is 55 min.  
- Resource analysis reveals 100% of ECG tests are handled by a single technician (Tech X) who is utilized at 92% during 10 AM–12 PM.  
- Duration distribution shows Tech X processes ECGs in 5–15 min (median 8 min), but waits occur because:  
  - Doctor Consultations run late (30% exceed scheduled 15-min slots), delaying ECG start.  
  - 60% of ECG waits occur when Tech X is assigned to other tasks (e.g., X-rays) due to poor resource allocation.  

---

### 3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for High-Variability Activities**  
- **Target Queue**: "Doctor Consultation  ECG Test" (90th percentile wait = 55 min).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Single-technician bottleneck + poor coordination between doctor and technician schedules.  
- **Data Support**:  
  - Tech X handles 100% of ECGs but is utilized at 92% during peak hours (10 AM–12 PM), while Tech Y is idle 60% of the time.  
  - Doctor Consultations for Cardiology patients exceed scheduled time by 12 min on average.  
- **Action**:  
  - Cross-train Tech Y to handle ECGs during peak hours (10 AM–12 PM).  
  - Implement a real-time "ECG Demand Dashboard" showing doctor consultation finish times and technician availability.  
  - Automatically assign ECG tasks to the next available technician (Tech X or Y) based on live queue status.  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Reduce ECG test wait time by 40% (from 25-min avg to 15 min; 90th percentile from 55 min to 30 min).  
  - No new hires needed; leverages existing idle capacity (Tech Y utilization drops to 75%).  
  - *Cost Impact*: $0 (uses current staff; minimal training cost).  

**Strategy 2: Appointment Scheduling Optimization Based on Arrival Patterns**  
- **Target Queue**: "Registration  Nurse Assessment" (90th percentile wait = 35 min).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Overconcentrated morning arrivals overwhelming registration clerks.  
- **Data Support**:  
  - 60% of new patients arrive between 8–10 AM, but clerks can only process 25 patients/hour (vs. 35 arrivals/hour).  
  - Follow-up patients have shorter registration times (avg 3 min vs. 8 min for new patients), but 70% of follow-ups are scheduled in the same morning block.  
- **Action**:  
  - Restructure appointment slots:  
    - Shift 30% of new patient appointments from 8–10 AM to 1–3 PM.  
    - Reserve 8–10 AM for urgent/new patients only; schedule follow-ups in 1–3 PM slots.  
  - Use predictive scheduling: Algorithm assigns slots based on historical arrival patterns (e.g., "Cardiology new patients" assigned later slots if data shows they typically cause longer registration).  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Reduce registration wait time by 50% (from 12-min avg to 6 min; 90th percentile from 35 min to 15 min).  
  - Increase clinic capacity by 15% (more efficient clerk utilization).  
  - *Cost Impact*: $0 (no new staff; scheduling system update requires <10 hours IT effort).  

**Strategy 3: Parallel Processing for Low-Dependency Activities**  
- **Target Queue**: "Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation" (90th percentile wait = 28 min).  
- **Root Cause Addressed**: Nurse assessment is a sequential bottleneck for follow-up patients despite short duration.  
- **Data Support**:  
  - For follow-up patients, Nurse Assessment duration is consistently short (avg 4 min, 90th percentile 8 min), but 40% of cases wait >15 min for doctor consultation due to nurse availability.  
  - Variant analysis shows 65% of follow-up patients have no diagnostic tests (e.g., ECG), meaning nurse assessment and doctor consultation could overlap.  
- **Action**:  
  - Redesign workflow: For follow-up patients without diagnostic tests, allow nurse assessment to start *while* the doctor is finishing a prior consultation (using a "pre-assessment" room).  
  - Implement a "Nurse-Doctor Handoff Protocol": Nurses notify doctors 5 min before completing assessment, enabling immediate handoff.  
- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Reduce "Nurse  Doctor" wait time by 30% (from 18-min avg to 12.6 min; 90th percentile from 28 min to 18 min).  
  - Free up 2 hours of doctor time daily for additional patients.  
  - *Cost Impact*: $0 (process redesign only; no new resources).  

---

### 4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints  
**Potential Trade-offs and Mitigation**:  
| Strategy | Trade-offs | Mitigation Plan |  
|----------|------------|-----------------|  
| **Dynamic Resource Allocation** | Risk of technician overload if demand spikes; potential staff resistance to new roles. | - Start with 1–2 weeks of pilot testing (e.g., only for Cardiology patients). <br> - Monitor technician utilization; if >85%, adjust staffing ratios. <br> - Include technicians in design process to ensure buy-in. |  
| **Appointment Scheduling** | Reduced morning availability for urgent patients; possible patient dissatisfaction with afternoon slots. | - Reserve 20% of morning slots for urgent cases only. <br> - Use patient preference data (e.g., "90% of follow-up patients accept afternoon slots if wait time is lower"). <br> - Track patient no-show rates; if >5% increase, adjust slot distribution. |  
| **Parallel Processing** | Risk of rushed handoffs reducing care quality; room availability constraints. | - Only apply to low-complexity follow-ups (validated via process mining). <br> - Require dedicated "pre-assessment" rooms to avoid physical crowding. <br> - Add quality checks: If doctor consultation time drops >10%, pause implementation. |  

**Balancing Conflicting Objectives**:  
- **Cost vs. Wait Time**: All strategies avoid new hires by leveraging idle capacity or process redesign. For example, dynamic resource allocation uses existing staff (Tech Y’s idle time), saving $25K/year vs. hiring a new technician.  
- **Quality vs. Efficiency**:  
  - *Trade-off*: Faster handoffs may reduce thoroughness.  
  - *Mitigation*: Use process mining to monitor "Doctor Consultation" duration; if it drops below 12 min (historical minimum for safe care), trigger alerts.  
- **Systemic vs. Local Optimization**:  
  - Always monitor *all* queues post-implementation. For example, if "Registration" wait drops but "Check-out" wait increases due to clerks handling more follow-ups, adjust staff allocation accordingly.  
- **Data-Driven Trade-off Decisions**:  
  - Calculate ROI: `Reduction in wait time × patient satisfaction score × revenue per visit` vs. implementation cost.  
  - Example: A 10-min reduction in total visit time could increase daily patient capacity by 8–10, generating $1,200/day in new revenue (assuming $150/visit), offsetting costs in <2 weeks.  

---

### 5. Measuring Success  
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:  
| KPI | Measurement Method | Target Improvement |  
|------|-------------------|---------------------|  
| **Critical Queue Wait Times** | Daily median + 90th percentile for top 3 queues (e.g., RegistrationNurse, DoctorECG, NurseDoctor) | - RegistrationNurse: 90th percentile 15 min <br> - DoctorECG: 90th percentile 30 min <br> - NurseDoctor: 90th percentile 18 min |  
| **Total Visit Duration** | Average time from Registration START to Check-out COMPLETE | Reduce by 20% (e.g., from 90 min to 72 min) |  
| **Excessive Wait Incidence** | % of visits where any critical queue exceeds threshold (e.g., >20 min for DoctorECG) | Reduce from 45% to 25% |  
| **Resource Utilization Balance** | Standard deviation of utilization across similar resources (e.g., technicians) | Reduce from 0.35 to 0.15 (more even distribution) |  
| **Patient Satisfaction Proxy** | NPS (Net Promoter Score) or survey data (if available); if not, use "total visit time <60 min" as surrogate | 70% of patients complete visit in <60 min (vs. current 40%) |  

**Ongoing Monitoring & Continuous Improvement**:  
- **Automated Process Mining Dashboard**:  
  - Real-time alerts for KPI deviations (e.g., "DoctorECG 90th percentile >35 min for 2 consecutive days").  
  - Drill-down capability: Click on a queue to see root causes (e.g., "High wait due to 2 technicians out sick").  
- **Weekly Process Mining Reports**:  
  - Compare current vs. baseline metrics using control charts.  
  - Analyze new bottlenecks (e.g., if "Check-out" wait increases after Strategy 2, investigate clerk allocation).  
- **Feedback Loop for Refinement**:  
  - If a strategy reduces one queue but worsens another (e.g., Strategy 3 lowers "NurseDoctor" wait but increases "Check-out" wait), use variant analysis to identify the new bottleneck.  
  - Example: If "Check-out" wait increases due to clerks handling more follow-ups, reassign clerks to focus on check-out during peak follow-up times.  
- **Sustainability Check**:  
  - After 3 months, verify that 80% of KPIs are sustained without additional costs.  
  - If not, trigger a root-cause analysis (e.g., "New patient volume increased 15% but scheduling wasn’t adjusted").  

**Final Note**:  
This approach transforms raw event logs into actionable insights by focusing on *systemic patterns* rather than isolated delays. By prioritizing data-driven interventions that leverage existing resources, the clinic can reduce wait times by 25–35% within 3 months without new hires or capital expenditure. The continuous monitoring framework ensures improvements are sustained and adapts to evolving patient flows.
