This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating a procedure for shipping goods from a company—likely a computer hardware shop—to a customer. Here’s what’s happening in detail:

**Swimlanes and Roles**:  
- The diagram is divided horizontally into “swimlanes” (also sometimes called “pools” or “lanes”), each representing a different role or department involved in the process.  
- In the provided example, you see at least two main lanes:
  1. **Logistics** (top lane): This lane represents tasks performed by the logistics or shipping coordination staff.
  2. **Warehouse** (bottom lane): This lane represents tasks handled by the warehouse team, such as physically preparing the package for shipment.

**Start and End Events**:  
- On the far left, there’s typically a start event (a circle) indicating the trigger of the process, such as “Dispatch of goods” or an order being ready to ship.  
- On the far right, you’ll see an end event (a circle with a thick border) indicating that the shipment is prepared and the process is complete.

**Flow of Activities**:  
1. **Initiation**: The process begins when goods are ready to be shipped.
   
2. **Decision on Shipping**:  
   - The first decision might be represented by a gateway (diamond shape) asking, for example, if shipping will proceed immediately or if some clarification is needed.
   
3. **Clarify Shipment Method**:  
   - If a certain condition is met (like a request from the customer or a special item), the logistics team needs to clarify how the goods will be shipped. This could mean determining if special handling is required.  
   
4. **Special Handling & Insurance**:  
   - Another gateway checks if special handling is required. If yes, the process moves to “Check if insurance is required.” If the items are valuable or fragile, the logistics team arranges insurance (as shown by the “Insure parcel” activity).
   
5. **Labeling and Selecting a Logistics Company**:  
   - After insurance considerations, the process always includes writing a package label (identification, address details, etc.).
   - The logistics team obtains offers from multiple logistic providers (for instance, requesting 3 quotes). Once the best offer is chosen, they select that logistic company and place the order for shipment.
   
6. **Warehouse Preparation**:  
   - In the meantime, on the warehouse lane, there’s a step to “Package goods.”  
   - There’s a noted time delay (e.g., “48 hours”) before the package is ready. If this delay occurs, the warehouse staff notifies the customer about the delay in shipment.
   
7. **Final Steps Before Handover**:  
   - Once packaging and labeling are done and the logistic company is selected, the warehouse finalizes shipment paperwork.
   - The packaged and documented parcel is then moved to a pickup area where the logistics company can collect it.

8. **Completion**:  
   - The process ends once the shipment is prepared and ready for pickup.

**Gateways (Decision Points)**:  
- Diamonds indicate a decision or branching in the flow. For example:
  - One gateway checks if the shipment method needs clarification.
  - Another checks if special handling is necessary.
  - Yet another checks if insurance is needed or not.

Each gateway splits the process into two or more paths. After completing the relevant tasks, these paths might merge again, leading back into the main process flow.

**In summary**: The diagram maps out a structured workflow for shipping products, starting from deciding how to ship, ensuring all necessary handling and insurance is arranged, selecting a shipping provider, preparing and packing the goods, and finally moving them to a pickup area. This helps everyone involved understand their responsibilities, the sequence of events, and any decisions that need to be made along the way.
