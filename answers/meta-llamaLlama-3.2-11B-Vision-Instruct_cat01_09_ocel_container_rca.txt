To identify the root causes for the performance issues in the process, I will analyze the data and look for patterns and bottlenecks. Here are the findings:

1. **Long waiting times**: Many transitions have long waiting times, which can indicate inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the process. The top 5 transitions with the longest waiting times are:
	* "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" (duration: 368943.92)
	* "Book Vehicles" -> "Load to Vehicle" (duration: 283101.01)
	* "Book Vehicles" -> "Reschedule Container" (duration: 371476.42)
	* "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" (duration: 152433.14)
	* "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" (duration: 1051301.41)
2. **High frequency of self-loops**: Many transitions are self-loops, which can indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary steps in the process. The top 5 transitions with the highest frequency of self-loops are:
	* "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (frequency: 8559)
	* "Load to Vehicle" -> "Load to Vehicle" (frequency: 1827)
	* "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" (frequency: 585)
	* "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency: 16)
	* "Depart" -> "Depart" (frequency: 142)
3. **High frequency of rework**: Some transitions have high frequency of rework, which can indicate inefficiencies or quality issues in the process. The top 5 transitions with the highest frequency of rework are:
	* "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" (frequency: 7)
	* "Reschedule Container" -> "Book Vehicles" (frequency: 12)
	* "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency: 16)
	* "Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency: 13)
	* "Depart" -> "Reschedule Container" (frequency: 21)
4. **Low frequency of forward progress**: Some transitions have low frequency of forward progress, which can indicate inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the process. The top 5 transitions with the lowest frequency of forward progress are:
	* "Weigh" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" (frequency: 175)
