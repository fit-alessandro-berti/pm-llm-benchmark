# 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

**a. Reconstructing Actual Flow Using Process Mining**

- **Event Log Preparation:**  
  Extract and preprocess MES logs to standardize timestamps, normalize activity labels, and encode resources, tasks, and job attributes. Ensure logs include start/end times, resource IDs, task sequences, setup indicators, disruptions, and priority/due date info.

- **Process Discovery:**  
  Apply algorithms such as the *alpha* algorithm (for simple models), or more scalable, noise-tolerant algorithms like *Inductive Miner* or *Enhanced Process Mining* techniques, to generate *as-is* models of job flows. These models reveal actual process variants, loops, and alternative paths, reflecting the real shop operation.

- **Trace and Variant Analysis:**  
  Identify common pathways vs. outliers, highlighting frequent sequences, sequence-dependent setup differences, and deviations from planned routings.

**b. Quantifying Performance Metrics**

- **Lead Times & Makespan Distributions:**  
  Calculate for each job the total elapsed time from release to completion (events timestamp difference). Aggregate across jobs to derive statistical distributions—mean, median, variance, outliers—for lead times and overall makespan.

- **Waiting (Queue) Times:**  
  Use timestamps of queue entry and task start events to measure dwell times at each work center. Distribution analysis reveals bottlenecks and variability.

- **Resource Utilization & Setup Times:**  
  - Compute active processing vs. idle periods for each machine/operator, considering overlaps and concurrent tasks.  
  - Deduce setup durations by aligning *Setup Start* and *Setup End* events, associating them with preceding job types.  
  - Determine *sequence-dependent* setup costs by examining consecutive job pairs on each machine—e.g., average difference in setup durations for same vs. different job types.

- **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness:**  
  - Compare task and job completion timestamps with due dates.  
  - Calculate tardy instances, lateness magnitude, and percentage of late jobs.  
  - Use cumulative energy of delays to assess systemic tardiness issues.

- **Impact of Disruptions:**  
  - Map breakdown events and urgent tasks onto job flow logs.  
  - Analyze shifts in resource utilization, increased setup times, or queue buildups surrounding disruptions.

# 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

**a. Evidence from Process Mining Data**

- **Bottleneck Identification:**  
  - Generate *resource utilization heatmaps* and *throughput timelines* to spot resources with high occupancy or frequent idling.  
  - Bottlenecks often coincide with machines showing long queues, variability, or breakdown frequency peaks.

- **Poor Prioritization & Delays:**  
  - Compare the path of high-priority vs. low-priority jobs through the process model.  
  - Identify instances where low-priority or late-stage jobs are delayed by upstream jobs or resource contention, causing cascading tardiness—this suggests suboptimal dispatching.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Inefficiencies:**  
  - Analyze job sequences at critical machines: high variability in setup durations linked with certain job orderings.  
  - Variants with frequent changeovers indicate potential for batching or sequencing optimization.

- **Downstream Resource Starvation:**  
  - Detect cases where upstream bottlenecks induce idle periods downstream, creating *starvation* that prevents smooth flow or increase WIP accumulation.

- **Variability & WIP Fluctuations:**  
  - Bullwhip effects are evidenced by wide WIP oscillations, often caused by overreactive dispatching rules or lack of synchronization.

**b. Supporting Evidence through Process Mining**

- Use *conformance checking* to compare actual flow with planned routing, revealing deviations and their impact.

- Conduct *variant analyses* comparing jobs completed on time vs. late, identifying process paths or sequences associated with high delays.

- Apply *resource contention analysis* to identify periods where multiple jobs compete for the same resource, clarifying causes of delays.

# 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

**a. Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules**

- Dispatching rules (e.g., FCFS, EDD) do not adapt dynamically to real-time shop floor states. Analysis of logs may show frequent deviations from the expected sequence, leading to delays.

**b. Lack of Real-Time Visibility & Decision Support**

- Process mining reveals gaps in real-time situational awareness—delays, breakdowns, or urgent orders are not promptly considered, causing reactive rather than proactive scheduling.

**c. Inaccurate Task Duration & Setup Estimates**

- Variance in planned vs. actual durations from logs suggests that static estimates are unreliable, resulting in schedule inaccuracies and underestimated lead times.

**d. Sequence-Dependent Setup Challenges**

- Frequent changeovers with high variability suggest inadequate batching strategies or sequencing that disregards similar job clusters, increasing lead times and setup inefficiencies.

**e. Poor Coordination & Handling of Disruptions**

- Bottleneck effects amplified by uncoordinated upstream/downstream scheduling decisions. Process logs showing throughput stalls during breakdowns suggest insufficient contingency planning.

**f. Differentiating Causes**

- Process mining metrics distinguish between issues:

  - *Process variation analysis* shows variability sources—if caused primarily by random process time, focus on robust scheduling; if caused by resource constraints, capacity expansion or investment may be needed.

  - *Bottleneck analysis* indicates whether capacity or sequencing policies are the root cause.

# 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic, Multi-Criteria Dispatching Rules Informed by Data**

- **Logic:**  
  Combine criteria such as *remaining processing time* (shortest processing for quick throughput), *earliest due date*, *job priority*, *downstream queue lengths*, and *estimated sequence-dependent setup time*. For example, assign a score:  
  \[
  \text{Score} = w_1 \times \text{EDD} + w_2 \times \text{ProcessingTime} + w_3 \times \text{DownstreamLoad} + w_4 \times \text{SetupCostEstimate}
  \]

- **Process Mining Insights:**  
  Use historical data to calibrate weights (\(w_i\)), identify critical sequences that lead to delays, and quantify setup durations associated with job attributes.

- **Addressing Pathologies:**  
  Prioritizes jobs that are most at risk of tardiness, balances load, and minimizes unnecessary setups, reducing tardiness and WIP.

- **Expected Impact:**  
  Enhanced responsiveness, reduced late jobs, balanced throughput, and better resource utilization.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling using Historical Distributions and Machine Learning**

- **Logic:**  
  - Use process mining to extract distributions of task durations, setup times, and breakdown intervals.  
  - Employ machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification) trained on historical logs to predict individual job processing times (considering features like job complexity, operator, prior setup time).  
  - Incorporate real-time data (from IoT sensors, MES) for proactive bottleneck prediction.

- **Implementation:**  
  Generate probabilistic forecasts for each task, allowing the scheduler to assign start times that buffer against variability, improving punctuality.

- **Addressing Pathologies:**  
  Reduces schedule inaccuracies, mitigates unanticipated delays, and enhances capacity planning.

**Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization through Intelligent Batching & Sequencing**

- **Logic:**  
  Analyze historical setup data to identify clusters of jobs with similar properties that can be batched.  
  Use algorithms (e.g., multi-machine heuristics, sequence alignment) to sequence jobs at bottleneck machines minimizing total setup time.

- **Process Mining Usage:**  
  - Identify frequent job pairs or groups with low setup cost when processed consecutively.  
  - Detect high-frequency transition pairs and optimize their ordering.

- **Addressing Pathologies:**  
  Significantly reduces sequence-dependent setup times, shortens overall throughput times, and improves machine availability.

# 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**a. Simulation for Validation**

- Use discrete-event simulation tools (e.g., FlexSim, Plant Simulation) calibrated with log-derived data:

  - **Inputs:**  
    - Task duration distributions (from logs)  
    - Setup time models (sequence-dependent)  
    - Breakdown and repair patterns  
    - Job routing probabilities and processing sequences

  - **Scenarios:**  
    - Base case: current dispatching rules  
    - Improved strategies: each of the above proposals  
    - Variations in load levels and disruption frequencies

- **Metrics to Assess:**  
  - Total lead time, WIP levels, tardiness frequency, resource utilization, setup durations, bottleneck throughput rates.

**b. Framework for Continuous Monitoring**

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  Extend process mining to streaming data for live monitoring.

- **KPIs and Data-Driven Alerts:**  
  Track key indicators like average job tardiness, machine idle times, WIP fluctuations.

- **Adaptive Scheduling:**  
  Develop feedback loops where process mining insights inform real-time adjustments (e.g., reprioritization, rescheduling, batching).  
  Implement predictive alerts for potential bottlenecks or delays, prompting preemptive corrective actions.

- **Periodic Model Updating:**  
  Re-mine logs periodically to capture process drifts, new bottlenecks, or changes in job complexity, ensuring scheduling strategies remain aligned with actual operations.
