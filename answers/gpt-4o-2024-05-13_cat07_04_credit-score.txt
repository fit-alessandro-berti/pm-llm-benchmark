This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that represents a credit scoring process involving a bank and a scoring service. The diagram consists of two main partitions (called "swimlanes"):

1. **Credit Scoring (Bank)**
2. **Scoring Service**

Here's a detailed explanation of the processes depicted in each swimlane:

### Credit Scoring (Bank)

- **Scoring Request Received**:  
  The process starts when a scoring request is received.

- **Request Credit Score**:  
  The bank then requests a credit score by sending this request to the scoring service.

- **Decision and Delay Handling**:
  - If delay information is received, a delay is reported.
  - If the credit score is received, it proceeds to send the credit score.
  
- **Send Credit Score**:  
  Once the credit score is available, it is sent, and the scoring request is marked as handled.

### Scoring Service

- **Scoring Request Received**:  
  This swimlane starts when the scoring service receives a scoring request.

- **Compute Credit Score (Level 1)**:  
  The scoring service begins by computing the credit score at level 1.

- **Decision on Score Availability**:
  - If the score is available, it sends the credit score.
  - If not, it reports a delay.

- **Compute Credit Score (Level 2)**:  
  In case of a delay, the scoring service proceeds to compute the credit score at level 2.

- **Send Credit Score**:  
  Once computed, the credit score is sent back to the bank, and the scoring request is handled.

The diagram outlines each key step and decision point within these two main processes, highlighting interactions between the bank and the scoring service to manage the credit scoring process efficiently. Additionally, it shows how delays are handled and how the process ensures the computation of credit scores at different levels to meet the scoring requirements.
