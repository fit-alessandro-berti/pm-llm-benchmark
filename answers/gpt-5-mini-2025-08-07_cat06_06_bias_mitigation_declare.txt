Rationale (brief):

- Coexistence (Approve_Minority / Reject_Minority -> ManualReview): Ensures that whenever a decision targeted at a sensitive subgroup appears in a trace, a ManualReview activity also appears in that same trace. This requires human oversight and reduces the risk of automated, unchecked biased decisions for sensitive applicants.

- Response (CheckApplicantRace / CheckApplicantAge / CheckApplicantGender -> BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview): Whenever a sensitive attribute is checked, the model requires that bias mitigation and manual review activities follow. This enforces that checks of sensitive attributes trigger explicit mitigation and oversight steps.

- Precedence (BiasMitigationCheck -> Approve / Reject / Approve_Minority / Reject_Minority): Decisions cannot occur unless a BiasMitigationCheck has already occurred. This ensures that bias mitigation is performed prior to any decision, preventing decisions that bypass mitigation steps.

- Non-chainsuccession (CheckApplicant* -> Approve/Reject...): Prevents an immediate decision directly after a sensitive-attribute check (i.e., forbids the check being followed immediately by a decision). This avoids situations where the presence of a sensitive attribute directly triggers a decision without any intervening mitigation or review.

Together these constraints make it impossible in the modeled traces to (a) make immediate decisions right after observing sensitive attributes and (b) make decisions about sensitive-group applicants without explicit mitigation and manual review steps, reducing the potential for discriminatory outcomes.
