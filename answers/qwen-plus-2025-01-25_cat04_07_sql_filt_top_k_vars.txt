To address the benchmark prompt, we need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that processes the `event_log` table in multiple stages. Below is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

---

### **Step 1: Extract the Ordered Sequence of Activities per Case**
We first group events by `case_id` and order them by `timestamp` to determine the sequence of activities for each case. This can be achieved using `STRING_AGG` (or equivalent string aggregation function) with an `ORDER BY` clause.

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
```

Here:
- `STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp)` concatenates the activities for each `case_id` in the order of their timestamps.
- The result is a table (`ordered_sequences`) where each row contains a `case_id` and its corresponding `activity_sequence`.

---

### **Step 2: Group Cases by Their Activity Sequence**
Next, we group the cases by their `activity_sequence` to identify unique process variants and count how many cases correspond to each variant.

```sql
, variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
)
```

Here:
- We count the number of cases (`COUNT(*)`) for each `activity_sequence`.
- The results are sorted in descending order of frequency to prioritize the most common variants.

---

### **Step 3: Identify the Top K Variants**
We filter the top K variants based on their frequency. This can be done using a `LIMIT` clause.

```sql
, top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    LIMIT :K -- Replace :K with the desired value for K
)
```

Here:
- `LIMIT :K` ensures that only the top K variants are selected.

---

### **Step 4: Filter Cases Belonging to the Top K Variants**
We now filter the original `ordered_sequences` table to include only those cases whose `activity_sequence` matches one of the top K variants.

```sql
, filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        os.case_id
    FROM ordered_sequences os
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv
        ON os.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
```

Here:
- An `INNER JOIN` ensures that only cases matching the top K variants are retained.

---

### **Step 5: Return Events from the Filtered Cases**
Finally, we return all events from the original `event_log` table that belong to the filtered cases.

```sql
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc
    ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

Here:
- An `INNER JOIN` ensures that only events belonging to the filtered cases are included in the final result.

---

### **Complete Query**
Combining all the steps above, the complete query is as follows:

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    LIMIT :K -- Replace :K with the desired value for K
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT
        os.case_id
    FROM ordered_sequences os
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv
        ON os.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc
    ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

---

### **Explanation of Key Components**
1. **`STRING_AGG`**: Used to concatenate activities into sequences while preserving the order imposed by `timestamp`.
2. **`GROUP BY` and `COUNT`**: Used to aggregate cases by their activity sequences and count the frequency of each sequence.
3. **`LIMIT`**: Ensures that only the top K variants are considered.
4. **`INNER JOIN`**: Filters cases and events to include only those matching the top K variants.

---

### **Notes**
- Replace `:K` with the desired value for K when executing the query.
- Ensure that the `event_log` table exists and has the specified schema (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`).
- If the dataset is large, consider indexing the `case_id` and `timestamp` columns for improved performance.

This query efficiently identifies the top K process variants and filters the event log accordingly.
