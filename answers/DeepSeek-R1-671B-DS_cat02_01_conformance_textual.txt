**Identified Violations and Explanations:**

1. **Case 2**  
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
   - **Explanation:**  
     The normative process explicitly states that "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and **before** "Package items." Authorizing payment ensures the customer’s payment method is valid, which is only relevant after confirming sufficient inventory. Packaging items before authorization violates the required sequence.  

2. **Case 3**  
   - **Violations:**  
     a. "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment" (which implies sufficient inventory).  
     b. "Ship order" occurs after cancellation.  
   - **Explanation:**  
     - If inventory is sufficient (as indicated by proceeding to "Authorize payment"), cancellation is illogical. The process should follow the fulfillment path ("Package items"  "Ship order"  "Close order"). Canceling after authorization violates the branching logic.  
     - Shipping after cancellation directly contradicts the rule that fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) cannot follow cancellation.  

3. **Case 5**  
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items."  
   - **Explanation:**  
     The normative process mandates that "Package items" must precede "Ship order." Skipping packaging violates the requirement that items must be prepared before shipping.

**Additional Notes on Ambiguities:**  
- **Case 3’s authorization before cancellation:** The normative description does not explicitly address whether payment authorization can occur in cancellation scenarios (e.g., partial fulfillment). However, the text strongly implies that authorization is only relevant for fulfillment, so this case is interpreted as a violation.  
- **Case 5’s missing packaging:** The description does not allow exceptions for skipping packaging (e.g., digital goods). Thus, this is treated as a deviation.  

**Valid Cases:**  
- **Case 1** and **Case 4** follow the normative process (sufficient and insufficient inventory paths, respectively).
