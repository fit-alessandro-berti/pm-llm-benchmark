As a language model, I don't have access to the specific dates of each process mentioned. However, based on common patterns and outcomes from viewing an apartment for rental purposes, it seems that the main difference in these processes is the frequency of screening and rejection procedures.

For instance:

- Application for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant: This process involves sending the tenant a letter to confirm acceptance or rejection, often followed by a screen check. After that, it's time to go through all of the necessary steps to rent the property.

- Application for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant: This process is similar to above but with more detailed checks before final acceptance decisions are made. 

So in summary, these processes involve a series of steps and procedures designed to assess whether the tenant is a potential landlord or tenant. Each step involves specific criteria and checks that may vary depending on factors such as whether there were any previous history issues, past rental histories, or other relevant information available for review.

This pattern also indicates some common behaviors seen in screening tenants, with more detailed screens and stricter rules being applied after certain conditions are met to prevent rejection.
