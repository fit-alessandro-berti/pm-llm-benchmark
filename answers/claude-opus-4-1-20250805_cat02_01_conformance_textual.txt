Based on the normative process description, I'll analyze each case to identify violations:

## Analysis of Cases:

### **Case 1: COMPLIANT **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the expected flow perfectly for sufficient inventory scenario. All activities occur in the correct order with proper dependencies maintained.

### **Case 2: VIOLATION **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items  Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** Package items occurs before Authorize payment
- The normative process explicitly states that "Package items" should only occur after authorization
- The description emphasizes: "packaging items before authorization—would be considered a violation"
- This violates the logical business flow where payment should be secured before preparing items for shipment

### **Case 3: MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
1. **Illogical flow after cancellation:** The order proceeds with both Cancel order AND Ship order, which is contradictory
2. **Ship order after Cancel order:** The description explicitly states "Ship order should...never after a cancellation"
3. **Authorize payment before cancellation:** If inventory was insufficient (implied by the cancellation), the process should have gone directly from Check inventory to Cancel order without authorizing payment

This case appears to be attempting both fulfillment and cancellation paths simultaneously, which violates the fundamental logic of the process.

### **Case 4: COMPLIANT **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case follows the expected cancellation flow perfectly for insufficient inventory scenario. It properly skips all fulfillment activities (payment, packaging, shipping) and proceeds directly to closure after cancellation.

### **Case 5: VIOLATION **
Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** Missing Package items activity
- The normative process clearly states that items must be packaged before shipping
- The description emphasizes: "items must be prepared before they can be shipped"
- Shipping without packaging violates the logical sequence of order fulfillment

## Summary of Violations:

**Compliant Cases:** 1, 4

**Non-compliant Cases:** 
- **Case 2:** Packaged items before payment authorization
- **Case 3:** Shipped order after cancellation (plus authorized payment in a cancellation scenario)
- **Case 5:** Shipped order without packaging items first

These violations represent failures to follow the prescribed business logic where activities have clear dependencies and prerequisites that ensure proper order handling, payment security, and logical process flow.
