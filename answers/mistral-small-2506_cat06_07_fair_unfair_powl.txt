Here are the two POWL models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, one with potential unfairness and one without.

---

### **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**
This model includes an XOR branch where applicants may be subjected to different evaluation paths based on community affiliations, introducing potential bias.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops and choices
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation (potential bias)
cultural_fit_choice = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Construct the workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        data_loop,
        SkillAssessment,
        cultural_fit_choice,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ]
)

# Define execution order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_choice)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_choice, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**
- The **XOR choice** (`cultural_fit_choice`) allows applicants to either go through a **standard cultural fit check** or a **community affiliation check**, where the latter may introduce bias.
- This structure means that applicants with certain affiliations (e.g., "Global Business Leaders Club") may receive an unfair advantage in the evaluation.

---

### **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**
This model ensures fairness by removing the biased XOR branch, ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Single, unbiased evaluation
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loops
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Construct the workflow
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[
        ReceiveApplication,
        data_loop,
        SkillAssessment,
        CulturalFitCheck,
        ManagerialReview,
        FinalDecision
    ]
)

# Define execution order
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**
- The **XOR choice is removed**, and all applicants now go through a **single, standardized cultural fit check**.
- This ensures fairness by eliminating the possibility of biased evaluation based on community affiliations.

### **Key Differences:**
| Feature | **Model with Unfairness** | **Model Without Unfairness** |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Cultural Fit Evaluation** | XOR choice (Standard vs. CommunityAffiliationCheck) | Single, unbiased CulturalFitCheck |
| **Potential Bias** | Yes (affiliations may influence evaluation) | No (all applicants treated equally) |
| **Workflow Structure** | Includes a biased branching path | Linear, fair evaluation path |

These models demonstrate how process design can either introduce or mitigate bias in hiring workflows.
