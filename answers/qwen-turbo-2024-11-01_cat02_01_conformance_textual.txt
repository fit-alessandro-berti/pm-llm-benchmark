### Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

Let's analyze each case against the normative process described:

#### Case 1:
1. **Receive order** (2023-10-05 09:00)
2. **Check inventory** (2023-10-05 10:00)
3. **Authorize payment** (2023-10-05 11:00)
4. **Package items** (2023-10-05 12:00)
5. **Ship order** (2023-10-05 13:00)
6. **Close order** (2023-10-05 14:00)

**Compliance:** This case follows the correct sequence as per the normative process. After receiving the order, inventory is checked, payment is authorized, items are packaged, and then the order is shipped and finally closed.

#### Case 2:
1. **Receive order** (2023-10-06 09:00)
2. **Check inventory** (2023-10-06 09:30)
3. **Package items** (2023-10-06 10:00)
4. **Authorize payment** (2023-10-06 10:30)
5. **Ship order** (2023-10-06 11:00)
6. **Close order** (2023-10-06 11:30)

**Violation:** 
- **Authorization of payment before checking inventory:** According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory." In Case 2, payment is authorized before checking the inventory, which violates the described process.

#### Case 3:
1. **Receive order** (2023-10-07 09:00)
2. **Check inventory** (2023-10-07 09:20)
3. **Authorize payment** (2023-10-07 09:40)
4. **Cancel order** (2023-10-07 10:00)
5. **Ship order** (2023-10-07 10:30)
6. **Close order** (2023-10-07 11:00)

**Violation:**
- **Shipping after cancellation:** According to the normative process, once an order is canceled, it should not proceed to any activities intended for fulfillment, including shipping. In Case 3, after canceling the order, the process incorrectly ships the order, violating the described process.

#### Case 4:
1. **Receive order** (2023-10-08 09:00)
2. **Check inventory** (2023-10-08 09:10)
3. **Cancel order** (2023-10-08 09:20)
4. **Close order** (2023-10-08 09:50)

**Compliance:** This case follows the correct sequence for the scenario where inventory is insufficient. After receiving the order and checking the inventory, the order is canceled and then closed, which aligns with the normative process.

#### Case 5:
1. **Receive order** (2023-10-09 09:00)
2. **Check inventory** (2023-10-09 10:00)
3. **Authorize payment** (2023-10-09 10:30)
4. **Ship order** (2023-10-09 11:00)
5. **Close order** (2023-10-09 11:30)

**Violation:**
- **Shipment without packaging:** According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items." In Case 5, the order is shipped without being packaged first, which violates the described process.

### Summary of Violations:
- **Case 2:** Violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should occur after "Check inventory."
- **Case 3:** Violates the rule that once an order is canceled, no further activities related to fulfillment (like shipping) should take place.
- **Case 5:** Violates the rule that "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items."

These violations indicate that Cases 2, 3, and 5 do not follow the normative process as outlined in the description.
