To accomplish the task outlined, we'll break down the solution into the steps provided and implement them using DuckDB SQL. We will assume that the value of `K` (the number of top variants to consider) is a parameter that we will define before the query. For demonstration purposes, let's set `K = 3`.

### Step 1: Construct a Query to Determine the Sequence of Activities for Each `case_id`

First, we need to order the activities by their `timestamp` within each `case_id`. We can achieve this using a window function like `ROW_NUMBER()` to assign a unique ordering within each case, based on the `timestamp`.

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
  FROM event_log
)
```

### Step 2: Group Cases by Their Complete Activity Sequence

Next, we aggregate the activities into sequences per case. We'll use the `STRING_AGG` function to concatenate the activities in order, creating a string representation of each variant.

```sql
, variant_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ', ' ORDER BY row_num) AS variant
  FROM ordered_events
  GROUP BY case_id
)
```

### Step 3: Count Cases per Variant and Determine the Top K Variants

Now, we count how many cases correspond to each variant and find the top K variants based on this count.

```sql
, variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM variant_sequences
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    count
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT 3  -- Assuming K = 3
)
```

### Step 4: Return Events from Cases of Top K Variants

Finally, we filter the original event log to include only events from cases whose variants are among the top K.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.case_id,
  e.activity,
  e.timestamp
FROM event_log e
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON e.case_id = vs.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON vs.variant = tkv.variant
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Complete Query

Putting it all together, the complete query looks like this:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num
  FROM event_log
),
variant_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ', ' ORDER BY row_num) AS variant
  FROM ordered_events
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM variant_sequences
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
  SELECT 
    variant,
    count
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT 3  -- Adjust this value to change K
)
SELECT 
  e.case_id,
  e.activity,
  e.timestamp
FROM event_log e
JOIN variant_sequences vs ON e.case_id = vs.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON vs.variant = tkv.variant
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

This query will return all events from the original event log that belong to cases which are part of the top K process variants, ordered by `case_id` and then by `timestamp`. Adjust the `LIMIT` clause in the `top_k_variants` CTE to change the value of `K`.
