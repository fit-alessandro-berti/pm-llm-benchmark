### Analyzing and Renaming Process Event Log Activities

To address the task of renaming these activities to make their context clearer, I'll identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case, interpret how their meaning changes, and then rename them accordingly.

#### Revised Event Log

#### Naming Justification

- **Verify Documents**: Changed to specific versions based on context.
  - "Verify Document Submission": Refers to the initial verification of ID documents.
  - "Review Provided Docs": After ID scan is uploaded.
  - "Verify Physical Documents": For in-person document verification.
  - "Verify Adjusted Docs": Following account adjustments.

- **Call Customer**: Generic activity with multiple contexts. 
  - "Call Customer for Docs": For requesting missing documents.
  - "Call Customer for Info": To clarify account discrepancies.
  - "Follow-up Call": After adjustments are made to confirm accuracy.

- **Adjust Account**: No change needed as it reflects the same action throughout the cases. 

- **Approve Request**: No change required as this term stays context-agnostic under final approval.

By implementing these renamed activities, the activities now provide a clearer understanding of their contextual roles in the workflow, reducing ambiguity and enhancing process clarity.
