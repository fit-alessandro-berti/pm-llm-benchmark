**Analysis of Each Case:**

**Case 1001**  
**Sequence:**  
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

**Commentary:**  
Case 1001 follows the standard "Procure-to-Pay" sequence quite closely. A typical P2P process is:  
- Identify need and create a Purchase Requisition (PR)  
- Approve the PR  
- Convert the approved PR into a Purchase Order (PO) and send it to the vendor  
- Receive the goods  
- Receive the vendor invoice  
- Perform three-way match (Invoice, PO, and Goods Receipt)  
- Release payment after successful match  
- Close the case once completed

No anomalies appear in Case 1001. The order of events is logical and complies with best practices.

**Case 1002**  
**Sequence:**  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-01 08:30)  
2. Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-01 08:40)  
3. Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-03 07:00)  
4. Release Payment (2024-02-03 07:15)  
5. Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-03 08:00)  
6. Receive Goods (2024-02-04 09:00)  
7. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-05 08:00)  
8. Close Case (2024-02-06 16:00)

**Anomalies & Issues:**  
- **PO Issued Before Requisition Approval:** The purchase order is issued only 10 minutes after the requisition is created and **before** the requisition is formally approved. Normally, the approval step should occur before issuing the PO.  
- **Payment Released Before Approval and Goods Receipt:** Payment is released even before the requisition is approved and before the goods are received. This is a significant control issue. In standard P2P practice, payment typically should only occur after goods are received and the invoice has been matched to ensure correctness of quantity, quality, and pricing.  
- **Invoice Matching Occurs After Payment:** Matching the invoice to the PO and verifying receipt of goods usually happens before releasing the payment. Here, the payment is made first and matching is done afterward. This breaks the fundamental control mechanism intended to prevent overpayments, payment for undelivered goods, or payment without proper authorization.

**Why Problematic?**  
Making payments before proper approval and before ensuring goods have been received can lead to financial losses, reconciliation issues, and increased risk of fraud or vendor disputes.

**Case 1003**  
**Sequence:**  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-02 09:00)  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-02 09:10)  
3. Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-02 10:00)  
4. **Release Payment (2024-02-08 11:00)**  
5. Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-09 12:00)  
6. Receive Goods (2024-02-10 13:00)  
7. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-11 14:00)  
8. Close Case (2024-02-12 10:00)

**Anomalies & Issues:**  
- **Payment Released Before Goods Receipt and Invoice Receipt:** The payment release occurs well ahead of receiving the vendor’s invoice and even before the goods arrive.  
- **Out-of-Order Three-Way Match:** The intended three-way match (PO, invoice, goods receipt) is performed **after** payment is made. Normally, payment should be contingent upon a successful match.

**Why Problematic?**  
Paying before the invoice is received and goods are confirmed opens the door to serious financial and operational risks. The organization could pay for items never delivered or incorrectly billed amounts. This is a clear deviation from standard controls and best practices.

**Case 1004**  
**Sequence:**  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (2024-02-05 10:00)  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition (2024-02-05 10:15)  
3. Receive Goods (2024-02-06 09:00)  
4. Issue Purchase Order (2024-02-06 09:15)  
5. Vendor Invoice Received (2024-02-07 08:00)  
6. Match Invoice to PO (2024-02-07 08:30)  
7. Release Payment (2024-02-07 09:00)  
8. Close Case (2024-02-08 11:00)

**Anomalies & Issues:**  
- **Goods Received Before PO Issuance:** The company receives goods before issuing the formal purchase order to the vendor. This is highly unusual and suggests a breakdown in process controls. Normally, the PO should exist (and be communicated to the supplier) before any goods arrive.  
- Although the invoice is matched and payment is released after receiving the invoice, the primary anomaly is the reversed order of receiving goods and issuing the PO.

**Why Problematic?**  
Receiving goods prior to issuing the PO might indicate vendors are shipping items without proper authorization or that internal teams are bypassing crucial steps. It can lead to discrepancies in pricing, quantity, and agreement terms, and may suggest weak procurement controls or poor supplier management.

**Summary of Anomalies:**

- **Case 1002 and Case 1003:** Payments are released before the proper steps (approval, invoice receipt, goods receipt, and invoice matching) are completed. This can lead to financial risk and compliance issues.  
- **Case 1004:** Goods are received before a Purchase Order is issued, indicating a lack of proper procurement authorization and control.

**Overall Impact of These Anomalies:**

These deviations from the standard P2P sequence weaken the organization’s control framework, potentially leading to:  
- Financial losses due to early or unwarranted payments.  
- Compliance risks and audit findings due to non-adherence to standard policies.  
- Possible quality and quantity discrepancies, as goods may be accepted without a clear contractual agreement (PO).  
- Difficulty in supplier management, as standard ordering and payment protocols are not followed.

In a well-controlled P2P environment, the sequence is designed to ensure due diligence (approval before ordering), ensure value-for-money (goods receipt and invoice matching before payment), and maintain accountability (record-keeping and proper authorization steps at the right times). Any deviation can undermine these objectives.
