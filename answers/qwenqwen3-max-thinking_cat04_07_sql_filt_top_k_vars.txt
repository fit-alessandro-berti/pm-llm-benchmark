Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Extract ordered sequence of activities for each case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Count cases per variant
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Get top K variants by frequency
    -- Replace K with your desired number (e.g., 5, 10, etc.)
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
top_k_cases AS (
    -- Get all case_ids that belong to top K variants
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv ON cs.variant = tkv.variant
)
-- Step 4: Return all events from cases in top K variants
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN top_k_cases tkc ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Key components explained:**

1. **`case_sequences` CTE**: Uses `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` to create a string representation of each case's activity sequence in chronological order.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**: Groups by the variant string and counts how many cases follow each unique sequence.

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**: Orders variants by their frequency (descending) and limits to the top K variants. **Note**: Replace `K` with your actual desired number (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for top 5).

4. **`top_k_cases` CTE**: Joins back to get all case_ids that belong to the top K variants.

5. **Final SELECT**: Returns all original events from the `event_log` table, but only for cases that are part of the top K variants, ordered by case and timestamp.

**Usage note**: Before running, replace `K` in the `LIMIT K` clause with your desired number of top variants (e.g., `LIMIT 10` for top 10 variants).

This query efficiently handles the requirements while maintaining good performance through DuckDB's optimized string aggregation and join operations.
