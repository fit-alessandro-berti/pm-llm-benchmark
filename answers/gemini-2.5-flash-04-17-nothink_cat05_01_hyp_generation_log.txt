Based on the provided schema, sample data, and the assumed normal process flow, here are some identified anomalies/undesirable behaviors, potential hypotheses, and SQL queries to investigate them:

**Anomalies/Undesirable Behaviors:**

1.  **Activities out of expected sequence:**
    *   Case 1002: `Confirm Shipment` and `Ship Goods` occur *before* `Perform Credit Check` and `Validate Stock`.
    *   Case 1003: `Ship Goods` occurs *before* `Validate Stock` (which is implicitly required before shipping) and `Confirm Shipment`.
    *   Case 1004: `Receive Payment` occurs *before* `Issue Invoice`. `Confirm Shipment` is marked 'N' but `Ship Goods` still occurs.

2.  **Redundant or seemingly incorrect activities:**
    *   Case 1004: `Confirm Shipment` indicating 'N' followed by `Ship Goods`.

3.  **Potential delays between expected steps:**
    *   Case 1001: `Receive Payment` is several days after `Issue Invoice`. (While not necessarily an *anomaly* in every business, it might be a metric of interest).

**Hypotheses for Anomalies:**

1.  **Out-of-Sequence Activities:**
    *   **System/Workflow Configuration Error:** The automated process or system controlling the workflow is misconfigured, allowing steps to be triggered out of order.
    *   **Manual Override/Process Deviation:** A resource might be manually bypassing system controls or following an incorrect procedure (e.g., pushing a shipment through before credit/stock checks).
    *   **Training Issue:** Resources might not be fully aware of the correct sequence of steps.
    *   **System Race Condition:** Multiple system events are triggered simultaneously, and processing order isn't guaranteed.

2.  **Redundant/Incorrect Activities:**
    *   **Data Entry Error:** The 'N' in `additional_info` for `Confirm Shipment` in case 1004 might be a manual error.
    *   **Policy Violation:** Shipping despite confirmation not being granted might be a deliberate (or accidental) violation of policy.
    *   **System Glitch:** A system might record conflicting states or activities.

3.  **Delays:**
    *   **Customer Behavior:** The delay in payment is often customer-driven.
    *   **Internal Processing Delay:** The internal process for matching payments to invoices might be slow.

**SQL Queries for Investigation:**

Here are some PostgreSQL queries to start investigating these hypotheses.

**Query 1: Identify Cases with `Ship Goods` Before `Perform Credit Check`**

This query aims to find cases where the shipping activity happened before the credit check, violating the assumed sequence.

```sql
SELECT
    oe1.case_id,
    oe1.activity AS ship_activity,
    oe1.timestamp AS ship_timestamp,
    oe2.activity AS credit_activity,
    oe2.timestamp AS credit_timestamp
FROM
    order_event_log oe1
JOIN
    order_event_log oe2 ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
WHERE
    oe1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oe2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND oe1.timestamp < oe2.timestamp
ORDER BY
    oe1.case_id, oe1.timestamp;
```

**Query 2: Identify Cases with `Ship Goods` Before `Validate Stock`**

This query checks for shipments occurring before stock validation.

```sql
SELECT
    oe1.case_id,
    oe1.activity AS ship_activity,
    oe1.timestamp AS ship_timestamp,
    oe2.activity AS stock_activity,
    oe2.timestamp AS stock_timestamp
FROM
    order_event_log oe1
JOIN
    order_event_log oe2 ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
WHERE
    oe1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oe2.activity = 'Validate Stock'
    AND oe1.timestamp < oe2.timestamp
ORDER BY
    oe1.case_id, oe1.timestamp;
```

**Query 3: Identify Cases with `Receive Payment` Before `Issue Invoice`**

This query looks for instances where payment was recorded before the invoice was issued.

```sql
SELECT
    oe1.case_id,
    oe1.activity AS payment_activity,
    oe1.timestamp AS payment_timestamp,
    oe2.activity AS invoice_activity,
    oe2.timestamp AS invoice_timestamp
FROM
    order_event_log oe1
JOIN
    order_event_log oe2 ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
WHERE
    oe1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oe2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oe1.timestamp < oe2.timestamp
ORDER BY
    oe1.case_id, oe1.timestamp;
```

**Query 4: Identify Cases Where `Confirm Shipment` is 'N' But `Ship Goods` Occurs**

This query specifically targets the anomaly seen in case 1004.

```sql
SELECT
    oe1.case_id,
    oe1.activity AS confirm_activity,
    oe1.timestamp AS confirm_timestamp,
    oe1.additional_info AS confirm_info,
    oe2.activity AS ship_activity,
    oe2.timestamp AS ship_timestamp
FROM
    order_event_log oe1
JOIN
    order_event_log oe2 ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
WHERE
    oe1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oe1.additional_info ILIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%'
    AND oe2.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    -- Ship goods could theoretically happen before confirmation, but this checks the specific scenario
    AND oe2.timestamp > oe1.timestamp
ORDER BY
    oe1.case_id;
```

**Query 5: Calculate Time Difference Between `Issue Invoice` and `Receive Payment`**

This helps quantify the delay observed in case 1001 and allows for analyzing this metric across all cases.

```sql
SELECT
    oe1.case_id,
    oe1.timestamp AS invoice_timestamp,
    oe2.timestamp AS payment_timestamp,
    (oe2.timestamp - oe1.timestamp) AS time_to_payment
FROM
    order_event_log oe1
JOIN
    order_event_log oe2 ON oe1.case_id = oe2.case_id
WHERE
    oe1.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oe2.activity = 'Receive Payment'
ORDER BY
    oe1.case_id;
```

These queries provide starting points for drilling down into the identified anomalies using the event log data. Further analysis might involve joining with the `orders` table to see if these anomalies correlate with specific order types or values, or joining with the `resources` table to see if specific resources or departments are involved more frequently in the anomalous flows.
