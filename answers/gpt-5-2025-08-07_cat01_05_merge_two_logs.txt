Below is a single, integrated event log for Order#1234. I matched events primarily by order_id and near-time proximity, normalized event names, and merged attributes when events appeared to be the same occurrence. System A’s timestamp is used as the primary timeline when available; System B’s timestamp is preserved and a delta is shown when both exist.

Reasoning and decisions:
- Primary timeline: Used System A’s timestamp as primary when merged, as System A represents the “primary” timeline. Included System B timestamps and computed timestamp deltas when both existed.
- Name normalization:
  - OrderReceived (B) -> Order Received (unified)
  - OrderValidation (B) -> Order Validated (unified)
  - PaymentCheck (B) -> Payment Processed (unified payment step)
  - Shipping (B) -> Item Shipped (unified)
  - Quality Check remains as-is (B-only step)
- Matching tolerance:
  - Default tolerance: close temporal proximity with same order_id; ~2 seconds.
  - Matched events:
    - Order Received: A 10:00:00 vs B 09:59:58 (2s) merged.
    - Order Validated: A 10:01:30 vs B 10:01:29 (1s) merged.
    - Item Shipped: A 10:05:00 vs B 10:05:02 (2s) merged.
  - Extended tolerance for Payment: A 10:02:00 vs B 10:02:05 (5s). Despite exceeding the nominal 2s, labels and sequence strongly indicate the same payment operation; B’s note (“Payment gateway delay”) plausibly explains timing skew between systems. I merged and preserved both timestamps.
- Non-overlapping events:
  - Quality Check at 10:03:00 appears only in System B; included as B-only.
  - Item Delivered at 10:20:00 appears only in System A; included as A-only.
- Conflict handling:
  - Where names differed but referred to the same step, I unified to the clearer business term (typically System A’s name) and kept System B’s original event_name in a separate field.
  - Kept both timestamps when merged and exposed timestamp_delta_seconds to show any skew.
