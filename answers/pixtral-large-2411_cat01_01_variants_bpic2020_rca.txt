Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies and performance metrics, several root causes for performance issues can be identified:

1. **Rejections and Re-submissions**:
   - Variants involving rejections (by ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, or EMPLOYEE) and subsequent re-submissions significantly increase the process duration. For example:
     - Variants with multiple rejections and re-submissions have very high performance values (e.g., frequency = 36, performance = 2542497.917).
     - Even a single rejection can increase the process duration significantly (e.g., frequency = 174, performance = 727139.517).

2. **Additional Approval Steps**:
   - Variants with additional approval steps, such as those involving the BUDGET OWNER, tend to have higher performance values. For example:
     - The variant with BUDGET OWNER approval (frequency = 2473, performance = 1084338.407) has a higher performance value compared to the variant without it (frequency = 4618, performance = 810187.903).

3. **Missing Information**:
   - Variants involving rejections due to missing information (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING") also contribute to higher performance values. For example:
     - The variant with "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" (frequency = 21, performance = 872310.667) indicates that missing information leads to delays.

4. **Pre-Approval Step**:
   - Variants involving the PRE_APPROVER step generally have higher performance values compared to those without it. For example:
     - The variant with PRE_APPROVER (frequency = 575, performance = 861058.409) has a higher performance value compared to the variant without it (frequency = 1392, performance = 854633.975).

5. **Outliers with Extremely High Performance Values**:
   - Some variants have extremely high performance values, indicating potential outliers or special cases that significantly impact overall performance. For example:
     - The variant with frequency = 5 and performance = 13805869.200.

6. **Saved Declarations**:
   - The variant "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" has a frequency of 134 and a performance value of 0.000, indicating that saved declarations do not contribute to the process duration but may represent inefficiencies if they are not being processed.

Addressing these specific issues, such as reducing rejections, streamlining approval steps, ensuring complete information, and managing outliers, could help improve the overall performance of the process.
