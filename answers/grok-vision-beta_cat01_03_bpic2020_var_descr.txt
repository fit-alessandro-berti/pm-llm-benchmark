The data you've provided describes various paths or variants of a process likely related to handling declarations or requests for payment within an organization. Here's a detailed breakdown of the process based on the information:

### General Process Flow:

1. **Initiation**: 
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE** - This is the starting point where an employee submits a declaration, possibly for expenses, reimbursements, or some form of payment request.

2. **Approval/Rejection Stages**:
   - **Approval by Various Roles**: Depending on the variant, the declaration might need approval from different roles such as ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, or PRE_APPROVER. The sequence and necessity of these approvals can vary.
   - **Rejection**: If a declaration is rejected at any stage, it generally goes back to the EMPLOYEE for resubmission or correction. This can happen multiple times, leading to different pathways back into the approval process.

3. **Final Approval**:
   - **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**: This step indicates the final approval stage where the SUPERVISOR gives the final go-ahead. This step is crucial in most variants before proceeding to payment.

4. **Payment Handling**:
   - **Request Payment**: After final approval, there's typically a step where payment is formally requested.
   - **Payment Handled**: This is the conclusion where the payment process is completed.

### Key Observations:

- **Multiple Approval Layers**: Some declarations require approvals from multiple roles (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) which indicates a structured approval hierarchy or different checks depending on the nature of the declaration.

- **Rejection and Resubmission**: There's a significant number of cases where declarations are rejected and need to be resubmitted. This suggests a process designed with quality control in mind, ensuring that all submissions meet certain criteria before final approval.

- **Performance Metrics**: The performance metric provided might relate to the time taken for each variant or some form of efficiency measure. Variants with more steps or rejections generally have higher performance values, indicating longer processing times.

- **Frequency of Variants**: The most common path involves submission, approval by administration, final approval by a supervisor, request for payment, and then payment handling. This streamlined path might represent standard or less complex declarations.

- **Complex Cases**: Some variants involve multiple rejections and resubmissions, indicating potentially problematic or non-standard declarations that require more scrutiny or corrections.

- **Special Cases**: There are instances where the process deviates significantly, like immediate final approval by a supervisor without intermediate steps or cases ending with rejections without resubmission, showing flexibility or exceptions in the process.

### Conclusion:

The process described is a multi-tiered approval system for handling declarations, likely related to financial or administrative requests within an organization. It features:

- A structured approval mechanism with potential for multiple levels of review.
- A feedback loop for corrections through rejections and resubmissions.
- Variability in process flow depending on the nature of the declaration, the roles involved, and the outcome at each approval stage.
- A focus on ensuring all submissions meet organizational standards before financial transactions are processed. 

This process likely aims to balance efficiency with thoroughness, ensuring that all financial declarations are properly vetted before payments are made, while also allowing for flexibility in handling special or problematic cases.
