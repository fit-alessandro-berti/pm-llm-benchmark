The data you've provided describes the workflow or series of activities in a business process, likely associated with handling financial transactions or approvals, possibly in a human resources or accounting context. The process starts with a declaration being submitted by an employee (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE). Certain activities must occur at least once (Existence constraints), meaning that there is at least one instance of Request Payment, Payment Handled, and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR happening within the process.

There are several constraints that add rules about how these activities can or cannot occur:

1. **Initialization**: The process begins with a declaration being submitted by an employee. This means the first activity in the process must involve an employee initiating a declaration.

2. **Co-Existence**: Activities like Request Payment and Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR must happen together along with other common combinations, ensuring they are not executed separately from the LENN of the other mentioned activities.

3. **Alternate precedence**: There are patterns in when some activities can occur in relation to others, such as an employee submitting a declaration happening before it is approved by a supervisor but also approving a payment. The activities must alternate without repeats.

4. **Proof of existence**: There's a strong connection between Approval and Payment processes, with payments happening after approval and approvals often triggered by payments.

5. **Succession constraints**: Responsive to the simultaneously defined precedents, successions and chain successions ensure that activities like payments and approvals follow other key events sequentially, barring repetition and enforcing a specific order.

6. **Co-existence constraints**: Activities like requests for payments affecting declarations of approval or payments, supporting the interdependence of these actions.

7. **Limited comity**: Activities such as a request for payment should not occur when a declaration is already approved, ensuring a well-defined flow.

Overall, the model defines a robust, sequential and interconnected workflow where certain activities are mandatory, they follow strict flow rules, and interactions are tightly controlled, ensuring a structured and accountable process for handling financial requests or approvals within an organization.
