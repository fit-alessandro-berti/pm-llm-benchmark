### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**

- **Identification:** Use the event log to track the utilization of the cold-packing stations. Focus on the timestamps for activities involving these stations to identify waiting times.
- **Metrics:**
  - *Waiting Time Metric:* Calculate the average and maximum waiting times for orders requiring cold-packing.
  - *Utilization Rate:* Determine the percentage of time each cold-packing station is in use.
- **Differentiation:** Compare the waiting times for orders requiring cold-packing against those that do not. Within-instance factors like long activity durations would show consistent delays across all orders, whereas between-instance factors would show specific delays correlated with cold-packing requirements.

**Shipping Batches:**

- **Identification:** Analyze the timestamps for the 'Shipping Label Generation' step and identify delays caused by batching.
- **Metrics:**
  - *Batch Waiting Time:* Measure the time orders spend waiting for a batch to form before label generation.
  - *Batch Size Efficiency:* Evaluate the average size of batches and the frequency of batch formation.
- **Differentiation:** Compare the waiting times for orders in batches versus those processed individually. Within-instance factors would not show batch-specific delays.

**Priority Handling for Express Orders:**

- **Identification:** Track the interruptions caused by express orders by analyzing the timestamps and order types.
- **Metrics:**
  - *Interruption Frequency:* Count the number of times standard orders are paused for express orders.
  - *Delay Impact:* Measure the additional time standard orders spend waiting due to express order interruptions.
- **Differentiation:** Compare the processing times of standard orders with and without express order interruptions. Within-instance delays would be consistent, while between-instance delays would correlate with express order arrivals.

**Regulatory Limits on Hazardous Materials:**

- **Identification:** Monitor the number of hazardous material orders simultaneously undergoing 'Packing' or 'Quality Check'.
- **Metrics:**
  - *Throughput Reduction:* Measure the reduction in throughput when hazardous material orders are processed.
  - *Queue Lengths:* Track the queue lengths for hazardous material orders waiting to enter the packing or quality check phases.
- **Differentiation:** Compare the throughput and queue lengths for hazardous material orders versus standard orders. Within-instance delays would not show regulatory-specific bottlenecks.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Interactions:**

- **Express Orders and Cold-Packing Stations:** Express orders requiring cold-packing can significantly disrupt the queue for these limited resources, leading to longer waiting times for standard orders.
- **Batching and Hazardous Material Limits:** If multiple hazardous orders are destined for the same region, batching can be delayed due to regulatory limits, causing further delays in label generation.
- **Priority Handling and Batching:** Express orders may necessitate splitting batches prematurely, reducing the efficiency of batching and increasing the overall label generation time.

**Importance of Understanding Interactions:**

Understanding these interactions is crucial for developing effective optimization strategies. For example, if express orders frequently disrupt cold-packing, it may be necessary to allocate dedicated cold-packing stations for express orders. Similarly, adjusting batching logic to account for hazardous material limits can prevent regulatory bottlenecks.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations.
- **Proposed Changes:** Implement a dynamic allocation policy where cold-packing stations are reserved for express orders during peak times. Use historical data to predict peak times and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:** Use process mining to identify peak times and predict resource demand based on historical data.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting times for express orders and more balanced utilization of cold-packing stations.

**Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Batching for Shipping.
- **Proposed Changes:** Implement dynamic batch formation triggers based on real-time order volumes and hazardous material constraints. Use predictive analytics to optimize batch sizes and formation times.
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:** Analyze historical batching data to determine optimal batch sizes and formation triggers.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Faster batch formation and reduced waiting times for label generation, especially during peak seasons.

**Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling and Regulatory Limits.
- **Proposed Changes:** Develop a scheduling algorithm that considers both priority handling and regulatory limits. The algorithm should prioritize express orders while ensuring that no more than 10 hazardous material orders are processed simultaneously.
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:** Use process mining to understand the current scheduling patterns and identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Improved throughput and reduced delays for both standard and express orders, while maintaining compliance with regulatory limits.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Techniques:**

- **Resource Contention:** Simulate the allocation and utilization of cold-packing stations to test the effectiveness of dynamic allocation policies.
- **Batching Delays:** Model the batching process to evaluate the impact of revised batching logic on waiting times and throughput.
- **Priority Interruptions:** Simulate the scheduling of express orders to assess the impact on standard order processing times.
- **Regulatory Limits:** Include constraints on hazardous material processing to ensure compliance while optimizing throughput.

**Focus Areas in Simulation Models:**

- **Queue Lengths:** Monitor queue lengths for shared resources to ensure they are managed effectively.
- **Batch Formation:** Evaluate the efficiency of dynamic batch formation triggers.
- **Priority Handling:** Assess the impact of express order interruptions on overall process flow.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure that hazardous material limits are respected while optimizing throughput.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics and Dashboards:**

- **Waiting Times:** Track average and maximum waiting times for cold-packing stations, batch formation, and priority handling.
- **Utilization Rates:** Monitor the utilization rates of cold-packing stations and other shared resources.
- **Batch Efficiency:** Evaluate the efficiency of batch formation and label generation.
- **Throughput:** Measure the overall throughput of the fulfillment process, with a focus on hazardous material orders.
- **Compliance:** Ensure continuous compliance with regulatory limits on hazardous material processing.

**Process Mining Dashboards:**

- **Resource Contention Dashboard:** Display real-time queue lengths and utilization rates for shared resources.
- **Batching Efficiency Dashboard:** Show the efficiency of batch formation and label generation.
- **Priority Handling Dashboard:** Monitor the impact of express order interruptions on standard order processing.
- **Regulatory Compliance Dashboard:** Track the number of hazardous material orders being processed simultaneously to ensure compliance.

By continuously monitoring these metrics and dashboards, the fulfillment center can ensure that the instance-spanning constraints are being managed more effectively, leading to improved process performance and better compliance with regulatory limits.
