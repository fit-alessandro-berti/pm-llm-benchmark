The figure shows a Petri–netstyle model of a business process, drawn as a set of white, rounded boxes linked by places and directed arcs. Each box is an activity, with a mnemonic letter and a label such as “register request” (a), “examine thoroughly” (b), “examine casually” (c), “check ticket” (d), “reinitiate request” (f), “decide” (e), “pay compensation” (g), “reject request” (h) and “end” (z). Black dots between the boxes are places, and the arcs indicate how tokens flow between tasks: the request is registered, examined and checked in some combination, a decision is made, there may be a loop back to reinitiate the request, and finally the case is compensated or rejected before ending.

In the lowerright corner is a legend on a shaded background showing the basic routing constructs as they appear in this notation: examples of XOR–splits and joins, AND–splits and joins, and OR–splits and joins, with one white box and multiple black places and arrows indicating the branching and synchronisation behaviour.
