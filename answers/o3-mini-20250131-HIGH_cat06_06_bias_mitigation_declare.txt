Below is one valid updated DECLARE model that adds fairness‐oriented constraints. In this version, we introduce activities for handling sensitive cases (for example, using “Approve_Minority” and “Reject_Minority”), a bias check (“BiasMitigationCheck”), and an extra “ManualReview” step for sensitive decisions. We also add constraints so that whenever any sensitive attribute is examined (via activities such as “CheckApplicantRace”, “CheckApplicantAge”, or “CheckApplicantGender”), a BiasMitigationCheck is required before any decision may immediately follow.

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints for Sensitive Decisions:**  
   - *Constraint:* When a sensitive decision (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) occurs, a `ManualReview` activity must also be present in the trace.  
   - *Rationale:* This ensures that decisions involving sensitive applicants receive additional oversight and are not made solely on automated or biased rules.

2. **Response Constraints from Sensitive Attribute Checks:**  
   - *Constraint:* Whenever an event disclosing a sensitive attribute (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`, or `CheckApplicantGender`) occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must eventually follow.  
   - *Rationale:* This forces the process to perform a bias check after reviewing sensitive applicant information, helping to prevent immediate biased decisions.

3. **Precedence Constraints for Sensitive Decisions:**  
   - *Constraint:* For sensitive decision events (`Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must have occurred earlier in the trace.  
   - *Rationale:* This guarantees that before any sensitive decision is finalized, the process includes a bias mitigation step, thereby reducing the chance of discrimination.

4. **Non-Chained Succession Constraints:**  
   - *Constraint:* Decision events (whether general like `Approve`/`Reject` or sensitive like `Approve_Minority`/`Reject_Minority`) are not allowed to occur immediately after any sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`, or `CheckApplicantGender`).  
   - *Rationale:* By preventing an immediate jump from a sensitive attribute check to a decision, the model forces an intervening activity (ideally a `BiasMitigationCheck`), reducing the risk that the decision was influenced directly by sensitive information.

Together, these constraints help ensure that the process incorporates fairness checks and manual oversight whenever sensitive applicant data is involved, thereby mitigating potential bias in the loan application review.
