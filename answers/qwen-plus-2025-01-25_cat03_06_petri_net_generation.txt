Below is the Python code for constructing an accepting Petri net for the described insurance claim management process. The code uses the `pm4py` library to define places, transitions, arcs, initial marking (`im`), and final marking (`fm`).

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="InsuranceClaimManagement")

# Define places
start_place = PetriNet.Place("start")
claim_registration = PetriNet.Place("claim_registration")
document_verification = PetriNet.Place("document_verification")
re_document_submission = PetriNet.Place("re_document_submission")
fraud_check = PetriNet.Place("fraud_check")
in_depth_investigation = PetriNet.Place("in_depth_investigation")
claim_assessment = PetriNet.Place("claim_assessment")
approval = PetriNet.Place("approval")
payment = PetriNet.Place("payment")
notification = PetriNet.Place("notification")
closure = PetriNet.Place("closure")
end_place = PetriNet.Place("end")

# Add places to the Petri net
for place in [
    start_place, claim_registration, document_verification, re_document_submission,
    fraud_check, in_depth_investigation, claim_assessment, approval, payment,
    notification, closure, end_place
]:
    net.places.add(place)

# Define transitions (activities)
cr = PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration")
dv = PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification")
rds = PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
fc = PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check")
ii = PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")
ca = PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment")
ap = PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval")
p = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")
n = PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification")
cl = PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure")

# Add transitions to the Petri net
for transition in [cr, dv, rds, fc, ii, ca, ap, p, n, cl]:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# Add arcs to form the process flow
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, cr, net)  # Start -> Claim Registration
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr, document_verification, net)  # Claim Registration -> Document Verification

# Loop between Document Verification and Re-Document Submission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(document_verification, dv, net)  # Document Verification -> Transition DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, re_document_submission, net)  # Transition DV -> Re-Document Submission
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_document_submission, rds, net)  # Re-Document Submission -> Transition RDS
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds, document_verification, net)  # Transition RDS -> Document Verification

# Continue to Fraud Check after successful Document Verification
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(dv, fraud_check, net)  # Transition DV -> Fraud Check

# Loop between Fraud Check and In-depth Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fraud_check, fc, net)  # Fraud Check -> Transition FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, in_depth_investigation, net)  # Transition FC -> In-depth Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(in_depth_investigation, ii, net)  # In-depth Investigation -> Transition II
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii, fraud_check, net)  # Transition II -> Fraud Check

# Continue to Claim Assessment after Fraud Check
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc, claim_assessment, net)  # Transition FC -> Claim Assessment

# Approval if needed
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(claim_assessment, ca, net)  # Claim Assessment -> Transition CA
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ca, approval, net)  # Transition CA -> Approval
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(approval, ap, net)  # Approval -> Transition AP

# Payment and Notification
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap, payment, net)  # Transition AP -> Payment
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment, p, net)  # Payment -> Transition P
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p, notification, net)  # Transition P -> Notification
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(notification, n, net)  # Notification -> Transition N

# Closure and End
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n, closure, net)  # Transition N -> Closure
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(closure, cl, net)  # Closure -> Transition CL
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl, end_place, net)  # Transition CL -> End

# Define initial marking (token at start place)
im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

# Define final marking (token at end place)
fm = Marking()
fm[end_place] = 1

# Print the constructed Petri net
print("Petri Net Constructed Successfully!")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Places**: Represent states or stages in the process, such as `start`, `claim_registration`, `document_verification`, etc.
2. **Transitions**: Represent activities or actions, labeled with their respective names (e.g., "Claim Registration", "Document Verification").
3. **Arcs**: Connect places and transitions to define the flow of tokens through the process.
   - Loops are implemented for `Document Verification`  `Re-Document Submission` and `Fraud Check`  `In-depth Investigation`.
4. **Initial Marking (`im`)**: Places a token at the `start` place to initiate the process.
5. **Final Marking (`fm`)**: Places a token at the `end` place to signify the completion of the process.

This Petri net captures the complexity of the insurance claim management process, including potential loops for document re-submission and in-depth investigation.
