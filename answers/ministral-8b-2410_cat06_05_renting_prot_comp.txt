To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times for both groups. Based on the given data, here are the main differences:

### Variants with Higher Execution Times for the Protected Group

1. **Extended Screening and Multiple Rent Payments Leading to Cancellation:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent (x times) -> Tenant Cancels Appartment:**
       - Frequency: 18, 16, 14, 12, 11, 11, 10, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6
       - Performance:
         - 810,021.897
         - 900,045.188
         - 1,259,993.929
         - 1,170,026.167
         - 1,349,975.636
         - 1,169,987.909
         - 720,057.800
         - 899,973.750
         - 809,980.875
         - 1,440,007.833
         - 1,079,944.833
         - 990,084.833
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - **Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent (x times) -> Tenant Cancels Appartment:**
       - Frequency: 268, 223, 156, 128, 103, 88, 63, 56, 52, 45, 44, 43
       - Performance:
         - 640,003.769
         - 719,990.659
         - 800,009.840
         - 880,029.711
         - 960,002.670
         - 1,040,011.655
         - 880,014.238
         - 1,200,034.536
         - 1,119,986.154
         - 1,280,091.444
         - 1,119,994.455
         - 960,024.279

2. **Extensive Screening and Eviction Process:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Frequency: 6
     - Performance: 990,084.833
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - No equivalent process variant with extensive screening and eviction.

### Variants with Higher Frequencies for the Unprotected Group

1. **Rejection of Prospective Tenants:**
   - **Protected Group:**
     - Frequency: 1,036, 793, 484, 366
     - Performance: 270,000.477, 540,011.977, 89,999.306, 449,997.746
   - **Unprotected Group:**
     - Frequency: 2,490, 1,022, 674, 365
     - Performance: 400,004.640, 480,013.530, 240,000.654, 80,002.688

### Summary of Main Differences

- **For the Protected Group:**
  - Higher execution times for processes involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments leading to cancellation.
  - A process variant involving extensive screening and eviction, which is not present in the unprotected group.

- **For the Unprotected Group:**
  - Higher frequencies of rejection of prospective tenants compared to the protected group.
  - The absence of a process variant involving extensive screening and eviction, which is present in the protected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group faces longer and more complex processes, while the unprotected group has more frequent rejections but shorter and simpler processes. This indicates potential unfairness in the treatment of the protected group, as they are subjected to more lengthy and complex procedures, possibly leading to higher barriers in their path to securing housing.
