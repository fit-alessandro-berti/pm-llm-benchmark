To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given scenario, we need to carefully analyze the sequence and constraints of the activities. Here's a possible structure for the Log Skeleton:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': set(),  # No equivalence constraints specified.
    'always_before': {
        ('Check Availability (CA)', 'Reserve Items (RI)'),
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Pick Items (PI)'),
        ('Pick Items (PI)', 'Quality Check (QC)'),
        ('Quality Check (QC)', 'Pack Order (PO)'),
        ('Pack Order (PO)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Dispatch (D)'),
        ('Invoice Customer (IC)', 'Record Payment (RP)'),
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Receive Order (RO)', 'Check Availability (CA)'),
        ('Pick Items (PI)', 'Quality Check (QC)'),
        ('Pack Order (PO)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),
        ('Dispatch (D)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)'),
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Check Availability (CA)', 'Record Payment (RP)'),
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)'),
        # Add other constraints as needed.
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order (RO)': {1},
        'Check Availability (CA)': {1},
        'Reserve Items (RI)': {1},
        'Pick Items (PI)': {1},
        'Quality Check (QC)': {1},
        'Pack Order (PO)': {1},
        'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)': {1},
        'Dispatch (D)': {1},
        'Invoice Customer (IC)': {1},
        'Record Payment (RP)': {1},
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order (RO)', 'Check Availability (CA)'),
        ('Check Availability (CA)', 'Reserve Items (RI)'),
        ('Reserve Items (RI)', 'Pick Items (PI)'),
        ('Pick Items (PI)', 'Quality Check (QC)'),
        ('Quality Check (QC)', 'Pack Order (PO)'),
        ('Pack Order (PO)', 'Generate Shipping Label (GSL)'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label (GSL)', 'Dispatch (D)'),
        ('Dispatch (D)', 'Invoice Customer (IC)'),
        ('Invoice Customer (IC)', 'Record Payment (RP)'),
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence:** No equivalence constraints were specified, so this set is empty.
- **Always Before:** Ensures that certain activities must happen before others, reflecting the flow of the order fulfillment process.
- **Always After:** Specifies that activities must be followed by others in a direct sequence.
- **Never Together:** Prevents activities from happening in the same case, which may arise from operational or logical reasons.
- **Activity Occurrences:** Sets a fixed occurrence count of 1 for each activity in a case, as each activity should happen exactly once per order fulfillment cycle.
- **Directly-Follows Constraints:** Defines a strict sequence where each activity is immediately followed by the next one in the process.

This structure ensures that the order fulfillment process follows a logical and consistent sequence, adhering to the constraints provided.
