To infer the activities being performed on the manufacturing assembly line based on the provided event log, we need to analyze the patterns in the sensor readings. Each event contains several sensor readings that can help us identify distinct phases in the manufacturing process. Let's break down the events and assign labels to each phase based on the changes in these readings.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Idle Phase (Events 1-3):**
   - **Temperature:** 20-21°C
   - **Pressure:** 1 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 0 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 0 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 0.40-0.50 kWh

   **Label:** Idle/Setup
   **Rationale:** Low temperature, pressure, vibration, and material flow indicate that the machine is not actively performing any task. The stable energy consumption suggests that the machine is in a standby or setup mode.

2. **Cutting Metal Phase (Events 4-6):**
   - **Temperature:** 50-58°C
   - **Pressure:** 1-1.5 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 30-38 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 5 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 5-10 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 2.00-3.00 kWh

   **Label:** Cutting Metal
   **Rationale:** Significant increase in temperature, vibration, and material flow, along with a change in tool position, indicates a cutting operation. The increase in energy consumption supports this activity.

3. **Welding Phase (Events 7-8):**
   - **Temperature:** 40°C
   - **Pressure:** 2 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 10 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 2 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 15 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 2.00 kWh

   **Label:** Welding
   **Rationale:** Stable temperature and pressure, moderate vibration, and material flow suggest a welding operation. The consistent energy consumption and tool position indicate a continuous welding process.

4. **High-Energy Phase (Event 9):**
   - **Temperature:** 80°C
   - **Pressure:** 2 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 50 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 15 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 5.00 kWh

   **Label:** High-Energy Operation
   **Rationale:** A sudden spike in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, with no material flow, suggests a high-energy operation that could be related to a quality inspection or a specialized process.

5. **Cooling/Stabilization Phase (Event 10):**
   - **Temperature:** 30°C
   - **Pressure:** 1 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 1 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 15 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 1.00 kWh

   **Label:** Cooling/Stabilization
   **Rationale:** A decrease in temperature and energy consumption, along with stable pressure and vibration, indicates a cooling or stabilization phase after a high-energy operation.

6. **Quality Inspection Phase (Events 11-12):**
   - **Temperature:** 25°C
   - **Pressure:** 1 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 5 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 1 unit/s
   - **Tool Position:** 20 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 1.50-1.60 kWh

   **Label:** Quality Inspection
   **Rationale:** Moderate temperature, pressure, and vibration, along with a slight material flow, suggest a quality inspection process. The stable energy consumption and change in tool position support this activity.

7. **Final Idle Phase (Events 13-15):**
   - **Temperature:** 20-21°C
   - **Pressure:** 1 bar
   - **Vibration Level:** 0 Hz
   - **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
   - **Tool Position:** 0 mm
   - **Energy Consumption:** 0.40-0.50 kWh

   **Label:** Idle/Setup
   **Rationale:** Similar to the initial idle phase, low temperature, pressure, vibration, and material flow indicate that the machine is in a standby or setup mode.

### Summary of Labeled Activities:

1. **Idle/Setup**
2. **Cutting Metal**
3. **Welding**
4. **High-Energy Operation**
5. **Cooling/Stabilization**
6. **Quality Inspection**
7. **Idle/Setup**

By analyzing the patterns in the sensor readings, we have been able to infer the high-level manufacturing activities being performed on the assembly line. Each phase corresponds to a distinct activity based on the changes in temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, tool position, and energy consumption.
