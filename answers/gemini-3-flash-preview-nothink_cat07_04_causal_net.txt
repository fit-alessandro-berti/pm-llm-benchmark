The provided image is a process flow diagram, likely representing a business process or a workflow. It uses a specific notation for control flows, which is explained in a legend at the bottom right.

### **Legend Summary**
The legend defines how different paths in the process split and join:
*   **XOR (Exclusive OR):** Only one path is taken (split) or one incoming path is needed to proceed (join). Represented by a single dot on each path.
*   **AND:** All paths are taken (split) or all incoming paths must complete before proceeding (join). Represented by a simple arc across the paths.
*   **OR:** One or more paths are taken (split) or one or more completed incoming paths are joined. Represented by an arc with a dot at each intersection point.

### **Process Description**

1.  **Initiation:** The process begins at node **a (register request)**.
2.  **Initial Split:** After registration, an **OR-split** occurs. This means one or more of the following activities are triggered:
    *   **b: examine thoroughly**
    *   **c: examine casually**
    *   **d: check ticket**
3.  **Processing and Loop-back Joins:**
    *   Node **b** leads directly toward the decision point.
    *   Nodes **c** and **d** have **XOR-joins** at their input. This allows them to be triggered either from the initial registration (**a**) or from a reinitiated request (**f**).
4.  **The Decision Point:** All active paths from b, c, and d converge at node **e (decide)** via an **OR-join**. This node waits for all triggered activities from the previous step to finish.
5.  **Outcomes of the Decision:** Node **e** has an **XOR-split**, meaning exactly one of three outcomes is chosen:
    *   **g: pay compensation:** Leads to the end.
    *   **h: reject request:** Leads to the end.
    *   **f: reinitiate request:** This leads to a loop-back.
6.  **Re-initiation Loop:** If the request is reinitiated (**f**), an **OR-split** triggers **c (examine casually)** and/or **d (check ticket)** again. Note that the "thorough examination" (**b**) is not part of this loop.
7.  **Termination:** If either path **g** or **h** is taken, they meet at node **z (end)** through an **XOR-join**, signifying the completion of the process.
