We are going to break down the problem into steps:

 Step 1: Identify cases that have the sequence of three activities in direct succession: 
   'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'

 We can use window functions to check the sequence. We'll partition by case_id and order by timestamp.

 Step 2: For the cases that have the sequence, check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

 Step 3: Exclude all events from the cases that meet both conditions.

 Approach:

 We can use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to mark the cases that should be excluded.

 Let's create a CTE that identifies the cases to exclude:

   - We'll assign a row number or use lead/lag to check the next activities.
   - We are looking for a row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and then the next activity in the same case is 'Create Order', and then the next is 'Confirm Order'. We must ensure there are no other activities in between.

 We can do:

   WITH sequence_check AS (
     SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp2
     FROM event_log
   )

 Then, from this CTE, we can find rows where:
   activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
   AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
   AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'

 And then, for the same case, we can compute the time difference between the next_timestamp1 (which is the timestamp of 'Create Order') and next_timestamp2 (which is the timestamp of 'Confirm Order') and check if it is more than 5 days.

 However, note: the condition is that the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. So we can do:

   DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp1, next_timestamp2) > 5

 But note: the problem says "more than 5 days", so we use > 5.

 Then, we can get a list of case_ids that meet both conditions.

 Then, in the main query, we select all events from event_log where case_id is not in that list.

 However, note: the same case might have multiple sequences? The problem says "any case that contains the following sequence". We are to exclude the entire case if at least one such sequence exists and the timing condition is met.

 But note: the problem says "among those cases that have this specific sequence", so we are only concerned with the sequence and then the timing condition on that same sequence.

 However, what if a case has multiple such sequences? We are to exclude the case if at least one sequence meets the timing condition? The problem says: "further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed ... of that sequence". So we are looking for a specific sequence (the one we found) and then check the time for that same sequence.

 So we can do:

   Step 1: Find cases that have the sequence (without considering time) and then for each found sequence, check the time condition.

   But note: a case might have multiple sequences? We are not told that we have to consider multiple occurrences. The problem says "the sequence", meaning one occurrence? Actually, it says "any case that contains the following sequence", meaning at least one occurrence. And then we check the timing condition on that same sequence (the one we found). However, if a case has multiple sequences, we only need to exclude it if at least one of the sequences meets the timing condition.

 So we can do:

   We'll collect the case_ids that have at least one sequence meeting both conditions.

   We can do:

     WITH flagged_sequences AS (
        ... as above ...
     ),
     excluded_cases AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM flagged_sequences
        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
          AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
          AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp1, next_timestamp2) > 5
     )

   Then, the main query:

     SELECT *
     FROM event_log
     WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

 However, note: the LEAD functions might look beyond the case boundary? No, because we partition by case_id.

 But what if the sequence spans the last two events? Then next_activity2 would be NULL? So we have to check that next_activity1 and next_activity2 are not null? Actually, the condition will fail if they are null, so it's safe.

 Alternatively, we can use a self-join or a pattern matching approach? But the LEAD method is straightforward.

 But note: the problem says "direct succession", meaning no other events in between. The LEAD method with two leads exactly checks the next two events without gaps.

 However, what if there are more events? We are only concerned with the immediate next two events? Yes, because we are using LEAD(,1) and LEAD(,2). So if the next event is 'Create Order' and the one after that is 'Confirm Order', then there is no event in between.

 So the above CTE should work.

 But note: performance. We are scanning the entire table and then for each row we look two ahead. Then we filter for only the rows that are the first activity. Then we check the time condition. Then we get distinct case_ids.

 Alternatively, we can use a window function to assign a sequence number per case and then check for consecutive events? But the LEAD method is efficient enough.

 Let's write the query accordingly.

 However, note: DuckDB supports the LEAD function and DATEDIFF.

 But note: the DATEDIFF function in DuckDB: 
   The syntax is: DATEDIFF(part, startdate, enddate) -> returns the number of part boundaries between startdate and enddate.

   So DATEDIFF('day', t1, t2) returns the number of days between t1 and t2? Actually, it returns the number of day boundaries crossed. So if t1 is 2020-01-01 23:59:59 and t2 is 2020-01-02 00:00:01, then DATEDIFF('day', t1, t2) returns 1.

   But we want the actual time difference? The problem says "more than 5 days", meaning 5 full days? Or more than 5*24 hours? 

   The problem does not specify, but typically in such business scenarios, we consider calendar days. So if the time between the two events is more than 5 calendar days (i.e., at least 6 days later? or 5 full days?).

   Actually, the condition is: time elapsed is more than 5 days. So if the time difference is 5 days and 1 second, that is more than 5 days.

   Using DATEDIFF with 'day' counts the number of day boundaries. So:

     2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2020-01-06 00:00:00 -> 5 days? Then DATEDIFF returns 5? But we want more than 5 days.

   Actually, if we do DATEDIFF('day', t1, t2) > 5, then:

     from 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-02 -> 1 day -> 1 > 5? no.
     from 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-07 -> 6 days -> 6>5 -> yes.

   But what about from 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2020-01-06 23:59:59? That is almost 6 days? But DATEDIFF('day', ...) returns 5? Because it counts the boundaries: 1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th, 4th to 5th, 5th to 6th -> 5 boundaries? So 5.

   Then 5>5 is false.

   But we want to include if it is more than 5 days. So we should use an interval comparison:

      (next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1) > interval 5 days

   In DuckDB, we can subtract timestamps and compare to an interval.

   Example: 
        (next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1) > INTERVAL '5 days'

   This would be more accurate because it considers the exact time.

   Alternatively, we can do:

        next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'

   This is equivalent.

   So let's use:

        next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'

   This will be true if the time between is more than 5 full days (5*24 hours? Actually, 5 days as in 5*24 hours? But note: daylight saving? The problem doesn't specify, so we assume we are using UTC or ignore DST. Typically, we use absolute time difference.)

   This condition is more natural.

   So we can write:

        WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
          AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
          AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
          AND next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'

 Step 3: Then we exclude the entire case.

 However, note: what if the same case has multiple sequences? We are only flagging the case if at least one sequence meets the condition. Then we exclude the entire case.

 So the query:

   WITH flagged_sequences AS (
     SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp2
     FROM event_log
   ),
   excluded_cases AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT case_id
     FROM flagged_sequences
     WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
       AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
       AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
       AND next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'
   )

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)

 But note: what if there are no events? Then excluded_cases will be empty and we return all events? Correct.

 However, what if the event_log is huge? We are doing a window function over the entire table partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. That might be heavy, but it's the most straightforward.

 Alternatively, we can try to optimize by only considering cases that have at least the three activities? But the problem doesn't specify, and we are already partitioning by case_id.

 We can also consider using the MATCH_RECOGNIZE if DuckDB supports it? But DuckDB does not currently support MATCH_RECOGNIZE (as of my knowledge cutoff). So we stick with window functions.

 Also note: we are selecting DISTINCT case_id in excluded_cases. This is because we only need the case_id to exclude.

 But note: the window function will run for every row. However, we are only interested in rows where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. We can filter earlier? Actually, we can push the condition into the CTE? But the window function must run over all rows because we need the next two events.

 Alternatively, we can do:

   WITH candidate_sequences AS (
     SELECT 
        case_id,
        timestamp as approve_ts,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as create_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as create_ts,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_ts
     FROM event_log
     WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'   -- This might reduce the rows we process in the window function? But note: the window function is partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp. If we filter by activity, then we lose the context of the next events? Because the next events might not be the immediate next in the case? Actually, no. The window function is applied to the entire partition (all events of the case) and then we filter. So if we filter first, we break the sequence.

   So we cannot filter in the inner query of the CTE. We must run the window function over the entire partition.

   Therefore, we leave it as is.

   However, we can try to filter after the window function? Which we are already doing.

   So the above CTE is acceptable.

 Let's write the final query.

 Note: We must return all events from the event_log except those from excluded cases. And we must return the events in the same structure? The problem says: "return all events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and the timing condition".

 So the above query does that.

 But note: the ordering of events? The problem doesn't specify an order, but typically we might want the original order? The query without an ORDER BY will return in arbitrary order. We can add an ORDER BY at the end? The problem says: "ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering". It says "grouping" but we are not grouping? Actually, we are not aggregating. It says "ordering" - so we should order by case_id and timestamp? The problem doesn't specify, but to be safe, we can order by timestamp and case_id? Or by the original order? Since we are not modifying the events, we can just order by timestamp and case_id.

 However, the problem says: "the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out". So we can do:

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp   -- to get the events per case in chronological order

 But note: the problem doesn't specify the order. But it's common to return events in chronological order per case.

 Alternatively, we can leave it unordered? But the problem says "proper ordering", so we should order.

 So we add an ORDER BY.

 Final query:

   WITH flagged_sequences AS (
     SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp2
     FROM event_log
   ),
   excluded_cases AS (
     SELECT DISTINCT case_id
     FROM flagged_sequences
     WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
       AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
       AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
       AND next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'
   )

   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

 But note: what if the event_log has duplicate rows? We are returning all events, so duplicates are preserved? Yes.

 However, the problem does not specify if there are duplicate events. We assume the table is as given.

 Let me test with a small example.

 Example case 1: 
   case_id=1, events in order:
     event1: activity='Approve Purchase Requisition', timestamp='2020-01-01'
     event2: activity='Create Order', timestamp='2020-01-02'
     event3: activity='Confirm Order', timestamp='2020-01-03'

   Then the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is 1 day -> not more than 5 -> so case1 is not excluded.

 Example case 2:
   case_id=2, events:
     event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-01'
     event2: 'Create Order', '2020-01-02'
     event3: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-10'   --> 8 days, so >5 -> exclude case2.

   Then the query should return no events from case2.

 Example case 3:
   case_id=3, events:
     event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-01'
     event2: 'Some Other Activity', '2020-01-02'
     event3: 'Create Order', '2020-01-03'
     event4: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-04'

   This case does not have the sequence in direct succession -> not excluded.

 Example case 4:
   case_id=4, events:
     event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-01'
     event2: 'Create Order', '2020-01-02'
     event3: 'Some Other Activity', '2020-01-03'
     event4: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-04'

   This case does not have the sequence in direct succession -> not excluded.

 Example case 5:
   case_id=5, events:
     event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-01'
     event2: 'Create Order', '2020-01-02'
     event3: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-10'   -> 8 days, so exclude case5.

   But note: what if there are more events after? We are only concerned with the sequence? And we are excluding the entire case? Yes.

 Example case 6:
   case_id=6, events:
     event1: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-01'
     event2: 'Create Order', '2020-01-02'
     event3: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-03'   -> 1 day, not excluded.
     event4: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', '2020-01-04'
     event5: 'Create Order', '2020-01-05'
     event6: 'Confirm Order', '2020-01-15'   -> 10 days -> exclude case6.

   So case6 will be excluded because one sequence meets the condition.

 Therefore, the query should work.

 However, note: the window function LEAD might be NULL for the last two rows? But we are filtering on activity='Approve Purchase Requisition', and then checking the next two activities. So if the 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is the last or second last event, then next_activity1 or next_activity2 will be NULL, and the condition will fail.

 So it's safe.

 Let's write the query accordingly.
</think>
To solve this problem, we need to identify cases that contain a specific sequence of activities in direct succession and meet a timing condition, then exclude all events from those cases. The solution involves using window functions to detect the sequence and timing condition efficiently.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH flagged_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp2
    FROM event_log
),
excluded_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM flagged_sequences
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM excluded_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **Identify Sequences with Window Functions**:
   - The `flagged_sequences` CTE uses `LEAD` to look ahead two activities and their timestamps for each event, partitioned by `case_id` and ordered by `timestamp`.
   - This allows checking the next two activities in sequence without gaps.

2. **Filter Cases Meeting Both Conditions**:
   - The `excluded_cases` CTE selects distinct `case_id` values where:
     - The current activity is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`.
     - The next activity is `'Create Order'`.
     - The activity after that is `'Confirm Order'`.
     - The time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` exceeds 5 days (`next_timestamp2 > next_timestamp1 + INTERVAL '5 days'`).

3. **Exclude Cases and Return Results**:
   - The main query retrieves all events from `event_log` except those belonging to `excluded_cases`.
   - Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain chronological order per case.

This approach efficiently identifies cases with the specified sequence and timing condition using window functions, then excludes all events from those cases, returning the remaining events in the desired order.
