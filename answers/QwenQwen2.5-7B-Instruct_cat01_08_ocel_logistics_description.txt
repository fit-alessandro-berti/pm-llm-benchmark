Based on the provided event logs and the directly follows graphs, we can infer the overall process occurring in this system. Let's break it down for each object type:

### Item Process

1. **Order Initiation:**
   - Customers initiate orders via "place order". This can happen independently or as a result of other events.
   - Customers can place multiple orders ("place order" -> "pay order").

2. **Order Confirmation:**
   - Once placed, orders get confirmed ("place order" -> "confirm order").

3. **Item Selection:**
   - The system needs to "pick item" based on the customer's selection, or items are picked independently of order placement.
   - If an item is out of stock, it triggers "reorder item".

4. **Item Packaging:**
   - Items are packaged ("pick item" -> "create package").
   - Packages are sent ("create package" -> "send package").

5. **Payment:**
   - "Pay order" involves paying for the order, which can happen before or after the package is sent.
   - "Confirm order" often precedes "pay order" but can also follow it, indicating different payment policies (e.g., immediate, conditional).

6. **Customer Interaction:**
   - If items are out of stock, the system may trigger "reorder item".
   - "Reorder item" can lead to "pick item".

7. **Delivery:**
   - Packages are delivered ("send package" -> "package delivered").
   - Payment reminders are sent for overdue payments ("package delivered" -> "payment reminder").
   - Items may be delivered directly to customers without immediate payment.

### Employee Process

- Employees are involved in picking items ("pick item").
- They confirm orders ("confirm order").
- They handle stock shortages ("item out of stock" -> "reorder item").
- They create packages ("create package") and send them ("send package").
- They interact with the payment process ("pay order") and package delivery ("package delivered").

### Order Process

- Once an order is placed, it gets confirmed ("place order" -> "confirm order").
- Orders are paid ("confirm order" -> "pay order").
- Payment of an order can trigger picking items ("pay order" -> "pick item").

### Customer Process

- Customers place orders ("place order").

1. **Order Completion:**
   - Orders get confirmed ("place order" -> "confirm order").

2. **Item Selection:**
   - Customers have the option to pick items themselves or the system picks them ("confirm order" -> "pick item").

3. **Payment:**
   - Customers pay for their orders ("confirm order" -> "pay order").

4. **Delivery:**
   - After the order is paid, items can be packed and sent to the customer ("pick item" -> "send package").
   - Packages are delivered ("send package" -> "package delivered").
   - Customers may receive payment reminders ("package delivered" -> "payment reminder").

### Product Process

- Products are picked and added to packages ("pick item" -> "create package").
- Items are confirmed as picked ("pick item" -> "confirm order").

### Package Process

- Packages are created ("create package") and then sent ("create package" -> "send package").
- Packages get delivered ("send package" -> "package delivered").

### Summary

The overall process involves:
1. **Order Placement and Confirmation:** Customers place orders which get confirmed.
2. **Item Selection and Packaging:** Items are picked and packaged.
3. **Payment:** Orders are paid, and payment can trigger further actions (item picking, order confirmation).
4. **Delivery:** Packages are sent and delivered to customers.
5. **Feedback and Reminders:** Payment reminders are sent for overdue payments.

This process is cyclical and involves multiple roles (customers, employees, and systems) working in tandem to ensure smooth order fulfillment from start to finish.
