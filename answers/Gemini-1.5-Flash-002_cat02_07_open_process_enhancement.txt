In process mining, "process enhancement" focuses on improving existing processes based on insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking.  It's the *actionable output* after understanding the "as-is" process and its deviations from the "should-be" process.  It's not just about identifying problems, but actively suggesting and implementing changes to optimize efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance.

Here's how it differs from process discovery and conformance checking:

* **Process Discovery:** This is the initial step where process mining algorithms analyze event logs (e.g., from ERP systems, databases) to automatically generate a visual representation (e.g., a process map) of the *actual* process as it's executed.  It's purely descriptive; it doesn't judge the process's quality or suggest improvements.  Think of it as creating a "map" of the existing process.

* **Conformance Checking:** This compares the discovered "as-is" process model with a pre-defined "should-be" process model (often a BPMN diagram). It identifies deviations and bottlenecks, quantifying the differences between the intended process and the actual execution.  This highlights *where* the process isn't working as planned, but doesn't directly offer solutions. It's diagnostic; pointing out the issues.

* **Process Enhancement:** This is the prescriptive stage.  It leverages the insights from discovery and conformance checking to propose and implement improvements. This can involve:

    * **Identifying and eliminating bottlenecks:** Based on conformance checking, areas with excessive wait times or frequent deviations can be targeted for optimization.
    * **Simplifying complex processes:** Process discovery might reveal unnecessary steps or loops, which can then be removed to streamline the workflow.
    * **Automating tasks:**  Identifying repetitive tasks highlighted in the process map enables the automation of those steps using RPA or other technologies.
    * **Improving resource allocation:** Analyzing resource usage across different activities can guide better resource assignment and workload balancing.
    * **Enhancing compliance:**  Conformance checking reveals non-compliance instances; process enhancement focuses on implementing measures (e.g., additional controls, training) to improve adherence to regulations.
    * **Implementing process changes:**  This can be iterative, using simulation and further analysis to test the impact of potential improvements before implementing them in the real world.


In short:  Discovery *finds* the process, conformance *judges* the process, and enhancement *improves* the process.  They are sequential steps in a process mining project, each building upon the previous one.  Process enhancement is the ultimate goal â€“ to make the process better, faster, and more efficient.
