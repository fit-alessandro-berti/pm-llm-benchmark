Certainly! A Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process typically involves a series of activities that include requisitioning, approving, purchasing, receiving, and paying for goods or services. For the sake of this example, let's assume the following activities in the P2P process:

1. Requisition (R)
2. Approval (A)
3. Purchase Order (PO)
4. Delivery (D)
5. Invoice (I)
6. Payment (P)

We will generate a temporal profile for this process, including the average times and standard deviations between these activities. Here is a hypothetical temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('R', 'A'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
    ('R', 'PO'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Standard Deviation: 8 hours
    ('R', 'D'): (259200, 43200),  # Average: 3 days, Standard Deviation: 12 hours
    ('R', 'I'): (345600, 57600),  # Average: 4 days, Standard Deviation: 16 hours
    ('R', 'P'): (432000, 72000),  # Average: 5 days, Standard Deviation: 20 hours

    ('A', 'PO'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
    ('A', 'D'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Standard Deviation: 8 hours
    ('A', 'I'): (259200, 43200),  # Average: 3 days, Standard Deviation: 12 hours
    ('A', 'P'): (345600, 57600),  # Average: 4 days, Standard Deviation: 16 hours

    ('PO', 'D'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
    ('PO', 'I'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Standard Deviation: 8 hours
    ('PO', 'P'): (259200, 43200),  # Average: 3 days, Standard Deviation: 12 hours

    ('D', 'I'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
    ('D', 'P'): (172800, 28800),  # Average: 2 days, Standard Deviation: 8 hours

    ('I', 'P'): (86400, 14400),  # Average: 1 day, Standard Deviation: 4 hours
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Requisition (R) to Approval (A):** The average time is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
- **Requisition (R) to Purchase Order (PO):** The average time is 2 days, with a standard deviation of 8 hours.
- **Requisition (R) to Delivery (D):** The average time is 3 days, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
- **Requisition (R) to Invoice (I):** The average time is 4 days, with a standard deviation of 16 hours.
- **Requisition (R) to Payment (P):** The average time is 5 days, with a standard deviation of 20 hours.
- **Approval (A) to Purchase Order (PO):** The average time is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
- **Approval (A) to Delivery (D):** The average time is 2 days, with a standard deviation of 8 hours.
- **Approval (A) to Invoice (I):** The average time is 3 days, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
- **Approval (A) to Payment (P):** The average time is 4 days, with a standard deviation of 16 hours.
- **Purchase Order (PO) to Delivery (D):** The average time is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
- **Purchase Order (PO) to Invoice (I):** The average time is 2 days, with a standard deviation of 8 hours.
- **Purchase Order (PO) to Payment (P):** The average time is 3 days, with a standard deviation of 12 hours.
- **Delivery (D) to Invoice (I):** The average time is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.
- **Delivery (D) to Payment (P):** The average time is 2 days, with a standard deviation of 8 hours.
- **Invoice (I) to Payment (P):** The average time is 1 day, with a standard deviation of 4 hours.

This temporal profile provides a structured way to understand the typical time intervals and variability between different activities in the P2P process. You can use this profile to detect deviations using the ZETA threshold as described.
