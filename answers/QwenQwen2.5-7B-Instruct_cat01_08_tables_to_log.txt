### Assumptions and Notes
- For simplicity, the `Resource/Actor` column is left blank in the event log as the ERP system does not specify which user performed each action.
- The `Case ID` is derived from `order_id` for each process instance.
- The event log is structured to capture the sequence of events from order creation to payment received, ensuring chronological correctness.
