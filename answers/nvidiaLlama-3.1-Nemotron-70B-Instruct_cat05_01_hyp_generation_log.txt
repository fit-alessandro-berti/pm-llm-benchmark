**Anomaly Identification and Hypotheses**

After analyzing the provided `order_event_log` data, the following anomalies and undesirable behaviors have been identified:

1. **Out-of-Sequence Events**
   - **Case 1002**: "Confirm Shipment" (event_id 9) occurs before "Perform Credit Check" (event_id 11) and "Validate Stock" (event_id 12). This deviates from the assumed normal process flow.
   - **Hypothesis**: Potential miscommunication between departments, incorrect assumption of creditworthiness, or a test scenario.
   - **Proposed SQL Query for Investigation**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM order_event_log 
     WHERE case_id = 1002 
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```
     **Follow-up Query to Check Preceding Activities Across All Cases**:
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id, activity, LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity
     FROM order_event_log
     WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
     AND previous_activity NOT IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock');
     ```

2. **Missing Activities**
   - **Case 1003**: Misses "Validate Stock" before "Ship Goods", and "Confirm Shipment" is recorded after "Ship Goods".
   - **Hypothesis**: Oversight in the logistics process, possible misunderstanding of the procedure, or an emergency shipment protocol.
   - **Proposed SQL Query for Investigation**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM order_event_log 
     WHERE case_id = 1003 
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```
     **Follow-up Query to Identify Any Case with Incomplete Sequence**:
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id 
     FROM (
       SELECT case_id, 
              BOOL_AND(activity IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 
                                    'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')) AS is_complete
       FROM order_event_log
       GROUP BY case_id
     ) AS subquery
     WHERE NOT is_complete;
     ```

3. **Unconventional Payment and Invoicing**
   - **Case 1004**: "Receive Payment" precedes both "Issue Invoice" and the completion of shipment preparation ("Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods").
   - **Hypothesis**: Advance payment agreement, a system error in event logging, or an unconventional sales promo.
   - **Proposed SQL Query for Investigation**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * 
     FROM order_event_log 
     WHERE case_id = 1004 
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```
     **Follow-up Query to Find Similar Advance Payments**:
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, o.order_value, oel.activity, oel.timestamp
     FROM order_event_log oel
     JOIN orders o ON oel.case_id = o.case_id
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) 
                           FROM order_event_log 
                           WHERE case_id = oel.case_id 
                           AND activity IN ('Issue Invoice', 'Confirm Shipment'));
     ```

4. **Credit Check Outcomes and Their Impact**
   - **Variability in Credit Scores (e.g., 810 for Case 1001, 650 for Case 1002, 720 for Case 1003)**: No direct anomaly in sequence, but worth investigating if lower scores correlate with delayed or cancelled shipments.
   - **Hypothesis**: Credit score thresholds might not be uniformly applied across all cases, or there's a lack of clear guidelines on how to proceed with lower credit scores.
   - **Proposed SQL Query for Investigation**:
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.additional_info AS credit_score, 
            (SELECT activity FROM order_event_log WHERE case_id = oel.case_id AND activity = 'Ship Goods') AS shipped
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check';
     ```
     **Follow-up Query to Analyze Shipments Based on Credit Scores**:
     ```sql
     WITH CreditScores AS (
       SELECT case_id, CAST(SPLIT_PART(additional_info, '=', 2) AS INTEGER) AS credit_score
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
     )
     SELECT credit_score, 
            COUNT(CASE WHEN shipped THEN 1 END) AS num_shipped, 
            COUNT(*) AS total_orders
     FROM (
       SELECT cs.credit_score, 
              CASE WHEN oel_case.shipment_activity IS NOT NULL THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS shipped
       FROM CreditScores cs
       LEFT JOIN (
         SELECT case_id, MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS shipment_activity
         FROM order_event_log
         GROUP BY case_id
       ) oel_case ON cs.case_id = oel_case.case_id
     ) AS merged_table
     GROUP BY credit_score
     ORDER BY credit_score;
     ```

**Actionable Recommendations**

- Re-evaluate the process flow to ensure all necessary checks are in place before proceeding to shipment.
- Implement more stringent event logging validation to catch out-of-sequence activities.
- Provide clear guidelines on credit score assessment and its implications on order processing.
- Consider implementing a more integrated system where payments, invoicing, and shipment logistics are synchronized to prevent unconventional transaction flows.
