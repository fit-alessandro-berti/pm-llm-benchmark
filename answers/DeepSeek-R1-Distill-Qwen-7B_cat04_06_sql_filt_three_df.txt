Okay, I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that identifies cases in the event_log table which have a specific sequence of three activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in that exact order. Then, among these cases, I need to further refine the selection to only those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, I have to exclude these cases from the result set and return all events from the remaining cases.

First, I'll think about how to identify the sequence of events. I can use a window function to look at the previous two events in the same case. So, for each event, I'll check if the previous event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the one before that is 'Create Order'. This way, I can determine if the current event is the third in the sequence.

Next, I need to calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. I'll compute the timestamp difference and ensure it's more than 5 days. I'll have to convert this difference into days and compare it against 5.

After identifying the cases that meet both criteria, I need to exclude them from the final result. To do this, I'll use a subquery to filter out these cases. I'll group the events by case_id and check if any of the events in that group meet the sequence and time condition. If they do, I'll exclude the entire group from the result.

I should also consider the ordering of events within a case. Since I'm using a window function, I need to make sure that the events are ordered by timestamp to correctly identify the sequence.

Putting it all together, I'll write a SELECT statement that includes all events from event_log, excluding those cases where the sequence and time condition are met. I'll use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first identify the cases that need to be excluded and then join the original table with this CTE to filter out those cases.

I'll also have to handle duplicates and ensure that each case is only checked once. Using DISTINCT on case_id in the CTE should help with that.

Finally, I'll verify the query by testing it with sample data to make sure it works as intended.

To address the problem, we need to identify cases that contain a specific sequence of activities and exclude them from the final result. The solution involves using window functions and subqueries to filter out the desired cases.

### Solution Code

```sql
WITH 
    case_sequence AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp,
            
            -- Check if the current activity is the third in the sequence
            CASE 
                WHEN activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' THEN LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) IS NULL
                WHEN activity = 'Create Order' THEN LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
                WHEN activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'Create Order'
                ELSE NULL 
            END AS prev_two_activities,
            
            -- Calculate time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'
            DATEDIFF(timestamp, 
                     FILEREVERSE(LAG(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp))) AS time_diff
        FROM 
            event_log
    )
SELECT 
    e.* 
FROM 
    event_log e
JOIN 
    case_sequence cs 
ON 
    e.case_id = cs.case_id
    AND e.activity = cs.activity
    AND e.timestamp = cs.timestamp
    AND cs.time_diff > 5
    AND cs.prev_two_activities = 'Approve Purchase Requisition Create Order'
    AND (SELECT activity FROM case_sequence WHERE case_id = e.case_id) = 'Approve Purchase Requisition Create Order Confirm Order';
```

### Explanation

1. **Identify the Sequence**:
   - We use a CTE called `case_sequence` to examine each activity within a case.
   - For each activity, we check if the previous two activities form the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order'.
   - We also calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' to ensure it is more than 5 days.

2. **Filter Cases**:
   - We join the original `event_log` table with the `case_sequence` CTE to filter out cases that meet both criteria:
     - The case contains the specific sequence.
     - The time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

3. **Exclude Filtered Cases**:
   - The final result excludes events from cases that were identified in the `case_sequence` CTE, ensuring only events from cases that do not meet the criteria are returned.

This approach efficiently identifies and excludes the required cases while maintaining the integrity of the event log data.
