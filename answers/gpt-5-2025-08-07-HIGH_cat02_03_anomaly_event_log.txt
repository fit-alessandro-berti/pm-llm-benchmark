Below is a quick reference for the standard P2P flow, followed by case-by-case anomalies.

Typical P2P sequence (simplified best practice)
- Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  Approve PR  Issue Purchase Order (PO)  Receive Goods/Services (GR)  Vendor Invoice Received  3way match (PO–GR–Invoice)  Release Payment  Close

Case-by-case assessment

Case 1001
- Sequence: PR  PR approval  PO  GR  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close
- Assessment: Conforms to standard P2P. No anomalies.

Case 1002
- PO before PR approval: PO issued (2024-02-01 08:40) before PR was approved (2024-02-03 08:00).
  Why problematic: Bypasses authorization controls; creates risk of unauthorized spend (“maverick buying”).
- Payment before goods receipt and before 3-way match: Payment released (2024-02-03 07:15) before GR (2024-02-04 09:00) and before matching (2024-02-05 08:00).
  Why problematic: Violates 3way match control; risk of paying for items not received, incorrect quantities/prices, duplicate or fraudulent invoices.
- PR approved after payment: Approval occurs after funds have been committed and paid.
  Why problematic: Severe control breach; undermines approval as a preventive control and raises audit/SOX concerns.
- Invoice before goods: Invoice received prior to GR (2024-02-03 vs 2024-02-04).
  Note: Not inherently wrong (vendors can bill on shipment), but payment should be blocked until GR and match are complete. Here it wasn’t.

Case 1003
- Payment before invoice, goods receipt, and match: Payment released (2024-02-08) precedes invoice receipt (2024-02-09), GR (2024-02-10), and matching (2024-02-11).
  Why problematic: Indicates an unreferenced advance payment. While prepayments can be legitimate, they should follow a dedicated prepayment/downpayment process with specific approvals and liabilities tracking. Paying before having an invoice and proof of receipt is a high financial and fraud risk and a 3way match violation.
- 3way match after payment:
  Why problematic: Converts a preventive control into a detective one; raises risk of postpayment discrepancies with limited recovery options.

Case 1004
- Goods received before PO: GR (2024-02-06 09:00) occurs before PO issuance (2024-02-06 09:15).
  Why problematic: “Afterthefact PO”/retroactive ordering; terms and pricing were not agreed before receipt. Increases risk of price disputes, noncompliance with sourcing policies, and challenges in matching/approval integrity.
- Note: Invoice, match, and payment occur in the expected order after the PO is created; the main issue is the GR preceding the PO.

Why these patterns matter
- Control/compliance: Breaks in PR approval, PO-before-approval, and 3way match are classic audit findings (SOX/ISO/internal policy noncompliance).
- Financial risk: Paying prior to GR/match increases chances of overpayments, duplicate payments, and paying for undelivered or incorrect goods.
- Operational risk: Afterthefact POs and maverick buying erode negotiated terms, budget control, and spend visibility.

Summary of anomalies
- 1002: PO before PR approval; payment before GR and match; PR approval after payment.
- 1003: Payment before invoice, GR, and match (improper prepayment).
- 1004: Goods receipt before PO (afterthefact PO).
- 1001: No issues.
