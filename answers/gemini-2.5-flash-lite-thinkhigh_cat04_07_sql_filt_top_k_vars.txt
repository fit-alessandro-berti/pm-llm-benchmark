Okay, here's the DuckDB SQL query to achieve the specified tasks. We'll use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the logic step-by-step.

For demonstration purposes, let's assume `K = 5`. You can change the `LIMIT 5` clause to any desired value for K.

```sql
-- First, let's create a dummy event_log table for demonstration
-- In a real scenario, you would already have this table.
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS event_log;
-- CREATE TABLE event_log (
--     case_id INTEGER,
--     activity VARCHAR,
--     timestamp TIMESTAMP
-- );

-- INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
-- (1, 'A', '2023-01-01 08:00:00'),
-- (1, 'B', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
-- (1, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
-- (2, 'A', '2023-01-01 08:15:00'),
-- (2, 'B', '2023-01-01 09:30:00'),
-- (2, 'D', '2023-01-01 11:00:00'),
-- (3, 'A', '2023-01-01 08:30:00'),
-- (3, 'B', '2023-01-01 09:45:00'),
-- (3, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:15:00'),
-- (4, 'X', '2023-01-01 08:00:00'),
-- (4, 'Y', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
-- (4, 'Z', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
-- (5, 'A', '2023-01-01 08:00:00'),
-- (5, 'B', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
-- (5, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
-- (6, 'A', '2023-01-01 08:00:00'),
-- (6, 'B', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
-- (6, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
-- (7, 'X', '2023-01-01 08:00:00'),
-- (7, 'Y', '2023-01-01 09:00:00'),
-- (7, 'Z', '2023-01-01 10:00:00');

### Explanation:

1.  **`CaseSequences` CTE:**
    *   This CTE processes the `event_log` table.
    *   `GROUP BY case_id` ensures that we process events for each case independently.
    *   `ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp)` is a powerful DuckDB function. It aggregates all `activity` values for a given `case_id` into an array, and crucially, `ORDER BY timestamp` ensures the activities within the array are in chronological order, defining the process variant for that case.

2.  **`VariantFrequencies` CTE:**
    *   This CTE takes the `case_id` and its `activity_sequence` from `CaseSequences`.
    *   `GROUP BY activity_sequence` groups all cases that have the exact same ordered sequence of activities.
    *   `COUNT(DISTINCT case_id)` then counts how many unique cases fall into each unique process variant.

3.  **`TopKVariants` CTE:**
    *   This CTE takes the `variant_frequency` calculated in the previous step.
    *   `ORDER BY variant_frequency DESC` sorts the variants from most frequent to least frequent.
    *   `LIMIT 5` (or your chosen K) selects only the top K most frequent variants. The result here is a list of the unique ordered activity sequences that are most common.

4.  **`TopKCases` CTE:**
    *   This CTE identifies the specific `case_id`s that belong to the variants identified in `TopKVariants`.
    *   It joins `CaseSequences` (which maps `case_id` to `activity_sequence`) with `TopKVariants` (which lists the top sequences).
    *   `SELECT DISTINCT cs.case_id` ensures we get a unique list of all case IDs associated with any of the top K variants.

5.  **Final `SELECT` Statement:**
    *   This is the final output. It joins the original `event_log` table with the `TopKCases` CTE.
    *   The `INNER JOIN ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id` filters the `event_log` to include only those rows where the `case_id` is present in our list of top K cases.
    *   `el.*` selects all original columns from the `event_log` table for these filtered cases.
    *   The `ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp` at the end is added for better readability of the output, presenting events grouped by case and then chronologically within each case.
