What a fascinating dataset!

After analyzing the data, I've identified several unfair differences between the treatment of the "protected" group (first) and the "unprotected" group (second). Here are the main differences:

1. **Time taken for Extensive Screening**: The protected group (first) takes significantly longer to go through the Extensive Screening process, with an average time of 2.2 hours (1109506.950 vs. 830001.799 for the unprotected group). This suggests that the protected group is subject to more scrutiny and requires more thorough review.
2. **Number of tenant cancellations**: The unprotected group (second) has a higher number of tenant cancellations (35 instances) compared to the protected group (second) (5 instances). This implies that the protected group is more likely to have issues with tenants, leading to more cancellations.
3. **Processing time for Tenant Cancels Appartment**: The protected group (first) has a longer processing time for Tenant Cancels Appartment, with an average time of 6.5 hours (720057.800 vs. 609003.538 for the unprotected group).
4. **Additional screening**: The protected group (first) performs additional screening (Extensive Screening) that is not required for the unprotected group (second). This suggests that the protected group is being held to a higher standard due to their vulnerabilities.
5. **Increased complexity**: The unprotected group (second) has more complex processes, such as Extensive Screening and Tenant Cancels Appartment, which require more time and effort to complete. In contrast, the protected group (first) has simpler processes like View The Property and Set Appointment.

These findings suggest that the protected group (first) is being treated unfairly due to its vulnerabilities, which are being highlighted through the increased processing time, additional screening, and increased complexity of their processes.
