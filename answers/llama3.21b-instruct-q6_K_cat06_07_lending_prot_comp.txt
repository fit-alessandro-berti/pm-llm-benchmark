A fascinating example of a credit approval process!

After analyzing this output, I've identified several key differences between lending decisions and loan approvals:

**Decision-making frequencies:**

* Lends out `2709` times with an average frequency of 3 attempts, which indicates a successful decision in most cases.
* Rejects applications `3409` times, resulting in an average rejection rate of around 10%.
* Denies loans only once, which suggests that the loan is approved.

**Performance metrics:**

* `2709` requests led to a successful outcome (`Loan Approved`), while `1656` attempts resulted in rejections.
* An application was rejected due to `Verification Borrowers Information` failure. This implies that there were issues with verifying borrowers, which would typically lead to rejection.
* A loan was denied for various reasons, including not having co-signer (frequency: 23), not meeting underwriter expectations (frequency: 11).

**Reasons for rejection/decline:**

* Not enough credit history (`1641` applications that requested a smaller amount, implying they likely had good credit).
* Non-liquid income or other financial issues (`1555` applicants with no liquid assets listed on their application).
* Insufficient collateral or assets to secure the loan (`1456` applications without sufficient assets).

**Key takeaway:**

The lender's approach has two primary strategies:

1. **Success-oriented approach**: Lending out for more credit and higher-value loans, which seems to be working effectively since most successful outcomes are reflected in `Loan Approved`.
2. **Risk-averse approach**: Rejecting applications due to lack of liquid assets (`1555` cases), indicating a focus on prudence.

This highlights the importance of risk assessment, financial evaluation, and compliance with regulatory requirements when creating credit policies and underwriting procedures.
