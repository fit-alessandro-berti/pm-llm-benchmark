Starting from the initial state, the readings are low and steady—temperature, pressure, vibration, and flow all near zero, with minimal energy use. This suggests the machine is idle or in standby. That phase lasts for the first three events.

Then, at event 4, there's a sharp rise in temperature and vibration, along with a jump in material flow and tool position, and a significant increase in energy consumption. This points to an active machining process, likely cutting metal, where the tool engages material, generating heat and vibration. The pattern continues to climb through event 6, with temperature and vibration peaking, reinforcing the cutting operation.

After that peak, event 7 shows a drop in temperature and vibration, but tool position continues to advance and energy use remains elevated. This suggests the cutting phase has ended, but the machine is still moving the tool, possibly clearing the workpiece or transitioning. Event 8 confirms this—readings stabilize, indicating a brief pause or dwell in tool position.

Event 9 brings another sharp spike—temperature soars, vibration peaks, and energy use is highest. With no material flow, this isn't cutting but rather an intense localized operation, such as welding, where heat is generated without continuous material feed.

Event 10 drops back to low temperature and vibration, with no material flow and low energy—likely an inspection or measurement step, where the machine is stationary and sensors check the workpiece.

Events 11 and 12 show a gradual increase in tool position, small vibration, and steady material flow with moderate energy use. This pattern matches an assembly operation, where parts are positioned and joined at a controlled pace.

Finally, events 13-15 return to the initial low readings, marking the end of the cycle and a return to standby.

The inferred sequence is:
1. Idle/Standby
2. Cutting Metal
3. Tool Movement (Clearing/Positioning)
4. Welding
5. Quality Inspection
6. Assembling Parts
7. Idle/Standby
