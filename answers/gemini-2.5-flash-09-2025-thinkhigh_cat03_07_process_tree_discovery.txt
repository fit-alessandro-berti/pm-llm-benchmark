This Process Tree captures the mandatory sequential flow of the application handling process (RA $\rightarrow$ VF $\rightarrow$ AE $\rightarrow$ AD $\rightarrow$ SC $\rightarrow$ AC) while introducing an optional, repeatable loop structure between $AE$ and $AD$ to handle the requesting of missing information ($RMI$) and subsequent re-validation ($VF$).

The loop is defined such that when rework is performed, $RMI$ must occur at least once, but can be repeated multiple times, before the single necessary $VF$ (re-validation) occurs, and then the process chooses whether to proceed to $AD$ or repeat the rework block.

We define the sub-components first for clarity:

1.  **RMI Repetition ($RMI^+$):** Represents one or more executions of $RMI$.
    $$RMI\_Plus = \rightarrow ( 'RMI', * (\tau, 'RMI') )$$

2.  **Rework Block ($L$):** Represents the sequence of requesting missing info (RMI+) followed by the required re-validation (VF).
    $$L = \rightarrow ( RMI\_Plus, 'VF' )$$

3.  **Optional Rework Loop ($P_{Loop}$):** Allows zero or more executions of the Rework Block $L$. If executed zero times, we skip directly to $AD$.
    $$P_{Loop} = * (\tau, L)$$

4.  **Final Sequence ($T$):** Incorporates $P_{Loop}$ into the main process flow.

## **Final Process Tree Model:**

$$
\rightarrow (
    'RA',
    \rightarrow (
        'VF',
        \rightarrow (
            'AE',
            \rightarrow (
                P_{Loop},
                \rightarrow (
                    'AD',
                    \rightarrow (
                        'SC',
                        'AC'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
$$

Where $P_{Loop}$ is defined as:

$$
P_{Loop} = * (\tau, \rightarrow (
    \rightarrow (
        'RMI',
        * (\tau, 'RMI')
    ),
    'VF'
))
$$
