To create a temporal profile, we need a representation of how often each process step is executed and the associated duration.

Based on your input, I can describe some possible steps:

1. Create Fine -> Send Fine -> Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture: This sequence is executed 6 times.
2. Payment -> Send for Credit Collection -> Payment (frequency=45): It's repeated twice at a duration of approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes (1 hour + 8 min) each time, totaling 3 hours.

Let's construct this profile as follows:

- Frequency: 6
- Performance: 76229485.714

Here is the summary for the temporal profile:

The system processes about 6 times a day (at frequencies ranging from every 6 to 56 days depending on the sequence, including variations due to retries).

Note that actual durations and frequencies may vary in practice based on business logic, resources available, and other factors.
