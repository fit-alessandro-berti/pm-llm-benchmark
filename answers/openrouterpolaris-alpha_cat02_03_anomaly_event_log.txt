Here’s a concise, case-by-case analysis, based on standard P2P flow:

Typical expected P2P sequence (simplified):
- Create Purchase Requisition (PR)
- Approve PR
- Issue Purchase Order (PO)
- Receive Goods/Services
- Receive Vendor Invoice
- 3-way Match (PO, GR, Invoice)
- Release Payment
- Close Case

Case 1001 (Reference/Normal)
- Sequence is clean and logical: PR  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close.
- No anomalies; this is a good “baseline” case.

Case 1002 (Multiple anomalies)
Observed:
- Create PR  Issue PO  Vendor Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve PR  Receive Goods  Match  Close

Issues:
1) PO issued before PR approval
   - “Approve Purchase Requisition” happens AFTER “Issue Purchase Order.”
   - Problem: Bypasses authorization controls; commitments made without confirmed approval.

2) Invoice received and payment released before PR approval and before goods receipt
   - “Vendor Invoice Received” and “Release Payment” occur before:
     - PR approval
     - Goods receipt
     - 3-way match
   - Problem: High risk of:
     - Paying for unapproved, potentially non-compliant spend.
     - Paying before confirming delivery (overpayment, fraud risk, or undelivered goods).

3) Payment before 3-way match
   - Payment (2024-02-03 07:15) is made before “Match Invoice to PO” (2024-02-05).
   - Problem: Violates basic control that checks quantity, price, and receipt before payment.

4) Goods received after payment
   - “Receive Goods” is after “Release Payment.”
   - Problem: Poor leverage and risk of non-delivery; contradicts standard P2P control where receipt confirmation typically precedes or coincides with payment.

Case 1003 (Sequence integrity issues)
Observed:
- PR  Approval  PO  Release Payment  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match  Close

Issues:
1) Payment before invoice receipt
   - “Release Payment” (2024-02-08) occurs before “Vendor Invoice Received” (2024-02-09).
   - Problem: Paying without an invoice:
     - No formal claim from vendor.
     - No legal/financial documentation supporting payment.
     - Reconciliation and audit issues.

2) Payment before goods receipt and before 3-way match
   - Payment precedes “Receive Goods” and “Match Invoice to PO.”
   - Problem: Same control risk as Case 1002 (no confirmation of delivery, quantity, or price correctness).

3) 3-way match after payment
   - Matching after money is out significantly weakens the control; errors/fraud discovered too late.

Case 1004 (Significant process violation)
Observed:
- PR  Approval  Receive Goods  Issue PO  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close

Issues:
1) Goods received before PO is issued
   - “Receive Goods” occurs prior to “Issue Purchase Order.”
   - Problem:
     - Indicates maverick buying or verbal/unauthorized commitments.
     - No formal PO terms in place at time of delivery (price, quantity, T&Cs unclear).
     - Compliance and legal exposure.

2) Retrospective PO
   - Issuing PO after receipt suggests “backdating” documents to legitimize an already executed purchase.
   - Problem: Masks unauthorized procurement, undermines spend control and auditability.

Why these anomalies are problematic overall:
- Control and compliance risks:
  - Violations of segregation of duties and approval hierarchies.
  - Increased fraud risk and regulatory/audit findings.
- Financial risks:
  - Paying without proper documentation or confirmation can lead to overpayment, duplicate payment, or payment for goods never received.
- Operational and contractual risks:
  - Lack of formal PO at the right time weakens contractual protection (price, warranty, delivery terms).
- Data quality and process reliability:
  - Retroactive and out-of-order events make it hard to monitor performance, enforce policies, and trust reports.

In short:
- Case 1001: normal.
- Case 1002: multiple severe control breaches (approval after PO, payment before receipt/match).
- Case 1003: payment made too early (before invoice, receipt, and match).
- Case 1004: goods received before PO (retroactive PO; indicates uncontrolled purchasing).
