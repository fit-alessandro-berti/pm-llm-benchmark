The process described is essentially a system of fines and appeals that can be analyzed based on its timeline:

Timeline Overview:
- Date Appeal to Prefecture: Starts with an initial appeal from the prosecutor or justice, followed by notification.
  - Notification typically comes after a pre-appeal date.
- Send Appeal to Prefecture: The first step involves sending the fine notification to the prefecture's office. This is where the fines are actually sent to the individual. There may be additional penalties if notified earlier.
- Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture: Once the fine reaches the prefecture, it can be reviewed and potentially appealed.
  - Appeals will follow a standard procedure: typically involve reviewing the fine, determining if there's an error, or being unable to collect.
  - Appeals typically result in either approval, denial (indicating that the case does not merit further appeal), or refusal, which means no further action is taken.

- Send Appeal to Prefecture again: In this step, a new appeal is made to the prefecture. The old fine notification can be updated and sent.
- Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture: After the appeal results, the appeals process typically involves reviewing all affected information to determine if any adjustments need to be made. If necessary, further steps may follow.

- Send Appeal to Prefecture again (if needed): After making any changes or findings, it's important for prefectures to update their notification and appeal processes.
  
- Proceed with Appeals: In the final step, an individual can make new appeals of their fine or other charges if they believe there are further issues. This would involve sending the updated notifications and potentially reviewing all information again.

In summary:

- Timeline starts with a notification from the prefecture that triggers the fine process.
- The notification leads to review by prefectures. Appeals occur after initial notification, but before any decision is made.
- Appellations generally follow the standard appeal processes outlined above, with possible further adjustments or appeals needed when necessary.

The timeline for each step may vary, especially as new technologies and digital platforms make it easier to send notifications and conduct appeals.
