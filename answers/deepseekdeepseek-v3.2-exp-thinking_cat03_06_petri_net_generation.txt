We are going to model the insurance claim process as described.
 Steps:
 1. Create the Petri net and the necessary places and transitions.
 2. Connect them with arcs to model the control flow, including the loops for re-submission and in-depth investigation.
 3. Set the initial marking (one token in the start place) and the final marking (one token in the end place).

 We note the following activities (transitions) and the need for places in between:

 The process starts with a token in the place representing the initial state (before the claim is registered).

 Steps and their corresponding transitions (with labels as given):
   - Claim Registration (CR)
   - Document Verification (DV)
   - Fraud Check (FC)
   - Claim Assessment (CA)
   - Approval (AP) [conditional: only if the amount is above threshold]
   - Payment (P)
   - Notification (N)
   - Closure (CL)

 Additionally, we have two loops:
   - After Document Verification (DV), if documents are incomplete, we have Re-Document Submission (RDS) and then go back to DV.
   - After Fraud Check (FC), if doubts are raised, we have In-depth Investigation (II) and then go back to FC.

 We also note that the Approval (AP) step is conditional. We can model this by having two outcomes from CA: one that requires approval and one that doesn't.
 However, the problem states: "The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So we can model two transitions after CA: 
   - one for when the amount is below the threshold (so we skip AP) and 
   - one for when the amount is above (so we go to AP).

 But note: the problem does not specify two separate activities for below and above threshold. So we can model the conditional routing with a silent transition (or two transitions, one labeled and one silent) and a place that leads to AP or directly to P.

 However, let's stick to the given activities and model the conditional branching with a silent transition (since the problem does not specify an activity for the case when approval is not needed).

 Alternatively, we can have:
   - After CA, we have a silent transition (tau) for the case of no approval needed, and the AP transition for the case of approval needed.

 But note: the problem says "if the amount surpasses a certain threshold" then AP is required. So we can model:

   CA -> place1 -> (AP) -> place2 -> P
   CA -> place1 -> (tau) -> place2 -> P

 However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for the non-approval path, so we use a silent transition.

 Let's break down the places we need:

   start (initial place) -> CR -> place_after_CR -> DV -> place_after_DV -> FC -> place_after_FC -> CA -> place_after_CA

 Now, from place_after_CA, we have two transitions: 
   - AP (if approval is needed) and 
   - a silent transition (skip_approval) if not.

 Both AP and skip_approval lead to the same place (place_after_approval) which then goes to P.

 Then: P -> place_after_P -> N -> place_after_N -> CL -> end (final place)

 For the loops:

   - The loop for DV and RDS: 
        We have after DV a place (place_after_DV) that leads to FC and also to RDS (if documents are incomplete). 
        But note: the problem says "if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues". 
        So we can model:

          DV -> place_after_DV -> (if incomplete) RDS -> place_after_RDS -> (loop back to) DV

        But note: the process must also be able to continue from place_after_DV to FC. So we need a choice at place_after_DV.

        We can model this by having two transitions from place_after_DV: 
          - one silent transition (tau) for the case of complete documents (then go to FC) and 
          - one transition RDS for the case of incomplete.

        Then RDS leads to a place that goes back to DV.

   - Similarly, for FC and II:

          FC -> place_after_FC -> (if doubts) II -> place_after_II -> (loop back to) FC

        And a silent transition from place_after_FC to CA for the case of no doubts.

 However, note that the problem says "this can happen multiple times", so we are modeling loops.

 Let's define the places and transitions:

 Places (we'll give them descriptive names):

   p0: start (initial place)
   p1: after_CR
   p2: after_DV  (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to RDS and one silent to FC)
   p3: after_RDS (this place goes back to DV)
   p4: after_FC  (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to II and one silent to CA)
   p5: after_II  (this place goes back to FC)
   p6: after_CA  (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to AP and one silent to the next step after approval)
   p7: after_approval (this place is after AP or the silent transition from p6)
   p8: after_P
   p9: after_N
   p10: end (final place)

 Transitions (with labels, except the silent ones):

   CR: "Claim Registration"
   DV: "Document Verification"
   RDS: "Re-Document Submission"
   FC: "Fraud Check"
   II: "In-depth Investigation"
   CA: "Claim Assessment"
   AP: "Approval"
   skip_approval: None (silent)
   P: "Payment"
   N: "Notification"
   CL: "Closure"

 We also need two silent transitions for the choices after DV and after FC:

   skip_RDS: None (silent) - from p2 to p4 (if documents are complete, then go to FC)
   skip_II: None (silent) - from p4 to p6 (if no doubts, then go to CA)

 But note: the problem says the process continues after DV to FC, and after FC to CA, unless there is a loop. So we model the loops as optional and the silent transitions as the way to skip the loop.

 Now, let's code accordingly.

 Steps in code:

 1. Import necessary modules.
 2. Create a Petri net.
 3. Create places and transitions.
 4. Add them to the net.
 5. Connect them with arcs.
 6. Set initial and final markings.

 Note: We are using `pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils` for adding arcs and removing places (if needed) but in this example we don't remove places.

 Let's code accordingly.

Here's the Python code to construct the accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance_Claim_Management")

# Create places (states)
p_start = PetriNet.Place(name="start")
p_after_cr = PetriNet.Place(name="after_claim_registration")
p_after_dv = PetriNet.Place(name="after_document_verification")
p_after_fc = PetriNet.Place(name="after_fraud_check")
p_after_ca = PetriNet.Place(name="after_claim_assessment")
p_after_ap = PetriNet.Place(name="after_approval")
p_after_p = PetriNet.Place(name="after_payment")
p_after_n = PetriNet.Place(name="after_notification")
p_end = PetriNet.Place(name="end")

# Add all places to the net
places = [p_start, p_after_cr, p_after_dv, p_after_fc, p_after_ca, 
          p_after_ap, p_after_p, p_after_n, p_end]
for place in places:
    net.places.add(place)

# Create transitions (activities)
t_cr = PetriNet.Transition(name="claim_registration", label="Claim Registration")
t_dv = PetriNet.Transition(name="document_verification", label="Document Verification")
t_fc = PetriNet.Transition(name="fraud_check", label="Fraud Check")
t_ca = PetriNet.Transition(name="claim_assessment", label="Claim Assessment")
t_ap = PetriNet.Transition(name="approval", label="Approval")
t_p = PetriNet.Transition(name="payment", label="Payment")
t_n = PetriNet.Transition(name="notification", label="Notification")
t_cl = PetriNet.Transition(name="closure", label="Closure")

# Create transitions for loops
t_rds = PetriNet.Transition(name="re_document_submission", label="Re-Document Submission")
t_ii = PetriNet.Transition(name="in_depth_investigation", label="In-depth Investigation")

# Add all transitions to the net
transitions = [t_cr, t_dv, t_fc, t_ca, t_ap, t_p, t_n, t_cl, t_rds, t_ii]
for transition in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(transition)

# Main flow arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_start, t_cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_cr, p_after_cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_cr, t_dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_dv, p_after_dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_dv, t_fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_fc, p_after_fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_fc, t_ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ca, p_after_ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ca, t_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ap, p_after_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_ap, t_p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_p, p_after_p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_p, t_n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_n, p_after_n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_n, t_cl, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_cl, p_end, net)

# Loop for document re-submission (between DV and RDS)
p_dv_loop = PetriNet.Place(name="dv_loop_place")
net.places.add(p_dv_loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_dv, t_rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_rds, p_dv_loop, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_dv_loop, t_dv, net)

# Loop for in-depth investigation (between FC and II)
p_fc_loop = PetriNet.Place(name="fc_loop_place")
net.places.add(p_fc_loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_fc, t_ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ii, p_fc_loop, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_fc_loop, t_fc, net)

# Set initial and final markings
im = Marking()
im[p_start] = 1

fm = Marking()
fm[p_end] = 1

print("Accepting Petri net created successfully!")
print(f"Initial marking: {im}")
print(f"Final marking: {fm}")
```

This Petri net models the insurance claim management process with:

1. **Main sequential flow**: The core process from claim registration through closure
2. **Document re-submission loop**: If documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), the process can loop back through Re-Document Submission (RDS) before continuing to Fraud Check (FC)
3. **In-depth investigation loop**: If Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, the process can loop back through In-depth Investigation (II) before continuing to Claim Assessment (CA)

The initial marking has one token in the "start" place, representing a new claim arriving. The final marking has one token in the "end" place, representing a successfully closed claim. The loops allow for multiple iterations of document re-submission and in-depth investigation as needed in the process.
