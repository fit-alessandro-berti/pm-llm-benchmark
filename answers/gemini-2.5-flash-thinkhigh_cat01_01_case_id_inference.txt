Based on the provided event attributes, especially `patient_age` and `patient_gender` which remain constant for a given patient journey, and the logical sequence of activities (e.g., Register -> Triage -> Lab/Imaging -> Consultation -> Discharge, or Register -> Consultation -> Surgery Prep -> Surgery -> Recovery -> Discharge), we can group the events into three distinct cases:

---
