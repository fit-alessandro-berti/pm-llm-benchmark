Below is a list of targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee to clarify and deepen my understanding of the property onboarding process. These questions are grouped thematically for clarity, focusing on uncovering missing details (e.g., specific criteria or steps), decision criteria, roles and responsibilities, timing and sequencing, and exception handling. They are designed to be conversational and exploratory, building on the description provided.

### Initial Contact and Documentation Review
1. Can you walk me through what typically happens in the initial contact between the landlord and the regional office—such as how the request is logged and what initial information the landlord is asked to provide right away?
2. How does the property coordinator determine if documentation like deeds, compliance certificates, or inspection reports is "outdated" or insufficient, and what kinds of follow-up processes are in place if updates are requested from the landlord?
3. What other types of documentation or information might the coordinator review beyond what's mentioned, and how do they handle cases where landlords are unresponsive or provide incomplete submissions?

### Recording Property Details and Assignment of Property Manager
4. When recording property details into the central database, what additional attributes or data points (beyond square footage, units, location, amenities, and pricing) are typically captured, and how is the accuracy of this information verified?
5. How do you weigh the different factors—like a manager's workload, geographic specialization, experience with property types, or track record with unique landlord requirements—when assigning a property manager, and are there any formal scoring or prioritization methods used?
6. Who is ultimately responsible for approving the property manager assignment, and what happens if the initially assigned manager is unavailable or if the landlord has preferences for a different manager?

### Introductory Meeting and Alignment
7. During the introductory call or meeting between the property manager and landlord, what are the most common special conditions or policies discussed (e.g., pets, maintenance, payments), and how are any disagreements resolved at this stage?
8. How long does this introductory step typically take after assignment, and what role does the property coordinator play in facilitating it?

### Inspection, Photography, and Issue Resolution
9. What criteria does the property manager use to select a professional photographer and certified inspector, and how are their schedules coordinated with the landlord's availability?
10. If the inspector's report identifies issues, can you describe the typical sequence of steps the property manager takes to address them—such as prioritizing safety versus cosmetic fixes—and how the landlord's involvement influences the timeline?
11. In cases where repairs require hiring contractors, who decides on the contractors, and how are costs shared or approved between the company and the landlord?

### Marketing, Activation, and Tenant Screening
12. How does the digital marketing team collaborate with the property manager to create online listings and brochures, and what market data or trends are considered when updating internal pricing models?
13. Once the property is activated in the rental portal, what is the typical timeline for it becoming visible to prospective tenants, and who oversees any final checks before activation?
14. During tenant screening, how do you handle the complexity of multiple interested applicants—such as what negotiation tactics are used for lease terms or discounts, and what criteria prioritize certain tenants (e.g., longer lease commitments)?
15. Who specifically runs the credit checks, employment verifications, and reference calls during screening, and how is sensitive tenant information protected throughout the process?

### Lease Finalization, Quality Checks, and Overall Process
16. After selecting a tenant, what steps does the property manager take to finalize the lease agreement and collect the security deposit, and how flexible is the move-in scheduling based on tenant or landlord needs?
17. Can you explain the roles of the compliance officer, financial analyst, and IT department in the quality checks and audits—what specific aspects do they review, and in what order do these reviews typically occur relative to lease signing?
18. Throughout the onboarding process, how are exceptions like special insurance requirements or custom lease clauses identified and managed, and who has the authority to approve deviations from standard procedures?
19. What tools or methods (beyond email, CRMs, and project management software) are used to track communication and progress across regional offices, landlords, managers, and support teams, and how do you ensure all stakeholders stay aligned during delays?
20. Overall, how long does the entire onboarding process usually take from initial contact to move-in, and what are the most common bottlenecks or variations in timing based on property type or location?
