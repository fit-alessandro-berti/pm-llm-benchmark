. **Component Sourcing Strategy**: Why is component sourcing parallelized across four distinct geographic regions, and how does this approach balance risk mitigation against logistical complexity?  

2. **Assembly Location Rationale**: What factors influenced the choice of Malaysia for assembly, and how do labor costs, infrastructure, and trade policies impact this decision?  

3. **24/7 Assembly Implications**: What are the operational, quality control, and ethical trade-offs of running a 24/7 assembly line, and how does this align with global labor standards?  

4. **Quality Gate Thresholds**: At what specific quality fail rate does the process trigger rework instead of scrap, and how are these thresholds dynamically adjusted based on real-time production data?  

5. **Shipping Mode Optimization**: Air freight targets high-demand markets while cargo ship serves others. How is demand volatility quantified to dictate shipping mode, and what KPIs validate this split?  

6. **Customs Compliance Risks**: With components sourced from 5+ countries and distributed to 4 regional centers, what compliance bottlenecks are anticipated, and how are they mitigated proactively?  

7. **Stakeholder Information Flow**: How does real-time data (e.g., shipment delays, quality failures) propagate between suppliers, the assembly plant, and distributors without causing misalignment?  

8. **Inventory Forecasting Accuracy**: What tools or algorithms predict sales spikes or dips, and how quickly can the process adjust supplier orders to avoid overstock/stockouts?  

9. **Rework/Scrap Decision-Making**: Beyond quality metrics, what cost-benefit analysis determines whether a failed unit reenters assembly or is scrapped? How are sustainability considerations factored in?  

10. **Parallel Distribution Efficiency**: Why are distribution tasks (warehousing, retail delivery, e-commerce, VIP shipments) split in parallel rather than sequenced, and where do resource inequities arise?  

11. **Geopolitical Risk Mitigation**: How does the process respond to sudden trade restrictions (e.g., tariffs, embargoes) on component sources like Taiwan or South Korea?  

12. **Customer Experience Trade-offs**: How are air-freight premiums for high-demand markets balanced against cost targets to maintain competitive pricing, and who bears these costs?  

13. **Performance Metrics Design**: Beyond time/cost, what environmental KPIs (carbon footprint, e-waste) should be tracked for end-to-end process optimization?  

14. **Supplier Collaboration Synchronization**: How are delivery timelines coordinated between four component suppliers, and what delays cascade if one fails to meet deadlines?  

15. **Regulatory Adaptation**: As GDPR, FCC, or local safety standards evolve, what mechanisms ensure compliance updates propagate through customs, distribution, and QA steps?  

16. **Technology Integration Gaps**: Where in the process (e.g., real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance) does lack of IoT/automation create blind spots visibility?  

17. **Market Research Feedback Loop**: How do sales data from regional distributors inform the initial product design in R&D, and what delays disconnect these cycles?  

18. **Cost Innovation Pressure**: With parallel tasks, where are redundant inefficiencies (e.g., duplicated customs filings, fragmented packaging lines), and how can they be consolidated?  

19. **Stakeholder Conflict Resolution**: When air-freight priority conflicts with VIP/pre-order shipments, how are trade-offs decided between revenue targets and customer equity?  

20. **Disaster Contingency Planning**: What scenario-based simulations test resilience against black-swan events (e.g., assembly plant fire, pandemic shipping shutdowns), and how often are they reviewed?
