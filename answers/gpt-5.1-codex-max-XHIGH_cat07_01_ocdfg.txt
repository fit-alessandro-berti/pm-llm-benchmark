It’s a processflow diagram showing how different kinds of order records move through a business workflow. Across the top are five starting points for VendorInvoiceItems, ReturnOrderItems, PurchaseRequisitionItems, SalesOrderItems and PurchaseOrderItems, each with a “Start” node and a count of objects. From there, colored arrows connect activity boxes such as “Create Requisition,” “Approve Requisition,” “Send Order,” “Check Stock,” “Process Return,” “Approve Payment,” “Create Invoice,” “Create Order,” “Pack Goods,” “Ship Goods,” “Confirm Delivery” and “Close Order,” with “End” nodes at the bottom. Each box includes an overall volume (e.g. “Overall: 5.7M” for Approve Requisition), and the arrows are annotated with typical elapsed times in milliseconds between steps.
