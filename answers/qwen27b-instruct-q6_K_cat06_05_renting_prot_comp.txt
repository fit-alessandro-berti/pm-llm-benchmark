Based on the process variants provided, it is apparent that there are several key differences across the two groups:

### Protected Group:
This group focuses on a comprehensive and structured leasing process with additional screening measures for prospective tenants before signing contracts.

- **Extended Screening:** Some processes in this group include 'Extensive Screening' (or similar) of prospective tenants as part of their evaluation, which is not evident in the unprotected group.
  
- **Tenant Management:** The protected group includes scenarios like 'Pay Rent' and handling instances where a tenant cancels the apartment. This suggests they have mechanisms for managing payments and tenancy cancellations.
    
### Unprotected Group:
The unprotected group lacks these extended steps such as extensive screening or specific measures to handle cancellations, indicating potentially a more streamlined process with less emphasis on deep tenant vetting.

- **Lack of Extensive Screening:** Most processes in this group do not include the 'Extensive Screening' phase for prospective tenants.
    
- **Tenant Cancellations:** The unprotected group also has variations where tenants might cancel their apartment after signing contracts, without going through a specific process as seen in the protected group. This could imply more casual or informal handling of cancellations.

### Key Differences:
1. **Screening Depth**: The presence of 'Extensive Screening' indicates that the protected group is taking greater precautions to ensure tenant suitability.
2. **Tenant Management Processes**: The ability to manage and handle tenant payments and cancellations directly suggests a more proactive approach in dealing with tenants, which could lead to better documentation, less disputes, and possibly higher tenant satisfaction rates.
3. **Process Complexity**: The presence of 'Miss Rent Payment', 'Issue Warning', and 'Evict Tenant' steps implies that the protected group has clear protocols for dealing with potential lease violations or breaches by tenants. This adds complexity but also provides a robust system for managing non-compliance.

### Implications:
The differences likely impact how the two groups handle risk, operational efficiency, tenant satisfaction, and possibly revenue stability. The protected processes aim to mitigate risks associated with tenant behavior through thorough vetting and clear procedures for handling issues, while the unprotected processes might operate more efficiently but potentially face higher variability in outcomes related to tenant management.
