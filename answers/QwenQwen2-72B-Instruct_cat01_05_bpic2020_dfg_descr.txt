The process described in this data appears to be a workflow for handling declarations and payments in an organizational setting, likely a business or a governmental institution. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the process:

1. **Initiation:**
   - Employee submits a declaration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) which is the starting point of the workflow.

2. **Approval Path 1 (Primary Path):**
   - The declaration is approved by the administration (`Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION`).
   - In some cases, the declaration is then approved by the budget owner (`Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER`) before the supervisor's final approval (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - Once the supervisor approves, the process moves to payment handling (`Request Payment` to `Payment Handled`).

3. **Approval Path 2 (Alternative Route):**
   - Some declarations might bypass approval by the budget owner and go straight to the supervisor for final approval from the administration (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` follows directly to `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`).
   - There is also a route through a pre-approver (`Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER`) before supervisor's final approval.

4. **Rejection Handling:**
   - There are several points of rejection in the process: by the employee (`Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`), administration (`Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION`), pre-approver (`Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`), budget owner (`Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER`), supervisor (`Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR`), and by MISSING which possibly represents a missing entity in the process.
   - Upon rejection, the declaration often returns to the employee to correct and resubmit (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`).

5. **Payment Rejection and Recurrence:**
   - If a payment is rejected, it does not return to any previous state but instead might trigger a declaration rejection by MISSING (`Payment Handled` to `Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`), implying an issue that is beyond the scope of the normal workflow and requires restarting the process.

6. **Exceptional Cases:**
   - Some rare events are also recorded like declarations being saved by the employee directly leading to a payment request or rejections leading to resubmission from unexpected states.

The `performance` figures likely represent the average time taken for transitions between states, and the `frequency` indicates how many times that specific path has been taken. The time
