Based on my analysis of the event log, I've identified four distinct high-level process steps that represent the manufacturing workflow. Here's my proposed grouping:

## High-Level Process Steps

### 1. **Material Preparation**
**Low-level events included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:** These events represent the initial setup phase where raw materials are prepared for processing. They share several characteristics:
- They occur sequentially at the beginning of each case
- They involve preparing the metal sheet for subsequent operations
- They include both manual operations (by Operator A) and automated processes (Robot Arm, Heating Unit)
- The preheating step is the final preparation before actual manufacturing begins

### 2. **Welding Assembly**
**Low-level events included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:** This group represents the core assembly operation where the product is physically created through welding:
- All activities are performed by the same operator (Operator B)
- They involve the actual joining/assembly of materials
- The sequence is tool preparation followed by the welding operations
- These events transform the prepared material into a semi-finished product

### 3. **Surface Treatment**
**Low-level events included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:** These events constitute the post-assembly treatment phase:
- Both activities relate to applying and curing a protective surface layer
- They use specialized equipment (Coating Unit, Heating Unit)
- This phase protects the welded assembly from environmental factors
- The activities are automated and occur in immediate sequence

### 4. **Quality Inspection**
**Low-level events included:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Rationale:** This group encompasses all quality assurance activities:
- Both events verify the quality of the completed work
- They occur at strategic points (after welding and after coating)
- They involve different inspection methods (automated sensor and human visual inspection)
- These are critical decision points that determine if the product meets standards

    },
    {

      "purpose": "Join metal components through welding"
    },
    {
      "name": "Surface Treatment",
      "start_event": "Apply protective coating",
      "end_event": "Dry coating",
      "typical_duration": "20-25 seconds",
      "resources_involved": ["Coating Unit #3", "Heating Unit #2"],
      "purpose": "Apply protective finish to welded assembly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Quality Inspection",
      "events": ["Measure weld integrity", "Visual check"],
      "typical_duration": "10-15 seconds per inspection",
      "resources_involved": ["Quality Sensor #1", "Operator C"],
      "purpose": "Verify product quality at critical stages"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Process Flow Visualization

The manufacturing process follows this sequence:

```
Material Preparation  Welding Assembly  Quality Inspection (Weld)  Surface Treatment  Quality Inspection (Final)
```

Note that Quality Inspection occurs at two points:
1. After welding (automated measurement of weld integrity)
2. After surface treatment (visual inspection by operator)

This grouping strategy transforms 12 low-level events into 4 meaningful high-level activities, making the manufacturing process much easier to understand and analyze at a strategic level.
