To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the event log data provided and hypothesize potential causes for these anomalies, we will systematically analyze the data with respect to the standard process flow.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Standard Process Flow Verification:**
   - Ensure events for each case follow the standard process order: 
     1. Register Order (Sales)
     2. Perform Credit Check (Finance)
     3. Validate Stock (Warehouse)
     4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics)
     5. Ship Goods (Logistics)
     6. Issue Invoice (Finance)
     7. Receive Payment (Finance)

2. **Identify Deviations:**
   - Identify cases where events are out of order.
   - Identify missing activities within cases.
   - Check for premature or overdue activities (e.g., shipment before stock validation).

3. **Anomalous Event Patterns:**
   - Evaluate patterns and detect inconsistencies.
   - Evaluate timestamps to check for potentially overlapping or extremely rapid sequences of events.

### Potential SQL Queries to Investigate Anomalies

#### 1. Identify Cases with Events Out of Order:
To find cases where activities deviated from the standard order, we can check for discrepancies in the sequence of event timestamps against the expected order.

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        event_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as seq_num
    FROM order_event_log
),
activity_order AS (
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER () as expected_seq_num,
        activity
    FROM (
        VALUES 
            ('Register Order'),
            ('Perform Credit Check'),
            ('Validate Stock'),
            ('Confirm Shipment'),
            ('Ship Goods'),
            ('Issue Invoice'),
            ('Receive Payment')
    ) as standard_process(activity)
)
SELECT
    ol.case_id,
    ae.activity AS actual_activity,
    ao.activity AS expected_activity,
    ol.timestamp
FROM
    ordered_events ol
    JOIN activity_order ao ON ol.seq_num = ao.expected_seq_num
    AND ol.activity != ao.activity
ORDER BY
    ol.case_id,
    ol.timestamp;
```

#### 2. Identify Cases with Missing Activities:
To find cases with missing activities compared with the standard flow:

```sql
SELECT
    ol.case_id,
    sp.activity AS missing_activity
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ol
CROSS JOIN
    (
        VALUES 
            ('Register Order'),
            ('Perform Credit Check'),
            ('Validate Stock'),
            ('Confirm Shipment'),
            ('Ship Goods'),
            ('Issue Invoice'),
            ('Receive Payment')
    ) AS sp(activity)
LEFT JOIN
    order_event_log el ON ol.case_id = el.case_id AND el.activity = sp.activity
WHERE
    el.activity IS NULL
ORDER BY
    ol.case_id,
    missing_activity;
```

#### 3. Identify Transactions Completed Prematurely or Overly Delayed:
Check for cases where activities like shipment are completed before necessary validations.

```sql
WITH timestamps AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN timestamp END) AS stock_validation_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN timestamp END) AS shipment_time
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT
    case_id,
    stock_validation_time,
    shipment_time
FROM timestamps
WHERE
    stock_validation_time > shipment_time;
```

### Hypotheses for Identified Anomalies

1. **System Errors:**
   - Possible reasons include technical glitches where events were logged incorrectly.

2. **Policy Violations:**
   - Departments or individuals bypassing standard procedures for hurried processing.
   
3. **Training or User Errors:**
   - Unfamiliarity with the system or process steps leading to mis-steps.
   
4. **Operational Issues:**
   - Overburdened or understaffed departments handling steps out of order to manage workload.

5. **Fraudulent or Unauthorized Actions:**
   - Intentional deviations to expedite certain cases for personal gain or client pressures.

### Next Steps

- Run the provided SQL queries and analyze more specifically which cases and activities are anomalies.
- Validate and discuss findings with respective departments to understand underlying root causes.

By following these steps and queries, further detailed insights and understanding of anomalies in the order processing workflow can be achieved.
