**Redesigned Pseudo-BPMN for Enhanced Flexibility and Efficiency:**

```

       --> [If Highly Standardized] Task A1: "Fast Track Standard Validation"
           --> Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date" --> End Event

       --> [If Partially or Highly Custom] Task B: "Detailed Request Analysis"

                            --> [If Low Complexity] Task H3: "Assign Junior Assistant"

               --> Task I: "Obtain Necessary Resources and Schedule"

**Discussion on Changes:**

1. **Initial Screening**: Introduced a new gateway to quickly categorize requests into standard, partially custom, or highly custom based on predefined criteria. This allows for immediate routing of straightforward requests (Fast Track Standard Validation) and prioritizes complex ones for detailed analysis.

2. **Detailed Request Analysis & Predictive Feasibility Check**: For custom or partly custom requests, a detailed analysis subprocess is initiated. Within this, predictive analytics can be leveraged to assess feasibility early on, potentially saving time by identifying infeasible customizations at the outset.

3. **Dynamic Resource Allocation & Subprocess (Resource Optimization)**: This allows for more efficient use of human resources based on the complexity of the task. By using ML-driven estimates, less skilled personnel can handle straightforward aspects while senior specialists focus on intricate elements. 

4. **Dynamic Approval Routing**: Introduced to streamline the approval process. Depending on factors like request urgency and value, approvals are routed through different channels (emergency, regular, or automated), reducing bottlenecks and expediting decisions for high-value requests.

5. **Predictive Analytics Integration**: Predictive models can be integrated throughout the process – from initial screening to feasibility checks and resource allocation – providing insights that drive proactive decision-making and improve overall efficiency.

**Effects on Performance, Customer Satisfaction & Operational Complexity:**

- **Performance**: By automating parts of the process (e.g., using ML for feasibility checks, automated approvals), response times should decrease, and resource utilization increase, thereby improving throughput. 

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Faster turnaround times and more accurate handling of custom requests through predictive analytics can enhance customer experience, especially for complex, high-value orders.

- **Operational Complexity**: The introduction of subprocesses and ML-driven decision points adds a layer of sophistication. This might initially increase setup complexity but should ultimately lead to better scalability and adaptability in dealing with diverse request types efficiently. Proper implementation and clear communication of these new workflows will be crucial for successful transition.
