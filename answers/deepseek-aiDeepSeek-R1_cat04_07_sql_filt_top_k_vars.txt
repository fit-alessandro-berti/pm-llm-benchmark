<think>
Okay, let's tackle this SQL problem step by step. So, the task is to write a DuckDB query that identifies the top K process variants based on their frequency and then returns all events from cases that belong to those variants. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what a process variant is. Oh right, it's the ordered sequence of activities per case, ordered by timestamp. So for each case_id, I have to list all activities in the order they occurred. Then group all cases with the same sequence together, count them, find the top K by count, and finally get all their events.

Step 1: Get the ordered sequence per case. That means for each case_id, aggregate the activities in the order of their timestamps. Maybe use GROUP_CONCAT or some string aggregation function. In DuckDB, if I remember correctly, the function is STRING_AGG. So, group by case_id, order by timestamp, and aggregate the activities into a string. That gives each case's variant.

So first, create a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the variant for each case. Something like:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)

Yes, that should get each case's sequence as a comma-separated string.

Next, count how many cases per variant. So group by variant and count case_ids. Then rank them by the count in descending order to find the top K. Let's say K is 5, but in the query, we can make it a parameter.

Another CTE could be variant_counts, which counts each variant's occurrences. Like:

variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant,
    COUNT(case_id) as case_count
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
)

Then, to get the top K variants, perhaps use ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() ordered by case_count descending. Alternatively, use DENSE_RANK? But to just get the top K, maybe a window function with ORDER BY case_count DESC.

But wait, what if there's a tie? Like the Kth position has multiple variants with the same count. The problem says "top K variants by frequency", which might require including all variants that are in the top K ranks. So using RANK() might include ties. For example, if K is 3 and there are two variants with the second-highest count, they'd both be included.

But the problem statement says "top K variants by their frequency". So perhaps we can use LIMIT K, but then if there's a tie for the Kth position, it would exclude the ties. Hmm. Maybe the user wants the top K by frequency, regardless of ties. Or perhaps the exact K. Wait, the problem statement says "determine the top K variants by their frequency". The exact approach might depend on the exact requirements, but since the prompt doesn't specify handling ties, maybe we proceed with the top K ordered by count descending, using LIMIT K. However, that's problematic because if multiple variants have the same count as the K-th one, they won't be included. But perhaps the problem expects to use that method. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps rank them using DENSE_RANK or RANK and then pick all variants where the rank <= K. For example:

top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant,
    case_count,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rank
  FROM variant_counts
)
SELECT variant
FROM top_variants
WHERE rank <= K

But RANK() would leave gaps. For example, if the first two have the same count, they are rank 1, and the next is rank 3. If K is 2, then rank <=2 would only pick the first two. But DENSE_RANK would create contiguous ranks. Alternatively, use DENSE_RANK. Hmm, maybe the problem expects using ROW_NUMBER, but that will break ties. So perhaps in the problem statement, they just want the top K variants ordered by case_count, without considering ties. So in that case, using LIMIT K.

Wait, but how do we handle ties? For example, if the top two variants have the same count, and K=1, which one is selected? The problem statement says "top K variants by their frequency", so frequency (count) is the key. So if there are multiple variants with the same count, they would all be part of the same rank.

This might require a different approach. Let's see. If we have:

variant_counts as (
  select variant, case_count,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rnk
  from ...
)

Then, selecting variants where rnk <= K. But this depends on how duplicates are handled. For example, if K=1, and multiple variants have the highest count, they all get rnk=1 and are included.

But the problem statement says "the top K variants by their frequency". So if K=3 and there are three variants with the same highest count, and K=3, would they all be part of the top 3? Probably yes. But perhaps the user wants exactly K distinct variants. The problem is ambiguous here. However, the problem's fourth step says "cases not in the top K variants should be excluded". So, if multiple variants are tied at the Kth position, they should all be included. Thus, the correct approach is to use DENSE_RANK and select all variants with rank <= K.

Wait, using DENSE_RANK, if K=3, and three variants have the same highest count, they would all be rank 1, so selecting rank <=3 would include them. But also any that are rank 2 and 3. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, DENSE_RANK assigns ranks without gaps. For example:

If case_counts are 10,10,9,8,8,7.

RANK() would assign 1,1,3,4,4,6.

DENSE_RANK would assign 1,1,2,3,3,4.

If we want top K=2, then K=2 would include the first two variants (ranks 1 and 2), but with DENSE_RANK, the third variant (case_count 9) would be rank 2. So if using DENSE_RANK and K=2, we get all variants with rank <=2, which are those with case_count 10,9.

But in terms of the actual number of variants, we'd have more than K variants if there are ties.

Hmm, perhaps the problem wants exactly the K most frequent variants, even if there are ties. For example, if K=3, and the third position has multiple variants with the same count, then all should be included. But how to handle that in SQL. The best way is to use the window function and include all variants where the count is >= the K-th highest distinct count.

Alternatively, use a subquery to get the K-th largest case_count, and then select all variants with case_count >= that value. However, that approach can include more than K variants if there are ties on the K-th value.

But that's exactly the desired behavior. For example, if the top K=3 may actually return 5 variants because the third distinct count has multiple variants. But the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency". So perhaps this approach is better.

Let me think of an example. Suppose we have:

Variant A: 10 cases

Variant B: 10

Variant C: 9

Variant D: 8

Variant E: 8

Variant F: 7

If K=3, the top 3 frequencies are 10,9,8. But there are two variants with 10, one with 9, and two with 8. So the total variants in top 3 counts are 2+1+2=5. But if we want the top 3, then perhaps the user wants to include all variants that have counts within the top 3 distinct counts. So 10 (two variants), 9 (one), 8 (two).

But how to find that.

Alternatively, using DENSE_RANK. Let's say the DENSE_RANK is ordered by case_count DESC. So:

Variant A: 10, rank 1

Variant B: 10, rank 1

Variant C:9, rank 2

Variant D:8, rank 3

Variant E:8, rank3

Variant F:7, rank4

So if K=3, we include variants with rank <=3. So all except F.

But that would include 5 variants. Which is more than K=3. But the problem says "top K variants by frequency", which may imply that K refers to the number of unique frequencies. Or perhaps K is the number of variants, not frequency ranks.

This is ambiguous. The prompt says, "determine the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)." So the top K variants are those with the highest counts. If multiple variants have the same count as the K-th variant, they should all be included. So, for example, if K=3, and the third highest count is 5, but there are two variants with 5 count, then those two would both be in the top K=3. Wait, no. Wait, the K-th variant in terms of their individual frequencies. For instance, the top 3 could be three variants with counts 100, 90, 80. But if two are tied at third place (both 80), then K=3 would include three variants. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach is to get all variants sorted by case_count in descending order and pick the first K rows. If there's a tie at the K-th position, include all. But SQL's LIMIT K would not include them. That's the problem. So to handle ties, you need to find all variants where case_count >= the case_count of the K-th variant.

How to get that? For example:

SELECT variant, case_count
FROM variant_counts
WHERE case_count >= (
  SELECT case_count
  FROM variant_counts
  ORDER BY case_count DESC
  LIMIT 1 OFFSET K-1
)

But this would get all variants with case_count >= the case_count of the K-th variant. However, if there's no K-th variant (e.g., less than K variants total), then the subquery would return NULL. Need to handle that.

Alternatively, use window functions to compute the top K.

But this can get a bit complicated. However, for DuckDB, perhaps the easiest way is to use the window function to assign a rank and then select where rank <= K.

But which rank function to use.

If we use ROW_NUMBER(), then even if there are ties in case_count, each row gets a unique number. So if two variants have the same case_count, their row numbers would be different. For example:

case_count | ROW_NUMBER
10         | 1
10         | 2
9          | 3
8          |4
8          |5

So if K=3, then row_number <=3 would include the first three variants. But in this example, the third row is case_count 9, which might be the third highest. But the two 10s are in row 1 and 2, then 9 is 3. So if K=3, this would include the top three rows. But this excludes variants with case_count 8 even if they are part of the K-th position if their row_number is beyond K.

But this is not handling ties. So, for example, if K=2, the third variant (case_count 9) would be excluded, but two variants have higher counts. But if K=3, the third one is 9.

But perhaps the problem expects that the top K variants are the first K distinct when ordered by case_count descending, not accounting for ties. Or maybe the problem expects that if K=3, it's the three variants with the highest counts, even if there are ties.

But the problem statement says, "the number of cases that follow that variant". So the top K would be the K variants with the highest counts, regardless of whether there are ties. So if two variants have the same highest count, they would be considered as two entries in the top K. So, for K=3, the top three variants would be the three with the highest counts, regardless of duplicates.

But in SQL, using ROW_NUMBER would not account for ties. For example, the two 10's get row numbers 1 and 2. Then the 9 gets row 3. So for K=3, you would get three variants. But if there are two variants with 10, then those two are top two. Then K=3 would include the third, which is 9. But what if there are three variants with 10. Then the top K=3 would be all three 10's, but if there are four variants, then K=3 would have three of them. Which is correct?

Hmm. The problem isn't very clear on this, but perhaps in the context of process mining, when you talk about top K variants, you usually consider the K most frequent ones, even with ties. So if you have three variants with the same highest count, they would all be in the top 1, and if K=1, you include all three. If K=2, include those three plus the next group.

But that complicates the approach. However, considering that the problem wants to get the top K variants by their frequency, and return all events from cases in those variants, it's probably safer to handle ties. Because otherwise, using ROW_NUMBER would split the same-count variants into separate ranks, and LIMIT K would miss some.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to use DENSE_RANK, which allows multiple variants to have the same rank. For example:

SELECT variant, case_count,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as dr
FROM variant_counts

Then, when we select variants where dr <= K, we get all variants whose case_count puts them in the top K ranks. For example, if K=2, and two variants have case_count 10 (dr=1), one has 9 (dr=2), and two have 8 (dr=3), then dr <=2 would get the first two ranks. But if K=3, then dr<=3 would include dr=1,2,3. But this approach may include more than K variants.

Wait, but the 'K' is the number of ranks, not the number of variants. So this may not exactly fit the problem's intention. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects exactly K variants, even if it means breaking ties. The problem statement says "the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)". So if multiple variants have the same frequency, perhaps they count as distinct entries. So if two variants have the same highest frequency, they are both considered top 1 and top 2? Or are they both considered top 1?

In the SQL ranking functions, RANK would assign the same rank to ties, so for example, two rows with the same highest case_count would get rank 1, the next would be rank 3 (if RANK is used), but with DENSE_RANK, it would assign rank 1 and then next rank 2.

Wait, let me clarify the functions:

RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) gives:

For case_counts 10,10,9,8,8:

rank 1,1,3,4,4.

DENSE_RANK() would give 1,1,2,3,3.

So, for example, if K=2, using RANK <= 2 would include the first two variants (rank 1 and 1) and none else. But the third rank is 3 which is over 2. If K=3, then ranks 1,1,3,4,4 would include the first three ranks (1,1,3). If K=3. But in that case, the third variant (rank 3) would have a case_count of 9.

Alternatively, using DENSE_RANK <= K, for K=2, you get 1 and 2. So 10s, 9.

The problem states that the top K variants are determined by frequency, which is the count. So perhaps the problem means that variants are sorted in descending order of frequency, and the top K are the first K entries when sorted like that, even if they have the same count. But if two variants have the same count, their order is undefined, but they both would be in the top K if their position is <=K.

But this is ambiguous. However, given that the user wants to group by the complete activity sequence, and count each group, and then find the top K, perhaps the answer should use ROW_NUMBER, which doesn't account for ties. So, for example, two variants with the same case_count would be ordered arbitrarily, and one might be in the top K, the other not. But that's probably not desired. So this brings us back to the issue of how to handle ties. 

Given that the problem may not have a clear answer but expects the solution to handle it as per standard SQL practices, perhaps the best way is to use DENSE_RANK and select variants where dense_rank <= K. This way, all variants that have a case_count in the top K distinct case_counts are included. For example, if K=2, it would include all variants with case_count in the first two highest distinct case counts. If there are multiple variants in the first case count, they are all included. 

I think this approach is better because it includes all variants that are in the top K when considering their frequency. So, for the example:

If variants have case_counts 10,10,9,8,8,7. For K=2:

- DENSE_RANK is 1,1,2,3,3,4.

So selecting DENSE_RANK <=2 would include all variants with case_counts 10,10,9. So three variants. So K=2 in terms of dense ranks, which are 1 and 2. But the actual count of variants is three. So the answer includes all variants in the top two frequency levels. 

This might be the desired behavior, but the problem statement says "the top K variants by their frequency". So if K is 2, the top two are the two highest frequency levels. So the first frequency is 10, the second is 9. So variants with 10 and 9 are included, which are three variants. So in this case, the answer includes three variants.

But the problem says "the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)". So the number of cases is the count. So the top K variants are those with the highest counts. So if multiple variants share the same highest count, they are all part of the top 1, and if K is 2, then the next highest count is considered. 

This suggests that using DENSE_RANK is the correct approach, as it groups all variants with the same case_count into the same rank. Then, selecting where the dense_rank is <= K gives all variants with case_count in the top K distinct case counts.

So I'll proceed with that approach.

So, putting it together:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT variant,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS dr
  FROM variant_counts
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_variants
WHERE dr <= K;

Then, we can get the variants in the top K.

Once we have the top K variants, we need to select all events from the original event_log that belong to case_ids which have their variant in the top K variants.

So, next step: join the case_variants to the ranked_variants to get the case_ids that are in the top variants.

So the final query would be:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT variant,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT variant,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS dr
  FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM ranked_variants
  WHERE dr <= K  -- Replace K with the desired number, like 5
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants cv
  WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
);

But we need to parametrize K. Also, in DuckDB, can we use a parameter here? Well, assuming that we're writing this as a static query with K as a variable.

But how to ensure that the case_variants and the rest are correctly computed.

Another possible optimization: Use the case_variants to get the variant for each case, then join with variant_counts and ranked_variants to check if their variant is in the top K. Then select all events for those case_ids.

Alternatively, the steps are:

1. For each case, compute the variant (activity sequence ordered by timestamp).

2. For each variant, count how many cases have it.

3. For each variant, compute its dense rank based on the count.

4. Select top K dense ranks.

5. Select all case_ids that have a variant in the top K ranks.

6. Join back to the original event_log to get all events for those case_ids.

Thus, the query would follow those steps.

Now, check for possible errors: For example, in the case_variants, the STRING_AGG is ordered by timestamp. So the order of activities within a case is preserved. That's correct.

Another possible problem: What if two events in the same case have the same timestamp? Then STRING_AGG's order is non-deterministic. But the problem statement says "the ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp". So if timestamps are the same, the order between them is not specified, but in SQL, the ORDER BY clause would require a deterministic sort. But if two events have the same timestamp, the order may not be guaranteed. However, the problem states to order by timestamp, so presumably, the timestamps are unique. But if not, perhaps we can add another column to the ORDER BY to break ties, but the problem doesn't mention any. So assuming that the timestamps are unique for each activity within a case.

Another point: The final query returns all events from the original event_log for cases in the top K variants. So the steps are correct.

Now, testing for K: How to replace K with a value. Let's assume that the user would replace K with 5, for example.

Putting it all together:

The query would look like:

WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS dr
  FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM ranked_variants
  WHERE dr <= 5  -- Replace 5 with desired K
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;

This should work. The final SELECT retrieves all columns from the original event_log (assuming it's named event_log) for the cases that are in the top K variants.

But let me double-check the steps.

1. case_variants: Each case and its activity sequence.

2. variant_counts: Each variant's count.

3. ranked_variants: Assign dense rank to variants based on count.

4. top_variants: Select variants with dr <= K.

5. Get case_ids from case_variants where their variant is in top_variants.

6. Join back to event_log to get all events for those cases.

Yes, that makes sense. The final result would include all events for those cases, ordered by case_id and timestamp, but the problem doesn't require any specific order. The problem says to return the corresponding events; ordering may not be required unless specified.

But in the query, the ORDER BY is optional unless the user wants a specific order. The problem doesn't mention ordering the final result, so perhaps it can be omitted. But including ORDER BY case_id, timestamp ensures that the events are in chronological order within each case, which might be desired.

So that's the query.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants based on their frequency and retrieve all events from cases following these variants. Here's how you can achieve this using DuckDB SQL:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Extract Process Variants**: For each case, concatenate activities in chronological order to form the process variant.
2. **Count Variants**: Determine how many cases follow each variant.
3. **Rank Variants**: Rank variants by their frequency to identify the top K.
4. **Filter Cases**: Select case IDs corresponding to the top K variants.
5. **Retrieve Events**: Fetch all events from the original log for the selected cases.

### SQL Query

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
ranked_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) AS dr
    FROM variant_counts
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM ranked_variants
    WHERE dr <= K -- Replace K with the desired number (e.g., 5)
)
SELECT event_log.*
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_variants
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation

1. **case_variants**: Constructs each case's activity sequence by concatenating activities ordered by timestamp.
2. **variant_counts**: Counts how many cases follow each variant.
3. **ranked_variants**: Assigns a dense rank to each variant based on frequency, ensuring ties are handled correctly.
4. **top_variants**: Filters the top K variants based on their rank.
5. **Final Query**: Retrieves all events from cases that belong to the top K variants, maintaining the original order of events within each case.

This query efficiently groups cases, ranks variants, and filters results to meet the problem requirements.
