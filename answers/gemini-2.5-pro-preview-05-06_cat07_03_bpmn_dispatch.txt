This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating the "Dispatch of goods" process for a "Computer Hardware Shop." The process is divided into three swimlanes, representing different roles or departments: "Logistics," "Secretary" (within "Dispatch of goods Computer Hardware Shop"), and "Warehouse."

Here's a breakdown of the process flow:

1.  **Process Start (Secretary):** The process begins with a "Ship goods" start event in the Secretary's lane.

2.  **Parallel Activities:**
    *   **Secretary:** Simultaneously, the Secretary "Clarifies shipment method."
    *   **Warehouse:** The Warehouse "Packages goods." This task has a 48-hour timer event attached. If packaging exceeds 48 hours, the "Notify customer about delay" task is triggered. After packaging (and potential notification), the flow proceeds through an inclusive gateway.

3.  **Secretary - Shipment Method Follow-up:**
    *   After clarifying the shipment method, a decision ("Special handling?") is made:
        *   **No Special Handling:**
            *   The Secretary "Checks if insurance is required," referencing "Order details" and "Customer information" (a database).
            *   An inclusive gateway follows. If insurance is necessary, the "Logistics" department will "Insure parcel."
            *   Regardless of insurance (or after insurance is handled), the Secretary will "Write package label." This path is labeled "always" from the inclusive gateway, suggesting it happens either directly if no insurance is needed, or after the insurance step.
            *   These paths then merge at another inclusive gateway.
        *   **Yes Special Handling:**
            *   The Secretary will "Get 3 offers from logistic companies."
            *   Then, "Select logistic company and place order."
    *   The outcomes of the "Special handling?" decision (either the insurance/labeling path or the logistic company selection path) merge at an exclusive gateway.

4.  **Synchronization:** A parallel gateway then synchronizes the two main branches:
    *   The completion of the Secretary's tasks (clarifying shipment, handling special cases/insurance, writing labels, or selecting logistics).
    *   The completion of the Warehouse's "Package goods" task (and any potential delay notification).

5.  **Final Warehouse Activities:** Once both main branches are complete and synchronized:
    *   The Warehouse "Fills out Shipment paperwork."
    *   Then, they "Move package to pickup area."

6.  **Process End (Warehouse):** The process concludes with a "Shipment prepared" end event.

In essence, the diagram shows a coordinated effort between the Secretary, Warehouse, and potentially Logistics to prepare goods for dispatch, handling standard and special shipping requirements, including packaging, labeling, insurance, and paperwork, with a mechanism to notify customers of packaging delays.
