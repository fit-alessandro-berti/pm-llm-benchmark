Event abstraction is a powerful technique for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. It involves grouping or merging low-level events into higher-level events or activities that provide a more abstract and meaningful representation of the underlying process, thereby reducing complexity and enhancing understanding.

To effectively utilize event abstraction in improving the readability and manageability of complex process models, consider the following steps:

1. Event clustering: Identify and group events that belong together based on their characteristics, such as event types, resources involved, or timestamps. This can be done using clustering algorithms or by defining rules based on domain knowledge.

2. Define abstraction levels: Establish a hierarchical structure of abstraction levels, where lower levels represent more detailed events and higher levels represent more abstract activities. This helps in organizing the complex process model into a more manageable and understandable format.

3. Event aggregation: Merge events within each cluster into a single abstract event or activity. This can be done by defining aggregation rules, such as combining events that occur in sequence, events that share common resources, or events that represent similar actions.

4. Labeling abstract events: Assign meaningful labels to abstract events based on their underlying events and the context of the process. This helps in understanding the purpose and significance of each abstract event within the process model.

5. Visualize abstract process model: Create a visual representation of the abstract process model using process modeling notations such as BPMN or Petri nets. This allows stakeholders to easily understand the process flow and identify potential bottlenecks or improvement opportunities.

6. Validate and refine: Validate the abstract process model with domain experts to ensure its accuracy and completeness. Refine the model as needed based on feedback, and iterate the abstraction process until a satisfactory level of readability and manageability is achieved.

By following these steps, the concept of event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. This, in turn, can facilitate better understanding, analysis, and optimization of business processes.
