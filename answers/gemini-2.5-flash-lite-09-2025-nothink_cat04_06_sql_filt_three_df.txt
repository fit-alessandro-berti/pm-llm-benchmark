This problem requires identifying cases based on a specific sequence pattern and a temporal constraint, and then using that identification to exclude those cases from the final result set.

We will use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the logic:

1. **`SequenceCases`**: Identify all `case_id`s that exhibit the exact three-step sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' $\rightarrow$ 'Create Order' $\rightarrow$ 'Confirm Order'.
2. **`TimingViolationCases`**: From the cases identified in step 1, find those where the time gap between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is greater than 5 days.
3. **Final Selection**: Select all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` is **NOT IN** the set identified in `TimingViolationCases`.

### DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
WITH SequenceEvents AS (
    -- 1. Find overlapping triplets using LEAD/LAG or self-joins.
    -- Using LEAD to find the next two activities for each event within the same case.
    SELECT
        el1.case_id,
        el1.timestamp AS ts_approve,
        el2.timestamp AS ts_create,
        el3.timestamp AS ts_confirm,
        el1.activity AS act1,
        el2.activity AS act2,
        el3.activity AS act3
    FROM
        event_log el1
    JOIN
        event_log el2 ON el1.case_id = el2.case_id
                     AND el1.timestamp < el2.timestamp
    JOIN
        event_log el3 ON el1.case_id = el3.case_id
                     AND el2.timestamp < el3.timestamp
    WHERE
        el1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND el2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND el3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        -- Crucial check: Ensure no other events exist between the three required events for the same case
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM event_log el_mid
            WHERE
                el_mid.case_id = el1.case_id
                AND el_mid.timestamp > el1.timestamp
                AND el_mid.timestamp < el3.timestamp
                -- Exclude the three events we are already matching
                AND (el_mid.activity != el2.activity OR el_mid.timestamp != el2.timestamp)
        )
),
TimingViolationCases AS (
    -- 2. Identify cases from the sequence matches where the time difference > 5 days
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM
        SequenceEvents
    WHERE
        -- Calculate difference in days (DuckDB uses EPOCH for interval subtraction)
        (ts_confirm - ts_create) > INTERVAL '5' DAY
)
-- 3. Final result: Select all events *except* those belonging to the violation cases
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM TimingViolationCases)
ORDER BY
    el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation of Key Steps:

1.  **`SequenceEvents` CTE (The Self-Join Approach for Direct Succession):**
    *   We join `event_log` to itself three times (`el1`, `el2`, `el3`) based on the same `case_id`.
    *   We enforce strict chronological order: `el1.timestamp < el2.timestamp < el3.timestamp`.
    *   We filter for the required activities: 'Approve...' ($\text{el1}$), 'Create...' ($\text{el2}$), 'Confirm...' ($\text{el3}$).
    *   **The Direct Succession Check (`NOT EXISTS` subquery):** This is the most critical part to ensure *no other event* occurs between the 'Approve' and 'Confirm' steps. We check if any other event (`el_mid`) exists in the log for that case that falls strictly between $\text{ts\_approve}$ and $\text{ts\_confirm}$ (and isn't one of the three matched events itself).

2.  **`TimingViolationCases` CTE:**
    *   We use the results from `SequenceEvents`.
    *   DuckDB supports direct subtraction of `TIMESTAMP` columns, resulting in an `INTERVAL` type. We compare this interval to `INTERVAL '5' DAY`.
    *   We select the distinct `case_id`s that meet this timing violation criteria.

3.  **Final Selection:**
    *   We select all columns (`el.*`) from the original `event_log`.
    *   We use `WHERE el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM TimingViolationCases)` to exclude all events belonging to any case that satisfied both the sequence and the timing violation criteria.
