## Step 1: Identify the Expected Sequence of Activities in a Standard Hire-to-Retire Process
A standard Hire-to-Retire process typically includes activities such as posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding a new employee, adding the employee to the payroll system, and closing the case. These activities generally follow a predictable sequence.

## Step 2: Analyze POWL Model 1
POWL Model 1 shows a deviation from the standard sequence. Specifically:
- The sequence does not clearly follow the standard order: Post_Job_Ad (Post) -> Screen_Candidates (Screen) -> Decide (Decide) -> Onboard_Employee (Onboard) -> Payroll (Payroll) -> Close_Case (Close) might be unexpected without additional context.
- The lack of explicit sorting by any of the activities introduces uncertainty in the workflow.

## Step 3: Analyze POWL Model 2
POWL Model 2 introduces anomalies:
- The loop_in_onboardingOperator (loop_onboarding) is introduced between Onboard_Employee (Onboard) and skip, which might imply that Onboard should be followed by the loop operator or an alternative process, depending on the specifics of the hiring process.
- The xor_payrollOperator (xor_payroll) might be intended to introduce an additional choice based on whether the employee was added to the payroll system or not.

## Step 4: Determine Which Model More Closely Aligns with a Normative Hire-to-Retire Process
Considering the typical logic and sequence of the Hire-to-Retire process, POWL Model 1 seems to be less aligned with standard process logic compared to Model 2. While Model 2 shows more deviation from the expected sequence and introduces more anomalies, these might be less severe or represent different logical flow paths rather than fundamental deviations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$
