### 1. Normative Rule Violations
The normative rules enforce a strict, non-skippable sequence with precise ordering and conditional logic. Below is an analysis of each case:

- **Case 1**: **Fully compliant**. The sequence follows the exact normative path: Application Received (09:00)  Credit Check (09:30)  Risk Assessment (10:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 11:00)  Inform Applicant (13:00)  Finalize Documentation (13:30)  Close Case (14:00). No skips, reversals, or contradictions.

- **Case 2**: **Multiple severe violations**:
  - Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs **before Credit Check (09:00)**, violating the strict ordering rule (Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment). This also implies skipping Credit Check initially.
  - **Inform Applicant is entirely skipped** after Loan Decision (09:30), violating the requirement that notification must follow the decision.
  - Finalize Documentation (10:00) occurs **after Loan Decision (Rejected, 09:30)**, which is explicitly not allowed for rejections (no documentation finalization permitted).
  - These make the process invalid end-to-end.

- **Case 3**: **Fully compliant**. The sequence adheres perfectly: Application Received (Jan-12 09:00)  Credit Check (Jan-14 10:00)  Risk Assessment (11:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 12:00)  Inform Applicant (Jan-16 15:00)  Finalize Documentation (Jan-17 09:00)  Close Case (10:00). No skips, reversals, or contradictions despite longer timelines.

### 2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal but Not Severe)
Desiderata are recommended best practices (e.g., Credit Check within ~24 hours of application, Inform Applicant within ~48 hours of decision, and a Follow-up Call before Close Case). Deviations are suboptimal and indicate room for improvement but do not invalidate the process.

- **Case 1**: Meets timing desiderata (Credit Check 30 minutes after application; Inform Applicant ~2 hours after decision). However, **no Follow-up Call** is suboptimal, as it is encouraged before closing to confirm alignment.

- **Case 2**: Timing desiderata are mostly met where applicable (Credit Check ~1 hour after application), but **no Follow-up Call** and the normative violations overshadow these. Suboptimal due to missing follow-up.

- **Case 3**: **Multiple desiderata failures**:
  - Credit Check ~49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation).
  - Inform Applicant ~51 hours after decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation).
  - **No Follow-up Call** (explicitly noted).
  These represent delays and missed opportunities for better customer alignment but are not normative breaches.

### 3. Suggested Interpretations or Justifications
Where behaviors align with rules, they can be seen as ideal. For deviations:

- **Case 1**: Fully justifiable as efficient processing, perhaps under low workload. The absent Follow-up Call could be justified if the quick timeline and approval ensured natural alignment (e.g., applicant already engaged post-notification).

- **Case 2**: Normative violations have **no valid justification** under strict rules—Risk Assessment before Credit Check cannot be reconciled (perhaps a logging error or rogue action, but it breaks sequence). Finalize Documentation post-rejection is contradictory and unjustifiable. Missing Inform Applicant suggests process abandonment. Desiderata absence (Follow-up Call) aligns with overall disarray but isn't excusable.

- **Case 3**: Normative compliance is justifiable despite delays. Late Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be interpreted as due to external factors (e.g., holidays Jan-12 to Jan-14, high volume, or manual verification needs), still respecting order. No Follow-up Call might be justified by the extended timeline allowing informal check-ins, though suboptimal for best practice. Overall, this shows resilience in maintaining sequence under constraints.
