This image displays a process model, which is a visual representation of a workflow, along with a legend explaining the notation used for control flow.

### Main Process Model

The main part of the image is a flowchart that illustrates the steps for handling a request. The process consists of several activities, represented by rounded rectangles with letter labels (a, b, c, etc.) and descriptive names. The flow of the process is indicated by directed arrows.

The workflow can be described as follows:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with activity **a: register request**.
2.  **Examination Phase:** After registration, the workflow seems to split into three concurrent or optional examination tasks:
    *   **b: examine thoroughly**
    *   **c: examine casually**
    *   **d: check ticket**
3.  **Decision:** The results from these examination tasks are synchronized before moving to activity **e: decide**.
4.  **Outcomes:** Based on the decision, there are three possible paths:
    *   The request is approved, leading to **g: pay compensation**.
    *   The request is denied, leading to **h: reject request**.
    *   More information is needed, which triggers a loop back to **f: reinitiate request**. From here, the process can loop back to the examination phase (b, c, and d).
5.  **End:** Whether compensation is paid (g) or the request is rejected (h), the process concludes at activity **z: end**.

### Legend

The gray box in the bottom right corner serves as a legend, defining the graphical notation for the logical gateways (the small black circles) that control the splitting and joining of paths in the workflow.

*   **Splits (Divergence):**
    *   **XOR-split:** An exclusive choice. The process follows exactly one of the outgoing paths.
    *   **AND-split:** Parallel execution. The process follows all outgoing paths simultaneously.
    *   **OR-split:** An inclusive choice. The process can follow one or more of the outgoing paths.

*   **Joins (Convergence):**
    *   **XOR-join:** The process continues as soon as one of the incoming paths is completed.
    *   **AND-join:** Synchronization. The process waits for all incoming paths to be completed before continuing.
    *   **OR-join:** The process continues after one or more incoming paths are completed, often with more complex synchronization logic.

Applying the legend to the main diagram, the split after **e: decide** is an **XOR-split** (a choice between paying, rejecting, or reinitiating), and the join before **z: end** is an **XOR-join** (the process ends after either paying or rejecting). The join before **e: decide** appears to be an **AND-join**, suggesting all examination tasks must be completed before a decision is made.
