This image displays a process model, also known as a workflow diagram, which visualizes the sequence of tasks in a process. The diagram uses a specific notation, explained in a key at the bottom right, to represent different logical flows.

### Key/Legend Description
The gray box at the bottom right serves as a legend for interpreting the diagram's logic gates (splits and joins):

*   **XOR-split/join:** Represents an exclusive choice.
    *   **XOR-split:** One of several outgoing paths is chosen.
    *   **XOR-join:** The process continues after any one of the incoming paths completes.
*   **AND-split/join:** Represents parallelism.
    *   **AND-split:** All outgoing paths are activated simultaneously (in parallel). The dot connecting the arrows signifies this.
    *   **AND-join:** The process waits for all incoming parallel paths to complete before continuing (synchronization).
*   **OR-split/join:** Represents an inclusive choice (one or more).
    *   **OR-split:** One or more of the outgoing paths can be chosen.
    *   **OR-join:** The process continues as soon as the first path arrives, but also correctly handles subsequent arrivals from other active paths.

### Main Process Flow Description

The main diagram illustrates a request handling process, likely for an insurance claim or a similar compensation request. The flow is as follows:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with task **a: register request**.
2.  **Parallel Examination:** After registration, an **AND-split** occurs. This means three tasks are initiated in parallel:
    *   **b: examine thoroughly**
    *   **c: examine casually**
    *   **d: check ticket**
3.  **Synchronization and Decision:** The process then waits at an **AND-join** until all three examination tasks (b, c, and d) are complete. Once they are, the process moves to task **e: decide**.
4.  **Decision Outcomes (XOR-split):** The `decide` task has three possible outcomes, representing an **XOR-split** (only one path can be taken at a time):
    *   **Path 1: Pay Compensation.** The process moves to task **g: pay compensation**.
    *   **Path 2: Reject Request.** The process moves to task **h: reject request**.
    *   **Path 3: Rework/Reinitiate.** The process moves to task **f: reinitiate request**.
5.  **Rework Loop:** If the decision is to reinitiate, task `f` is performed. Following `f`, an **AND-split** triggers tasks **c: examine casually** and **d: check ticket** to be performed again in parallel. Note that task **b: examine thoroughly** is *not* part of this loop and is only performed once at the beginning. After `c` and `d` are completed, the flow returns to the **AND-join** before the **e: decide** step.
6.  **End:** Both the "pay compensation" path (g) and the "reject request" path (h) lead to an **XOR-join**. This means whichever path was taken, the process converges and proceeds to the final step, **z: end**, which concludes the workflow.
