I need to present this section in paragraphs instead of bullets. I’ll cover queue frequency and the number of cases with excessive waits, focusing on resource-specific queues like triage and doctor consultations. I can identify critical queues by their average wait times, volumes, and potential to expedite patient flow. It's important to consider various patient types and their frequency of waiting, and the impact of urgent cases on service time variability could be significant. Let's analyze those metrics further!

I want to use process mining to pinpoint resource utilization bottlenecks by calculating resource utilization from start times to end times. I can utilize the ProM plugin to get a workload profile and gather resource-level throughput statistics, considering specialized rooms and equipment. I also need to look at variant analysis, focusing on typical paths and deviations, especially by patient type and urgency. Lastly, examining handover times between resources and service times is essential to understand how they relate to waiting times.

I can use various process mining techniques like social network analysis and conformance checking to analyze scheduling adherence and schedule variation. It’s essential to propose optimization strategies, starting with predictive scheduling to better match demand patterns using data from the last six months to forecast daily hour-of-day arrivals. Another idea is resource pooling, allowing clinics to share staff across specialities while considering specific skills. Lastly, I want to explore in-room sampling to minimize movement and improve patient flow efficiency.

I’m planning to analyze lab and imaging times versus their respective queues. The goal is to evaluate the cost and ROI for expansions while identifying cycle time “hard tails” at the 90th and 99th percentiles to understand risks. 

For queue times, I’ll calculate waiting time as the difference between the start and the completion of subsequent activities. Key metrics include total waiting time, waiting times by resource type and urgency, and the frequency of excessive waits. This helps pinpoint critical queues for attention and further analysis.

I want to emphasize the importance of service-time variability as it often causes queue length issues. The square of variation relates to expected queue time, so I'll check the coefficient of variation (CV) for each queue. High variability, particularly with urgent cases, can lead to stretched waits for regular patients. 

Next, I'll analyze resource utilization and capacity planning. I need to review exam room usage, evaluate bottlenecks, and see how scheduling can affect resource management. These analyses will help create targeted optimization strategies, ensuring efficient resource use while minimizing excessive waits and dissatisfaction.

For parallelization, I think it’s essential to split tasks to reduce waits for consulting rooms. We can start with an initial question and register while waiting for the nurse or room. Additionally, pre-check-in via kiosk or mobile could help streamline the registration process.

I'll propose technology aids like self-service kiosks and remote queuing, which could reduce registration times and improve satisfaction. Another idea is to utilize point-of-care testing to minimize patient movement and time spent. Lastly, I’ll emphasize coordination strategies like central dispatch and bedside registration to enhance efficiency.

To address trade-offs and constraints, I need to balance costs and staff workload while keeping patient satisfaction a priority. Increasing capacity or pooling resources might bring challenges like cross-training needs and overtime risks, but it can improve efficiency too.

I want to develop KPIs to monitor success, like average waiting time per queue and throughput. We’ll also implement ongoing process monitoring to track these metrics regularly. The key is to use the event log structure effectively to ensure continuous improvement and manage daily arrival forecasts accurately.

I'm putting together an implementation plan that follows a detailed structure. I'll begin with data preprocessing, defining events and creating a structured table with details like case ID, activity, timestamps, and resources.

Next, I'll outline phases, including descriptive analysis, bottlenecks, scheduling simulations, and operational pilots. I plan to compute waiting time, handle arrival data, and analyze queue times across activities. It’s crucial to identify critical queues and potential root causes, ultimately proposing optimization strategies to improve the overall process while managing costs and staff utilization.

### 1. Queue identification and characterization

I begin by explicitly defining waiting time from the event log, then measure and rank it so improvements can be focused where they matter most. In a typical outpatient visit the sequence moves through a defined set of activities, each of which has a START and a COMPLETE event. For two consecutive activities A and B in the same case, waiting time for B is the time from the COMPLETE of A to the START of B. If B follows immediately, wait is zero; if there is a gap, that gap is the queue time for the step B. This computation is done per case and per queue segment to preserve context and to allow downstream segmentation by patient type, urgency, specialty, resource, or day/time of arrival.

With waiting times in hand, I compute key metrics to characterize the state of the queues. First, central tendency and spread: the mean, median, and a robust range via the 90th and 99th percentiles for each queue, so I can see both typical waits and the “hard tails” that disproportionately affect patients. Second, frequency and volume: the number of cases that pass through each queue, and the share of cases whose waits exceed clinically meaningful thresholds (for example, longer than the service duration of the next step or longer than clinically tolerable for diagnostic queues). Third, variability: the coefficient of variation of waiting time and of service time (derived from the difference between START and COMPLETE within each activity). In queueing theory, the combination of variability in interarrival times and service times largely governs waiting time even when capacities are similar; therefore, variability often explains where waits inflate despite nominal capacity. Fourth, distribution shape and tails: skewness to determine if long waits are concentrated among particular hours or patient mixes; I will also analyze the empirical waiting-time distribution versus an exponential model to see where behavior deviates from simple assumptions, which signals operational irregularities (such as batch scheduling or urgent interruptions). Finally, resource-specific layering: for each activity, I tag resource identifiers and compute waiting time by resource, by resource class (e.g., “Nurse 1 vs. Nurse 2” or “Room 3 vs. Room 4”) to surface uneven utilization and shifts in bottlenecks.

To identify the most critical queues I apply a concise, multi-criteria rule that prioritizes based on patient experience and operational leverage. The primary weighting favors queues with the longest median wait and the highest 90th-percentile wait, because these are the queues most patients experience and the ones that risk dissatisfaction and care delays. Secondary weighting adds those with the largest case volume and a high share of cases exceeding a service-duration threshold for the next step, because even moderate waits affect large populations or propagate delays downstream. Finally, I include variability pressure (high CV on waits) as a red flag that minor schedule shocks can cause major tail times; in resource-constrained contexts, increasing variability usually matters as much as increasing the mean. To resolve ties, I favor queues with the highest contribution to total cycle time across all cases, because optimizing them yields the largest reduction in average visit duration. Justification is straightforward: if a queue is both long and frequent, and if the most adverse impacts cluster among specific patient types (e.g., new patients or non-urgent follow-ups), then improving that queue is a fast, high-impact lever.

### 2. Root cause analysis

Having identified the principal queues, I now diagnose why they form. In most outpatient clinics, several mechanisms produce waiting, and multiple mechanisms often coexist. Resource bottlenecks are common: a handful of rooms or staff run hot, others sit idle, and demand overshoots capacity at predictable times. I measure resource utilization by dividing each resource’s busy time by the total available time per day or per shift, and I compare utilization across resources in the same queue to find imbalance. High utilization coupled with high variability in service time makes queues inevitable, because even small demand spikes translate into long waits. I also detect idle gaps that suggest room rotation or handoff friction rather than true shortage.

Activity dependencies and handovers are another root cause. Some steps demand a specific resource class (e.g., “ECG Test” needs Tech X and Room 3), and those constrained resources act as single points of failure. Parallel dependencies—for instance, “ECG Test” and “Blood Test” scheduled sequentially rather than concurrently—unnecessarily serialize patients. Sequence variants amplify this: if many cases follow a nonstandard path with extra tests or specialist reviews that were not anticipated at scheduling, overall cycle time expands. I use variant analysis to find the most common process paths and to quantify the share of cases that deviate; variants with abnormal lengths or waits pinpoint constraints and scheduling mismatches.

Variability in service times also generates queues. A long mean service time is manageable if variance is low; it is problematic when CV is high. The event log lets me measure service time per activity, and I relate it to waiting time by queueing insight: the relationship is approximately linear to the square of CV and to utilization. If high waits coincide with high CV for service times, I infer that irregular activities—such as urgent cases inserted into a normal schedule or uneven nursing tasks—create spillovers. By comparing new vs. follow-up visits or normal vs. urgent urgency, I can see whether surges in one group puff out tail times for another.

Appointment scheduling policies strongly influence queues. If arrivals cluster early in the day, registration queues spike during the first hour, and lab queues later when orders pile up. If scheduled slots are too tight relative to historical service-time distributions, the system cannot absorb variability. Conversely, gaps left unused because of poor alignment between capacity and forecasted demand waste capacity while leaving queues elsewhere unaddressed. I analyze arrival patterns by hour, day of week, and patient type; I estimate interarrival distributions; and I cross-check scheduled start times with actual START events to see where on-time adherence drifts into late or early starts, which both destabilize queues.

Patient mix and triage priorities shift loads and create inequalities. Urgent cases sometimes preempt normal ones, leaving the later group to suffer longer waits; if urgents arrive in bursts, that pressure may alternate with quiet periods that yield idle time. New patients require more registration complexity and assessment time than follow-ups; if rooms and nurses are not flexibly assigned to absorb the extra time, queues accumulate. I measure the effect of urgency on waiting time and service time distributions and test whether resource assignment policies inadvertently distribute the wrong amounts of capacity to the wrong mix.

To surface these causes I apply resource analysis (profile and heatmaps per resource), bottleneck analysis (throughput constraints and cycle-time decomposition), variant analysis (common vs. outlier paths), process conformance and timetable analysis (compare planned schedules to actual timing), and social-resource network analysis (who hands off to whom and when). These techniques help me separate symptom from mechanism and align fixes with the real drivers of queuing rather than guesses.

### 3. Data-driven optimization strategies

I propose three concrete, data-backed strategies, each aimed at the identified critical queues and designed to minimize cost while maximizing patient throughput and satisfaction.

Strategy A: Dynamic, skill-based resource pooling with predictive scheduling. The analysis often reveals that registration and nurse assessment queues escalate near appointment start times, while some staff and rooms have uneven utilization. I propose a pool of cross-trained registration and nursing staff that can be flexed hourly by predicted load from the six-month event log. The clinic should model arrival and service-time distributions per hour and per patient type and simulate simple slotting that adjusts daily capacity and skill-mix to keep queue lengths near a target. Expected impact: a 20–30% reduction in median registration waits and a 10–15% reduction in nurse-assessment waits within the first hour of opening, with improved fairness across staff. The reasoning is direct: by matching capacity to observed variability, I reduce the mismatch that produces queues, and I use cross-training to break fixed-resource bottlenecks without major new hires.

Strategy B: In-room registration and selective parallelization of diagnostics. Many visits serialize registration, nurse assessment, and doctor consultation in that order. I propose conducting registration within the first few minutes of the encounter—ideally at the point of care—while the nurse prepares the patient, and I propose running point-of-care blood draws or pre-ECG preparations concurrently when appropriate. The goal is to parallelize the parts of registration and assessment that do not strictly require the doctor, and to cut “movement time” through bedside workflows. Expected impact: a 25–35% reduction in total waiting time between registration and doctor consultation, and a 10–15% reduction in average overall visit duration due to fewer idle intervals. The reasoning is simple: serialization creates queues by forcing patients into single-lane processes; by co-locating and parallelizing low-risk steps, I reduce idle gaps without straining rooms or equipment.

Strategy C: Self-service registration kiosks and digital triage plus remote lab dispatch. Registration queues often peak early and collapse later; labor costs climb if clerks must manage surge capacity. I propose self-service kiosks (or mobile pre-check-in) that handle standard intake and insurance capture for non-urgent cases, with staff supporting exceptions and urgent patients. Simultaneously, I propose a digital triage workflow that sends lab orders ahead of time to available technicians and rooms, so that the “ECG Test” queue moves as soon as the doctor completes ordering rather than when the patient physically reaches the lab desk. Expected impact: a 40–50% reduction in registration wait times at peak, a 15–25% reduction in the median ECG test queue, and higher throughput that does not depend on more staff. The reasoning combines reduction of arrival bottlenecks with faster dispatch and fewer manual handoffs; technology spreads the load and frees staff to solve exceptions rather than routine intake.

To prioritize these, I first focus on queues with the highest median and 90th-percentile waits and the largest share of cases experiencing excessive waits. In many clinics, registration and doctor consultation emerge as top bottlenecks. Strategy A directly targets registration and nurse assessment, Strategy B compresses the time before and during consultation, and Strategy C reduces both registration and diagnostic queueing through technology. Together, these three actions address the core pathways and the variability that generates long waits, while minimizing cost by flexing existing staff and adding limited technology that pays back with throughput.

### 4. Consideration of trade-offs and constraints

Improvements create trade-offs that must be weighed carefully. Increasing pooling requires cross-training and careful rostering so that skill depth does not erode quality. If not managed, pooling can merely relocate the bottleneck rather than shrink it; for example, pulling nurses from one area to another may solve one queue but create another. The mitigation is to design capacity targets and schedule adjustments based on observed variability and case mix, and to implement guardrails (such as minimum nurse coverage per specialty) to maintain clinical thoroughness. In-room registration can raise documentation complexity if not supported by mobile tools; I mitigate this with standardized templates, role clarity, and a final safety check by front-desk staff for edge cases. Parallelization of diagnostics must be clinically appropriate; not every test can or should be started at the bedside. The mitigation is to define a list of eligible activities by specialty and urgency, and to rely on the doctor’s order to signal concurrent dispatch rather than improvisation.

Self-service kiosks raise cost and can create inequity for patients less comfortable with technology. I mitigate this by ensuring assistance is readily available, by maintaining paper alternatives, and by using the log to monitor whether delays for non-digital users increase disproportionately. Remote lab dispatch helps reduce queues but can lead to equipment overload if not synchronized; the mitigation is to integrate a digital signal that includes expected completion time and to use technicians’ workload state as part of the dispatch logic. Most importantly, I keep an eye on the “mobility” problem: moving faster from one step to another only improves satisfaction if the next step is truly ready. Technology that accelerates ordering must be paired with capacity-aware scheduling, or queues simply re-form downstream.

Balancing reduction of wait times against cost and thoroughness requires explicit targets. I set clinic-level and queue-specific thresholds: for instance, median wait under X minutes for registration and consultation, 90th-percentile under Y, with maximum total visit duration improvements of Z%. I establish budget limits for technology pilots, and I tie investment to the proportion of cases affected by each queue and the expected reduction in patient dissatisfaction. Where staff workload rises, I plan micro-breaks and shifts that maintain focus and error rates; the event log supports analysis of service time spikes during high-pressure periods, so I can adjust rosters proactively.

### 5. Measuring success

To measure whether changes reduce waits without compromising care, I define concise KPIs and monitor them continuously. The primary KPIs include per-queue average and median waiting time, 90th and 99th percentile waits by patient type and urgency, and the share of cases whose waits exceed predefined thresholds. I also track overall cycle time from arrival to check-out, and I measure on-time rate (the percentage of cases that start and complete each scheduled activity within a tolerance window). I add resource KPIs—utilization per resource class, nurse-to-room ratio, and technician load for high-demand tests—to see whether improvements are achieved by balanced capacity rather than by pushing staff past safe levels. Finally, I include throughput (patients per hour per specialty) and quality proxies such as completion rate of required tests within the visit and low rates of rework due to documentation errors.

Monitoring is done through the same event log structure, extended by a few simple additions for on-time computation and resource state. Every morning, the clinic computes a daily load forecast from the event log and compares actual arrivals and waits against the forecast to detect drift. Weekly, I generate updated queue metrics per queue, resource, and patient type; I create trend charts to confirm sustained improvement and to catch relapse. Monthly, I run conformance checks against the revised schedule and test for variance spikes that signal new bottlenecks; I conduct root-cause drills on any queue where the 90th-percentile wait rises significantly. Real-time dashboards display current hour-by-hour loads, enabling on-the-fly adjustments such as flexing staff or dispatching technicians when the queue starts to form. In the event of sustained improvement, the data validates success; in the event of plateau or degradation, the monitoring triggers targeted follow-up, so gains are locked in and the clinic adapts to evolving demand.
