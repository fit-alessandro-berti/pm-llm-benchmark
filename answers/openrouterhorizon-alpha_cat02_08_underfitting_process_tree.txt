1) Example of an invalid-but-accepted trace
[Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order]

2) Why the model accepts it and why it’s wrong
- Why it’s accepted: In the given tree, the root is a sequence of [Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, xor_node, Close_Order]. The xor_node can choose the cancel_subtree = [Cancel_Order, Close_Order]. After completing cancel_subtree, the root appends its own Close_Order. Hence two Close_Order events in a row are allowed by the model.

- Why it’s wrong domain-wise:
  - Closing the order twice is illogical; once an order is canceled and closed, there should not be a second closure event.
  - Conceptually, either the cancel path should include the only Close_Order or the root should close the order, but not both.

Other examples the model also (incorrectly) allows:
- Shipping before packaging: because the “successful_subtree” is a parallel block of Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, and Ship_Order, the model can accept [Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order]. This violates the natural order where items must be packaged before shipment and payment authorization should precede fulfillment.
- Shipping without payment authorization: the same parallel block lets Ship_Order occur before or even without Authorize_Payment completing, which is unacceptable in a typical Order-to-Cash process.
