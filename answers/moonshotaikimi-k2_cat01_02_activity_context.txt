Brief Justification for Renaming Choices
1. Initiate Request has the initiating channel attached (“via Web Portal / in Branch / via Web Portal”) – the channel dictates subsequent routing.
2. Verify Documents is crucial two times in every case.  
   • First appearance always concerns an initial identity check.  
   • Second appears after either (a) the customer uploads missing documents or (b) internal corrections changed the account.  
   Adding suffixes “– Initial Identity Check”, “– Re-check After Resubmission”, and “– Post-adjustment Review” removes the ambiguity.
3. Call Customer happens for three distinct reasons. We appended the objective of each call (“Request Missing Docs”, “Resolve Account Discrepancy”, “Retrieve Walk-in Customer”, “Follow-up Confirmation”) so that the purpose is evident.
4. Adjust Account and Approve Request occur only once per case; we only kept them explicit but added the reassuring hint “Final Authorization” to Approve Request for completeness.
