<answer>To solve this problem, we need to identify cases with a specific activity sequence and timing condition, then exclude those cases from the final result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown and the corresponding DuckDB SQL query.


### **Step 1: Identify Cases with the Target Sequence**  
We first need to identify cases where the activities `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `'Create Order'`, and `'Confirm Order'` appear in direct succession (no intervening events) for the same case.  

### **Step 2: Filter for Time Difference > 5 Days**  
Among the cases identified in Step 1, we then filter only those where the time elapsed between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` events is more than 5 days.  

### **Step 3: Exclude the Identified Cases**  
Finally, we exclude the events from all cases that meet the sequence and timing condition, then return all remaining events.


### **DuckDB SQL Query**  
Here's the SQL query that implements the above logic:

```sql
WITH problematic_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT el.case_id
  FROM event_log el
  -- Find first 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event in the case
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id, timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  ) a ON el.case_id = a.case_id
  -- Find next 'Create Order' event after 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id, timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
    AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM event_log WHERE case_id = a.case_id AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition')
  ) b ON el.case_id = b.case_id
  -- Find next 'Confirm Order' event after 'Create Order'
  INNER JOIN (
    SELECT case_id, timestamp
    FROM event_log
    WHERE activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND timestamp > (SELECT timestamp FROM event_log WHERE case_id = b.case_id AND activity = 'Create Order')
  ) c ON el.case_id = c.case_id
  -- Filter cases where time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days
  WHERE (c.timestamp - b.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Return all events except those from problematic cases
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM problematic_cases pc
  WHERE e.case_id = pc.case_id
);
```


### **Explanation**  
1. **`problematic_cases` CTE**:  
   This common table expression (CTE) identifies cases that have the sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'` with a time difference between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` exceeding 5 days. It uses three inner joins to connect the events in the correct sequence and filters based on the time difference.  

2. **Final Selection**:  
   The outer query selects all events from the original `event_log` but excludes those from cases identified in the `problematic_cases` CTE. The `NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that only events from cases not meeting the sequence and timing condition are returned.  


This query effectively filters out the cases that meet the specified sequence and timing condition, preserving all other events in the `event_log`.
