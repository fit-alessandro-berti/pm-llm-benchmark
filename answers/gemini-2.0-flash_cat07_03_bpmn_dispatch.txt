The visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that describes the shipment process of goods from a Computer Hardware Shop. The diagram is divided into three horizontal lanes representing different departments: "Logistics", "Dispatch of goods - Computer Hardware Shop - Secretary", and "Warehouse".

The process starts in the "Dispatch of goods" lane with the "Ship goods" event. The next task is to "Clarify shipment method". A decision gateway then determines whether "Special handling?" is required. If "no", the process moves to check "Check if insurance is required" using "Customer Information" and "Order details". If "yes" to special handling, the process goes to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies", and then "Select logistic company and place order".  After checking insurance, it is determined "If insurance necessary". If "always" the process moves to "Write package label" after which the insurance task "Insure parcel" takes place. These two tasks then converge.

In the "Warehouse" lane, there is the task "Package goods". After "Package goods", if "48 hours" have passed, the process splits into two parallel tasks: "Notify customer about delay" and continues on. The process eventually involves the "Fill out Shipment paperwork" task and then "Move package to pickup area". Finally, there's an end event labeled "Shipment prepared".

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols to represent events (circles), tasks (rounded rectangles), gateways (diamonds), data objects (cylinder for "Customer Information", document icon for "Order details"), and sequence flows (arrows). The gateways indicate points of decision and divergence in the process flow.  The lanes clearly define the responsibilities of each department within the overall shipment process.
