###  Summary of Normative Process:

According to the **Normative Process Description**, we have two valid pathways:

---

#### **Fulfillment Path (Sufficient Inventory):**

Must follow this order:

`Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`

**Constraints:**

- **"Authorize payment"** must occur *after* "Check inventory" and *before* "Package items".
- **"Package items"** must occur *after* "Authorize payment" and *before* "Ship order".
- **"Ship order"** must occur *after* "Package items".
- **"Ship order"** must never occur after a cancellation.
- **"Close order"** must be the final activity for all cases.

---

#### **Cancellation Path (Insufficient Inventory):**

Must follow this order:

`Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`

**Constraints:**

- After "Cancel order", no fulfillment activities (e.g., "Package items", "Ship order") should occur.

---

###  Case Analysis:

---

####  **Case 1**

- `Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`

 Follows correct Fulfillment Path with proper activity order.

**No violations.**

---

####  **Case 2**

- `Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close`

**Violations:**

1. **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**
   > Violates: _"Package items" should only occur after authorization and before shipping_

2. Despite correct overall shape (fulfillment), this inversion breaks a key dependency.

**Conclusion:**  Case 2 violates normative process.

---

####  **Case 3**

- `Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close`

**Violations:**

1. **"Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment"**
   > Debatable, but implies inventory was insufficient and order was canceled. Canceling after payment is illogical if inventory fails.

2. **"Ship order" occurs _after_ "Cancel order"**
   >  Clearly violates:
   > _"Ship order" must never occur after a cancellation._

**Conclusion:**  Case 3 violates normative process.

---

####  **Case 4**

- `Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`

 Follows correct Cancellation Path.

**No violations.**

---

####  **Case 5**

- `Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close`

**Violations:**

1. **Missing "Package items"**
   > _"Package items" is a required step in the fulfillment path before shipping._

2. **"Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment"**
   > Violates: _"Package items" should occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order"._

**Conclusion:**  Case 5 violates normative process.

| 3       |  No      | "Cancel order" after "Authorize payment"; "Ship order" after "Cancel order"                                                                |
| 4       |  Yes     | –                                                                                                                                           |
| 5       |  No      | Missing "Package items"; "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment" (without packaging)                                         |

###  Conclusion:

**Cases 2, 3, and 5** **violate** the normative process.

These violations mainly involve **incorrect ordering** of activities and violation of **critical dependencies** such as:

- Authorizing payment before checking inventory.
- Packaging items before payment.
- Shipping after cancellation or without packaging.
