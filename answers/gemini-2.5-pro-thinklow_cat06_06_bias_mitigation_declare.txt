Here is the updated DECLARE model with new constraints to mitigate bias, along with a detailed explanation of the changes.

### Updated DECLARE Model

```python
# Initial DECLARE model
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}

# --- New Bias-Mitigating Constraints ---

# To model the bias mitigation, we introduce new activities:
# - ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority: An event representing the identification of a sensitive attribute.
# - ManualReview: An additional, more thorough review step.
# - BiasMitigationCheck: A specific check to ensure the decision is not influenced by bias.
# - Reject: A specific negative final decision.

# 1. Add Coexistence constraint for fair review
# Ensures that if an applicant is identified from a minority group, a ManualReview must occur in the process.
declare_model["coexistence"]["ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority"] = {
    "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

# 2. Add Response constraint to mandate a fairness check
# If an applicant is identified as a minority, a BiasMitigationCheck must eventually follow.
declare_model["response"]["ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority"] = {
    "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

# 3. Add Precedence constraint to ensure checks happen before decisions
# A final decision of "Reject" can only happen after a BiasMitigationCheck has already occurred.
declare_model["precedence"]["BiasMitigationCheck"] = {
    "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}

# 4. Add Non-Succession constraint to prevent immediate biased decisions
# A "Reject" decision cannot immediately follow the identification of a sensitive attribute.
# This forces at least one other activity (like the required BiasMitigationCheck) to occur in between.
declare_model["nonsuccession"]["ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority"] = {
    "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

To mitigate bias in the loan application process, we introduced several new activities (`ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority`, `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `Reject`) and four new constraints that enforce a fairer workflow.

1.  **`coexistence(ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority, ManualReview)`**:
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint ensures that whenever an applicant is identified as belonging to a protected minority group, their case must also include a `ManualReview`. This enforces a "two-person rule" or a more thorough check for potentially sensitive cases, reducing the chance of automated or single-person bias affecting the outcome. It guarantees that these specific cases receive extra scrutiny.

2.  **`response(ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority, BiasMitigationCheck)`**:
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint mandates that if the system flags an application based on a sensitive attribute (`ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority`), a specific `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must be performed at some point later in the process. This creates a mandatory fairness checkpoint for all sensitive cases, ensuring that a formal step is taken to validate the decision's impartiality.

3.  **`precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, Reject)`**:
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint dictates that the `BiasMitigationCheck` must occur *before* a `Reject` decision can be made. This is a crucial control to ensure that the fairness check is not a mere formality performed after the fact but is an integral part of the decision-making process that precedes any negative outcome.

4.  **`nonsuccession(ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority, Reject)`**:
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint explicitly forbids a direct sequence from `ApplicantIdentifiedAsMinority` to `Reject`. It breaks the immediate causal link where an agent might see a sensitive attribute and immediately make a negative decision. By enforcing that at least one other activity must occur between these two events, it prevents knee-jerk biased reactions and ensures that the process includes intermediate steps, such as the `BiasMitigationCheck` mandated by the other rules.
