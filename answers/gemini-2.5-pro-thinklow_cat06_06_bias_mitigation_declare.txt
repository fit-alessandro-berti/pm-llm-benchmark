Here is the updated DECLARE model with new constraints to mitigate bias, followed by a rationale for the additions.

### Updated `declare_model` with Bias Mitigation Constraints

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDED: Ensure any rejection is accompanied by a manual review
        "Reject": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDED: If race is checked, a bias mitigation check must eventually follow
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # ADDED: Link specific decisions back to the abstract FinalDecision activity
        "Approve": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        # ADDED: A rejection can only occur if a bias mitigation check has already happened
        "Reject": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        # ADDED: An application cannot be both approved and rejected
        "Approve": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        # ADDED: Prevent a direct, knee-jerk rejection immediately after checking race
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}

```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

The new constraints introduce several new activities (`Approve`, `Reject`, `CheckApplicantRace`, `BiasMitigationCheck`, `ManualReview`) and enforce rules to ensure a fairer decision-making process.

1.  **Mutually Exclusive Outcomes (`noncoexistence`)**
    *   **Constraint:** `noncoexistence("Approve", "Reject")`
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint ensures that a single loan application cannot be both approved and rejected within the same process instance. It enforces logical consistency in the final outcome.

2.  **Mandatory Review for All Rejections (`coexistence`)**
    *   **Constraint:** `coexistence("Reject", "ManualReview")`
    *   **Rationale:** This rule establishes a "four-eyes principle" for all negative decisions. It mandates that if a `Reject` activity occurs, a `ManualReview` activity must also occur in the process trace (and vice versa). This provides an essential check and balance, reducing the risk of a single person's bias leading to an unfair rejection.

3.  **Preventing Immediate Biased Decisions (`nonsuccession`)**
    *   **Constraint:** `nonsuccession("CheckApplicantRace", "Reject")`
    *   **Rationale:** This constraint prevents a `Reject` decision from occurring *immediately* after the `CheckApplicantRace` activity. It forces at least one other activity to happen in between, breaking the direct causal chain from viewing a sensitive attribute to making a negative decision and mitigating the risk of reflexive bias.

4.  **Enforcing a Bias Mitigation Workflow (`response` and `precedence`)**
    *   **Constraint 1:** `response("CheckApplicantRace", "BiasMitigationCheck")`
    *   **Constraint 2:** `precedence("Reject", "BiasMitigationCheck")`
    *   **Rationale:** These two constraints work together to create a mandatory fairness workflow.
        *   The `response` rule ensures that if an applicant's race is ever checked, a formal `BiasMitigationCheck` *must* be performed at some point later in the process.
        *   The `precedence` rule acts as a gatekeeper, stating that a `Reject` decision can *only* be made if a `BiasMitigationCheck` has already occurred.
        *   Combined, they guarantee that for any case where a sensitive attribute is viewed, a rejection cannot happen without a documented mitigation step having been completed first.

5.  **Maintaining Process Integrity (`response`)**
    *   **Constraints:** `response("Approve", "FinalDecision")` and `response("Reject", "FinalDecision")`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints link the new, specific decision activities (`Approve`, `Reject`) to the original abstract `FinalDecision` activity. This ensures that whenever a concrete decision is made, the overall process milestone of `FinalDecision` is also recorded, maintaining the high-level structure of the original model.
