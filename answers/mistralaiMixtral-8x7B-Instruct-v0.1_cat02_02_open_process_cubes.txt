 Process mining is a family of techniques used to discover, monitor, and improve business processes by extracting knowledge from event logs recorded by information systems. Traditional process mining approaches primarily focus on control-flow perspective, which emphasizes the sequence of activities and their causal dependencies in a process. However, modern business processes are often complex and involve various dimensions such as resources, data, and time, which cannot be sufficiently analyzed using control-flow perspective alone. This has led to the development of multi-dimensional process mining, which aims to incorporate multiple perspectives to analyze business processes better.

In multi-dimensional process mining, process cubes play a crucial role in analyzing business processes from different perspectives. A process cube is a data structure that stores and organizes event data based on multiple dimensions such as time, resources, and data attributes. It is an extension of the traditional OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cube concept, which is widely used in data warehousing and business intelligence applications.

The role of process cubes in multi-dimensional process mining can be summarized as follows:

1. Multi-perspective analysis: Process cubes enable the analysis of business processes from multiple perspectives, including control-flow, time, resources, and data attributes. This allows process analysts to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the process and identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.
2. Scalability: Process cubes can handle large volumes of event data and enable efficient querying and analysis of the data. This is particularly useful in analyzing complex business processes that generate vast amounts of event data.
3. Flexibility: Process cubes can be customized to store and analyze event data based on the specific needs of the organization. This allows process analysts to focus on the dimensions that are most relevant to their analysis.
4. Interactive exploration: Process cubes support interactive exploration of the process data, enabling process analysts to drill down, drill up, and slice and dice the data based on different dimensions. This allows analysts to gain insights into the process data and identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent in traditional control-flow analysis.

Process cubes differ from traditional process mining approaches in several ways. Traditional process mining approaches primarily focus on the control-flow perspective, while process cubes enable the analysis of multiple perspectives. Traditional process mining approaches are often limited in their ability to
