Based on the provided constraints and activities, it appears to outline a basic workflow for handling an "approval" or "review" type process that includes stages such as submission, approval, and payment. The primary components involved are EMPLOYEE, SUPERVISOR, PRE_APPROVER, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and MISSING (possibly representing missing information or decision makers). Below is the description based on the provided data:

1. **Initialization**: The workflow starts when an activity (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`) occurs at least once.

2. **Request Payment**:
   - Can be triggered after `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` if it is approved.
   - Can also be requested independently, perhaps for situations where a request precedes the submission.
   - If executed, there can be two outcomes: 
     * Lead to `Payment Handled`
     * Or trigger `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, indicating approval without an explicit payment action.

3. **Payment Handled**:
   - Can occur after either of the following events:
     * A request for payment (`Request Payment`)
     * An approved declaration (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`)

4. **Alternate Response**: It appears that EMPLOYEE can choose between submitting a request and payment, or instead move to obtain approval.

5. **Chain Response**:
   - After `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, the process continues with a request for payment.
   - Following `Request Payment`, it proceeds directly to handling payment.

6. **Existence**: Activities like `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, and others must occur at least once in any valid workflow path.

7. **Co-Existence**:
   - The process involves concurrent possibilities where certain activities can coexist, such as a request being made along with an approval or payment actions occurring concurrently.

8. **Succession** (or Non Succession):
   - There are constraints that ensure direct sequences between certain activities, e.g., moving from submission to either approval or payment handling directly without repetition in the process flow.

9. **Alternate Precedence**: EMPLOYEE can initiate with either a submission or request for payment; these actions precede other specified activities such as approval and handling of payments.

10. **Chain Precedence**: This indicates that once an activity like `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` occurs, the next steps are clearly defined (requesting payment and then handling it).

11. **Non Co-Existence**: Ensures there's a specific order where approval can happen before payment is requested.

This model appears to be designed for managing an internal or organizational process involving different roles such as employees seeking approvals and making payments, with supervisors approving actions and administrators overseeing overall workflow. It encapsulates various constraints on the sequence and occurrence of tasks to ensure a well-structured and controlled flow through these phases.
