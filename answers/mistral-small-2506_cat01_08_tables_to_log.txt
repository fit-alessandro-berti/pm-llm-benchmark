### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Order 1004**: Missing delivery and invoice/payment data. Assumed to be incomplete or not yet processed.
2. **Item Picking Events**: Each item pick is treated as a separate event, as they may occur at different times and by different resources.
3. **Multiple Invoices/Payments**: For `order_id 1002`, two invoices and payments are recorded separately.
4. **Resource Names**: Mapped from the `Resources` table where available.
5. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered by timestamp for each `order_id`.

This log can be directly used for process mining analysis.
