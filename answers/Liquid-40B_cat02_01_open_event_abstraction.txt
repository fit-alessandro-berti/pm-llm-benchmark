Event abstraction is a technique used in event log analysis to simplify complex event data by grouping similar events together. This can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs in several ways:

1. Simplification: By abstracting similar events, the overall complexity of the process model is reduced. This makes it easier to understand and manage the model, as there are fewer individual events to keep track of.

2. Pattern Recognition: Event abstraction can help identify patterns in the data that might not be immediately apparent when looking at individual events. This can lead to new insights and a better understanding of the underlying processes.

3. Noise Reduction: In many cases, event logs contain a lot of noise - irrelevant or redundant events that don't contribute to the overall understanding of the process. Event abstraction can help filter out this noise, making the process model more focused and relevant.

4. Scalability: As the volume of event data increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage and analyze without some form of abstraction. By grouping similar events together, event abstraction makes it possible to handle larger volumes of data.

5. Visualization: Event abstraction can also improve the visualization of process models. By reducing the number of individual events, it becomes easier to create clear and understandable visual representations of the process.

6. Performance: In terms of performance, event abstraction can help speed up the analysis of event logs. By reducing the number of events that need to be processed, the analysis can be completed more quickly.

In summary, event abstraction is a powerful tool for improving the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. It can help simplify the model, identify patterns, reduce noise, handle larger volumes of data, improve visualization, and speed up analysis.
