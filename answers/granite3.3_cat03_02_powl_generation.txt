### Explanation:

1. **Transitions & Silent Transitions:**
   - Defined each activity with corresponding transitions or silent transitions where applicable, e.g., `DNC` as a silent transition indicating successful completion of BNC without any explicit label.
   
2. **Loop and Choice Nodes:**
   - Constructed the loop (`loop`) for BNC and D&R using `OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP)`.
   - Created an exclusive choice (`xor`) between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD) using `OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR)`.

3. **Partial Orders:**
   - Defined several partial orders (`StrictPartialOrder`) to represent the sequential, parallel, and conditional dependencies between activities:
     - `po1`: Sequential from SR to CS.
     - `po2`: Parallel execution of DA and ACI following contract setup.
     - `po3`: Ensures both DA and ACI complete before starting BNC.
     - `po4`: D&R completes before making the deployment decision.
     - `po5`: Exclusive choice between CD and MD post-configuration.
     - `po6`: Concurrent execution of QA and SA.
     - `po7`: GLA only starts after both QA and SA.

4. **Connecting Nodes:**
   - Established edges (order relationships) among nodes using `.order.add_edge()` within the overall `StrictPartialOrder`. This ensures activities are executed according to the specified partial orders.

This construction faithfully captures all described process steps, including loops, choices, and concurrent tasks, adhering to the POWL model definition.
