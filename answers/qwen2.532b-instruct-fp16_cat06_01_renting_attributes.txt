In the context of fairness in machine learning and process mining, sensitive attributes typically refer to characteristics that should not influence decisions or outcomes because they could lead to unfair discrimination. Based on the information provided in your dataset summary, here's an assessment:

- **View The Property** (9151 occurrences): This is a regular event attribute indicating a property viewing activity.
- **Set Appointment** (9151 occurrences): Another regular event representing appointment setting actions.
- **Screen Prospective Tenant** (7441 occurrences), etc.: These are also normal process steps.

The more notable list for potential sensitive attributes in the context of tenant screening and property management might include:

### Resources:
This appears to be a crucial attribute related to who is performing an action during the rental or lease process. While it does not seem to contain directly personal data, it could reveal information that correlates with demographics (e.g., if certain Real Estate Agents predominantly serve specific communities). If Real Estate Agents or Landlords are acting discriminatorily based on race, gender, age, religion, national origin, etc., this could be a sensitive attribute.

### Tenant:
This is likely the most direct reference to the person involved in the rental process. Any bias against the tenant based on protected attributes (like those mentioned above) would make this a critical area for fairness concerns.

### Time-related Attributes
The time stamps and quantitative measurements associated with these events can be useful, but they do not inherently seem sensitive unless there is a pattern suggesting discrimination based on temporal factors such as certain days or hours when rejections or screenings are more likely to happen (potentially correlating with less favorable demographics).

For example:
- If tenants from particular backgrounds have fewer viewings scheduled during peak times.
- If the process duration for specific groups is consistently longer, potentially delaying their move-in.

### Conclusion
The sensitive attributes here would primarily include:

1. **Tenant**: This directly identifies the individual going through the rental or lease application process and is where most discrimination risks lie.
2. **Resource (Real Estate Agent / Landlord)**: The person responsible for key decisions in the leasing process may be biased, leading to unfair outcomes if they act based on protected characteristics.

For ensuring fairness, you would want to carefully monitor these attributes to ensure no discriminatory patterns or biases are present. This can involve reviewing how each tenant is treated and how different resources interact with applicants from various backgrounds.
