I'll help merge these logs and explain my reasoning for each decision. Here's the analysis and merged output:

**Reasoning for Decisions:**

1. **Event Matching:**
   - Matched events based on timestamp proximity (within 2-second window) and similar event names
   - Used semantic matching for different event names (e.g., "OrderReceived"  "Order Received")

2. **Timestamp Handling:**
   - Used the earlier timestamp as the primary_timestamp for merged events
   - Preserved original timestamps from both systems for reference
   - All timestamp differences were within the 2-second tolerance

3. **Event Name Standardization:**
   - Used System A's naming convention as the standard (more human-readable)
   - Mapped System B's event names to System A's where appropriate

4. **Specific Event Decisions:**
   - "Quality Check" appears only in Log B - included as standalone event
   - "Item Delivered" appears only in Log A - included as standalone event
   - "Payment Processed"/"PaymentCheck" matched despite slight name difference due to timing and context

5. **Attribute Integration:**
   - Preserved all additional attributes from System B (user_id, resource_id, notes)
   - Added source_systems array to track origin of each event
   - Used null for missing attributes in single-source events

This merged log provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process while maintaining data integrity and traceability to source systems.
