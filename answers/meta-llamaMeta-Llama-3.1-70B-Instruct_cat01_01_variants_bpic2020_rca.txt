Analyzing the provided process variants, I've identified some potential root causes for performance issues:

1. **Rejections and rework**: Variants with multiple rejections and re-submissions (e.g., Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ->...) contribute to increased performance times. This is likely due to the additional processing time and handling required for each rejection and re-submission.
2. **Multiple approvals**: Variants with multiple approvals (e.g., Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER ->...) tend to have longer performance times. This may indicate that the approval process is sequential, leading to delays between each approval step.
3. **Missing or incomplete information**: Variants with Declaration REJECTED by MISSING or Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING ->... may indicate issues with missing or incomplete information, leading to delays and rework.
4. **Long approval chains**: Variants with long approval chains (e.g., Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR ->...) tend to have longer performance times. This may indicate that the approval process is too complex or sequential.
5. **Repetitive tasks**: Variants with repetitive tasks (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ->...) may indicate inefficiencies in the process, leading to increased processing times.
6. **Lack of parallel processing**: The data suggests that most variants follow a sequential process, which may lead to delays and inefficiencies. Introducing parallel processing or concurrent approvals might help reduce performance times.
7. **Employee-related delays**: Variants with Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE or Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE may indicate delays or inefficiencies related to employee actions or decision-making.
8. **Administrative bottlenecks**: Variants with Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION as a bottleneck (e.g., Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION ->...) may indicate that the administration department is a bottleneck, leading to delays in the process.

By addressing these potential root causes, you may be able to improve the overall performance of the process and reduce processing times.
