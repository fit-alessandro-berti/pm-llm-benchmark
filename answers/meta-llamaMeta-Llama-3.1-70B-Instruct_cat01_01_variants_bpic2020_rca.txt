After analyzing the provided process variants, I've identified some potential root causes for performance issues in the process:

1. **Rejection loops**: Many variants involve rejection loops, where a declaration is rejected by one or more authorities (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, or PRE_APPROVER), followed by resubmission and re-approval. These loops can lead to increased processing time and decreased performance. (e.g., variants with frequencies 345, 188, 77, 49, 36, and 29)
2. **Multiple approvals**: Some variants require multiple approvals from different authorities (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR), which can slow down the process. (e.g., variants with frequencies 4618, 2473, and 575)
3. **Missing or incomplete information**: Variants with "REJECTED by MISSING" or "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" suggest that incomplete or missing information is causing delays. (e.g., variants with frequencies 40 and 21)
4. **Employee resubmissions**: In some cases, employees resubmit declarations after rejection, which can lead to additional processing time. (e.g., variants with frequencies 174, 134, and 11)
5. **Administrative inefficiencies**: Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions involving ADMINISTRATION suggest potential inefficiencies in this step of the process. (e.g., variants with frequencies 345, 188, 77, and 36)
6. **Bottlenecks at SUPERVISOR**: The high frequency of variants involving "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" (e.g., 4618, 2473, and 575) might indicate a bottleneck at this step, where the supervisor is a single point of failure or a constraint in the process.
7. **Lack of automation**: The presence of manual steps, such as "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" (frequency 134), might indicate opportunities for automation to improve performance.
8. **Complexity in approval workflows**: The numerous variants with different approval paths and rejections suggest that the approval workflow is complex and may benefit from simplification or optimization.

To address these performance issues, it's essential to analyze the process further, gather more data, and involve stakeholders to identify the root causes and potential solutions. Some potential improvements might include:

* Implementing automated checks for completeness and accuracy of declarations
* Streamlining approval workflows and reducing the number of required approvals
* Improving communication and feedback mechanisms for employees and authorities
* Introducing training or guidance for employees to reduce errors and rejections
* Analyzing and optimizing the SUPERVISOR's workload and approval process
* Automating manual steps where possible
* Simplifying the rejection and resubmission process

Keep in mind that these are just initial observations, and a more detailed analysis is necessary to confirm these findings and identify the most effective solutions.
