There are no explicitly named or numbered tasks in your BPMN XML snippet. Instead, the diagram is structured with events (represented by flow "breaks" and "joinings"), sequences flows connecting them, but without a clear definition of any nodes labeled as tasks within this structure.

To identify the tasks, you would typically refer to:

- Standard BPMN terminology where each flow represents an action or task
- Any annotations on flow elements that might denote roles or responsibilities

However, by simply examining your provided XML snippet, there are **no explicit named "tasks"**. All paths and divisions within the diagram connect processes as flows.

If you're working with a process model, to identify tasks explicitly:

1. Use BPMN2 spec references if specified
2. Define roles/tasks in annotations (e.g., <task name="ExampleTask">...</task>)
3. Review process design documentation or manual

Without additional context defining task naming conventions within the XML snippet itself, **there are no identifiable named "tasks"** to provide a specific list of names.
