# **Advanced Process Mining and Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.**

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To assess Precision Parts Inc.’s scheduling effectiveness, we leverage **process mining** techniques on the MES event logs to reconstruct and analyze job flows, resource utilization, and disruptions.

### **1.1 Key Process Mining Techniques & Metrics**
#### **(a) Job Flow Analysis**
- **Reconstruct Process Flows:** Use **Process Discovery (e.g., Inductive Miner, Alpha Miner)** to map actual task sequences across machines and compare against planned routes.
- **Lead Time & Makespan Analysis:**
  - Compute **job lead times** (from release to completion) and **makespan** (total shop floor time for all jobs).
  - Use **time perspective analysis** to identify delays at each stage.
- **Cycle Time Variability:**
  - Analyze **Gantt charts** and **timeline visualizations** to detect bottlenecks.

#### **(b) Waiting & Queue Time Analysis**
- **Queue Time Per Machine:**
  - Compute **average, median, and maximum waiting times** at each work center.
  - Identify machines with **persistent congestion** (e.g., CNC Milling, Heat Treatment).
- **Root Cause of Delays:**
  - Correlate waiting times with **machine breakdowns, priority changes, or upstream bottlenecks**.

#### **(c) Resource Utilization Analysis**
- **Machine & Operator Utilization:**
  - Compute **productive time vs. idle time** for each machine.
  - Identify **underutilized vs. overloaded** resources.
  - Analyze **setup time impact** on utilization.
- **Setup Time Analysis:**
  - Extract **job sequences** from logs and compute **setup time distributions** (e.g., cutting  milling vs. grinding  milling).
  - Use **sequence mining (e.g., Prefix Trees, Association Rules)** to find optimal job sequences.

#### **(d) Schedule Adherence & Tardiness**
- **Due Date Performance:**
  - Compare **planned vs. actual completion times** to measure **tardiness**.
  - Use **Gantt chart deviation analysis** to identify recurring delays.
- **Disruption Impact:**
  - Analyze **breakdowns** and **priority changes** via **event correlation** (e.g., how often delays follow machine failures?).

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Using the above analysis, we identify key inefficiencies:

### **(a) Bottleneck Identification**
- **Bottleneck Machines:**
  - **CNC Milling, Heat Treatment, and Grinding** likely have the highest queue times.
  - **Utilization Analysis** confirms whether bottlenecks are due to **capacity constraints** or **poor scheduling**.

### **(b) Poor Task Prioritization**
- **Earliest Due Date (EDD) vs. Shortest Processing Time (SPT):**
  - Current **dispensing rules** may not account for **urgent jobs** or **setup optimization**.
  - **Variant Analysis:** Compare on-time vs. late jobs—are high-priority jobs delayed due to suboptimal sequencing?

### **(c) Suboptimal Job Sequencing**
- **Setup Time Inefficiencies:**
  - If **grinding  milling** has a **20% longer setup** than **milling  grinding**, current scheduling likely ignores this.
- **Starvation of Downstream Machines:**
  - If **Cutting** is scheduled too aggressively, **Milling** may be starved.

### **(d) Disruption Handling**
- **Breakdowns & Urgent Jobs:**
  - **Event Log Analysis** shows how often **unplanned disruptions** cause cascading delays.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

### **(a) Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules**
- **FIFO/EDD lacks adaptability** to dynamic conditions (e.g., machine breakdowns).
- **No real-time feedback loop**—schedules are not adjusted based on actual shop floor state.

### **(b) Inaccurate Time Estimates**
- **Planned vs. Actual Durations** show significant **variability** (e.g., 60 min planned, 66.4 min actual).
- **Setup Time Underestimation:**
  - If **setup time is 23.5 min** but planned as **20 min**, schedules are unreliable.

### **(c) Poor Coordination & Sequence-Dependent Setups**
- **No optimized job sequencing**—leading to **excessive setup times**.
- **No batching of similar jobs** to minimize setups.

### **(d) Ineffective Disruption Handling**
- **No dynamic rescheduling** when **breakdowns or urgent jobs** occur.

## **4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
- **Core Logic:**
  - Replace static FIFO/EDD with **weighted priority rules** considering:
    - **Remaining processing time (slack time)**
    - **Due date urgency (EDD-like)**
    - **Downstream machine load (to avoid starvation)**
    - **Estimated setup time (sequence-aware scheduling)**
- **Process Mining Insights:**
  - **Setup time matrices** (from historical data) guide sequencing.
  - **Bottleneck analysis** adjusts priorities for critical machines.
- **Expected Impact:**
  - **Reduces tardiness** by prioritizing urgent jobs.
  - **Lowers WIP** by preventing starvation.
  - **Improves utilization** via setup optimization.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Machine Learning**
- **Core Logic:**
  - Use **historical task durations, breakdown frequencies, and setup times** to **predict delays**.
  - Apply **Monte Carlo simulation** to test schedules under uncertainty.
- **Process Mining Insights:**
  - **Task time distributions** (e.g., 90th percentile for safety buffers).
  - **Breakdown patterns** (e.g., MILL-03 fails more often after 8 hours).
- **Expected Impact:**
  - **More realistic lead time estimates** for customers.
  - **Proactive rescheduling** when disruptions are predicted.

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Job Sequencing**
- **Core Logic:**
  - **Batch jobs with similar setup requirements** (e.g., same material, similar tolerances).
  - Use **genetic algorithms** to optimize sequences minimizing setup time.
- **Process Mining Insights:**
  - **Setup time correlations** (e.g., Cutting  Milling = 15 min, Milling  Grinding = 25 min).
  - **Job family clustering** (group jobs by material, dimensions).
- **Expected Impact:**
  - **30% reduction in setup time** at bottleneck machines.
  - **Higher machine utilization** due to fewer setup interruptions.

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation & Continuous Improvement**

### **Discrete-Event Simulation Approach**
- **Model the Shop Floor:**
  - Use **Simul8, FlexSim, or Python-based simulations** parameterized with **mined data** (task times, breakdowns, setup matrices).
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **High Load:** Simulate 20% more jobs to test resilience.
  - **Frequent Disruptions:** Model machine breakdowns every 6 hours.
  - **Urgent Jobs:** Introduce random high-priority jobs.
- **KPI Comparison:**
  - Compare **baseline (FIFO/EDD) vs. proposed strategies** on **lead time, tardiness, WIP**.

### **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation**
- **Real-Time Process Mining:**
  - Use **CELONIS or ProcessMining.io** to **continuously monitor** KPIs.
  - **Automated alerts** if **WIP exceeds threshold** or **setup times spike**.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Retrain **predictive models** with new data (e.g., updated breakdown probabilities).
