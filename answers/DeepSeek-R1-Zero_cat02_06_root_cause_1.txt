To solve for which cases have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others, we need to calculate the total resolution time for each case (which is the time elapsed from the first event ("Receive Ticket") until the last event ("Close Ticket") for each case ID).

### Step-by-step reasoning for each case:

#### Case ID 101:
- First event (Receive Ticket) at "2024-03-01 08:00".
- Last event (Close Ticket) at "2024-03-01 10:15".
    
Total resolution time for case 101 is the difference between the timestamps:
$$
\text{2024-03-01 10:15} - \text{2024-03-01 08:00} = 2 \text{ hours }15 \text{ minutes} \text{ (or 135 minutes)}
$$

#### Case ID 102:
- First event (Receive Ticket) at "2024-03-01 08:05".
- Last event (Close Ticket) at "2024-03-02 09:15".
    
Total resolution time for case 102 is the difference between the timestamps:
$$
\text{2024-03-02 09:15} - \text{2024-03-01 08:05} = 1 \text{ day }1 \text{ hour }10 \text{ minutes}.
$$
1 day is 24 hours, so:
$$
= 24 \text{ hours } + 1 \text{ hour } + 10 \text{ minutes} = 25 \text{ hours }10 \text{ minutes}.
$$
This can also be calculated as follows:
$$
= (24 \times 60) + 60 + 10 = 1440 + 60 + 10 = 1510 \text{ minutes}.
$$
Alternatively, if we need a more intuitive breakdown:
$$
\underbrace{2024-03-01 08:05 \text{ to } 2024-03-02 08:05}_{\text{24 hours}} \text{ (i.e., until one day later at the same time)} \\
\text{2024-03-02 08:05 to 2024-03-02 09:15} = 1 \text{ hour }10 \text{ minutes} \text{ (which is 70 minutes)}.
$$
Total time is thus:
$$
24 \text{ hours } + 70 \text{ minutes} \text{ (which is 1510 minutes, as verified above)}.
$$
But for a more human-readable format, let's keep the total as:
$$
25 \text{ hours }10 \text{ minutes} \text{ (or 1510 minutes).
}
$$

#### Case ID 103:
- First event (Receive Ticket) at "2024-03-01 08:10".
- Last event (Close Ticket) at "2024-03-01 09:30".
    
Total resolution time for case 103 is the difference between the timestamps:
$$
\text{2024-03-01 09:30} - \text{2024-03-01 08:10} = 1 \text{ hour }20 \text{ minutes} \text{ (or 80 minutes)}
$$

#### Case ID 104:
- First event (Receive Ticket) at "2024-03-01 08:20".
- Last event (Close Ticket) at "2024-03-02 08:30".
    
Total resolution time for case 104 is the difference between the timestamps:
$$
\text{2024-03-02 08:30} - \text{2024-03-01 08:20} = 1 \text{ day }10 \text{ minutes}.
$$
This can be broken down similarly as:
$$
24 \text{ hours }10 \text{ minutes} \text{ (or 1440 + 10 = 1450 minutes)}
$$

#### Case ID 105:
- First event (Receive Ticket) at "2024-03-01 08:25".
- Last event (Close Ticket) at "2024-03-03 09:30".
    
Total resolution time for case 105 is the difference between the timestamps:
$$
\text{2024-03-03 09:30} - \text{2024-03-01 08:25} = 2 \text{ days }1 \text{ hour }5 \text{ minutes}.
$$
This can be broken down as follows:
$$
2 \text{ days }1 \text{ hour }5 \text{ minutes} = 2 \times 24 \text{ hours } + 1 \text{ hour } + 5 \text{ minutes} \\
= 48 \text{ hours } + 1 \text{ hour } + 5 \text{ minutes} = 49 \text{ hours }5 \text{ minutes} \\
= 49 \times 60 + 5 = 2940 + 5 = 2945 \text{ minutes}.
$$
Alternatively, another way to break it down:
$$
\underbrace{2024-03-01 08:25 \text{ to } 2024-03-03 08:25}_{\text{2 days (48 hours)}} \\
\text{2024-03-03 08:25 to 2024-03-03 09:30} = 1 \text{ hour }5 \text{ minutes} \text{ (which is 65 minutes)}.
$$
Total time is thus:
$$
48 \text{ hours } + 65 \text{ minutes} = 48 \times 60 + 65 = 2880 + 65 = 2945 \text{ minutes}.
$$

### Summary of Total Resolution Times (in minutes):
- Case 101: 135 minutes (2 hours 15 minutes)
- Case 102: 1510 minutes (25 hours 10 minutes, or approximately 1 day 1 hour 10 minutes)
- Case 103: 80 minutes (1 hour 20 minutes)
- Case 104: 1450 minutes (24 hours 10 minutes, or approximately 1 day 10 minutes)
- Case 105: 2945 minutes (49 hours 5 minutes, or approximately 2 days 1 hour 5 minutes)

### Identifying Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times:
1. **Average resolution time (in minutes):**
$$
\frac{135 + 1510 + 80 + 1450 + 2945}{5} = \frac{6120}{5} = 1224 \text{ minutes}.
$$
2. To find out what "significantly longer" means, let us check the standard deviation of the resolution times (excluding any "significantly longer" cases might need us to first identify outliers such as cases that are two standard deviations away from the mean). 

To find the standard deviation, first we need to compute the squared differences from the mean for each case:
$$
(135 - 1224)^2 = (-1089)^2 = 1185921\\
(1510 - 1224)^2 = 286^2 = 81796\\
(80 - 1224)^2 = (-1144)^2 = 1308736\\
(1450 - 1224)^2 = 226^2 = 51076\\
(2945 - 1224)^2 = 1721^2 = 2961841.
$$
Sum of squared differences:
$$
1185921 + 81796 + 1308736 + 51076 + 2961841 = 5589370.
$$
Variance (average squared differences from the mean):
$$
\frac{5589370}{5} = 1117874.
$$
Standard deviation:
$$
\sqrt{1117874} \approx 1057.3.
$$
3. To identify "significantly longer" cases, a common criterion is any case that has a resolution time that is more than one or two standard deviations above the mean. Let us check the mean plus one standard deviation:
$$
1224 + 1057.3 = 2281.3 \text{ minutes}.
$$
This means any case taking more than 2281.3 minutes might be considered "significantly longer" than the average. Another way to identify outliers is to check any case that takes longer than the mean by a significant margin such as a 50% increase:
$$
1.5 \times 1224 = 1836 \text{ minutes}.
$$
Based on this, any case taking more than 1836 minutes could be considered "significantly longer."

Based on the "mean + one standard deviation" threshold, only case 105 (2945 minutes) is significantly longer than the average (since 2945 > 2281.3). 

However, using a "mean + 50% of mean" threshold (1836 minutes), cases 102 (1510 minutes), 104 (1450 minutes), and 105 (2945 minutes) could be considered "longer" than average, but only cases where the total resolution time exceeds 1836 minutes (which would make cases 102 and 104 "longer" but not "significantly longer" compared to case 105). 

However, an intuitive comparison shows that cases 102 and 104 also took more than a day while cases 101 and 103 were resolved on the same day. Thus, cases 102, 104, and particularly 105 seem to take longer. However, case 105 takes by far the longest.

### Potential root causes for the performance issues:

#### Case 101:
- Process seems relatively smooth and quick. Total time is 2 hours and 15 minutes.

#### Case 102:
- Took a total of 25 hours and 10 minutes. An "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" event occurred here which might have caused a delay. The time from "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" at 11:30 on 2024-03-01 to "Investigate Issue" (which seems to be the next activity after escalation) is:
$$
\text{2024-03-01 14:00} - \text{2024-03-01 11:30} = 2 \text{ hours }30 \text{ minutes}.
$$
However, a more significant delay appears from "Investigate Issue" on 2024-03-01 14:00 until "Resolve Ticket" on 2024-03-02 09:00:
$$
\text{2024-03-02 09:00} - \text{2024-03-01 14:00} = 19 \text{ hours}.
$$
This includes an overnight period where the ticket might not have been actively worked on until the next day.

#### Case 103:
- Process seems very smooth and quick. Total time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.

#### Case 104:
- Took a total of 24 hours and 10 minutes. The time from "Triage Ticket" at 2024-03-01 09:00 to "Assign to Level-1 Agent" at 2024-03-01 09:30 was only 30 minutes, but a significant delay appears from "Assign to Level-1 Agent" at 2024-03-01 09:30 until "Investigate Issue" at 2024-03-01 13:00:
$$
\text{2024-03-01 13:00} - \text{2024-03-01 09:30} = 3 \text{ hours }30 \text{ minutes}.
$$
Another significant delay appears from "Investigate Issue" on 2024-03-01 13:00 until "Resolve Ticket" on 2024-03-02 08:00:
$$
\text{2024-03-02 08:00} - \text{2024-03-01 13:00} = 19 \text{ hours}.
$$
This includes an overnight period until the next morning.

#### Case 105:
- Took a total of 49 hours and 5 minutes. An "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" event occurred here which seems to have caused a significant delay. The time from "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" on 2024-03-01 10:00 until the next "Investigate Issue" event on 2024-03-02 14:00 is:
$$
\text{2024-03-02 14:00} - \text{2024-03-01 10:00} = 28 \text{ hours}.
$$
Another delay appears from "Investigate Issue" on 2024-03-02 14:00 until "Resolve Ticket" on 2024-03-03 09:00:
$$
\text{2024-03-03 09:00} - \text{2024-03-02 14:00} = 19 \text{ hours}.
$$
This again includes an overnight period until the next morning.

### Factors that could be leading to increased cycle times:
1. **Escalation to a higher-level agent or team:**
   - Cases 102 and 105 both experienced escalations ("Escalate to Level-2 Agent"), which seem to contribute to longer resolution times. This could indicate that escalations introduce new waiting times or that Level-2 agents have a higher workload or lower response times.

2. **Overnight delays (working hours vs. non-working hours):**
   - For cases 102, 104, and 105, there are long gaps that span overnight periods where no activity is recorded until the next day. It seems that any activity that runs into the evening might only be picked up the next day, thus increasing the total case duration. 

3. **Investigation time and delays before resolving the ticket:**
   - For case 102, the "Investigate Issue" step took from 14:00 until 9:00 the next day (19 hours including an overnight period).
   - For case 104, the "Investigate Issue" step took from 13:00 until 8:00 the next day (19 hours including an overnight period).
   - For case 105, the "Investigate Issue" step occurred twice (once before and once after the escalation), with a 28-hour gap from "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" until the second "Investigate Issue" event which also spans an overnight period.

### Propose insights or recommendations:
1. **Streamline the escalation process:**
   - Make sure that once a ticket is escalated, there should be a quick handover and prompt action by the Level-2 agents. A possible way to do this is by verifying that Level-2 agents are not overloaded and are able to handle escalations efficiently.

2. **Address working hours and round-the-clock support:**
   - If the nature of the business allows it, having round-the-clock support or at least extending support hours could help in reducing the "overnight" delays where no activities are logged until the next working day. Another option could be to make sure that tickets are assigned such that any ticket received is worked on until it reaches a state where it can be "paused" until the next day only if necessary.

3. **Prioritize "Investigate Issue" step:**
   - Once a ticket is assigned, make sure that the "Investigate Issue" step occurs promptly. There seems to be a significant delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" in case 104 (3 hours 30 minutes), which should ideally be minimized.

4. **Automate triage and assignment steps where possible:**
   - Automation could help in reducing the time between "Receive Ticket" and "Investigate Issue" steps. For instance, automated triage could help in immediately assigning the ticket to the right level.

5. **Monitor and analyze escalations:**
   - Identify why cases are being escalated and if there are any common issues that could be addressed at the Level-1 agent stage through additional training or resources.

These recommendations aim to reduce the total resolution times and make the process more efficient.
