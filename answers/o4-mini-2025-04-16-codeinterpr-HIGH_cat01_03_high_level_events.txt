Below is a twopart answer. First we define the highlevel activities (with names, their constituent lowlevel events and grouping logic). Then we show, for cases A1 and B2, how each case’s timeline collapses into those highlevel steps.

1. High-Level Activity Definitions

  1) Material Preparation  
     • Low-level events:  
       – Retrieve raw metal sheet  
       – Scan barcode  
       – Place metal sheet on table  
       – Align metal sheet  
       – Preheat metal sheet  
     • Name: “Material Preparation”  
     • Rationale: these five actions are all about getting the raw part ready for processing—identification (scan), handling (retrieve/place), positioning (align) and pre-heating—all within a short timewindow and by the same “setup” resources.

  2) Welding Assembly  
     • Low-level events:  
       – Pick up welding tool  
       – Weld corner A  
       – Weld corner B  
     • Name: “Welding Assembly”  
     • Rationale: operator/robot picks the tool then performs all welding actions in one contiguous block—clearly the “join” or “assembly” phase.

  3) Weld Quality Inspection  
     • Low-level event:  
       – Measure weld integrity  
     • Name: “In-Process Weld Inspection”  
     • Rationale: immediately after welding, the system checks weld quality. It’s a distinct QA step before any further processing.

  4) Surface Treatment  
     • Low-level events:  
       – Apply protective coating  
       – Dry coating  
     • Name: “Protective Coating & Drying”  
     • Rationale: these two events form the finishing/“surface treatment” phase, performed by coating and heating units in one logical group.

  5) Final Quality Inspection  
     • Low-level event:  
       – Visual check  
     • Name: “Final Visual Inspection”  
     • Rationale: a last, operator-driven check to confirm the completed part meets all specs.

2. Case-Level Aggregation

For each CaseID we map its timeline into the above five high-level steps, showing start/end timestamps and listing the low-level events collapsed.

Case A1:  
  1. Material Preparation  
     • Start: 2024-03-01 08:00:05  
     • End:   2024-03-01 08:00:20  
     • Events: Retrieve raw metal sheet; Scan barcode; Place metal sheet on table; Align metal sheet; Preheat metal sheet  

  2. Welding Assembly  
     • Start: 2024-03-01 08:01:00  
     • End:   2024-03-01 08:01:10  
     • Events: Pick up welding tool; Weld corner A; Weld corner B  

  3. In-Process Weld Inspection  
     • Timestamp: 2024-03-01 08:01:20  
     • Event: Measure weld integrity  

  4. Protective Coating & Drying  
     • Start: 2024-03-01 08:01:30  
     • End:   2024-03-01 08:01:45  
     • Events: Apply protective coating; Dry coating  

  5. Final Visual Inspection  
     • Timestamp: 2024-03-01 08:02:00  
     • Event: Visual check  

Case B2 (same structure / durations approx.):  
  1. Material Preparation  
     • 08:00:05–08:00:25  
     • Retrieve raw metal sheet; Scan barcode; Place on table; Align; Preheat  

  2. Welding Assembly  
     • 08:01:03–08:01:12  
     • Pick up welding tool; Weld corner A; Weld corner B  

  3. In-Process Weld Inspection  
     • 08:01:22  
     • Measure weld integrity  

  4. Protective Coating & Drying  
     • 08:01:35–08:01:50  
     • Apply protective coating; Dry coating  

  5. Final Visual Inspection  
     • 08:02:05  
     • Visual check

Rationale Summary

- Temporal contiguity: each high-level step groups events that occur back-to-back within seconds or a few tens of seconds.  
- Resource/logical cohesion:  
  • “Material Preparation” all by Operator A and Robot Arm/Heating Unit #1.  
  • “Welding Assembly” by Operator B exclusively.  
  • “Coating” by Coating Unit #3 + Heating Unit #2.  
  • Inspections by quality sensors or Operator C.  
- Process semantics: the five phases reflect standard manufacturing flow—prepare, assemble, inspect in-process, finish, final check—making the log much easier to read and analyze at a glance.
