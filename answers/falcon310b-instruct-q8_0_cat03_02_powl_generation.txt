This code defines the complex digital service provisioning process using POWL models in Python. It accurately reflects the described scenario with mandatory steps, loops, exclusive choices, and partially ordered tasks as specified. The silent transitions are used to represent optional steps within the loop and deployment choice. The partial order relationships ensure that the steps are executed in the correct sequence or concurrently as required by the process description.
