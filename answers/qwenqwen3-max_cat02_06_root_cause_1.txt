To analyze the event log for performance issues in the “Customer Support Ticket Resolution” process, we’ll follow a structured approach:

---

### **1. Calculate Total Resolution Time per Case**

Resolution time = **Close Ticket timestamp – Receive Ticket timestamp**

| Case ID | Receive Timestamp     | Close Timestamp       | Total Duration |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 101    | 2024-03-01 08:00       | 2024-03-01 10:15       | **2h 15m**     |
| 102    | 2024-03-01 08:05       | 2024-03-02 09:15       | **25h 10m**    |
| 103    | 2024-03-01 08:10       | 2024-03-01 09:30       | **1h 20m**     |
| 104    | 2024-03-01 08:20       | 2024-03-02 08:30       | **24h 10m**    |
| 105    | 2024-03-01 08:25       | 2024-03-03 09:30       | **49h 5m**     |

**Observation**:  
- Cases **102**, **104**, and especially **105** have **significantly longer resolution times** compared to the fast-resolved cases (101 and 103).
- Average resolution time (excluding outliers): ~1.7 hours.
- Outliers: **102 (25h)**, **104 (24h)**, **105 (49h)** — all **>14x longer** than average.

### **2. Identify Root Causes of Delays**

We examine the **sequence and timing** of activities in delayed cases.

#### **Common Pattern: Escalation to Level-2 Agent**
- **Case 102**: Escalated at 11:30 on Day 1  Next activity (Investigate) only at **14:00 same day**, then **no activity until next morning (09:00 Day 2)**.
- **Case 105**: Escalated at **10:00 Day 1**  Next “Investigate Issue” not until **14:00 Day 2**  **38-hour gap**.
- **Case 104**: **No formal escalation**, but large delay between **Assign (09:30 Day 1)** and **Investigate (13:00 Day 1)**  then **19-hour gap** until resolution next morning.

#### **Key Bottlenecks Identified**:

| Case | Delay Segment | Duration | Likely Cause |
|------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| 102 | Escalate  Investigate (Level-2) | 2.5h (same day), then 19h overnight | **Handoff delay + overnight wait** |
| 104 | Assign  Investigate | 3.5h (09:30  13:00) + 19h overnight | **Agent inaction or backlog** |
| 105 | Escalate  Investigate (Level-2) | **38 hours** (10:00 Day 1  14:00 Day 2) | **Severe escalation bottleneck** |

> **Critical Insight**:  
> **Escalation to Level-2 is strongly correlated with long resolution times.**  
> In both escalated cases (102, 105), the **Level-2 investigation starts only the next business day**—suggesting **no same-day Level-2 support** or **poor handoff coordination**.

Additionally, **Case 104** shows a long delay **without escalation**, indicating that **Level-1 agents may also delay investigation**—possibly due to overload, unclear ownership, or waiting for customer input (though not logged).

### **3. Analysis of Process Flow & Recommendations**

#### **Root Causes Summary**:
1. **Escalation Handoff Inefficiency**:  
   - Once escalated, Level-2 agents **do not act until the next day**, adding **24+ hours** of idle time.
   - No indication of parallel work or acknowledgment of escalation.

2. **Idle Time Between Assignment and Investigation**:  
   - In Case 104, 3.5 hours pass before investigation begins—suggesting **assignment  immediate action**.
   - May reflect **agent multitasking**, **lack of prioritization**, or **missing information**.

3. **Lack of SLA Monitoring**:  
   - No evidence of alerts or interventions during long idle periods.

---

### **Recommendations to Reduce Cycle Time**:

1. **Improve Escalation Protocol**:
   - Implement **same-day acknowledgment** for escalated tickets (e.g., Level-2 must triage within 2 hours).
   - Introduce **escalation SLAs** (e.g., “Level-2 investigation must begin within 4 business hours”).

2. **Monitor and Reduce Idle Time**:
   - Track **time between “Assign” and “Investigate”** as a KPI.
   - Use **automated reminders** if no action is taken within 1 hour of assignment.

3. **Clarify Ownership & Workflow**:
   - Ensure that “Assign to Agent” triggers an **active work state**, not just a queue placement.
   - Consider adding a “Pending Customer Input” or “Waiting for Resource” activity to distinguish **true delays** from **blocked states**.

4. **Introduce Tiered Response Times**:
   - Define resolution time targets:
     - Level-1: Resolve within 4 hours.
     - Level-2: Begin investigation within 4 hours of escalation.

5. **Analyze Resource Allocation**:
   - If Level-2 team is consistently unavailable same-day, consider **extending Level-2 coverage hours** or **empowering Level-1 agents** with more tools/knowledge to reduce escalations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The primary driver of long resolution times is **delays following escalation to Level-2 support**, compounded by **overnight idle periods** and **slow initiation of investigation**. Addressing the escalation handoff process and reducing idle time between assignment and action will significantly improve overall cycle time and customer satisfaction.
