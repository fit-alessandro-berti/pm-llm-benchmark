### 1. **Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

Let’s calculate the total resolution time (from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”) for each case:

- **Case 101**:  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:00  
  End: 2024-03-01 10:15  
   **Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes**

- **Case 102**:  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:05  
  End: 2024-03-02 09:15  
   **Duration: 25 hours 10 minutes**

- **Case 103**:  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:10  
  End: 2024-03-01 09:30  
   **Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes**

- **Case 104**:  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:20  
  End: 2024-03-02 08:30  
   **Duration: 24 hours 10 minutes**

- **Case 105**:  
  Start: 2024-03-01 08:25  
  End: 2024-03-03 09:30  
   **Duration: 49 hours 5 minutes**

>  **Cases with significantly longer resolution times: 102, 104, and 105.**  
> These take 24+ hours, while 101 and 103 are resolved within 2.5 hours.

### 2. **Determine Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

Let’s analyze the delayed cases for bottlenecks:

####  **Case 102**:
- **Escalation occurred**: “Escalate to Level-2 Agent” at 11:30 on Day 1.
- **Gap before escalation**:  
  Assigned at 09:00  Escalated at 11:30  **2.5 hours before escalation** (possibly Level-1 agent struggling).
- **Gap after escalation**:  
  Escalated at 11:30  Investigation starts at 14:00  **2.5 hours delay** before Level-2 begins work.
- **Resolution gap**:  
  Investigation ends at 14:00  Resolved next day at 09:00  **19-hour gap** (overnight, but includes non-business hours?).
- **Total delay concentrated around escalation handoff and next-day resolution.**

####  **Case 104**:
- **No escalation** — handled by Level-1 throughout.
- Assigned at 09:30  Investigation starts at 13:00  **3.5-hour gap** before investigation begins.
- Investigation starts 13:00 Day 1  Resolved 08:00 Day 2  **19-hour gap** (overnight).
- **Root cause**: Long idle time between assignment and investigation — possibly agent overload, poor workload distribution, or ticket deprioritization.

####  **Case 105**:
- **Escalation occurred**: at 10:00 on Day 1.
- Assigned at 09:00  Escalated at 10:00  **Only 1 hour** — suggests quick recognition of complexity.
- **Massive delay after escalation**:  
  Escalated 10:00 Day 1  Investigation starts 14:00 Day 2  **28-hour gap** (includes full day + 4 hours).
- Then resolved 09:00 Day 3  **19-hour gap after investigation**.
- **Root cause**: Extreme delay in Level-2 team picking up escalated tickets — possibly understaffed, poor SLA, or no urgency mechanism.

### 3. **Analysis of Factors Leading to Increased Cycle Times & Recommendations**

####  **Key Bottlenecks Identified**:

1. **Escalation Delays**:
   - In both escalated cases (102, 105), there are multi-hour (or multi-day) delays between escalation and the start of Level-2 investigation.
   - This indicates **poor handoff protocols or under-resourced Level-2 teams**.

2. **Idle Time Between Assignment and Investigation**:
   - Case 104 (non-escalated) shows a 3.5-hour gap — suggesting **Level-1 agents are overloaded or not prioritizing tickets effectively**.
   - Case 102 also shows 2.5 hours at Level-1 before escalation — possibly indicating **lack of clear escalation criteria or training**.

3. **Overnight/Weekend Delays Without Follow-up**:
   - All long-running cases span multiple days with large idle periods (e.g., 19-hour gaps).
   - Suggests **no after-hours coverage or automated prioritization for pending tickets**.

4. **Lack of SLA Enforcement**:
   - No visible time targets between stages — delays accumulate without alerts or intervention.

---

###  **Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**

####  **Improve Escalation Workflow**:
- Implement **escalation SLAs** (e.g., Level-2 must begin investigation within 1 hour of escalation).
- Automate alerts/notifications to Level-2 team leads when tickets are escalated.
- Consider **dedicated escalation queues with higher priority tagging**.

####  **Reduce Idle Time in Level-1**:
- Monitor time between “Assign” and “Investigate” — if >1 hour, trigger supervisor alert.
- Implement **auto-reassignment or load balancing** if agent workload exceeds threshold.
- Provide **better triage guidelines** so agents escalate sooner when appropriate (like Case 105 did well — escalated within 1 hour).

####  **Address Multi-Day Delays**:
- Implement **business-hour aware cycle time metrics** to distinguish between “waiting for business hours” vs “process inefficiency”.
- For tickets unresolved by EOD, trigger **automated follow-up or re-prioritization** the next morning.
- Consider **shift overlap or on-call Level-2 support** for critical escalations.

####  **Performance Monitoring & Dashboards**:
- Track **average duration per process stage** (e.g., Triage, Assignment  Investigation, Escalation  Resolution).
- Flag cases that exceed stage-specific thresholds for root cause analysis.
- Use this data for **agent coaching, staffing adjustments, and process redesign**.

###  **Summary Table: Bottleneck Analysis**

| Case | Total Time | Escalated? | Major Delay Location                     | Likely Root Cause                     |
|------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 101  | 2h15m      | No         | None — efficient                         | —                                      |
| 102  | 25h10m     | Yes        | Post-escalation (2.5h + 19h gaps)        | Slow Level-2 pickup, overnight delay   |
| 103  | 1h20m      | No         | None — efficient                         | —                                      |
| 104  | 24h10m     | No         | Pre-investigation (3.5h gap) + overnight | Agent delay, no urgency mechanism      |
| 105  | 49h05m     | Yes        | Post-escalation (28h gap!)               | Severe Level-2 bottleneck or neglect   |

###  **Conclusion**

The primary drivers of long resolution times are:
- **Delays in escalation handling** (especially Level-2 responsiveness),
- **Idle time between assignment and investigation** (workload or prioritization issues),
- **Lack of time-bound SLAs or automated escalation triggers**.

By implementing **stage-based SLAs**, **automated alerts**, **workload balancing**, and **performance monitoring**, the organization can significantly reduce cycle times and improve customer satisfaction.

>  **Quick Win**: Start by enforcing a 1-hour SLA for Level-2 to begin investigation after escalation — this alone could cut resolution times for Cases 102 and 105 by 50% or more.
