### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To perform process mining effectively, the data from GPS trackers, driver handheld scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs must be preprocessed and integrated into a cohesive event log. The following steps outline this process:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Timestamp Alignment**: Ensure all timestamps across sources are standardized (e.g., UTC) and synchronized.
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Address gaps in GPS data or scanner logs by interpolating missing values where possible or flagging incomplete records for exclusion.
   - **Data Deduplication**: Remove duplicate entries caused by overlapping systems (e.g., GPS and scanner recording the same event).

2. **Event Log Construction**:
   - Define a **Case ID** that uniquely identifies each delivery vehicle’s operational day (e.g., `Vehicle-Day`).
   - Map events to activities, ensuring consistency in naming conventions (e.g., "Depart Depot" vs. "Leaving Depot").
   - Include relevant attributes such as Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Package ID, Location, Speed, and Event Type.

3. **Challenges**:
   - **Granularity Mismatch**: GPS data is continuous, while scanner logs are discrete. Aggregating GPS data into meaningful intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) can help align with scanner events.
   - **Semantic Ambiguity**: Events like "Unscheduled Stop" may have multiple causes (e.g., traffic jam, engine issue). Additional metadata or manual annotations may be needed to clarify these.
   - **Data Volume**: Six months of detailed data could result in millions of events. Efficient storage and querying mechanisms (e.g., using a process mining tool like Celonis or Disco) are essential.

#### **Process Discovery**
Using process discovery algorithms such as the **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristics Miner**, or **Inductive Miner**, we can generate a visual representation of the actual delivery process. Key steps include:
- Identifying frequent patterns and deviations in the sequence of activities.
- Highlighting common paths and exceptions (e.g., failed deliveries, maintenance stops).
- Visualizing bottlenecks or delays through activity durations and frequencies.

The resulting process model will provide insights into:
- How drivers actually execute their routes compared to planned sequences.
- The frequency and impact of unplanned activities (e.g., traffic jams, failed deliveries).

#### **Conformance Checking**
Conformance checking involves comparing the discovered process model against the planned routes from the dispatch system. Techniques include:
- **Token Replay**: Simulating planned routes over the actual process model to detect deviations.
- **Alignment Analysis**: Quantifying differences in activity sequences, timing, and resource usage.

**Deviations to Look For**:
- **Sequence Deviations**: Drivers skipping stops or taking alternative routes.
- **Timing Differences**: Significant delays at specific points (e.g., prolonged idle times).
- **Unplanned Stops**: Frequent occurrences of unscheduled stops due to traffic, breakdowns, or other reasons.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
To evaluate Speedy Parcels’ operations, we define the following KPIs:
1. **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of deliveries completed within the customer-requested time window.
   - Formula: `(Deliveries on time / Total Deliveries) * 100`
2. **Average Time per Delivery Stop**: Total time spent at customer locations divided by the number of stops.
   - Formula: `Total Service Time / Number of Stops`
3. **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio**: Ratio of total travel time to total service time.
   - Formula: `Total Travel Time / Total Service Time`
4. **Fuel Consumption per km/package**: Fuel consumed divided by distance traveled or number of packages delivered.
   - Formula: `Fuel Used / Distance Traveled`
5. **Vehicle Utilization Rate**: Proportion of time vehicles are actively delivering versus idle.
   - Formula: `(Active Time / Total Shift Time) * 100`
6. **Rate of Failed Deliveries**: Percentage of attempted deliveries that fail.
   - Formula: `(Failed Deliveries / Total Attempts) * 100`

These KPIs can be calculated directly from the event log by aggregating timestamps and associated attributes.

#### **Bottleneck Identification**
Using techniques like **Performance Mining** and **Variant Analysis**, we identify bottlenecks:
- **Performance Mining**: Analyze activity durations to pinpoint slow-moving segments (e.g., prolonged idle times at specific locations).
- **Variant Analysis**: Compare high-performing routes/drivers with low-performing ones to identify patterns (e.g., certain routes consistently experience delays).

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
- **Traffic Hotspots**: Areas with recurring low-speed events.
- **High Variability in Service Times**: Some customers may require significantly more interaction time.
- **Driver Behavior**: Inconsistent driving speeds or excessive idling.

Quantify impacts by correlating bottlenecks with KPIs (e.g., higher fuel consumption in congested areas).

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Suboptimal Route Planning**
Static routes may not account for real-time traffic or demand fluctuations. Process mining can reveal discrepancies between planned and actual routes, highlighting inefficiencies.

#### **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations**
By analyzing historical travel times, we can identify systematic underestimations leading to missed deadlines.

#### **Impact of Traffic Congestion**
Correlate GPS speed data with timestamps to identify congestion patterns and their contribution to delays.

#### **High Variability in Service Times**
Analyze dwell times at customer locations to determine if certain areas or types of deliveries take longer.

#### **Vehicle Breakdowns**
Frequent unscheduled maintenance stops indicate poor vehicle condition or insufficient preventive maintenance.

#### **Driver Behavior**
Compare performance metrics across drivers to identify outliers (e.g., excessive idling, slower speeds).

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Target**: Reduce delays caused by traffic congestion.
- **Root Cause**: Static routes fail to adapt to real-time conditions.
- **Insights**: Use GPS data to identify congestion patterns and adjust routes dynamically.
- **Expected Impact**: Improved On-Time Delivery Rate and reduced Fuel Consumption per km.

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories**
- **Target**: Minimize unnecessary travel time.
- **Root Cause**: Overlapping or inefficiently assigned territories.
- **Insights**: Analyze historical route performance to redefine territories based on proximity and demand density.
- **Expected Impact**: Lower Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio and increased Vehicle Utilization Rate.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Target**: Reduce vehicle breakdowns during shifts.
- **Root Cause**: Reactive maintenance leads to unexpected stoppages.
- **Insights**: Identify patterns in maintenance logs and correlate them with vehicle usage data to predict failures.
- **Expected Impact**: Fewer unscheduled stops and improved Vehicle Utilization Rate.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Constraints**
- **Driver Working Hours**: Ensure optimized routes do not exceed legal working limits.
- **Vehicle Capacities**: Balance package loads to avoid overloading.
- **Customer Time Windows**: Prioritize deliveries within requested windows.

#### **Continuous Monitoring**
Implement process mining dashboards to track:
- Real-time adherence to planned routes.
- Daily/Weekly trends in KPIs.
- Emerging issues (e.g., new traffic hotspots).

**Metrics to Track**:
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Average Time per Delivery Stop
- Rate of Failed Deliveries

By continuously monitoring these metrics, Speedy Parcels can sustain improvements and quickly address new challenges.
