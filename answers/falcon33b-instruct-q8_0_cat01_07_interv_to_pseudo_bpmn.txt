**Process Model Description:**

1. **Activity/Task Sequence:**
   - *Receive Invoice:* Upon receipt by Accounts Payable (AP).
   - *Verify PO Matching:* AP checks invoice against existing Purchase Order (PO) in the system.
   - *Request Supplier Confirmation:* If the PO is missing or incorrect, AP sends a request to suppliers via email for clarification.
   - *Match Line Items:* Upon supplier confirmation, AP matches invoice line items with the verified PO in the system.
   - *Forwarding to Purchasing:** Once matched, AP forwards the validated invoice to Purchasing for further review.
   - *Purchasing Review:* Purchases Department reviews the invoice against their orders to confirm accuracy and completeness.
   - *Manager Approval:** If no discrepancies are noted, the purchasing officer forwards the invoice to the department manager for final approval.
   - *Department Manager Confirmation:* The manager approves the invoice if all conditions are met.
   - *Payment Scheduling:* Upon manager’s approval, the invoice is scheduled for payment within Accounts Payable's system.

2. **Sequence Flow:**
   - Start -> Receive Invoice -> Verify PO Matching -> Request Supplier Confirmation (if mismatch) -> Match Line Items -> Forwarding to Purchasing -> Purchasing Review -> Manager Approval -> Payment Scheduling -> End

3. **Gateways/Decision Points:**
   - *Mismatch Handling:* Decision point after verifying PO matching, where AP decides whether to request supplier clarification or escalate the issue.
   - *Supplier Confirmation:* Decision point for purchasing department based on supplier confirmation received.
   - *Discrepancy Review:* Decision at Purchasing level before forwarding to manager for approval, reviewing discrepancies noted.
   - *Manager Approval:** Manager’s decision point following invoice review, either approving or rejecting the invoice.

4. **Roles/Participants:**
   - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) -> Receives invoices and forwards them for verification.
   - Purchasing Officer (Dan) -> Reviews PO against received invoices.
   - Department Manager (Carlos) -> Final approval stage prior to invoice addition to payment cycle.
   - Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) -> Handles exceptions and ensures non-stagnation of invoices awaiting resolution.
   - Purchasing Relationship Manager (Karen) -> Indirectly involved through supplier liaison for missing or incorrect details.

5. **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**  
   - Input: Purchase Orders (POs), Invoices, Supplier communications and responses.
   - Output: Payment schedules and records within the AP system.

6. **Exceptions/Variations:**
   - Informal contracts where POs are not formally used for billing.
   - Delays in supplier response due to business conditions or external factors necessitating a longer negotiation process than anticipated.
   - Inconsistencies in invoice details that require manual reconciliation and coordination, such as discrepancies in pricing or quantity.
   - Situations where the initial invoice does not match any PO, requiring alternate procedures like creating retrospective POs or rejecting the invoice entirely.

This textual model captures the primary elements of the invoice approval process, acknowledging potential variability and exceptions while providing a clear, structured overview based on stakeholder accounts.
