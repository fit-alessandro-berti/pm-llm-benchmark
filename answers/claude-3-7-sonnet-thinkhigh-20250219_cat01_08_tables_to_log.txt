# Integrated Event Log for Process Mining

After analyzing the provided ERP data tables, I've created a comprehensive event log that tracks each order from creation to payment. I've used `order_id` as the Case ID and extracted events from all tables to create a chronological record of the order-to-payment process.

## Event Log

## Notes and Assumptions

1. **Activity Names**: I've derived activity names from the corresponding tables (Orders, Order Lines, Delivery, Invoice, and Payments).

2. **Multiple Events per Order**: For activities like "Item Picked," "Order Dispatched," and "Order Arrived," some orders have multiple events due to multiple items or split shipments.

3. **Resources**: For each activity, I've included the responsible person or organization based on the corresponding ID fields and the Resources table.

4. **Chronological Order**: All events are arranged in chronological order based on their timestamps.

5. **Incomplete Cases**: Order 1004 appears to be incomplete, with only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" events. This may represent an in-progress order.

6. **Payment Resource**: The Payments table doesn't specify a resource/actor who processed the payment, so these fields are left blank.

7. **Invoice-Delivery Relationship**: For orders with multiple deliveries/invoices (like Order 1002), I've used timestamps to infer which invoice corresponds to which delivery.

This event log provides a complete view of the order-to-payment process and is suitable for process mining analysis to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities.
