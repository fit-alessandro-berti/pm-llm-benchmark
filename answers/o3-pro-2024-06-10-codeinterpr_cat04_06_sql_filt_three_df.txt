-- 1) For every event we look at the *previous* and the *next* event
--    that belong to the same case (ordered by timestamp).
-- 2) If the current event is ‘Create Order’, the previous one is
--    ‘Approve Purchase Requisition’, the next one is ‘Confirm Order’
--    and the gap between the current- and next-event timestamps is
--    larger than 5 days, then the case is an “offending” case.
-- 3) Finally we return every event that does NOT belong to any
--    offending case.

Explanation of the key points

1. `ordered` windowcomputes  
   • the activity immediately before (`LAG`) and after (`LEAD`) each event, and  
   • the timestamp of the following event (`next_ts`).

2. In `offending_cases` we keep a case when the middle event of the trio is exactly  
   ‘Create Order’, its predecessor is ‘Approve Purchase Requisition’, its successor is  
   ‘Confirm Order’, and the elapsed time between the second and the third event exceeds five days (`> INTERVAL '5 days'`).

3. The final query excludes every event whose `case_id` occurs in `offending_cases`, leaving only the events from cases that do **not** match the required sequence plus time condition.
