To diagnose the root causes of performance issues based on the process data you provided, let’s start by looking at the factors directly impacting performance (execution time) within your process:

### Key Process Observations:

1. **Higher Performance Times in Variants with Rejections:**
   - Many of the process variants that involve rejection by a role (ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, or PRE_APPROVER), followed by resubmission by the EMPLOYEE, consistently have significantly higher performance times.
   - Example:
     - Variant:  _Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 36, performance = 2542497.917 ms)_.
     - This process shows that incorporating rejections and re-submissions, besides their repetition, causes a significant increase in performance time.

   **Potential Causes**:
   - **Delays between rejections and re-submissions**: When a declaration is rejected, the EMPLOYEE likely takes some time before re-submitting the declaration. This could be due to a lack of immediate feedback, communication lags, or manual rework.
   - **Inefficiencies in handling rejected requests**: If a rejected declaration requires substantial rework or manual interactions with different stakeholders, this increases the cycle time before re-approval.
   
2. **Budget Owner Involvement Increases Performance Time:**
   - Whenever the **BUDGET OWNER** is involved, the performance times are higher than variants without the BUDGET OWNER.
   - Example:
     - Variant:  _Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 2473, performance = 1084338.407 ms)_.
   
   **Potential Causes**:
   - **Coordination Delays**: The involvement of multiple approval levels often introduces delays. The **BUDGET OWNER** role might be introducing bottlenecks, either through manual review processes, cascading approvals, or priority issues due to workload.
   
3. **Multiple Approval Steps (Supervisors, Pre-Approvers, etc.):**
   - Variants with multiple approval steps see higher performance times in general. These processes include the roles of SUPERVISOR, ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and even PRE_APPROVERS in some cases.
   - Example:
     - Variant:  _Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 575, performance = 861058.409 ms)_.
  
   **Potential Causes**:
   - **Bureaucratic Overhead**: Multiple approval layers lead to back-and-forth communications or delays caused by waiting for decisions from different roles.
   - **Non-automated or manual processes**: If these approvals are manual (e.g., someone needs to manually check and give their approval), there’s potential for coordination delays, varying decision-making times, or other workload issues specific to that role.
   
4. **Exception Handling Takes the Longest Time:**
   - Repeated rejection cycles followed by re-submission tend to have extremely high performance times. These cases have performance metrics reaching millions of ms.
   - Example:
     - Variant:  _Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> *Repeated Resubmissions* -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 4, performance = 3502608.250 ms)_.
   
   **Potential Causes**:
   - **Complexity in conflict resolution**: Rejected declarations often require fixing mistakes and misalignments, leading to multiple resubmissions.
   - **Lack of transparency in rejection reasons or corrective guidelines**: Employees may not have a clear or structured way to address rejections, leading to inefficient fix cycles.
   
5. **"MISSING" Role Has High Performance Times:**
   - Variants involving "MISSING" also have very high performance times, indicating some undefined process gaps.
   - Example:
     - Variant:  _Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 40, performance = 1947246.400 ms)_.
   
   **Potential Causes**:
   - **Undefined Roles or Responsibilities**: The involvement of the "MISSING" role suggests that part of the approval or rejection process is not fully defined, leading to longer processing times. If there is ambiguity in which department or role is supposed to handle certain cases (leaving them in limbo), this increases overall process time.
   
6. **Workload Balancing Across Roles:**
   - Some roles, like **SUPERVISOR** or **ADMINISTRATION**, are involved in almost all variants and approvals. High reliance on specific roles may lead to bottlenecks, especially if these individuals have high workloads.
   - Example:
     - Variants where **SUPERVISOR** is involved tend to have consistently higher performance across multiple process variants.
    
    **Potential Causes**:
   - **Heavy reliance on specific roles**: When certain roles are handling many tasks or approvals (for example, the **SUPERVISOR** appears in many variants), this can overload those roles and cause delays in approval and handling.
   - **Workload management**: If roles such as **ADMINISTRATION** or **SUPERVISOR** are overloaded, they may approve/reject declarations more slowly, leading to overall process delays.

### Summary of Key Root Causes (Process & Data-Specific):
1. **Delays due to rejections**: Rejections (particularly by **ADMINISTRATION**, **SUPERVISOR**, or **BUDGET OWNER**) and any corrective action by EMPLOYEES significantly increase process times.
2. **Excessive approval layers**: The involvement of too many approval steps (e.g., adding both **PRE_APPROVER** and **BUDGET OWNER**) leads to bureaucratic delays, particularly if approval processes are manual.
3. **Delays caused by the "MISSING" role**: The presence of a "MISSING" actor likely indicates undefined roles or responsibilities, contributing to prolonged performance times.
4. **Inefficient handling of exception cases**: Exception handling or rework (_e.g., repeated rejection-resubmission cycles_) results in extremely long delays due to lack of clarity on resolving issues.
5. **Bottlenecks due to high workload on key roles**: Certain roles (particularly **SUPERVISOR**, **ADMINS**, **BUDGET OWNER**) are heavily involved across many process variants, leading to potential bottlenecks.

### Recommendations:
- **Streamline the approval process** by reducing the number of approvers where possible. Automating or simplifying approval processes could help avoid unnecessary redundancy.
- **Improve feedback and communication** after rejections to ensure EMPLOYEES know exactly what needs fixing to avoid repeated submissions.
- **Role clarification**: Address the "MISSING" role issue and ensure clearer accountability and defined actors for each step in the process.
- **Balance workload or introduce specialized roles** for large departments like **SUPERVISOR** to distribute tasks and alleviate bottlenecks.
