## Log Skeleton for Purchase-to-Pay Process
### Process Description
The Purchase-to-Pay process is a common business process in many organizations. It involves the series of activities from creating a purchase order, goods receipt, and invoice receipt to payment.

### Log Skeleton Model
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order')},
    'always_before': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'), 
                       ('Send Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'), 
                       ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'), 
                       ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')},
    'always_after': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'), 
                     ('Send Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'), 
                     ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'), 
                     ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')},
    'never_together': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Payment'), 
                       ('Send Purchase Order', 'Payment'), 
                       ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment')},
    'activ_freq': {'Create Purchase Order': {1}, 
                   'Send Purchase Order': {1}, 
                   'Goods Receipt': {1}, 
                   'Invoice Receipt': {1}, 
                   'Payment': {1}},
    'directly_follows': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'), 
                         ('Send Purchase Order', 'Goods Receipt'), 
                         ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'), 
                         ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment')}
}
```

### Explanation of the Log Skeleton Model

- **Equivalence**: The 'Create Purchase Order' and 'Send Purchase Order' activities are equivalent, meaning that they must occur together if either of them occurs.
- **Always Before**: The 'Create Purchase Order' and 'Send Purchase Order' must occur before 'Goods Receipt'. Similarly, 'Goods Receipt' must occur before 'Invoice Receipt', and 'Invoice Receipt' must occur before 'Payment'.
- **Always After**: The 'Create Purchase Order' and 'Send Purchase Order' must be followed by 'Goods Receipt'. Similarly, 'Goods Receipt' must be followed by 'Invoice Receipt', and 'Invoice Receipt' must be followed by 'Payment'.
- **Never Together**: The 'Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order', and 'Goods Receipt' cannot occur together with 'Payment'.
- **Activity Occurrences**: Each activity must occur exactly once in the process.
- **Directly-Follows**: The activities must occur in the specified order, with 'Create Purchase
