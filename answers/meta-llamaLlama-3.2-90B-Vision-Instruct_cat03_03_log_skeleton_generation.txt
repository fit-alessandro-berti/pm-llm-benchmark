Here is a Python dictionary representing a Log Skeleton model for an hypothetic Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order')},
    'always_before': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'), 
                       ('Create Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'), 
                       ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods')},
    'always_after': {('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'), 
                      ('Create Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'never_together': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'), 
                        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Create Invoice')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {1},
        'Send Purchase Order': {1},
        'Receive Goods': {1},
        'Create Invoice': {1},
        'Pay Invoice': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'),
                          ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'),
                          ('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'),
                          ('Create Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')}
}
```
This model represents the following logic:

1. When a purchase order is created (`Create Purchase Order`), it is immediately sent (`Send Purchase Order`) and these two activities are equivalent in terms of occurrence.
2. Before creating an invoice (`Create Invoice`), the goods must have been received (`Receive Goods`) and the purchase order must have been created (`Create Purchase Order`) and sent (`Send Purchase Order`).
3. After receiving the goods (`Receive Goods`), an invoice is created (`Create Invoice`).
4. An invoice is paid (`Pay Invoice`) after it has been created (`Create Invoice`).
5. Some activities cannot occur together in the same case, like creating a purchase order and paying an invoice.
6. Each activity occurs exactly once in the case, except for none.
