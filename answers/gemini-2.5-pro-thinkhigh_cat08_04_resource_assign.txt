### **A Data-Driven Approach to Optimizing Resource Assignment at TechSolve Solutions**

**Executive Summary:**
TechSolve Solutions is facing critical operational challenges, including SLA breaches, excessive ticket reassignments, and suboptimal use of skilled resources. These issues point towards systemic inefficiencies in the current resource assignment process. By leveraging process mining on the provided year-long event log, we can move from suspicion-based management to a data-driven strategy. This proposal outlines a five-step approach to diagnose the root causes of these problems, develop and test new intelligent assignment strategies, and establish a framework for continuous monitoring and improvement.

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

The first step is to transform the raw event log data into a clear, multi-faceted view of how resources (agents and tiers) currently operate.

**A. Performance and Behavior Analysis:**

We will use the event log to calculate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for individuals and teams. The focus will be on:

*   **Workload Distribution:**
    *   **Metric:** Number of cases handled per agent/tier/skill over time.
    *   **Analysis:** This will immediately validate or refute the suspicion of uneven workload. We can identify consistently overloaded agents (potential burnout risk, bottlenecks) and underutilized agents (potential for cross-training or reallocation).
*   **Activity Processing Times:**
    *   **Metric:** Average time an agent spends actively working on a ticket (e.g., time between "Work L1 Start" and "Work L1 End").
    *   **Analysis:** By comparing processing times for similar ticket categories across different agents, we can identify high-performing individuals who may be sources of best practices, as well as those who may require additional training.
*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of tickets resolved by the first L1 agent without any escalation or reassignment.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a critical measure of L1 effectiveness. We will analyze FCR rates per agent and correlate them with ticket category and priority to understand where L1 excels and where it struggles.
*   **Ticket Handling Frequency:**
    *   **Metric:** Frequency and type of tickets (by `Category`, `Priority`, `Required Skill`) handled by each agent.
    *   **Analysis:** This reveals the *de facto* specializations of agents, which may differ from their documented skill sets.

**B. Uncovering Actual Assignment and Escalation Patterns:**

Process mining tools will be used to automatically discover and visualize the end-to-end incident management process as it truly happens.

*   **Process Discovery:** The initial "spaghetti model" will graphically display all process flows, including standard paths, deviations, loops (reassignments), and escalations. We can immediately see the frequency of reassignments within the same tier (e.g., L2 to L2) and escalations between tiers (L1 to L2, L2 to L3).
*   **Social Network Analysis (Resource Interaction):** This technique visualizes handovers between resources.
    *   **Nodes:** Agents (e.g., Agent A05, Agent B12).
    *   **Edges:** Handovers of tickets. The thickness of the edge represents the frequency.
    *   **Insight:** This will clearly expose "ping-pong" behavior where tickets bounce between two or more agents. It will also highlight central figures in the escalation process (e.g., a few L1 agents who escalate most tickets) and reveal if the "Dispatcher" is a bottleneck.
*   **Role Discovery:** By analyzing activity patterns, the mining tool can automatically cluster resources into groups that perform similar tasks. We can then compare these data-driven roles against the formal L1/L2/L3 tiers to see if there is a mismatch between organizational structure and actual work performed.

**C. Analyzing Skill Utilization:**

*   **Metric:** Percentage of tasks assigned to an agent that match their documented `Agent Skills`.
*   **Analysis:** We will filter the process to identify cases where a mismatch occurs. For example, we can isolate all activities performed by L2/L3 specialists (`Agent Tier` = L2 or L3) and check the `Required Skill` for those tickets. This will quantify how often highly skilled (and more expensive) agents are working on low-complexity tasks (e.g., an 'App-CRM' specialist handling a 'Basic-Troubleshoot' task), revealing the cost of inefficient assignment.

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

With the analysis from step 1, we can pinpoint and quantify specific problems.

*   **Skill-Based Bottlenecks:** By filtering the process map by a specific `Required Skill` (e.g., 'Networking-Firewall'), we can analyze the waiting time between "Assign L2" and "Work L2 Start." Long waiting times for specific skills, despite high ticket volumes, indicate a capacity shortage for that skill.
*   **Cost of Reassignments:** We will calculate the average delay introduced by each "Reassign" or "Escalate" activity. For example, the average time from `Reassign` to the next `Work Start` might be 2 hours. Multiplying this by the total number of reassignments gives us a total "wasted time" figure, which can be converted into a financial cost.
*   **Impact of Poor Initial Assignments:** We will identify tickets that are reassigned or escalated within a short time (e.g., <30 minutes) after the initial assignment. This pattern suggests an incorrect initial assessment of the ticket's `Required Skill`. We can quantify this as a percentage of all tickets, highlighting a key failure point at the intake or L1 stage.
*   **Identifying Overloaded/Underperforming Resources:** Resource-specific dashboards will show workload over time. Agents consistently at maximum capacity are bottlenecks. We can then drill down to see if their long queues are due to a high volume of work, handling exceptionally complex tickets, or inefficient work habits.
*   **Linking Assignments to SLA Breaches:** This is the most critical connection. Using **Variant Analysis**, we will filter for all cases that breached their SLA (`Ticket Priority` P2 and P3). The process mining tool will then show us the common paths and resource behaviors for these failed cases. We will likely find that a high percentage of SLA breaches are preceded by multiple reassignments, long waits for a specific skill, or assignment to an underqualified agent. This provides a direct, quantifiable link: "X% of P2 SLA breaches involved at least one reassignment due to skill mismatch."

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Understanding *why* these inefficiencies occur is key to developing effective solutions.

*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    1.  **Assignment Logic:** The "round-robin" logic is blind to skills and current workload, making it inherently inefficient.
    2.  **Data Quality:** Agent skill profiles (`Agent Skills`) may be outdated or inaccurate. The initial `Required Skill` identified for a ticket may be wrong.
    3.  **Process Design:** L1 agents may lack the authority, training, or diagnostic tools to resolve more issues, leading to a culture of "escalate first." There might be no formal process for identifying the required skill at the point of ticket creation.
    4.  **System Limitations:** The ticketing system may lack real-time visibility into who is available and what their current workload is, forcing dispatchers and agents to make decisions with incomplete information.

*   **Data-Driven Root Cause Identification:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** We will compare the process variants of "good" tickets (resolved quickly, within SLA, no reassignments) against "bad" tickets (breached SLA, multiple reassignments). By comparing the case attributes (`Ticket Category`, `Priority`, initial channel) of these two groups, we can identify root causes. For instance, we might discover that tickets created via "Email" are far more likely to be reassigned than those created via the "Web Portal," suggesting the portal's structured forms lead to better initial data.
    *   **Decision Mining:** We can apply decision mining algorithms at key decision points like "Escalate L2" or "Reassign." The algorithm will analyze historical data to reverse-engineer the rules agents are implicitly using. This might reveal flawed logic, such as "IF Category = Network, ALWAYS Escalate," even for simple network issues. This helps us understand and correct flawed decision-making patterns.

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Based on the robust analysis above, we propose the following three data-driven strategies to replace the current inefficient logic.

**Strategy 1: Skill-Based & Proficiency-Weighted Routing**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Ticket-skill mismatch, leading to reassignments and delays. Specialists working on tasks below their skill level.
*   **How it Leverages Insights:** The analysis in Section 1 & 2 quantifies the negative impact of skill mismatches. This strategy directly targets that root cause.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   A reliable `Required Skill` attribute for each ticket (improved at the intake stage).
    *   A comprehensive and up-to-date agent skill matrix, ideally including a proficiency level (e.g., 1-Beginner, 2-Intermediate, 3-Expert).
*   **Implementation:** The assignment algorithm will prioritize agents whose `Agent Skills` match the ticket's `Required Skill`. For P1/P2 tickets, it could require an "Expert" level, while P3/P4 tickets could be assigned to "Intermediate" or "Beginner" agents, freeing up specialists.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Drastic reduction in reassignments (20-40%), faster time-to-resolution, improved specialist utilization, and higher agent satisfaction.

**Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Assignment**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution, overloaded agent bottlenecks, and underutilization.
*   **How it Leverages Insights:** The resource analysis in Section 1 identified specific overloaded and underutilized agents. This strategy aims to balance the load in real-time.
*   **Implementation:** This strategy builds on skill-based routing. When multiple agents have the required skill, the algorithm will assign the ticket to the agent with the lowest current workload (e.g., fewest open tickets, most availability).
*   **Data Required:**
    *   All data from Strategy 1.
    *   Real-time agent status (Available, Busy, In a Meeting).
    *   Real-time count of active tickets per agent.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Reduced waiting times in queues, balanced workload leading to less burnout and improved morale, and a smoother overall process flow. It directly tackles the bottlenecks identified in the analysis.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment and Escalation Avoidance**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial ticket categorization and unnecessary L1 escalations for resolvable issues.
*   **How it Leverages Insights:** Variant analysis identified the characteristics of tickets that are successfully resolved at L1 versus those that are always escalated. This strategy uses that historical knowledge to predict the future.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Predictive Skill:** Use machine learning on historical ticket data (keywords in description, category, user department) to predict the `Required Skill` with higher accuracy at the moment of creation.
    *   **Predictive Escalation:** Analyze historical L1 activities. For an incoming ticket, a predictive model can provide a "L1 Resolvability Score." High scores route to L1; very low scores could bypass L1 and route directly to a skilled L2 agent, saving the L1 handling time entirely for tickets that are historically never resolved at that level.
*   **Data Required:**
    *   Large historical dataset of tickets with text descriptions and resolution paths.
    *   Integration with the ticketing system to apply the predictive model in real-time.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Increased L1 FCR, reduced "hop" from L1 to L2, faster resolution for complex tickets (by skipping an unnecessary L1 stop), and significant efficiency gains.

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

**A. Pre-Implementation Simulation:**

Before overhauling the live system, we will use **Business Process Simulation**. We will build a digital twin of the service desk in the process mining tool, using the discovered process map, resource schedules, ticket arrival rates, and processing times from our "as-is" analysis. We can then run "what-if" scenarios:

*   **Scenario A (Baseline):** Simulate the current round-robin logic.
*   **Scenario B:** Simulate the proposed Skill-Based & Workload-Aware logic (Strategies 1 & 2).
*   **Scenario C:** Simulate the Predictive Assignment model (Strategy 3).

By comparing the simulated outcomes (e.g., projected SLA compliance, average resolution time, resource costs), we can provide a data-backed business case for the best strategy and fine-tune its parameters before a single line of code is written.

**B. Post-Implementation Monitoring:**

Once a new strategy is implemented, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure it delivers the expected benefits and to enable further adjustments. We will create a live **Resource & Process Performance Dashboard** that tracks:

*   **Key KPIs:**
    *   **SLA Compliance Rate:** Overall and filtered by Priority/Category.
    *   **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR):** Should decrease significantly.
    *   **Reassignment Rate:** Should drop dramatically.
    *   **L1 First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:** Should increase.
    *   **Resource Utilization (%) and Workload Distribution:** Should become more balanced.
    *   **Waiting Time by Skill Queue:** Should decrease, indicating fewer bottlenecks.
*   **Process Conformance:** The dashboard will continuously compare the live process flow against the target "to-be" model. This will immediately flag any new deviations or workarounds, allowing for swift corrective action.

By embedding this data-driven, cyclical approach of analysis, implementation, and monitoring, TechSolve Solutions can transform its service desk from a reactive, inefficient cost center into a proactive, optimized, and high-performing strategic asset.
