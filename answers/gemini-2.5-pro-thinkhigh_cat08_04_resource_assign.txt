Excellent. This is a classic scenario where the gap between the intended process and the reality on the ground creates significant operational friction. As a Process Improvement Consultant, here is a comprehensive, data-driven approach using process mining to address TechSolve's challenges.

***

### **Executive Summary**

TechSolve Solutions is facing critical service delivery issues stemming from inefficient resource assignment. The current approach leads to SLA breaches, excessive ticket reassignments, and suboptimal use of skilled specialists. This proposal outlines a systematic methodology using process mining to diagnose the root causes of these inefficiencies and develop intelligent, data-driven resource assignment strategies. By analyzing the provided event log, we will move from a reactive, manual assignment model to a predictive, optimized system that improves resolution times, enhances SLA compliance, and balances agent workload.

### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

The first step is to transform the raw event log data into a clear and comprehensive picture of how resources (agents and tiers) currently operate.

**A. Performance and Behavior of Agents and Tiers**

We will create a **Resource Performance Dashboard** to visualize key metrics derived directly from the event log. The focus will be on:

*   **Workload Distribution:**
    *   **Metric:** Number of cases handled per agent, per team (L1, L2, L3), and per skill.
    *   **Analysis:** This will immediately highlight overloaded and underutilized agents, revealing the workload imbalance TechSolve suspects. We can visualize this with bar charts showing case counts per resource.

*   **Activity Processing Times:**
    *   **Metric:** Average time spent on an activity (duration between `START` and `COMPLETE` events) per agent and per tier.
    *   **Analysis:** This helps identify agents who are exceptionally fast or slow at certain tasks. For example, we can see the average time for "Work L1" across all L1 agents to establish a baseline and identify outliers.

*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of tickets resolved by the first assigned agent (typically L1) without any escalation or reassignment.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a primary health indicator for the L1 team. We will calculate the FCR rate for L1 as a whole and for individual L1 agents. We can further break this down by `Ticket Category` to see if L1 struggles with specific types of issues.

*   **Ticket Handling Profile:**
    *   **Metric:** Distribution of `Ticket Priority` and `Ticket Category` handled by each agent/tier.
    *   **Analysis:** This will confirm or deny the suspicion that L2/L3 specialists are handling low-priority or simple-category tickets. For instance, we can quantify the percentage of P3/P4 tickets handled by L3 agents.

**B. Uncovering Actual Assignment Patterns**

Process mining excels at discovering the *actual* process flow, including all the informal workarounds and deviations.

*   **Resource Interaction Analysis (Social Network Analysis):**
    *   **Technique:** We will generate a social network graph where agents are nodes and ticket handovers (escalations, reassignments) are the connections (edges). The thickness and color of the edges will represent the frequency of handovers.
    *   **Insight:** This will visually expose:
        *   **"Ping-Pong" Reassignments:** Frequent back-and-forth handovers between two specific agents or teams.
        *   **Unexpected Paths:** Handovers that violate the intended L1 -> L2 -> L3 escalation path (e.g., L2 to L2 reassignments, L2 back to L1).
        *   **Central Hubs:** Agents who act as informal dispatchers or escalation points, even if that is not their official role.
    *   **Comparison:** We will contrast this discovered map with TechSolve's official, documented assignment logic (round-robin, manual escalation) to quantify the deviation.

*   **Role Discovery:**
    *   **Technique:** This algorithm groups agents based on their actual behavior (the types of activities they perform and tickets they handle).
    *   **Insight:** Instead of just seeing L1/L2/L3, we might discover more granular, *de facto* roles like "L2-Network-Specialists," "L1-Escalation-Experts," or even "Generalists" who touch many categories. This helps understand how work is truly specialized within the teams.

**C. Analyzing Skill Utilization**

*   **Technique:** We will perform a **Skill Mismatch Analysis** by cross-referencing the `Required Skill` on a ticket with the `Agent Skills` of the agent who worked on it.
*   **Insight:** We can create a report that highlights:
    *   **Under-skilling:** Percentage of tickets where the assigned agent did *not* have the `Required Skill`, likely leading to reassignment.
    *   **Over-skilling:** Percentage of tickets where a highly specialized agent (e.g., 'Security-IAM') worked on a ticket requiring only 'Basic-Troubleshoot' skills. This quantifies the inefficient use of expensive specialists.
    *   **Skill Gaps:** Identify `Required Skill` types for which there are frequent long waits, indicating a shortage of agents with that specific skill.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

With the analysis from step 1, we can pinpoint and quantify the specific problems.

*   **Bottlenecks from Skill Scarcity:** By overlaying waiting times on the process map (the time between activities like "Assign L2" and "Work L2 Start"), we can identify bottlenecks. Filtering this view by `Required Skill` will show exactly which skills are in short supply.
    *   **Quantification:** "Tickets requiring 'Database-SQL' wait, on average, 4.5 hours for an L2 agent, compared to a 1-hour average wait for other L2 skills."

*   **Impact of Reassignments:**
    *   **Technique:** We will filter for all cases containing a 'Reassign' activity.
    *   **Quantification:** We can calculate the "Reassignment Tax" – the average delay added to the total resolution time for each reassignment (e.g., "Each reassignment adds an average of 3 hours and 25 minutes to the ticket lifecycle").

*   **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
    *   **Technique:** Analyze the path `Work L1 End` -> `Escalate L2`.
    *   **Quantification:** "45% of tickets handled by L1 are escalated to L2. Of these, 60% are related to 'Network' or 'Software-App' categories, suggesting L1 is under-equipped or undertrained for these." We can also correlate this with the initial L1 agent to see if specific agents escalate more than others.

*   **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**
    *   **Technique:** Using **Variant Analysis**, we will compare the process maps and resource behaviors for two groups of tickets: those that met their SLA and those that breached it.
    *   **Quantification:** "P2 tickets that breach their SLA have, on average, 2.5 reassignments, while those that meet their SLA have only 0.5. Furthermore, 70% of breached P2 tickets involved a skill mismatch on the initial L2 assignment."

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

This phase moves from "what" is happening to "why" it is happening.

*   **Deficiencies in Assignment Rules:** The primary root cause is likely the "round-robin within tiers" logic. It completely ignores skill requirements and current agent workload, making inefficient assignments almost inevitable.
*   **Poor Initial Ticket Data:** If the `Ticket Category` or `Required Skill` is incorrectly identified at creation, the entire assignment chain is flawed from the start. We can identify problematic categories by seeing which ones have the highest reassignment rates.
*   **Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles:** The `Agent Skills` data may be outdated or inaccurate. An agent listed with 'App-CRM' might not be proficient, forcing them to reassign tickets. The mining analysis can flag agents who consistently reassign tickets of a certain skill type, suggesting their profile needs review.
*   **Insufficient L1 Empowerment:** High escalation rates from L1, even for tickets they should theoretically handle, points to a potential lack of training, inadequate knowledge base access, or a culture that encourages passing responsibility rather than owning resolutions.
*   **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** Dispatchers and agents making manual assignment decisions likely lack real-time data on who is available, who has the shortest queue, and who has the right skills. They rely on memory or static lists.

To confirm these, we will use **Decision Mining**. By analyzing the "Assign L2" decision point, we can automatically derive the rules the dispatchers are *actually* using. The model might reveal rules like "IF Priority=P2 AND Category=Network, THEN assign to Agent B08 (regardless of their current workload)," exposing the flawed, static logic in use.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Based on our findings, we propose the following three strategies to systematically improve resource assignment.

**Strategy 1: Intelligent Skill-Based Routing**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Skill mismatches, frequent reassignments, and the "over-skilling" problem.
*   **How it Leverages Mining:** Uses the insights from the Skill Mismatch Analysis and the correlation between skills and resolution times.
*   **Data Required:**
    1.  Accurate, real-time `Required Skill` on each ticket.
    2.  A comprehensive and validated `Agent Skills` matrix, ideally including a proficiency level (e.g., 1-5).
*   **Implementation:** The assignment engine (dispatcher or automated system) should prioritize assigning tickets to the available agent with the highest proficiency in the `Required Skill`.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Drastically reduced reassignments, faster time-to-resolution, improved FCR, and better utilization of specialists on tasks worthy of their expertise.

**Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution and bottlenecks caused by assigning tickets to already overloaded agents.
*   **How it Leverages Mining:** Directly uses the workload distribution and bottleneck analysis findings.
*   **Data Required:**
    1.  Real-time agent status (Available, Busy, On Break).
    2.  Real-time count of open tickets in each agent's queue.
    3.  Data from Strategy 1 (skills) to create a pool of eligible agents.
*   **Implementation:** The assignment logic becomes a two-step process: First, identify all available agents with the required skill (from Strategy 1). Second, from that eligible pool, assign the ticket to the agent with the lowest current workload (e.g., fewest open tickets).
*   **Expected Benefits:** Balanced workload across teams, reduced agent burnout, minimized queueing/waiting times, and improved overall process throughput.

**Strategy 3: Predictive Assignment & Escalation Guidance**

*   **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial assignments and unnecessary L1 escalations.
*   **How it Leverages Mining:** Uses historical data patterns from variant and decision mining to predict future outcomes.
*   **Data Required:**
    1.  Historical event log.
    2.  Ticket attributes at creation (channel, category, priority, user-entered description/summary).
*   **Implementation:** Develop a machine learning model trained on the historical log. When a new ticket is created, the model analyzes its text and attributes to:
    *   **Predict the `Required Skill`** with high accuracy, correcting for initial human error.
    *   **Predict the likely resolution tier** (L1, L2, L3). If a ticket is predicted to be an L2/L3 issue from the start, it could bypass L1 entirely for certain categories, or the L1 agent could be given a "strong recommendation to escalate immediately."
*   **Expected Benefits:** "Right-first-time" assignments, reduced ticket "hops," dramatically lower resolution times for complex issues, and empowerment of L1 agents with data-driven guidance.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

**A. Pre-Implementation Simulation**

Before committing to costly system changes, we will use **Business Process Simulation**.

1.  **Baseline Model:** We will create a simulation model based on the "as-is" process discovered from the event log, including current resource counts, shift schedules, skills, and the flawed round-robin assignment logic. We will run this simulation to validate that it accurately reproduces the existing problems (e.g., it predicts a similar SLA breach rate and workload imbalance).
2.  **"To-Be" Scenarios:** We will then create copies of this model and change *only* the resource assignment logic to reflect our proposed strategies (e.g., one model with Skill-Based Routing, another with Skill + Workload-Aware routing).
3.  **Evaluate Impact:** By running these new simulations, we can generate a comparative business case, forecasting the quantitative impact of each strategy (e.g., "Strategy 2 is predicted to reduce average P2 resolution time by 20% and decrease L2 agent overload by 35%").

**B. Post-Implementation Monitoring**

Once a new strategy is implemented, continuous monitoring is crucial to ensure its effectiveness and to enable further refinement.

*   **Live Dashboards:** We will set up live process mining dashboards connected to the production ITSM system. These dashboards will track:
    *   **Key KPIs:** SLA Compliance Rate, MTTR, Reassignment Rate, FCR, Agent Utilization. These should be trended over time to show improvement.
    *   **Process Views:** A live process map to ensure the new assignment logic is being followed.
    *   **Resource Performance:** Live views of agent workload and queue lengths.
*   **Conformance Checking:** We will use conformance checking to automatically detect deviations from the new, intended assignment process. For example, if a manual override assigns a ticket to an agent without the right skill, an alert can be generated for a team lead to review. This ensures the new process sticks and delivers its intended value.
