**Identification of Bias:**  
The **Unprotected Group (Group B)** exhibits bias through systematic advantages linked to the `CommunityGroup` attribute and corresponding `ScoreAdjustment` policies. This bias disadvantages Group A (Protected Group), where no such adjustments occur.

---

**Key Manifestations of Bias:**

1. **CommunityGroup-Based Score Adjustments (Group B Only):**  
   - In Group B, applicants affiliated with the *Highland Civic Darts Club* receive a **+10 ScoreAdjustment** (e.g., U001 and U003). This adjustment directly increases their eligibility for approval.  
   - Group A (Protected Group) has no `CommunityGroup` affiliations and receives **no adjustments**, even when their preliminary scores are comparable or higher (e.g., P002 in Group A scored 710 and was rejected, while U003 in Group B scored 705 after adjustment and was approved).

2. **Disparate Impact on Approval Thresholds:**  
   - In Group B, a preliminary score of **695** (U003) is boosted to 705 and approved. In Group A, a score of **710** (P002) is rejected with no adjustment.  
   - This implies Group B benefits from a **lower effective approval threshold** due to the community-based boost, while Group A faces stricter criteria.

3. **LocalResident Attribute Correlation:**  
   - All Group B applicants are `LocalResident = TRUE`, and the `CommunityGroup` advantage is only available to locals. Group A (`LocalResident = FALSE`) is systematically excluded from this opportunity, creating a **proxy bias** against non-locals.

**Systematic Differences in Outcomes:**  
- **Group B Approval Rate:** 2/3 (66.7%) – U001 and U003 approved.  
- **Group A Approval Rate:** 2/3 (66.7%) – P001 and P003 approved.  
  *Superficially equal, but the approval mechanisms differ:*  
  - Group B’s approvals rely on adjustments tied to `CommunityGroup`, enabling lower scores to qualify.  
  - Group A’s approvals require inherently higher preliminary scores (720 and 740), reflecting stricter criteria.  

This creates a **structural inequity**: Group B applicants with marginal scores gain approval through non-meritocratic adjustments unavailable to Group A, disproportionately favoring locals in specific communities.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The bias manifests as **unfair privileging of Group B** through `CommunityGroup`-based score adjustments, which are inaccessible to Group A. This systematically lowers the bar for Group B applicants while holding Group A to stricter standards, violating fairness principles by embedding advantages tied to local residency and community affiliation.
