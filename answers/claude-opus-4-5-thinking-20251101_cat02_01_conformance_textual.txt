# Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the event log against the normative process description, I identified **three cases with violations** (Cases 2, 3, and 5) and **two compliant cases** (Cases 1 and 4).

## Detailed Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1: COMPLIANT
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

This case follows the ideal flow for a fulfilled order with sufficient inventory. Each step occurs in the proper order:
- Process begins with "Receive order"
- "Check inventory" follows receipt
- "Authorize payment" occurs after inventory check
- "Package items" follows payment authorization
- "Ship order" follows packaging
- "Close order" is the final activity

**No violations detected.**

###  Case 2: VIOLATION DETECTED
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  **Package items**  **Authorize payment**  Ship order  Close order

**Violation: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**

According to the normative description:
> *"'Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."*

> *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped."*

The description explicitly states that packaging items before authorization is a violation. This makes logical sense—preparing items for shipment before confirming that payment is approved creates risk of wasted effort if payment ultimately fails.

###  Case 3: VIOLATIONS DETECTED (Multiple)
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  **Ship order**  Close order

**Violation 1: "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**

This is the most serious violation. The normative description is explicit:
> *"'Ship order' should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."*

> *"Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)"*

Shipping an order that has been cancelled is a clear logical contradiction and operational error.

**Violation 2: Mixed fulfillment and cancellation activities**

The case contains both "Authorize payment" and "Cancel order," which represents a problematic hybrid. The normative description indicates that the cancellation path should be: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. The presence of "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" suggests either:
- An improper process flow where payment was authorized unnecessarily
- The cancellation occurred for reasons other than inventory (which still doesn't justify subsequent shipping)

---

###  Case 4: COMPLIANT
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

This case correctly follows the cancellation flow described for insufficient inventory scenarios:
> *"In such a case, after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order.' Once an order is canceled... the next reasonable step is to 'Close order.' This results in a shorter sequence—Receive, Check, Cancel, Close—for insufficient inventory scenarios."*

**No violations detected.**

---

###  Case 5: VIOLATION DETECTED
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items"**

The required step "Package items" is completely missing from this case. According to the normative description:
> *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped."*

> *"Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"*

The description makes clear that packaging is a prerequisite for shipping. An order cannot logically be shipped without first being packaged.
