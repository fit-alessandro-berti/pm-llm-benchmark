**Merged Event Log with Reasoning**

**Overview of Approach**:  
1. **Primary Timeline**: We use Log A (System A) as our primary timeline since its timestamps are considered more standard for the process flow.  
2. **Matching Criteria**: Events are matched if:
   - They share the same `order_id`.
   - Their timestamps differ by less than or equal to approximately 2 seconds.
   - Their event names or semantics are closely related.

3. **Merging Attributes**:  
   - When two events match, we create one merged record containing:
     - The primary event name from Log A (to maintain consistency).
     - All attributes from both logs (including `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B).  
   - If timestamps differ slightly, we choose the timestamp from Log A as the primary timestamp (since it’s our main timeline), but we may note the alternate timestamp from Log B.
   
4. **Unmatched Events**:  
   - If an event from Log A or Log B cannot be confidently matched to a counterpart (due to timestamp differences beyond tolerance or no logical name match), it remains separate in the final output.
   - The final chronological order is based on the chosen primary timestamp (Log A’s timestamps for merged events, and Log B’s own timestamps for standalone events that have no A counterpart).

### Step-by-Step Matching

**Event 1: "Order Received" (A) at 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z**  
- Potential match in B: "OrderReceived" at 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z  
- Timestamp difference: 2 seconds. This is at the edge of our 2-second tolerance, but we will consider it acceptable.  
- Event names are semantically identical ("Order Received" vs "OrderReceived").  
**Decision**: Merge these two into one event.  
**Merged attributes**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (primary from A)  
- Event Name: "Order Received"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
- user_id: u45 (from B)  
- resource_id: r10 (from B)  
- notes: "Event captured at warehouse system" (from B)

---

**Event 2: "Order Validated" (A) at 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z**  
- Potential match in B: "OrderValidation" at 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z  
- Timestamp difference: 1 second, well within tolerance.  
- Event names are semantically the same step (“Order Validated” vs “OrderValidation”).  
**Decision**: Merge these two events.  
**Merged attributes**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z (from A)  
- Event Name: "Order Validated"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
- user_id: u12 (from B)  
- resource_id: r10 (from B)  
- notes: "Cross-check inventory" (from B)

---

**Event 3: "Payment Processed" (A) at 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z**  
- Potential match in B: "PaymentCheck" at 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z  
- Timestamp difference: 5 seconds, which exceeds our 2-second tolerance.  
- Event names are not a direct match. "Payment Processed" suggests completion, while "PaymentCheck" suggests a preliminary check. The 5-second gap suggests these might be two separate events in the payment workflow.  
**Decision**: Do not merge. Keep both events separate.  

**A-only Event**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z  
- Event Name: "Payment Processed"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
(No additional attributes from B since not merged.)

**B-only Event (PaymentCheck)**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z  
- Event Name: "PaymentCheck"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
- user_id: u12  
- resource_id: r99  
- notes: "Payment gateway delay"

---

**Unmatched Event in B: "Quality Check" (B) at 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z**  
- No corresponding event in A.  
- The name and timing do not closely match any A event.  
**Decision**: Include as a separate event from B.  
**B-only Event**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z  
- Event Name: "Quality Check"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
- user_id: u45  
- resource_id: r11  
- notes: "Random inspection"

---

**Event 4: "Item Shipped" (A) at 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z**  
- Potential match in B: "Shipping" at 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z  
- Timestamp difference: 2 seconds, on the edge but acceptable.  
- Names are semantically aligned ("Item Shipped" vs "Shipping").  
**Decision**: Merge these two events.  
**Merged attributes**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z (from A)  
- Event Name: "Item Shipped"  
- order_id: Order#1234  
- user_id: u45 (from B)  
- resource_id: r10 (from B)  
- notes: "Package handed to courier" (from B)

---

**Event 5: "Item Delivered" (A) at 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z**  
- No corresponding event in B.  
**Decision**: A-only event.  
**A-only Event**:  
- Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z  
- Event Name: "Item Delivered"  
- order_id: Order#1234

**Rationale & Conflict Resolution**:  
- We prioritized merging events where the timestamp difference was minimal and the event names or semantics were clearly aligned.  
- For the "Payment" steps, the 5-second difference was deemed too large and the event names suggested different stages, so we kept them separate.  
- The "Quality Check" event in Log B had no A counterpart and was included as-is.  
- Where events matched closely, all attributes from both logs were included, enriching the final record with user and resource information from Log B.  
- We maintained chronological order based on Log A’s event timestamps, inserting unmatched B events in their natural chronological position.
