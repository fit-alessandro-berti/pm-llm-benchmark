Process enhancement is a key aspect of process mining that involves optimizing existing business processes to improve their performance, efficiency, and effectiveness. It involves analyzing the current workflow, identifying bottlenecks, and finding ways to eliminate them through process automation, elimination of redundant steps, or reorganization of tasks. The goal of process enhancement is to make the existing process more efficient and effective while also ensuring that it aligns with the business objectives.

Process discovery, on the other hand, involves identifying and analyzing all the steps involved in a particular business process. It helps organizations understand how their processes are working and provides insights into areas of improvement. The primary goal of process discovery is to gain a better understanding of the existing process so that it can be improved or modified.

Conformance checking is the third aspect of process mining, which involves verifying whether an existing business process is being followed correctly. It compares the actual execution of the process against its intended behavior and flags any deviations from the standard. The primary goal of conformance checking is to ensure that the process is being executed correctly to avoid errors and inconsistencies.

In summary, process enhancement focuses on optimizing existing processes for improved performance, process discovery involves identifying and analyzing all the steps involved in a particular business process to gain insights into areas of improvement, and conformance checking ensures that the process is being executed correctly to avoid errors and inconsistencies.
