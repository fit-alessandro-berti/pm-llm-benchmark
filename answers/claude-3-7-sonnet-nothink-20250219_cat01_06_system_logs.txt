# Process Mining Event Log Transformation

Based on the Windows activity system log, I've transformed the raw data into a process mining event log. I've identified distinct cases based on document/application contexts and converted low-level actions into meaningful business activities.

## Event Log

## Explanation of Transformation Logic

### Case Identification
I identified 5 distinct cases based on the document or application context:
- **C1**: Work on Quarterly_Report.docx
- **C2**: Work on Document1.docx
- **C3**: Email interaction in Google Chrome
- **C4**: Review of Report_Draft.pdf
- **C5**: Work on Budget_2024.xlsx

The case identification was based on the principle that each document or distinct application context represents a separate work process. When the user returned to a previously opened document (like Document1.docx or Quarterly_Report.docx), I maintained the same case ID to show the continuity of work on that document.

### Activity Naming
I transformed low-level system actions into business-meaningful activities:
- **FOCUS** → Open Document/Spreadsheet
- **TYPING** → Draft Content/Edit Content/Update Data, etc. (context-dependent)
- **SAVE** → Save Document/Save Spreadsheet
- **SWITCH** → Open Email/Review PDF (based on destination)
- **CLICK** → Read Email/Compose Reply/Send Email (based on action)
- **SCROLL** → Browse Emails/Browse PDF
- **HIGHLIGHT** → Annotate PDF
- **CLOSE** → Close Document

The activity names were chosen to reflect the business process perspective rather than the technical system actions, making the log more suitable for process mining analysis.

### Additional Attributes
I included the original application and document names as additional attributes to provide context for each event. I also added brief descriptions in the "Additional Info" column to provide more context about what happened during each activity.

This transformed event log now tells a coherent story of the user's work processes across multiple documents and applications, suitable for process mining analysis.
