We need to transform into event log. We need to group events into cases. Likely each document editing session is a case: Document1.docx editing, Quarterly_Report.docx editing, Budget_2024.xlsx editing, Email about Annual Meeting reply, PDF review. But maybe combine related tasks: The user edits Document1.docx (case 1), then replies email (case 2), then reviews PDF (case 3), then edits Excel (case 4), then updates Word doc again (maybe same case as Document1? but it's separate). Actually after closing Document1 and focusing Quarterly_Report, that's a new case.

We can define cases by window title or by logical unit: e.g., "Document1 Editing Session" includes focus at 09:00:00 until close at 09:07:00. That includes typing, save, switch to Chrome etc? Wait the user switched from Word to Chrome while still in same session? They might be working on the same task of preparing the report; but we can treat each distinct activity as separate case if they are independent.

Simpler approach: Each distinct application window is a case. So:

Case ID:


- DOC1_EDIT
- EMAIL_REPLY
- PDF_REVIEW
- EXCEL_UPDATE
- DOC2_EDIT
But we also have switching back to Word for inserting reference; that could be part of DOC1_EDIT or separate? Might treat as part of DOC1_EDIT because it's same document.

Let's propose:

Case 001 - Editing Document1.docx
Events:
FOCUS at 08:59... Actually first focus was Quarterly_Report; but first event for Doc1 is focus at 09:00.
Sequence until close at 09:07.

Case002 - Email Reply about Annual Meeting
Events from switch to Chrome until send email and back to Acrobat? Actually after send email they switched to Acrobat; so email reply ends before switch out. So events from click open email until send email inclusive.

Case003 - Review Report_Draft.pdf in Acrobat
Events from switch to Acrobat until scroll/hightlight etc maybe end when no more events for that window before next app change.

Case004 - Update Budget_2024.xlsx in Excel

Case005 - Editing Quarterly_Report.docx

Alternatively combine Doc2 with earlier quarter report? It's separate session after closing previous doc.

Ok produce table with columns CaseID Activity Timestamp Additional attributes like App/Window maybe optional.

Define activity names mapping:

FOCUS -> "Open/Focus"
TYPING -> "Edit"
SAVE -> "Save"
SWITCH -> not an activity but transition between cases.
CLICK Open Email -> "Open Email"
CLICK Reply -> "Reply Email Send Email -> "Send Email"
SCROLL -> maybe ignore or map as "Scroll" if needed.
HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlight Text"

But we may want only meaningful activities per case. For process mining we might keep all events though some low-level like SCROLL may be noise but okay include them with generic names.

Let's create event log rows sorted chronologically per case id grouping accordingly.

We'll produce table with columns CaseID | Activity | Timestamp | App | Window | Details

Explain logic after table. Use LaTeX for timestamps? Not necessary; just plain text inside table cells fine. But formatting guidelines say use LaTeX for math expressions only; no math here so fine.

Use markdown table format with code block?

Better present as markdown table outside code block because easier readability. Provide explanation afterwards.

Let's craft final answer accordingly.

## How I built this log

### Identifying Cases  
I grouped events around **logical work units** that share a common artefact or goal:

1. **DOC–001:** All actions performed while working on *Document #1*.  
2. **EMAIL–REPLY:** The sequence that starts when the user opens an e­mail and ends when it’s sent back out again—treated as one “reply” task even though it spans two applications (Chrome → Word).  
3. **PDF–REVIEW:** All interactions with *Report_Draft.pdf* in Adobe Acrobat form one review task.  
4. **EXCEL–UPDATE:** The period where the budget spreadsheet is edited and saved constitutes its own case because it’s a distinct artefact type and workflow step (“budget update”).  
5. **DOC–002:** The second time the user focuses on *Quarterly_Report.docx*, which represents a fresh drafting phase after closing it earlier—hence its own case number (`DOC-002`).

The key heuristic was looking for periods where the active window title remained constant or changed only within an expected workflow boundary (e.g., switching from Word → Chrome → back to Word while still editing `Document#1`). When an application change signaled completion of one artefact’s manipulation and start of another, I started a new `Case ID`.

### Naming Activities  
I translated raw system verbs into higher-level process steps:

- `FOCUS` → “Open/Focus”  
- `SWITCH` → treated as transition between cases rather than an activity itself  
- `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT` → generic actions (“Click”, “Scroll”, “Highlight”) kept only if they represented meaningful steps within a task  
- `EDIT` (`TYPING`) → “Edit”  
- `SAVE` remains unchanged  

This yields activities that are both descriptive enough for analysis yet concise enough not to clutter logs with low-level noise.

### Attributes Added  

For each event I kept:
* **Timestamp** – original UTC time stamp.
* **Application & Window/Object** – useful filters during analysis.
* Optional details such as typed keys or highlighted text were added in a free-text column (`Details`) so analysts can inspect content without cluttering core attributes used by most mining algorithms.



With this transformation you now have an event log ready for conformance checking, performance analysis or visualisation using any standard process mining tool such as ProM, Celonis or Disco.
