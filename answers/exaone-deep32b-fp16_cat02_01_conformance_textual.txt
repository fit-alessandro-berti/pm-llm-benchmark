Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process described and then check each case in the event log against that process to find violations. Let me start by restating the key points from the normative description to make sure I get them right.

The process starts with "Receive order". Then the next step must be "Check inventory". The Check inventory has two possible paths:

1. If inventory is sufficient:
   - After Check, the sequence should be Authorize Payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. And Close must be last.
   
2. If inventory is insufficient:
   - After Check, it goes to Cancel order, then immediately Close order. No other steps allowed after Cancel except Close.

Important constraints from the text:
- Authorize Payment must come after Check and before Package. So you can't authorize before checking, and packaging must be after authorization.
- Ship must come after Package and never after a cancellation. So if there's a Cancel, Ship can't happen at all except maybe in a wrong case.
- Close is always last. So after Close, there should be no more activities.
- Any deviation like shipping after cancellation, authorizing before checking, packaging before authorization, etc., is a violation.

Now, let's go through each case one by one.

Starting with Case 1:
- The steps are Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. That follows the correct path for when inventory is sufficient. The order here looks correct. So no violation here. The Close is last, so that's okay. So Case 1 is okay.

Case 2:
Receive  Check  then Package comes before Authorize Payment. Wait, that's a problem. According to the normative, after Check (assuming inventory is sufficient), the next should be Authorize Payment, then Package. Here, Package is before Authorize. That violates the rule that Authorize must come before Package. So Case 2 is violating the order between Authorize and Package. Also, the rest after that: Ship and Close. But since the first mistake is Package before Authorize, that's a violation. So Case 2 is invalid.

Case 3:
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. Wait, after Cancel, they do Ship. But according to the norm, when you cancel (because inventory is insufficient), after Cancel you should go directly to Close. So Ship should not happen here. The Ship after Cancel is a violation. Also, the sequence after Cancel is Ship then Close. But Close must be the last step. Here, Ship is before Close, which is allowed only if Ship is part of the correct path. But since they canceled, Ship shouldn't be there at all. So this is a violation. The steps after Cancel should only be Close. So Case 3 is violating the rule that after Cancel, only Close can follow. Also, the Ship is after Cancel, which is prohibited.

Case 4:
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. That's exactly the path for insufficient inventory. The steps are correct here. Check leads to Cancel, then Close. No other steps. So this is okay. No violation here.

Case 5:
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait, the correct path after Authorize should be Package first, then Ship. Here, after Authorize, they go to Ship, skipping Package. That's a problem. The normative says after Authorize, you must Package before Shipping. So Ship can't come before Package. Therefore, Case 5 is violating the order between Package and Ship. They skipped Package, so that's a violation.

Let me double-check each case again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Case 1: All steps in order. Correct.

Case 2: Check  Package before Authorize. Definitely wrong. Authorize must come before Package. So yes, violation.

Case3: After Cancel, they Ship. That's not allowed. So violation.

Case4: Correct.

Case5: Missing Package between Authorize and Ship. So Ship is before Package? No, in Case5, after Authorize (11:00), next is Ship at 11:00? Wait the timestamps for case5:

Case5 steps:

Check at 10:00, then Authorize at 10:30, then Ship at 11:00. So between Authorize and Ship, there's no Package. So that's a problem. The correct path after Authorize is Package then Ship. So Ship can't come before Package. So yes, violation here.

Other possible checks: Are there any other rules? For example, the Close must be last. All cases have Close as the last step except maybe none. Let's check:

Case3's last step is Close, but before that is Ship. So Ship is before Close, which is allowed only if Ship is part of the correct path. But in the case where they canceled, Ship shouldn't be there. So the problem is the presence of Ship after Cancel, not the order of Ship and Close. But the Close is still last, so that part is okay. The main issue is Ship after Cancel.

Another check: In the case where inventory is sufficient, the steps must be Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. So any deviation in that sequence is bad. For example, in case5, missing Package, so that's a problem.

Another possible ambiguity: The normative says "the process must branch into a cancellation scenario" when inventory is insufficient. So after Check, if insufficient, then Cancel and Close. So in case3, after Cancel, they have Ship, which is not allowed. So that's a violation.

Any other cases? Let me check case2 again. The steps after Check are Package then Authorize. So the order is Check  Package  Authorize. That's wrong because Authorize must come before Package. So that's a clear violation.

So the violating cases are 2,3,5. Cases 1 and 4 are okay.

Wait, let me check case3 again. The steps are:

Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel  Ship  Close. Wait, the Authorize comes before Cancel? Wait, that's a problem. Because if they authorized payment before canceling, that might be an issue. Wait, according to the normative, when inventory is insufficient, after Check, you go to Cancel. But in case3, after Check, they do Authorize Payment first, then Cancel. That's a problem. Because the Check should immediately lead to either Authorize (if inventory is sufficient) or Cancel (if not). But here, they did Authorize even before deciding to cancel? That's conflicting.

Wait, the normative says that if inventory is insufficient, the process must branch to Cancel immediately after Check. So after Check, if inventory is insufficient, the next step must be Cancel, not Authorize. So in case3, after Check, they authorized payment first, then canceled. That's a violation because the Check should have determined that inventory is insufficient, so the next step must be Cancel, not Authorize. Therefore, even the sequence Check  Authorize  Cancel is invalid. Because once you check and find insufficient, you can't authorize payment. So that's another violation here. So the case3 has two violations: first, authorizing payment before canceling (when inventory was insufficient), and then shipping after cancel.

Hmm, that's an important point. The Check inventory step's outcome determines the path. So if the Check leads to insufficient inventory, then the next step must be Cancel. Therefore, in case3, after Check, they did Authorize, which would only be allowed if the inventory was sufficient. But since they later did Cancel, that implies that the Check found insufficient, so the Authorize shouldn't have happened. Therefore, the entire flow of case3 is wrong. The Check must be followed by either Authorize (if sufficient) or Cancel (if not). So in case3, after Check, they did Authorize, which would be incorrect if the Check had found insufficient. Therefore, the presence of both Authorize and Cancel in the same case's steps indicates a problem. Because once you choose to Cancel, you can't have done Authorize first. So that's another violation here. So the case3 is violating multiple rules.

Therefore, the violations in case3 are:

1. Authorizing payment before canceling (when inventory was insufficient, so Check should have led directly to Cancel, not Authorize).

2. Shipping after Cancel, which is prohibited.

So that's two violations in case3.

Similarly, in case5, the problem is that after Authorize, they skipped Package and went to Ship. So that's a violation of the order between Package and Ship.

Case2's problem is that after Check, they did Package before Authorize, which violates the Authorize before Package rule.

So the violating cases are 2,3,5. Let me confirm once more.

Case4 is correct: Check  Cancel  Close. That's exactly the path for insufficient inventory. So that's okay.

Case1 is correct.

So the answer should list cases 2,3,5 as violating, with explanations for each.

Now, to write the explanations properly, referencing the normative's rules.

For Case 2: The problem is Package comes before Authorize. The normative says after Check (assuming sufficient), the next steps must be Authorize then Package. So the violation is "Packaging items before authorizing payment" which violates the rule that Authorize must come before Package.

Case3: Two issues. First, Authorize is done before Cancel, which is only allowed if inventory was sufficient, but since they later Cancel, that implies insufficient, so the Check should have led directly to Cancel. Therefore, the sequence Check  Authorize is invalid here. Second, after Cancel, they Ship, which is not allowed. The norm says after Cancel, only Close can follow. So two violations here.

Case5: Ship is done before Package. The normative requires Package to come after Authorize and before Ship. So Ship cannot occur before Package. Hence, violating the order between Package and Ship.

Therefore, the answer should list these three cases with their respective violations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Violations:**

1. **Case ID 2**  
   - **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
   - **Rule Violated:** The normative states that "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items" (since payment authorization requires inventory sufficiency, and packaging must follow authorization).  
   - **Details:** After "Check inventory," the sequence should be Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. Here, Packaging (10:00) precedes Authorization (10:30), violating the required order.  

2. **Case ID 3**  
   - **Violations:**  
     a. **Authorization before Cancellation:** "Authorize payment" (09:40) occurs after "Check inventory" (09:20) but before "Cancel order" (10:00).  
        - **Rule Violated:** If inventory is insufficient (as implied by the subsequent "Cancel"), the process must branch directly to "Cancel" after "Check Inventory," bypassing payment authorization.  
     b. **Shipping after Cancellation:** "Ship order" (10:30) follows "Cancel order" (10:00), which is prohibited.  
        - **Rule Violated:** The normative specifies that after cancellation, only "Close order" is allowed. Shipping post-cancellation is invalid.  

3. **Case ID 5**  
   - **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."  
   - **Rule Violated:** The normative requires "Package items" to come after authorization and before shipping. Here, after authorization (10:30), shipping (11:00) skips packaging entirely, violating the sequence Authorize  Package  Ship.  

**Non-violating Cases:**  
- **Case 1** follows the correct flow: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.  
- **Case 4** adheres to the insufficient-inventory path: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close, with no subsequent steps after cancellation.  

**Summary of Violations:**  
- **Case 2:** Incorrect order of Authorize/Package.  
- **Case 3:** Authorization before cancellation and shipping post-cancellation.  
- **Case 5:** Skipping Package before Shipping.
