**Solution:**

To model the given global manufacturing and distribution process of high-end appliances using Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL), we need to capture the sequence, choices, loops, and concurrency in the process based on the provided event log.

### Analysis of the Event Log

From the event log, we can observe the following activities and their relationships:

1. **Order Received (OR)**: Start of the process.
2. **Material Sourcing (MS)**: Follows OR.
3. **Quality Screening (QS)**: Follows MS.
4. **Assembly (AS)**: Follows QS.
5. **In-line Quality Check (IQC)**: Can be repeated before AS.
6. **Testing (TST)**: Follows AS and IQC.
7. **Re-Testing (RT)**: Loops back to TST if the product fails.
8. **Packaging (PK)**: Follows TST.
9. **Labeling (LB)**: May be skipped in some cases.
10. **Distribution Planning (DP)**: Follows PK and LB.
11. **Dispatch (D)**: End of the process.

### Key Observations

- **Loop in IQC and AS**: IQC can be performed multiple times before AS.
- **Loop in TST and RT**: RT leads back to TST if re-testing is needed.
- **Optional Labeling (LB)**: Some cases skip LB.

### POWL Model Structure

To represent this process accurately, we will use the following POWL constructs:

- **Transitions** for individual activities.
- **OperatorPOWL** with `Operator.XOR` for choices (e.g., performing LB or skipping it).
- **OperatorPOWL** with `Operator.LOOP` for loops (e.g., IQC and AS loop, TST and RT loop).
- **StrictPartialOrder** to define the partial ordering and concurrency between different sub-processes.

### Final POWL Structure

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip_LB = SilentTransition()  # Silent transition for skipping LB

# Define the loop for IQC and AS
IQC_AS_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])

# Define the loop for TST and RT
TST_RT_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Define the choice for LB or skipping it
LB_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip_LB])

# Define the main process flow using StrictPartialOrder
main_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    OR,
    MS,
    QS,
    IQC_AS_loop,
    TST_RT_loop,
    PK,
    LB_choice,
    DP,
    D
])

# Define the partial order relationships
main_process.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
main_process.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
main_process.order.add_edge(QS, IQC_AS_loop)
main_process.order.add_edge(IQC_AS_loop, TST_RT_loop)
main_process.order.add_edge(TST_RT_loop, PK)
main_process.order.add_edge(PK, LB_choice)
main_process.order.add_edge(LB_choice, DP)
main_process.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# The final POWL model is 'main_process'
```

### Explanation

1. **Transitions**: Each activity is represented as a transition with its respective label.
2. **Loops**:
   - **IQC and AS Loop**: Represents the scenario where IQC is performed multiple times before AS.
   - **TST and RT Loop**: Represents the re-testing process that loops back to TST if needed.
3. **Choice**: An XOR operator is used for the choice between performing LB or skipping it (silent transition).
4. **Partial Order**: The main process is defined using `StrictPartialOrder`, specifying the sequence and dependencies between different activities and sub-processes.

This structure captures the essential flow, loops, choices, and partial ordering observed in the event log, providing a comprehensive model of the manufacturing and distribution process.
