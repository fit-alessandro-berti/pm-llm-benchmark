<think>
Okay, so I need to model this insurance claim process as an accepting Petri net using pm4py's objects. Let me break down the problem.

First, understanding the scenario: The process starts with a customer filing a claim, which triggers several steps like registration, verification, fraud checks, assessment, approval (if needed), payment, notification, and closure. But there are possible loops when documents need re-submission after DV or if fraud check leads to in-depth investigations multiple times.

So the Petri net should have transitions for each activity, places representing the states between them, and arcs connecting everything with proper sequences and loops.

Let me list out all the activities:

- Insurance Claim (C) – probably the start?
But wait, according to the scenario, C is what the customer does, then steps 1-8 follow. So maybe the initial place represents a new claim arriving, which would be before step CR? Because after C comes CR.

Wait, in the example given by the user's prompt, they have an "initial marking" that starts with a token in "source". Then transitions execute_activity leading to "sink".

In this insurance case, the initial place is probably like "start" where a token represents a new claim. Then transitions are CR, DV, etc.

So steps:

1. Create all places and transitions for each step and their intermediate states.
2. For loops between DV and RDS: If after DV there's incomplete docs, then RDS happens before continuing. So from DV transition, perhaps a place that leads back to DV again? Or maybe the process is DV -> check if documents are okay; but since Petri nets don't have conditional branches unless modeled with places and transitions.

Wait, in Petri net terms, how do we model the choice between proceeding or needing RDS?

Probably, after the Document Verification (DV) transition, there's a place that can either go to Fraud Check (FC) if verification is successful or trigger Re-Document Submission (RDS). So DV would have two output arcs: one leading towards FC and another leading back via RDS.

Similarly for Fraud Check (FC): If it raises doubts, then In-depth Investigation (II) occurs. After II, perhaps we loop back to FC again?

So the idea is that after some transitions like DV or FC, there are places allowing loops through other transitions (RDS or II).

Let me outline each step with possible branches:

Start -> CR -> DV.

From DV: two possibilities—successful verification leads to FC. If not, RDS happens then back to DV again? So DV transition would have a place that either goes towards FC or loops via RDS?

Wait, perhaps the process is structured as such:

After DV (transition), we create a place "after_DV". From there, if documents are complete, proceed to FC. If not, trigger RDS which then leads back to DV.

So modeling this would require that after DV transition deposits tokens into two places: one for proceeding forward and another for the loop via RDS?

Wait no. Let me think again.

In Petri net terms, each transition has input places (from its arcs) and output places. So perhaps after DV is executed (transition fired), it outputs to a place "post_DV". Then from this post_DV place, there are two transitions: one for proceeding normally to FC (if verification succeeded) or another for RDS.

But how would that work? Because in order to choose between the two paths, you need a decision. But Petri nets don't have built-in decisions; instead, tokens flow based on enabled transitions.

Alternatively, maybe DV is followed by an intermediate place where either FC can be executed (if verification passes) or RDS must happen first. So if there's a loop between DV and RDS:

The process would look like this: after DV, the system checks for documents validity. If invalid, then RDS happens which leads back to DV again.

So how is that modeled in Petri net?

Perhaps as follows:

DV transition connects from its input place (e.g., post_CR) to two output places: one for proceeding towards FC and another leading to a loop via RDS. Wait no; transitions can have multiple output arcs. So maybe after firing DV, tokens are put into both the next step's place and an intermediate place that leads back through RDS.

But that might not be correct because it would split the token flow unnecessarily. Alternatively, perhaps after DV there is a place from which either FC (if documents OK) or RDS (if docs need resubmission). But how to model this choice?

Alternatively, using places and transitions:

- Place "post_DV" has two outgoing transitions: one for proceeding normally (to FC), another that requires RDS. However, since a transition can't fire unless it's enabled, maybe the RDS path would have a place connected back to DV after executing.

Hmm. Let me sketch this part.

After CR is done (assuming the sequence goes from CR to DV):

CR transitions connects to some place "post_CR", which leads into DV. When DV fires, outputs tokens to "post_DV". Then from post_DV:

Option 1: proceed via FC transition (if documents are OK).

But if RDS is needed, maybe there's a transition called something like 'need_resubmission' that when fired takes the token from post_Dv and routes it back through RDS.

Wait but how would that be modeled? Because in Petri nets transitions represent activities. So perhaps after DV, we have an XOR split where either FC can happen (if verification is successful) or RDS must occur first before returning to DV again.

But since this isn't a BPMN model with gateways, in Petri net terms, maybe each possible path is represented by different transitions and places.

Alternatively, use the same approach as in other process models where after an activity there's a place that leads back into another activity (like RDS leading back to DV).

So perhaps:

DV transition fires when it has tokens from its input place. Upon firing, outputs to two separate places: one for proceeding further and another for triggering RDS.

But wait, transitions can have multiple output arcs. So the DV transition could deposit a token into "post_DV_ok" which leads towards FC, and also deposit a token into "need_resubmit", which is input to the RDS transition.

Wait but that would split tokens between two places, meaning both paths are taken simultaneously. Which isn't correct because either one or the other should be followed based on conditions.

Since Petri nets don't have inherent decision gates, perhaps we need a loop structure where after DV there's a place that can lead to FC if no resubmission is needed, or RDS then back to DV again.

Wait but how? Let me think of possible places and transitions:

- After CR: the process goes into "post_CR" which enables the DV transition.
DV fires from post_CR. Upon firing, produces a token in "after_DV".
Then, there are two possibilities here:
1. If docs OK, then FC is enabled next (so after_DV -> FC).
2. If not, RDS needs to happen: so after_DV would have another transition leading to RDS.

But how? Because the tokens in 'after_DV' can enable either transitions for FC or RDS. But if both are present, they could fire any of them.

Wait that's a problem because this represents an OR choice where either path is possible. However, in reality, only one of these paths should be taken based on some condition (like whether documents need resubmission). Since Petri nets don't have conditional arcs, perhaps the model here would allow both possibilities but with inhibitor arcs or something else.

But pm4py's standard petri net objects might not support that. So maybe in this case, for simplicity, we can model it as two separate transitions after DV: FC and RDS. But then when docs are okay, FC is taken; otherwise, RDS is done first before proceeding to FC again.

Wait but if the process allows multiple RDS steps (i.e., documents may need resubmission more than once), there needs to be a loop between DV and RDS.

So perhaps after DV transition fires, it deposits into an intermediate place. Then from this intermediate place:

Transition for RDS: when fired, takes token from intermediate place, does RDS activity, then puts token back into pre-DV (i.e., the input place of DV again). That way, if there's a problem, RDS is done and DV is repeated.

Alternatively, transition FC would take tokens from that same intermediate place and proceed to next steps. So in this model:

DV has an output arc to an intermediate place "after_DV_decision".

This place feeds into two transitions: RDS (leading back to the input of DV) and FC (proceeding forward). Once a token is here, either can fire.

But that's assuming that either path could be taken. But in reality, which one depends on some condition not modeled here. Since we're modeling the structure, perhaps this represents possible paths but with no constraints—so tokens can choose either transition when enabled.

In such case, for the process to model possible loops (allowing RDS and DV to happen multiple times), this setup would allow it: after each DV completion, a token is in "after_DV_decision", from which if RDS fires, then returns to pre-DV place. Then DV can fire again.

Wait but how?

Let me sketch the structure:

Places:

- p_start (initial marking)
8. p_post_CR
9. p_pre_DV: after CR is done, leads to DV transition.
10. After DV fires, outputs token into "p_post_DV".
11. From p_post_DV:
    - FC can fire when tokens are here, leading to next steps (CA).
    OR RDS can fire from this place which then puts token back into some previous place.

Wait no—RDS would need to lead back so that DV can be triggered again. So maybe:

After the DV transition fires, it outputs a token to p_post_DV.

From p_post_DV, if FC is taken (transition FC), proceeds next steps.

If RDS is needed, then there's a transition RDS which when fired takes from p_post_DV and puts into some place that leads back to pre-DV. So the path would be:

DV -> p_post_DV --> RDS -> ... put token in p_pre_DV again?

So perhaps:

After DV (transition) outputs tokens into p_post_DV.

The FC transition's input is p_post_DV, and output is next place towards CA.

RDS transition has input from p_post_DV. When fired, it takes the token from there and outputs to a new place that connects back to pre-DV (like perhaps another place "p_after_RDS" which leads into DV again).

So then:

DV's input would be p_pre_DV (from CR), after firing RDS transitions put tokens into some other place, e.g., p_post_RDS. Then from there, we have an arc to the DV transition.

Wait but that could create a loop between DV and RDS: when documents are not sufficient, you go through RDS then back to DV again.

So for this part:

- Place after CR is p_post_CR (output of CR).
DV's input place is p_pre_DV = p_post_CR? So from p_post_CR the token moves into DV. Then upon firing DV, outputs a token into p_post_DV.

Then FC transition would take from p_post_DV and output to next step (like towards CA).

RDS transition takes from p_post_DV and after being executed, deposits tokens back into some place that leads to pre-DV again, so perhaps "p_after_RDS" which connects as input to DV. So the cycle here is:

DV -> RDS -> back to DV's input (from p_after_RDS).

Wait but how? Because once you have a token in p_post_DV, either FC or RDS can fire.

Assuming that there are two transitions: FC and RDS, both enabled by tokens in p_post_DV. So the choice between them is non-deterministic unless other places' tokens are involved.

But perhaps to model multiple loops (i.e., needing to go through RDS several times), after each RDS execution, a token is put into p_after_RDS which then goes back as input to DV's transition. Thus, when RDS fires:

- Input: p_post_DV
7. Output: place(s) leading back to pre-DV.

So in code terms, the structure would be something like this:

CR (transition) connects from p_start via some initial setup? Wait no—the process starts with CR as step 1. So perhaps after C is represented by a start place where token is placed initially. Then transition "C" leads to the first actual activity: Claim Registration (CR). Hmm, but according to scenario description:

The customer files an Insurance Claim (C), then steps occur starting from CR.

Wait no—the process starts with step 1 being Claim Registration after C happens. So perhaps the initial place is a start where token represents that the claim has been filed and needs processing. Then transition "CR" fires next, moving to post_CR place.

So in this case:

Initial marking: a single token in 'p_start' (the starting place).

Then CR's input arc comes from p_start. When fired, deposits into p_post_CR.

From there, DV can fire, taking the token from p_post_CR and depositing into... maybe another intermediate place?

Wait let me map each activity to transitions:

Transitions list should include all steps: CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Plus additional ones for RDS and II.

So transitions are labeled as 'Claim Registration', etc., using their respective labels.

Now, the process flow is roughly (without loops):

Start -> CR -> DV -> FC -> CA -> [if needed: AP] -> P -> N -> CL.

But when there's a need to loop back:

After DV, RDS happens and then returns to DV again. So between DV and FC or RDS.

Similarly, after FC, if II is required, it loops back to FC multiple times.

So each of these steps (DV and FC) have possible loops via RDS and II respectively.

Let me outline the structure for both parts:

1. The main path:
p_start -> CR (transition) -> p_post_CR
-> DV (transition) -> p_post_DV

From here, either proceed to FC or do RDS first.

If proceeding normally: FC transition takes from p_post_DV and outputs to p_post_FC.
But if in need of resubmission: RDS transition fires, taking token from p_post_DV and outputting into a place that loops back to DV's input (so after RDS is done, the process returns to DV again).

Wait, how? Because DV requires tokens in its input place. So for RDS to loop back, it should deposit a token into the same place as where CR deposited, which was p_post_CR leading to DV.

But that would mean that after RDS execution (transition), you put a token back into p_pre_DV (which is p_post_CR). But wait—if p_post_CR is already being used for transitioning from CR to DV. So if we loop via RDS, then perhaps the place after RDS should be p_post_RDS which connects as an input to DV.

Alternatively:

After DV fires and deposits into p_post_DV.

If RDS transition fires (from p_post_DV), it outputs a token into p_after_RDS. Then from there, you have an arc connecting back to the DV transition's input place.

But where is DV's input? Originally, after CR completes, the token was in p_post_CR which connects to DV. So if RDS adds tokens to p_pre_DV (same as p_post_CR), then yes: when DV has a token here again, it can fire once more.

So code-wise:

For DV transition:
- Input place: p_post_CR
? Output places: p_post_DV and perhaps others?

Wait no. When DV fires, it should take from its input place (p_post_CR) and put into output places. In the main path, after DV, you need a token in p_post_Dv.

For RDS case:

DV transition's input is p_post_CR. Then when DV fires, removes one token from p_post_CR and adds to p_post_DV.

Then if there's an RDS transition that takes from p_post_DV (i.e., after DV), outputs into a new place called "p_after_RDS".

From p_after_RDS, perhaps another arc is added back to the input of DV. Because then when this token arrives here, it can trigger DV again.

So structure:

After RDS transition fires, places a token in p_post_RDS (perhaps). Then from there, an arc connects into DV's input place (p_post_CR? Or some new place?). Wait that might not be correct because the original path after CR was to go via DV. If we loop back to this same place, then yes.

But let me think: After RDS is done, you want to return to DV again. So when RDS transition fires, it takes from p_post_DV and deposits into a new place that is connected as input to DV's transition. But what was the original input for DV? It was after CR (p_post_CR).

So maybe:

The initial path: p_start -> CR (transition) outputs to p_post_CR.

DV has an arc from p_post_CR, and when fired, puts into p_post_DV.

Then RDS transition takes from p_post_DV and outputs back to p_post_CR. So that after DV is done via the main path, you can loop back by having RDS put a token in p_post_CR again. Then DV would fire once more (since its input place has tokens), leading to p_post_Dv.

Wait but this could cause an infinite loop unless there's some constraint. But if the model allows that possibility through structure—like allowing RDS to happen any number of times before proceeding to FC, then it's okay for the purposes here.

Similarly, in code:

CR transition: input from p_start (start place), output to p_post_CR.
DV transition: input from p_post_CR; after firing, outputs to p_post_DV.
RDS transition: input from p_post_Dv; when fired, outputs back to p_post_CR. Thus creating a loop.

Then FC's transition would take tokens from p_post_Dv and proceed towards next steps (CA).

But in that model, RDS is part of the loop—after RDS completes, DV can be executed again because there's now a token in p_post_CR again. So if after firing RDS, you put back into p_post_CR, which triggers DV again.

This would create a cycle between DV and RDS: whenever DV fires, it could lead to either FC (if docs are okay) or trigger RDS which leads back to CR's post place so that DV can fire again. Thus modeling the possible re-submission of documents multiple times before proceeding.

Similarly for Fraud Check (FC) leading to In-depth Investigation (II):

After FC transition fires, deposits a token into p_post_FC. From here, if there are doubts, II needs to happen and then loop back to FC again. So structure would be similar: after FC's output place (p_post_FC), there is an arc from that place to both CA (proceeding forward) or to the transition for II which loops back.

Wait no—probably:

After firing FC transition, it outputs into p_post_FC.

From here, two options:

1. Transition towards CA (next step).
2. Transition towards II (in-depth investigation), after completing II returns to FC again.

So similar setup: when II fires, takes from its input place(s) and deposits back into a place that connects as input for FC transition.

But what's the input of FC? It was in p_post_FC coming from DV's post-Dv output. So FC would have an input arc from p_post_DV (maybe), but wait no—FC is after Dv, so its input place could be a separate one: perhaps "p_pre_FC" which comes from the outputs of either DV or II.

Wait this might get complicated elsewhere. Let's see:

Let me outline all places and transitions step by step.

First, create all necessary objects (places and transitions) for each activity.

List of activities/transitions to model:
1. CR: Claim Registration
2. DV: Document Verification
3. FC: Fraud Check
4. CA: Claim Assessment
5. AP: Approval (if needed)
6. P: Payment
7. N: Notification
8. CL: Closure

Plus the additional transitions:

9. RDS: Re-Document Submission
10. II: In-depth Investigation.

Now, the initial place is p_start which has a token in im. Then CR's transition takes from here and deposits into p_post_CR.

From p_post_CR comes DV transition (so after CR, do DV).

After DV, output to p_post_DV. From there:

- RDS: if needed.
RDS transition takes from p_post_Dv and outputs back into p_post_CR? Or a separate place?

If it's a loop between DV and RDS, then after RDS executes (transition), the token should go back to where it was before so that DV can fire again.

So maybe when RDS fires, the output is directed back to p_post_CR. So:

DV transition: input = p_post_CR; output = p_post_Dv.
RDS transition: input = p_post_DV; output = p_post_CR (so after RDS completes, goes back into DV's input).

This way, whenever a token arrives at p_post_CR via CR or via RDS, the DV can fire again. So for example:

Claim registration puts a token into p_post_CR  DV fires  into p_post_DV.

If in this case, RDS is needed: transition RDS takes from p_post_Dv and outputs back to p_post_Cr  triggering DV again.

Thus creating a loop between DV and RDS until documents are sufficient (i.e., when the process proceeds via FC instead of RDS).

Similarly for Fraud Check and In-depth Investigation:

After FC fires, output into p_post_FC. From there:

- CA: if fraud check passes.
OR II transition which outputs back to a place that leads to FC again.

So how is this structured?

Let's see:

The main path after FC would be CA (Claim Assessment). So transitions for FC and CA:

After FC fires, output into p_post_FC. Then from here, the next step is CA transition firing: so it takes token(s) from p_post_Fc and outputs to p_post_Ca.

But if II needs to happen multiple times before proceeding:

Then after FC's transition fires (outputting to p_post_FC), there can be another transition for II that takes a token from p_post_FC, executes In-depth Investigation, then puts into a place leading back to FC. So upon completing II, the process loops back to FC.

So structures would look like:

p_post_Fc  II (transition) which outputs to some place e.g., p_after_II that leads back as input to FC's transition.

But wait—what is the input for FC? Originally, after DV's output (post_DV), it goes via RDS or directly into FC. The FC's input would come from where?

Wait no: in this structure:

After CR and DV, when process proceeds normally (without looping through RDS), a token arrives at p_post_Dv. Then the transition for FC takes that token and outputs to p_post_Fc.

So FC has an arc from p_post_DV as input.

But if after II is done, it needs to loop back into FC again. So where does II deposit its output? Perhaps in a place (e.g., p_after_II) which connects as input to FC transition.

Thus:

FC's input could be either from p_post_Dv or from another place connected via loops.

Wait but no: transitions can have multiple incoming arcs, so if the FC transition has two input places— one being p_post_DV and other being p_after_II (from II), then when any of them has tokens, FC is enabled?

Hmm. Alternatively, after FC fires, deposits into p_post_Fc, which feeds transitions to both CA and II.

Then:

CA takes from p_post_Fc and proceeds towards next steps.
II transition takes from p_post_Fc and outputs to a place that loops back (e.g., p_after_II) which connects as input to FC. So when II fires, token is taken from p_post_Fc and deposited into p_after_II.

Then FC's input would be connected not just once but also with another arc from p_after_II? Or perhaps FC transition has inputs from both p_post_Dv (original path) and p_after_II?

No, that can't happen because each transition is triggered by the presence of tokens in its input places. So if after II execution, a token is placed into p_after_II which connects to FC's input place, then when there’s a token here, FC can fire again.

Wait but FC's original input was from post_Dv (only).

So unless we modify the structure so that FC transitions have two input places—one for initial execution and another after II. That would complicate things because transitions are enabled only when all their input arcs have required tokens.

No, maybe instead:

The Fraud Check transition FC is part of a loop where upon triggering FC via p_post_DV, it outputs to p_post_Fc. Then from there, if you do In-depth Investigation (II), which after execution deposits back into the same p_after_FC place that leads to FC again.

Wait this might not work. Let's perhaps sketch:

After DV's transition fires and produces a token in post_DV, then FC can fire by taking one token from there, outputting to post_Fc (place). Then CA transitions takes tokens from here to proceed towards assessment.

But if during Fraud Check the system decides an In-depth Investigation is needed (II), which requires another check. So after II transition fires, it deposits a token back into a place that leads to FC again.

Thus:

FC's input would be post_DV and possibly some other places? Or perhaps not: maybe after II executes, it adds a token to the same input place as FC's original path (post_Dv), but that may conflict with previous steps. Alternatively, create another input place for FC via II loop.

Hmm this is getting complicated. Let me try again:

When Fraud Check (FC) transition fires from post_DV and outputs into post_FC. Then from there, two possible transitions: CA and II.

CA would take a token and proceed to Claim Assessment.
II would take a token, execute In-depth Investigation, then output to some place that leads back as input for FC again.

Thus:

After II's transition fires, deposits tokens into the same post_DV place (which was originally from DV). Wait no: because after firing FC once, you’ve moved past DV. So maybe not.

Alternatively, when II is executed, it outputs to a new place called p_after_II which connects back as input for FC's transition. Then FC can be triggered again via this loop.

But then the input places for FC would need two separate ones: one from post_Dv and another from after_ii?

No, transitions in Petri nets have multiple incoming arcs; all their input places must have tokens. So if FC has an arc from both post_DV and p_after_II, that transition can only fire when there are tokens in all connected input places. Which is not the desired behavior here.

Hmm. This seems tricky.

Alternative approach: after II, place a token back into post_Fc (the same as where CA's transition takes from). But then after firing II and placing token into post_FC again, you could trigger another FC cycle? Not sure if that would create loops correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop for Fraud Check is structured differently. When FC fires, outputting to a place like p_post_Fc.

From here:

- Transition CA takes a token from here and proceeds.
2. Transition II: takes a token from post_FC, outputs into some other place (p_after_II) which connects back as input for FC's transition again.

But how does this connect? Because FC would have to take inputs from two different places?

Wait maybe:

The FC transitions has arcs coming from p_post_DV and also from another place like p_pre_Fc, but that’s perhaps not the case. Let me think of it differently.

Original path after DV: post_Dv -> FC -> post_FC -> CA.

When II is involved:

post_FC serves as input to both transitions (CA and II).

If transition II fires, tokens are taken from post_FC and output into p_post_II (new place). Then from there, another arc connects back to FC's input. But what’s the original path? Because after DV you reach FC via post_Dv.

So perhaps:

After II completes (outputting into p_post_II), which is then connected as an incoming arc for FC transition. So when a token arrives in p_post_II, FC can fire again because it has an input from there.

But how to structure the inputs of FC? The original case after DV deposits tokens into post_Dv and that's the only input place for FC.

If FC needs another input (from II), then FC would have two input places: post_DV and p_post_II. But transitions can't be enabled unless there are tokens in all their input arcs, meaning that both places must have a token to fire FC again. That’s not the intended behavior here— we want FC to be able to fire either from DV's output or after II's execution.

Ah! So perhaps instead of having separate inputs, model multiple paths:

For FC transition, create two transitions: one for proceeding directly and another that requires an additional input (II), but this seems messy. Perhaps the correct way is to structure a loop where FC can be triggered again via II.

Alternative approach using Petri net's structure:

- After FC fires, outputs to post_FC.
   - If CA is next, then transition CA takes from here and proceeds.
   - Else, if II needs to happen: Transition II takes token from post_Fc, deposits into a new place (post_II), which connects back as input for FC's transition. Thus allowing FC to fire again when there are tokens in post_II.

But how can this be done?

So:

FC transition would have two incoming arcs— one from post_Dv (original path) and another from post_II (loop after II). Then, each time a token is present in either of these places, FC can fire. But transitions only fire if all input places required by their arcs have tokens.

Wait no: If the transition has multiple incoming arcs (each with weight 1), then it requires that there's at least one token in each place connected to an arc.

Ah! So for example:

Transition FC could have two arcs: one from post_Dv and another from post_II. Each of these arcs is a standard 'normal' arc, which means when the transition fires, tokens are consumed from all input places (both post_DV and post_II). But this would require that both places have at least 1 token each to enable FC.

Which isn't correct for our case—because in some scenarios we want FC to fire either after DV or after II. Thus, using standard arcs wouldn't work here because the transition requires tokens from all inputs.

So perhaps a better approach is to model two different transitions for FC: one that comes directly from post_Dv (FC1) and another coming from post_II (FC2). But this complicates the model as it duplicates transitions with same labels or creates new ones, which might not be ideal.

Alternatively, use Petri net's structure where after II execution, tokens are placed back into post_DV. Thus making FC available again via that path.

But then:

- After firing DV, token is in post_Dv; FC takes from there and proceeds.
2. If during FC processing we fire II transition: take token from post_Fc (output of FC), process through II, which outputs back into post_DV (original place for FC's input). Thus enabling FC again.

But this would create a loop where FC can be called again after II by tokens arriving in post_Dv via II. But since DV had already been completed once, putting the token back here might not make sense as it could require re-doing DV steps which may or may not happen.

Hmm. Maybe an alternative approach is required for both loops (DV-RDS and FC-II). It seems that each loop requires similar structures where after a transition there's an option to return to an earlier step via another activity.

Perhaps, using the same pattern as in RDS:

For DV -> possible loop through RDS:
- After DV outputs into post_Dv.
   - Transition for FC: takes token from here and proceeds.
   - Transition for RDS: takes tokens from here and outputs back into a place that leads to DV again.

Similarly, after FC's output (post_Fc):
   - Transition CA: proceeds next step.
   - Transition II: takes token and outputs into a place leading back to FC.

Thus:

RDS transition:
Input = post_Dv
Output = p_after_Rds  which connects as input to DV again via an arc.

II transition:
Input = post_Fc
Output = p_after_Ii  which connects as input to FC's transition via another arc.

This way, after RDS or II are done, their output places feed back into the respective transitions (DV and FC), creating loops.

But for FC, how is this loop structured? Let me outline:

Original path: DV outputs into post_Dv. Then FC takes from here  outputs to post_Fc  CA etc.

If in post_Fc a transition II fires  it will take token from post_FC and output into p_post_Ii (new place). From there, an arc connects back to FC's input (not the same as DV's).

So then FC would have two separate input places: one is post_Dv (original), another is post_Ii.

But how can this be modeled? Because transitions in Petri net are activated when all their incoming arcs' places have tokens. So if FC has an arc from post_Dv and another arc from post_Ii, then it would require a token in both to fire, which isn't desired here; we want the FC transition to activate whether there's a token from either post_Dv or post_Ii.

Ah! That requires something like a 'OR' condition for incoming places. But standard Petri nets don't support this unless modeled with hidden transitions or using different approach.

This seems problematic, but perhaps in pm4py, when constructing the net, you can model FC as having two input arcs from two separate places (post_Dv and post_Ii). Then if a token exists in either place, along with any other required inputs. Wait no—that's not possible because transitions require all incoming arcs to have sufficient tokens.

Thus, this approach would prevent the transition from firing unless there is at least one token in each of their input places. Which isn't desired here; instead, we need FC to fire if either post_Dv or post_Ii has a token (exclusive OR).

Therefore, perhaps it's necessary to model two separate transitions for FC: one triggered by post_Dv and another by post_Ii.

But since they are the same activity (Fraud Check), but under different contexts, maybe this is acceptable. But having multiple transitions with the same label might be confusing. Alternatively, we can give them different labels, but perhaps the model requires two separate FC steps which doesn't fit the scenario.

Hmm... So given time constraints and code complexity, I'll proceed to model both loops (DV-RDS and FC-II) using similar structures:

For DV -> RDS loop:
- After Dv transition fires, outputs into post_DV.
   - From here, transitions for Rds and Fc are available. When RDS fires, output tokens back into a place that connects as input to Dv's Transition.

Similarly, after FC transition firing (outputting into post_FC):
   - Transitions II and CA: when II fires, outputs into a place connecting back to FC's input via another arc.

But how? Let me code this step by step for pm4py:

Places needed:
1. p_start: initial token here.
2. p_post_cr: after CR is done.
3. p_post_dv: after DV.
4. p_after_rds: output of RDS, feeds back into Dv's input (p_post_cr?).
5. p_post_fc: output of FC.
6. p_after_ii: output of II transition, which connects to FC's input place(s)..
7. p_post_ca: after CA.
8. p_ap_input: before AP, if needed.
9. p_payment: after P.
10. p_notification: after N.
11. p_closed: final state.

But perhaps more places are required for each step's input and output transitions.

For example:

Start with creating all transitions first:
cr = Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="CR")
dv = Transition(name="Document Verification", label="DV")
rds = Transition(name="Re-Document Submission", label="RDS")
fc = Transition(name="Fraud Check", label="FC")
ii = Transition(name="In-depth Investigation", label="II")
ca = Transition(name="Claim Assessment", label="CA")
ap = Transition(name="Approval", label="AP")
p_tran = Transition(name="Payment", label="P")
n_tran = Transition(name="Notification", label="N")
cl = Transition(name="Closure", label="CL")

Now, places:

- p_start: Place("start") – initial token here.
8. p_post_cr: after CR completes (Place("post_CR"))
9. p_pre_dv: input for DV transition -> same as p_post_cr?
No: Because the initial path is Start  CR  post_CR.

DV's input is from post_CR, so it needs an arc to that place.

Then when DV fires, outputs into another place (post_DV).

From there:

- RDS takes token and puts back into a place leading to Dv. So for example:
RDS transition has input as p_post_dv and output as p_re_submit (a new place). Then an arc from p_re_submit back to DV's input (p_post_cr), making the loop.

Thus:

After RDS is executed, a token is placed into p_re_submit which connects via arc to Dv transition. Thus enabling DV again when tokens are in post_CR (which now includes from both CR and RDS).

Similarly for FC and II:

FC's input comes from p_post_dv (after dv) or maybe after ii.

Wait, let me re-express the structure step by step with possible code elements.

Implementing this in pm4py requires creating each place and transition, then connecting them via arcs using petri_utils.add_arc_from_to.

Let's start coding:

Construct net as a PetriNet object.

Create all transitions:
transitions = {
    "CR": create Transition("Claim Registration", label="CR"),
    "DV": ...,
    etc.
}

But to avoid verbosity, perhaps best to name them accordingly.

Now code outline (pseudo):

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# create net
net = PetriNet(name="Insurance Claim Process")

# create places
start_p = PetriNet.Place(name="start")
post_cr_p = PetriNet.Place(name="post_CR")
post_dv_p = PetriNet.Place(name="post_DV")
re_submit_p = PetriNet.Place(name="re_submit")  # after RDS, feeds back to DV
post_fc_p = PetriNet.Place(name="post_FC")
after_ii_p = PetriNet.Place(name="after_II")    # after II, loops back to FC
post_ca_p = PetriNet.Place(name="post_CA")
ap_input_p = PetriNet.Place(name="approve_check")  # after CA, if approval needed
post_ap_p = PetriNet.Place(name="post_AP")
payment_p = PetriNet.Place(name="payment_done")
notification_p = PetriNet.Place(name="notified")
closed_p = PetriNet.Place(name="closed")

# add all places to net.places.add()
net.places.add(start_p)
... etc.

Wait, in code:

But pm4py's objects are created via constructor. For each Place and Transition.

Then transitions for the activities:

cr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration")
dv_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification")
rds_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission")
fc_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check")
ii_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation")
ca_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment")
ap_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")
p_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment")
n_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification")
cl_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure")

# add all transitions to net.transitions.add()
net.transitions.add(cr_trans)
... etc.

Now connect the transitions with arcs:

Initial flow:

start_p -> CR  post_CR

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_p, cr_trans, net)

cr_trans's output: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cr_trans, post_cr_p, net).

Then DV transition is from post_CR to post_DV.

dv_trans input: add arc from post_cr_p to dv_trans.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(post_cr_p, dv_trans, net)

After dv fires  output to post_dv_p:

add arc from dv_trans to post_dv_p.

Then RDS transition: takes from post_DV and outputs into re_submit_p (which loops back to DV's input).

So RDS is connected via arcs as follows:

arc_from_to(post_dv_p, rds_trans, net)
rds_trans output re_submit_p
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_trans, re_submit_p, net)

Then connect re_submit_p to dv_trans's input (post_cr_p). Or wait no: DV's input is post_cr_p. So how does the loop happen?

Wait, after RDS fires and outputs into re_submit_p, then we need an arc from re_submit_p back to some place that enables DV again.

But in this structure, DV's input is post_CR (from CR). So perhaps connecting re_submit_p via a transition or directly? Hmm no: if after RDS fires and puts into re_submit_p, then we need another arc from re_submit_p back to dv_trans. But for that:

We can connect re_submit_p as an input to dv_trans.

But this would require adding an arc between re_submit_p and DV transition. So when a token is in re_submit_p, DV can fire again.

Thus the code would be:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_submit_p, dv_trans, net)

Wait no: arcs are from places to transitions or transitions to places.

To have DV's input include both post_cr_p and re_submit_p? That way, when either place has tokens, DV can fire. But transitions require all incoming arcs' places to contribute tokens (based on weight).

If the transition dv_trans has two incoming arcs: one from post_cr_p, another from re_submit_p.

But that would make it so DV requires a token from both, which isn't desired here.

Wait no; each arc is separate. If we have two input places for DV, then the transition will be enabled only if there's at least one token in all connected incoming arcs.

Thus, to allow dv_trans to fire either after CR or RDS, it should not have multiple input arcs but instead a single input from post_cr_p and re_submit_p would need another arc. Which isn't possible unless the transition accepts tokens from both places via separate arcs, meaning that each time DV is triggered, it's taking one token from each place.

But this would lead to requiring two tokens (from CR and RDS) for DV to fire once. That’s not desired here.

This seems like a complication.

So perhaps instead:

After RDS outputs into re_submit_p, we add an arc from re_submit_p back to the same input as after_CR, which is post_cr_p.

But that's only possible if they're the same place. Wait no; CR's output was in post_cr_p (which triggers DV), and RDS's output would need to be a separate place. So how can we make it so that DV has tokens from both original CR and RDS?

Ah, here's an alternative: after RDS completes, add the token back into post_cr_p. Thus enabling dv_trans again via existing arc (post_cr dv). This way, when either CR or RDS fires, a token is added to post_cr_p which triggers DV again.

So code:

When rds_trans fires, output place is post_cr_p:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(rds_trans, post_cr_p, net)

Thus, after RDS completes, the token goes back into post_cr_p. Then dv_trans can fire again as it's triggered from that same input.

This approach solves the loop between DV and RDS: whenever there is a need for re-submission (RDS), process returns to CR’s output place, allowing DV to execute again.

Similarly for FC and II:

After Fraud Check fires, outputs into post_fc_p. From here:

- CA transition takes tokens from post_fc_p.
- II transition takes token from post_fc_p  outputs into after_ii_p (or back into same input as FC's original path).

But to loop FC via II: need the output of II to be a place that feeds into FC’s input.

Thus:

If we model it similarly, when II fires, it outputs tokens into re_investigate_p (a new place), which is connected to FC transition. So code-wise:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ii_trans, after_ii_p, net)

Then add arc from after_ii_p back to the input of FC's transition.

But where is fc_trans’s original input? It was post_dv_p (from DV’s output).

Thus FC's transition has two incoming arcs: one from post_dv_p and another from after_ii_p. This would require tokens in both for FC to fire again, which isn't desired.

Alternative approach like the RDS loop: when II completes, outputs into post_fc_input (same as where CA starts), but no—different path.

Alternatively, have II transition output into a new place that leads back to fc_trans’s input. So:

After ii_trans fires, it deposits tokens into after_ii_p. Then add an arc from after_ii_p to FC's transition (fc_trans). Thus whenever there is a token in after_ii_p, FC can fire again.

So code would be: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(after_ii_p, fc_trans, net).

Then when II fires and deposits into after_ii_p, FC will have that as input. But then FC requires tokens from both post_dv_p (original path) and after_ii_p to fire again.

Which isn't correct— if during the loop we are only using the token in after_ii_p.

Ah! This is a problem because transitions require all incoming arcs' places to have tokens where they’re connected. So FC transition would need both post_dv_p and after_ii_p to have tokens for it to fire again, which isn't the case here.

To resolve this, perhaps structure II's loop such that when II fires, outputs into a place that merges back into post_fc_input (which is same as where CA transitions start from? Or create an alternative path).

Alternatively, if after FC finishes and goes through II, then process returns to the input of FC again. So how?

Alternative approach:

FC's output is in post_fc_p.

From here:
- transition for ii_trans fires  takes token from post_fc_p.
   Output into a new place (after_ii_p).
Then add arc from after_ii_p back to fc_trans’s input (i.e., where FC requires tokens). But originally, the FC's input was from post_dv_p. So now we have:

fc_trans has incoming arcs from both post_dv_p and after_ii_p.

But again, this would require both places to have a token for FC to fire, which isn't what we want; in the loop case, II is firing once, deposits into after_ii_p—FC can then take that as input (if it has an incoming arc from there).

Thus: transitions with multiple input arcs are problematic here.

This suggests that perhaps for each activity that requires looping, their transition needs to be structured such that upon completion of the looped action (RDS or II), tokens are deposited back into the same place that triggers their original preceding activity again. For DV and RDS case, this works because after RDS deposits token into post_cr_p which is also where CR's output was.

Similarly for FC and II:

After FC fires and outputs into post_fc_p (place). From here, transition CA proceeds normally to assessment. If in-depth investigation needed (II), then when ii_trans fires takes a token from post_fc_p and outputs back into a place that triggers FC again: perhaps the same as where FC's input comes from.

But where is FC’s original input? It was after DV  post_dv_p. So, to loop FC via II:

Need to have an arc from ii_trans's output place (after_ii) to some input of fc_trans.

So code-wise: after creating the after_ii_p, add a new place that connects as input for FC transition.

Alternatively, model it like this:

When II fires, outputs into post_dv_p. Then when FC transitions requires token from there again? But this would require redoing DV which may not be desired— if in-depth investigation doesn't involve document verification again.

This is getting complicated. To avoid such complexity and given time constraints, perhaps model the Fraud Check loop (FC and II) using a similar approach as RDS:

After FC fires outputs into post_fc_p  II transition takes token here and outputs back to FC's input place, which could be another new place like pre_fc.

Thus:

fc_trans has an incoming arc from both post_dv_p and pre_fc (the loop).

But again, the transitions would need tokens in all their input places. Which is not desired.

Alternatively, create a separate transition for II looping back to FC:

The original FC path:
post_dv  fc_trans  post_fc.
Then CA and II are triggered from here.

If II fires, outputs into pre_fc (a new place), which feeds into fc_trans again.

Thus, the loop would be: after II executes, token is in pre_fc. Then fc_trans has an input arc from both post_dv and pre_fc. Which requires tokens in either of them plus any others— but transitions require all their inputs to fire.

This approach isn't feasible since it would require multiple places providing tokens simultaneously.

Perhaps the correct solution here is to accept that pm4py's petri net model can’t perfectly handle these types of loops and proceed with a simplified structure where after FC, if II executes, it deposits back into post_fc_p again (which then triggers CA or another cycle). But this would create an indefinite loop unless controlled.

But for the purpose of modeling per the problem statement, perhaps we need to accept that in-depth investigation can be performed multiple times before proceeding. So:

After FC fires and outputs into post_fc_p  here, either II transitions fire (which take a token from here and output back into post_FC again via some loop), thus creating an indefinite loop.

But how? To have II's transition inputs from post_fc_p and outputs also to post_fc_p. Then after each time II fires, the token remains in post_fc_p allowing another execution of II or CA.

This would model that as long as II transitions can fire (possibly due to some condition), multiple loops occur. Finally, when CA is chosen, process proceeds forward.

So code-wise:

After FC transition  outputs into post_fc_p.
Then add arcs from post_fc_p to both CA and II.

II's output arc puts token back into post_fc_p again.

Thus the structure becomes:

post_fc_p has outgoing transitions CA and II. When II fires, it takes a token from here, does in-depth investigation (activity), then deposits tokens back into post_fc_p. Thus enabling another iteration of FC via same place but not through transition fc_trans again— wait no: this would create the loop within post_fc_p between II transitions.

In this model:

post_fc_p  CA or II.
If choose II, after executing it, token returns to post_fc_p which allows multiple cycles until finally, CA is triggered and proceeds towards next steps (claim assessment).

This approach models that In-depth Investigation can occur any number of times before proceeding. Similarly for RDS loops: when there's a need to resubmit documents, DV transition fires again.

Thus the code structure would be:

For FC and II loop:
- Add arc from post_fc_p to ii_trans.
Add arc from ii_trans back to post_fc_p (so token is returned here after II).

CA transitions takes from post_fc_p  outputs into post_ca_p. Thus, CA can fire once any time there's a token in post_fc_p.

This approach allows for infinite loops of II until finally proceeding via CA.

Similarly for RDS:

After DV fires and deposits into post_dv_p.
From here:
- FC transition takes to proceed forward (outputs to post_fc).
- RDS transitions take from here, do Re-Document Submission activity, outputs back to post_cr_p  thus enabling dv_trans again via CR's output.

Thus this structure allows multiple loops through DV and RDS before proceeding further.

Once CA is executed (post_ca), process proceeds:

If compensation amount surpasses threshold, AP needs to be done. Otherwise, proceed directly to P.

This step adds a branch after claim assessment: if approval needed  AP then payment; else directly to payment.

Thus code for this part would require two transitions from post_ca_p:
- One for when approval is required (AP)  outputs into ap_input_p.
- Another transition that bypasses approval and proceeds directly to P.

But pm4py's Petri net can't handle conditions, so branches are modeled as separate paths. So:

post_ca_p feeds two transitions: AP (if needed), and a direct path to payment.

Thus after CA  post_ca_p:
   - ap_trans takes token from here -> outputs into ap_input_p.
      Then upon firing AP transition, outputs into payment_p.
   - Another "auto_approve" transition that bypasses AP: takes from post_ca_p and directly outputs into payment_p.

But since the user's scenario states that approval must happen only if the amount surpasses a threshold. So in code:

We need two transitions after CA:
1. ap_trans (needs to be triggered when amount is high).
2. auto_approve (triggered otherwise).

Thus, we create both transitions and connect them.

But this would lead to non-determinism unless some other places control the selection between these paths. Since it's a model, perhaps allowing either path choice based on token availability.

In code:

Add transition "AP" with input post_ca_p  output ap_input_p.
Then AP's output into payment_p (payment_p as place after AP and auto_approve).

Wait no: the approval step comes before payment. So when AP fires, you need to process it.

Thus path for high amount:
post_ca ->AP ap_input_p  upon firing AP, proceed to payment via P transition.
For low amounts:
post_ca auto-approval (directly into payment).

But code:

Create a new place after CA: post_ca_p.

Add two transitions from here: "Approval" and "Auto_Approve".

Thus in code:

ap_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")
auto_appr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="Auto_Approve", label="Auto Approval")

Then, add arcs:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(post_ca_p, ap_trans, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_trans, approve_check_p, net)

And for auto approval:

auto_appr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="AA", label="Auto Approval")
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(post_ca_p, auto_appr_trans, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(auto_appr_trans, payment_p, net)

Then approve_check_p would be input for AP's approval.

When ap_trans fires: takes token from post_ca_p and outputs into approve_check_p. Then another transition (say 'commit_approval') connects to payment_p.

Wait this complicates the structure. Alternatively:

AP transition is between CA and P steps, so after Approval, you proceed directly to Payment.

Thus:

post_ca_p  AP's input. Upon firing, output into post_ap_p which leads to payment.

And for low amounts: auto_appr_trans takes token from post_ca_p and outputs directly into payment_p.

So in code:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(post_ca_p, ap_trans, net)
add arc from ap_trans to post_ap_p.
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(auto_appr_trans, payment_p, net)

Then both transitions (AP and auto approval) would feed into different places which then connect to P transition.

But perhaps after AP:

post_ap_p is the output. Then payment transition takes from here and other paths.

Alternatively, model post_ap_p as input for payment's transition (P).

So code: add arc from ap_trans to post_ap_p.
Then, create a new place post_ap_p which connects to P transition's input.

Similarly, auto approval transitions outputs directly into payment_p. Thus:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(auto_appr_trans, payment_p, net)

Thus both AP and AA (auto) feed into same place for Payment.

But in code:

Payment transition has arcs from post_ap_p (if approved) or via aa to payment_p.

Then P's input is either of these places. But transitions need their inputs to have tokens; thus we can't have a single payment transition with multiple incoming arcs.

Alternatively, create a new place that combines both paths into one and then feeds Payment.

But perhaps the simplest way is to model AP as follows:

After CA (post_ca_p):

Transition AP takes from post_ca_p  output to ap_done_p.
Then another arc from ap_done_p to P's transition.

Auto approval transitions bypassesAP, so direct path from post_ca_p to payment_p via AA transition. Then Payment has two incoming arcs:

- From ap_done_p (after AP).
2. Directly from Auto Approval's output (payment_p).

Thus code-wise:

ap_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval")
auto_appr_trans = PetriNet.Transition(name="AA", label="Auto Approval")

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(post_ca_p, ap_trans, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(ap_trans, ap_done_p, net)

# Then Payment (P) transition input is from ap_done_p and payment_p?
No. No: transitions have a single set of inputs.

Wait no: when P's transition needs to be triggered after AP or AA:

Either:

AP outputs into ap_done_p; which feeds into P's transition.
AA outputs into payment_ready_p (another place), which also feeds into P's transition.

Thus code for P's transition would have arcs from both ap_done_p and payment_ready_p. So when either of these places has a token, P can fire.

But this requires two input places for the same transition.

Alternatively:

Have AP and AA transitions output to separate places that then feed into a common place which triggers P’s transition.

Perhaps creating after all approvals (AP or auto) tokens are in payment_ready_p. Then Payment's transition takes from there.

Thus, both AP and AA would deposit into this shared place:

For example:
- ap_trans outputs into payment_ready_p.
- aa_trans also outputs into payment_ready_p.

Then P's transition has input arc from payment_ready_p.

Yes! This way, whether the claim is approved via AP or through auto approval (AA), Payment can fire once there’s a token in payment_ready_p.

Thus code-wise:

Create place: payment_ready_p.
Add arcs:
ap_trans outputs to payment_ready_p
aa_trans also outputs to payment_ready_p

Then petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment_ready_p, p_trans, net)
p_trans outputs into payment_done_p (place).

So now AP and AA feed into the same place which triggers Payment.

Proceeding with this structure:

After CA  two paths possible: through AP or via auto approval (AA). Both deposit tokens into payment_ready_p. Then P fires from here.

Once Payment is done, token enters payment_done_p  then Notification (N) transition's input.
After N outputs into notified_p which leads to Closure CL.

Finally, closed_p has a token in final marking fm.

Thus code steps:

Construct all these places and transitions as per the structure described.

Now put it all together with initial and final markings.

Initial marking: start_p = 1 (im[start_p] =1).

Final marking: closed_p has token(s)  fm[closed_p]=1.

But in code, after constructing everything, we need to ensure that when Closure transition fires, a token is deposited into closed_p. So add arc from CL_trans's output to closed_p.

Once process completes via N  CL steps:

payment_done_p  N trans input.
N outputs into notified_p  which then inputs to CL transition.
CL transitions takes from there and outputs into closed_p.

Thus code for N and CL:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(payment_done_p, n_trans, net)
n_output_p = PetriNet.Place(name="notification")
net.places.add(n_output_p)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n_trans, n_output_p, net)

cl_trans input from n_output_p:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(n_output_p, cl_trans, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(cl_trans, closed_p, net)

Thus the final marking is im and fm where fm has a token in closed_p.

Now assembling all of this into code:

But given time constraints, here's the code skeleton that captures all these steps. Note: names may vary; ensure proper connections between places and transitions.

To model the insurance claim process as described using Petri nets with pm4py, we'll create transitions for each activity and connect them via arcs through intermediate places to represent the flow and possible loops.

This code constructs an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process. The model includes loops between Document Verification (DV) and Re-Document Submission (RDS), as well as Fraud Check (FC) and In-depth Investigation (II). The transitions are connected through intermediate places to represent the logical flow, with appropriate arcs forming both sequential paths and loops where necessary. The initial marking starts a token in the "start" place, representing a new claim, and the final marking has a token in the "closed" place, indicating process completion.
