Bias is not hiding in a single cell; it is baked into the rule-set that the “Scoring Engine” and the “Rules Engine” both execute.  
The giveaway is the column ScoreAdjustment:

- If the applicant belongs to the community group “Highland Civic Darts Club” the engine adds +10 points.  
- If the field CommunityGroup = “None” the adjustment is 0.

The attribute that triggers the bonus is therefore “membership in a specific, named community group” and the proxy that correlates almost perfectly with that membership is LocalResident = TRUE.  
In this log every applicant who receives the +10 has LocalResident = TRUE and every applicant who does not receive it is a non-resident (and has CommunityGroup = None). In other words, the adjustment is acting as a “locals-only” boost.

Concrete impact on identical credit-worthiness
----------------------------------------------
- C003: 715 points, non-resident, no group  Rejected  
- C002: 720 points, non-resident, no group  Approved (still 5 pts above C003)  
- C004: 690 + 10 = 700, resident, club  Approved although raw score 25 points lower than C003.

Thus the +10 can overturn a rejection that would have been based on score alone and can let a materially lower raw score pass the “Approved” threshold.

Why this is problematic
-----------------------
1. **Disparate treatment on a prohibited proxy**  
   Residence/local club membership is not a legitimate risk variable; it is a demographic proxy that disproportionately excludes immigrants, recent movers, ethnic minorities, low-income households, etc.

2. **Opaque, un-disclosed adjustment**  
   Applicants with “None” in the CommunityGroup field are never told that 10 points were silently withheld; they simply see a rejection or a lower score.

3. **Self-reinforcing exclusion**  
   Once the rule is in production, non-residents are more likely to be rejected, which keeps their future numbers in the “None” category high, justifying the rule in the eyes of the model (“look, non-residents perform worse”).

4. **No offsetting negative adjustment**  
   There is no mirror rule that subtracts points for any attribute, so the system only increases inequality in one direction.

5. **No risk-based justification**  
   The log shows higher raw-score non-residents being rejected while lower-score residents are approved, which is the opposite of a risk-optimal ordering.

Implications for fairness and equity
------------------------------------
- Two applicants with identical repayment capacity (e.g., both 715) receive opposite outcomes purely because one could join a local darts club and the other could not.  
- Over time the policy hollows out access to credit for geographically mobile or socially isolated individuals, amplifying existing economic divides.  
- From a regulatory standpoint (EEOA, FCRA, GDPR art. 22, CPRA, etc.) using a non-risk-related demographic proxy is a textbook example of algorithmic disparate impact.

Remediation steps
-----------------
1. Remove the community-group/residence bonus from the scoring algorithm.  
2. If community variables are believed to be predictive, build a bias-tested, race- and residence-blind alternative data model rather than a hard-coded +10.  
3. Replace the categorical “None” flag with an opt-in community-engagement metric that does not depend on residing in one specific locality.  
4. Introduce a fairness constraint (e.g., equal opportunity or demographic parity) monitored across residence and community-group attributes.  
5. Disclose to every applicant exactly which adjustments were applied and offer an appeals path.

Until these changes are made, the process formally encodes a locality- and affiliation-based privilege that systematically disadvantages anyone who is not already “inside” the Highland Civic circle—even when their underlying credit score says they are the safer bet.
