Here’s a crisp conformance check against the intended flows:

Interpreted target flows
- Fulfillment (sufficient inventory): Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- Cancellation (insufficient inventory): Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
- Key constraints:
  - Check inventory precedes any authorization, packaging, or shipping.
  - Authorize payment must occur after Check inventory and before Package items.
  - Package items must occur after authorization and before shipping.
  - Ship order must occur only after packaging and never after cancellation.
  - Close order must be the final activity.

Case-by-case assessment
- Case 1: Conformant.
  - Exact fulfillment sequence in correct order.

- Case 2: Violations.
  - Package items occurs before Authorize payment, violating “Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging” and “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.”
  - Although shipping follows packaging, the precondition (authorization before packaging) is broken.

- Case 3: Violations.
  - Ship order occurs after Cancel order, violating “Ship order should never occur after a cancellation.”
  - Authorize payment appears even though the case goes on to Cancel order. Interpreting cancellation as the insufficient-inventory branch (as described), authorization should not happen in that branch. This breaches the intended split: if insufficient, go directly to Cancel  Close.

- Case 4: Conformant.
  - Correct cancellation path: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.

- Case 5: Violations.
  - Ship order occurs without any preceding Package items, violating “Ship order should only occur after packaging.” Packaging is missing entirely in a fulfillment scenario.

Summary
- Conformant cases: 1, 4.
- Non-conformant cases: 2 (packaging before authorization), 3 (shipping after cancellation; authorization in a cancel path), 5 (shipping without packaging).
