### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - **Observation:** The average time is approximately 25 hours with an extremely low standard deviation of 1 hour.
   - **Concern:** This rigid and consistent timing might indicate that approvals are being scheduled artificially, bypassing necessary evaluations or checks.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - **Observation:** The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days.
   - **Concern:** Such a long and inconsistent delay suggests potential bottlenecks in the notification process, possibly due to resource constraints or backlogs.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - **Observation:** Claims are closed on average 2 hours after assignment, with a standard deviation of 1 hour.
   - **Concern:** This rapid closure without evident intermediate steps like evaluation or approval raises questions about whether some claims are prematurely closed.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - **Observation:** The transition takes only 5 minutes on average with a very low standard deviation of 1 minute.
   - **Concern:** This exceedingly short duration may indicate automated processes that skip detailed reviews or manual interventions, leading to insufficient scrutiny.

### Hypotheses for the Observed Anomalies

1. **Rigid Scheduling for Approvals (R to P):**
   - Automated scheduling systems might enforce fixed timelines for approvals, irrespective of claim complexity or resource availability.
   - Certain claim types (e.g., low-value claims) might be fast-tracked through predefined rules.

2. **Notification Delays (P to N):**
   - Limited resources (e.g., insufficient staff handling notifications) could cause delays in informing customers.
   - Backlogs during peak periods might exacerbate this issue.
   - Some claims might experience expedited processing due to priority flags, reducing the overall consistency.

3. **Premature Claim Closure (A to C):**
   - Claims with incomplete information or minor issues might be closed immediately after assignment without further evaluation.
   - Adjusters in specific regions or specializations might have different protocols, leading to inconsistent handling.

4. **Automated Notifications (E to N):**
   - Automated systems might send notifications immediately after evaluation, potentially skipping manual review steps.
   - This could result in errors or oversights if complex claims require additional verification.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### Query 1: Identify Claims with Abnormal R to P Times
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_time_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) - 90000) > 3600; -- Deviation from mean by more than 1 hour
```
- **Purpose:** Detect claims where the time between "Receive" and "Approve" deviates significantly from the expected average.

---

#### Query 2: Investigate Long Delays in P to N
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_time_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > 604800; -- More than 7 days
```
- **Purpose:** Find claims where the notification process took longer than the average delay.

---

#### Query 3: Check Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_time_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 7200; -- Less than 2 hours
```
- **Purpose:** Identify claims closed unusually quickly after assignment, which may indicate premature closures.

---

#### Query 4: Correlate E to N Times with Specific Adjusters
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id, 
       ce1.resource AS adjuster_name,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_time_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < 300; -- Less than 5 minutes
```
- **Purpose:** Determine if specific adjusters consistently exhibit rapid transitions from evaluation to notification.

---

#### Query 5: Analyze Regional Patterns in A to C Times
```sql
SELECT adj.region,
       COUNT(*) AS num_claims,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp))) AS avg_a_to_c_time_seconds
FROM claim_events ce1
JOIN claim_events ce2
    ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
JOIN adjusters adj
    ON ce1.resource = adj.name
WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY adj.region
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp))) < 7200; -- Less than 2 hours
```
- **Purpose:** Assess whether regional differences contribute to premature claim closures.

By executing these queries, we can pinpoint specific claims, adjusters, or regions contributing to the observed anomalies, enabling targeted investigations into process inefficiencies or systemic issues.
