**Comparing hiring process models**

I’m analyzing two partial order models of hiring steps to spot anomalies versus a normative flow. Model1 allows decision before interviews and onboarding before interview completion, but runs all tasks once including payroll. Model2 lets interviews occur before screening, repeats onboarding, and can skip payroll entirely—which is a severe violation. Weighing anomalies, Model1 aligns more with normative expectations despite its flaws.

**Normative reference process**  
In a “HiretoRetire” workflow we normally expect a largely linear flow: a job is posted, candidates are screened, selected candidates are interviewed, a hiring decision is made, the new hire is onboarded, payroll is set up, and the case is closed. Every step is required, and each has a natural ordering constraint (e.g., you cannot credibly decide before interviewing, and you would never close the case before the employee is on payroll).

### Analysis of Model1
- **Control-flow structure:** All activities must be executed once; the partial order only specifies precedence relations.
- **Observed anomaly:**  
  - The model constrains `Screen_Candidates` to precede both `Make_Hiring_Decision` and `Conduct_Interviews`, but it does **not** enforce `Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision`. Consequently, the decision may be taken as soon as screening is finished, even if interviews have not yet happened. Downstream tasks (`Onboard`, `Add_to_Payroll`, `Close_Case`) can therefore start while interviews are still pending.  
- **Severity:** This is a serious sequencing issue—deciding and onboarding before interviewing contradicts the business logic—yet every activity must still be executed exactly once, and key postdecision steps (onboarding, payroll, closure) remain compulsory and in the correct relative order.

### Analysis of Model2
- **Control-flow structure:** Besides the partial order, this model introduces a loop and an exclusive choice with a silent transition.
- **Observed anomalies:**  
  1. **Screening loosened from the main decision track:** `Screen_Candidates` only depends on `Post_Job_Ad`. There is no requirement that screening finish before interviews or the hiring decision. Screening might be completed after the decision or even after closing, which undermines its gating role.  
  2. **Repeated onboarding:** The loop `*(Onboard_Employee, skip)` forces at least one onboarding but allows it to be repeated arbitrarily many times, which is atypical and confusing for a single hire.  
  3. **Optional payroll (major violation):** An XOR between `Add_to_Payroll` and a silent transition enables the case to skip payroll altogether and still reach `Close_Case`. This directly contradicts the fundamental requirement of paying a newly hired employee.  
- **Severity:** The optional payroll branch is particularly damaging; it allows the process to end without ever adding the new hire to payroll.

### Which model is closer to the normative process?

**Model1** is clearly closer to the expected HiretoRetire sequence. Its main defect is the missing dependency from interviews to the hiring decision, leading to the possibility of deciding and even onboarding before interviews finish. While undesirable, all essential steps (including payroll) are still mandatory and executed once.

**Model2**, by contrast, contains multiple, more severe anomalies: screening can happen out of place, onboarding can repeat indefinitely, and—most critically—the payroll step can be skipped entirely. Allowing the case to close without adding the employee to payroll violates the core purpose of the process.

**Conclusion:** Model1 better preserves the integrity of the Hire-to-Retire workflow; Model2 deviates in ways that undermine fundamental process correctness.
