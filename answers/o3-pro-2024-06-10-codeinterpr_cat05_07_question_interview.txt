Here is a set of open-ended, clarifying questions I would put to the interviewee to deepen understanding of the end-to-end property-onboarding process:

Intake and Documentation  
1. How does a landlord’s initial request reach the regional office (phone, email, web form, referral), and does the intake channel influence any subsequent steps?  
2. What specific checklist or criteria does the property coordinator use to confirm that a document set is “complete and current”?  
3. Are there service-level targets for how quickly missing or outdated documents must be supplied before the file is closed or escalated?  
4. At what point is a formal management contract signed with the landlord, and who is responsible for validating its terms?

Data Entry and Systems  
5. Besides the attributes you mentioned (square footage, amenities, etc.), what other data points are captured in the central property database, and how is data quality enforced or audited?  
6. Which teams rely most heavily on that database downstream, and what problems arise if information is missing or inaccurate?

Property-Manager Assignment  
7. What weighting or algorithm—formal or informal—do you use to balance workload, geographic specialization, and experience when assigning a property manager?  
8. If no manager cleanly matches the criteria (e.g., everyone is at capacity), what happens next?  
9. How is the assignment decision communicated to the manager and recorded for accountability?

Kick-off with Landlord  
10. What agenda or template guides the introductory call, and how are action items and special conditions documented and shared afterward?  
11. Are there common “deal-breakers” that surface during this meeting which can halt or reset the onboarding?

Photography, Inspection, and Readiness  
12. How are photographers and inspectors sourced and scheduled—do you keep preferred vendors, or does the landlord choose?  
13. What standards must an inspection report meet before the property can progress, and who signs off?  
14. If repairs are needed, how are cost responsibilities negotiated, and what is the average turnaround time to reach “inspection passed” status?

Marketing and Activation  
15. What internal approvals (legal, branding, pricing) are required before marketing materials go live?  
16. How do you decide on the initial listing price—does the digital marketing team own that decision, or is it collaborative with analytics and the property manager?  
17. Are there distinct system statuses (e.g., Draft, Ready for Marketing, Active, Suspended) that govern when a property is visible to prospective tenants?

Tenant Screening and Leasing  
18. What criteria or scoring model do you use when evaluating tenant applications, and can the landlord override recommendations?  
19. When multiple qualified applicants exist, who arbitrates final selection and under what guidelines?  
20. How often do lease negotiations involve deviations from the standard template, and what is the approval path for custom clauses?

Compliance, Audit, and Quality Control  
21. Which audits are mandatory for every onboarding versus triggered only by certain risk factors (e.g., property type, rent value, jurisdiction)?  
22. How are findings from compliance or financial analysts fed back into earlier stages to prevent repeat issues?

Exception and Edge-Case Handling  
23. What are the most frequent exceptions that cause delays (special insurance, unusual property types, landlord stipulations), and how are they tracked and resolved?  
24. Is there an escalation matrix for high-risk or time-sensitive exceptions, and who has final decision authority?

Timing, Metrics, and Continuous Improvement  
25. What are the key performance indicators you monitor (e.g., days from intake to activation, tenant-screening turnaround, first-month rent collected), and how often are they reviewed?  
26. Where does the process most often bottleneck, and what recent changes have been made to alleviate those pain points?  
27. How do feedback loops from tenants, landlords, or internal teams drive updates to the onboarding procedure?

Communication and Tooling  
28. Which parts of the communication trail are centralized (CRM, project tool) versus scattered in email, and how do you ensure visibility across stakeholders?  
29. How do regional offices coordinate with central support teams when onboarding properties that span multiple jurisdictions?  
30. If a system outage or tool mismatch occurs during onboarding, what contingency plans exist to keep the process moving?

These questions should surface the nuanced decision rules, hand-offs, timelines, and exception paths that define the property-onboarding workflow.
