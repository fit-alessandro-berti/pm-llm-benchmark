### **Analysis of Normative Rule Violations & Desiderata Deviations**  

---

## **1. Identifying Normative Rule Violations**  
Normative rules **must** be followed strictly. Any deviation is considered an **error** in process execution.  

### **Case 1 (‚úÖ No Violations)**
- The sequence follows the strict ordering:
  - **Application Received ‚Üí Credit Check ‚Üí Risk Assessment ‚Üí Loan Decision ‚Üí Inform Applicant ‚Üí Finalize Documentation ‚Üí Close Case**
- No steps were skipped or reordered.
- Since the loan was **approved**, "Finalize Documentation" occurred before closing the case.  
‚úî **No violations**  

---

### **Case 2 (‚ùå Multiple Violations)**  
- **Violation 1**: "Risk Assessment" occurred **before** "Credit Check" (Normative Rule: Credit Check must occur first).  
- **Violation 2**: "Finalize Documentation" was performed after a **rejection**, which is **not allowed**.  

üî¥ **Errors in Execution:**
1. The process jumped ahead to **Risk Assessment** before completing the **Credit Check**, violating a strict ordering rule.  
2. After rejection, **Finalize Documentation should not have been performed**, but it was.  

---

### **Case 3 (‚úÖ No Normative Violations)**
- The sequence is followed correctly:
  - **Application Received ‚Üí Credit Check ‚Üí Risk Assessment ‚Üí Loan Decision ‚Üí Inform Applicant ‚Üí Finalize Documentation ‚Üí Close Case**
- Since the loan was **approved**, "Finalize Documentation" was completed before closing.  
‚úî **No violations**  

---

## **2. Identifying Desiderata Deviations**  
Desiderata are **recommended** practices, but violations are not critical errors.  

### **Case 1 (‚úÖ Meets all recommendations)**  
- **Credit Check** happened **within** 24 hours.  
- **Applicant was informed** within 48 hours.  
‚úî **No issues**  

---

### **Case 2 (‚úÖ Meets all recommendations)**  
- Even though there were **normative violations**, the recommended **timing guidelines** were followed correctly.  
‚úî **No additional desiderata issues**  

---

### **Case 3 (‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple Desiderata Deviations)**  
- **Credit Check Delay**: It happened **more than 24 hours** after the application was received (January 12 ‚Üí January 14).  
- **Late Informing of Applicant**: The decision was made on **January 14, but the applicant was informed only on January 16**, exceeding the recommended 48-hour window.  
- **No Follow-Up Call**: While not required, a follow-up call is **encouraged** before closing the case.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Suboptimal Behavior:**
1. The **Credit Check delay** may suggest inefficiencies in processing.  
2. The **delayed communication** with the applicant could cause unnecessary waiting time.  
3. The **lack of a follow-up call** means there was no extra effort to align expectations.  

---

## **3. Interpretation & Justification of Observed Behaviors**  

### **Case 2 ‚Äì Possible Explanation for Violations**
- The **Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check**, which suggests either:  
  - A procedural mistake.  
  - A miscommunication where the assessor incorrectly assumed the check was already completed.  
- The **Finalize Documentation after rejection** might indicate:  
  - An attempt to keep records consistent before closing.  
  - A misunderstanding of the rule that documentation is only finalized for approvals.

**How to Fix:**  
- Ensure process **automation or validation checks** enforce the correct sequence.  
- Educate employees on why finalizing documentation after rejection is **not needed**.  

---

### **Case 3 ‚Äì Possible Explanation for Desiderata Deviations**
- **Late Credit Check**:  
  - Could be due to workload, system delays, or manual intervention.  
- **Late Informing of Applicant**:  
  - The delay might indicate internal processing time, waiting for managerial approval, or communication backlogs.  
- **No Follow-up Call**:  
  - Perhaps not deemed necessary, or the team lacked the bandwidth.  

**How to Improve:**  
- Automate reminders for timely actions.  
- Establish SLAs to ensure **faster processing & communication**.

## **Final Summary**  

| Case | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Deviations? | Notes |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **1** | ‚úÖ No Violations | ‚úÖ No Deviations | Process executed correctly. |
| **2** | ‚ùå **Yes** (Wrong order + Incorrect Finalization) | ‚úÖ No Deviations | Errors in execution order and documentation handling. |
| **3** | ‚úÖ No Violations | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yes** (Delays + No Follow-up) | Process was correct but suboptimal due to delays. |

### **Key Takeaways:**
‚úÖ **Case 1** is an **ideal execution.**  
‚ùå **Case 2** has **critical rule-breaking mistakes** that **must** be fixed.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Case 3** follows rules but should improve **timeliness & communication.**
