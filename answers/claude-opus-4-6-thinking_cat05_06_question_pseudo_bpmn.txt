# 20 Open-Ended, Thought-Provoking Questions on the Smartphone Supply Chain Process

1. **Why** is market research positioned as a single upstream task rather than a continuous, iterative activity that feeds back into multiple stages of the process, and what risks arise from treating it as a one-time gate?

2. How does the organization decide **which components to source from which specific countries**, and what geopolitical, economic, or technological factors could disrupt these sourcing decisions (e.g., Taiwan Strait tensions affecting microprocessor supply)?

3. Given that the four component-sourcing tasks run in **parallel**, what contingency plans exist if one supplier stream experiences a significant delay while the others are ready드nd how is the cost of idle inventory at the join gateway managed?

4. What criteria determine whether a failed unit at the **Quality Checks & Diagnostics** gateway is sent for **rework versus scrap**, and how does the organization prevent a systemic quality failure from creating a bottleneck loop back to assembly?

5. How does the company balance the **cost trade-off between air freight and cargo shipping**, and what dynamic factors (e.g., launch-day hype, perishability of demand, fuel prices) influence the split decision at that parallel gateway?

6. To what extent does the **24/7 assembly operation** in Malaysia account for labor welfare, shift fatigue, and local regulatory requirements, and how might these human factors introduce hidden quality or reputational risks?

7. What mechanisms are in place to ensure **real-time visibility and communication** across all parallel paths듡rom component suppliers in four different countries to a single assembly plant드nd what technology stack supports this orchestration?

8. How does the process handle **customs clearance variability** across vastly different regulatory environments (e.g., EU CE marking, U.S. FCC compliance, Latin American import tariffs), and should this be modeled as parallel region-specific tasks rather than a single generic task?

9. What key **performance indicators (KPIs)** are used at each major gateway and task to measure cycle time, cost efficiency, defect rate, and on-time delivery, and how are they aggregated into an end-to-end supply chain health score?

10. How resilient is the process to a **single point of failure** at the Malaysia assembly plant, and has the organization considered dual-sourcing assembly or establishing a secondary plant in a different geographic region?

11. In the final **Exclusive Gateway** for demand adjustment, what data sources, forecasting models, and decision-making authority structures determine whether demand has truly "changed" versus normal fluctuation드nd how quickly can supplier orders actually be adjusted?

12. How are **VIP and pre-order direct shipments** prioritized without cannibalizing inventory allocated to retail and e-commerce channels, and what conflict-resolution mechanisms exist when allocation disputes arise?

13. What role do **sustainability and environmental considerations** play across the process듡rom raw material sourcing and intercontinental shipping to end-of-life product management드nd where in the BPMN flow should these checkpoints appear?

14. How does the organization manage **intellectual property protection** during the R&D and prototype phase, especially when design specifications must eventually be shared with multiple international component suppliers?

15. If a **product recall** is necessary after distribution, how would the reverse logistics flow integrate back into this process, and which gateways or tasks would need to be redesigned to accommodate returns efficiently?

16. What **stakeholder communication protocols** exist between the parallel distribution channels (retailers, e-commerce, VIP) and the regional distribution centers to ensure consistent messaging around availability, delays, or product changes?

17. How would the process need to change if the company adopted a **build-to-order or mass-customization** model instead of the current build-to-forecast approach implied by the linear flow?

18. What **ethical sourcing and labor auditing** procedures are embedded듪r should be embedded등ithin the component procurement parallel paths, particularly regarding conflict minerals and supplier working conditions?

19. How does the company account for **currency exchange volatility** when securing components from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the USA, and at what point in the process are financial hedging decisions made?

20. Could the **Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast** task be repositioned earlier or duplicated at multiple points in the process to create a more **demand-sensing, agile supply chain**, and what structural changes to the BPMN flow would that require?
