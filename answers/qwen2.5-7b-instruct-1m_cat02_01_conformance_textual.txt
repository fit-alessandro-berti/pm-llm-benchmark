Let's analyze each case in the provided event log against the normative process described.

### Case 1:
1. **Receive order**: 2023-10-05 09:00
2. **Check inventory**: 2023-10-05 10:00
3. **Authorize payment**: 2023-10-05 11:00
4. **Package items**: 2023-10-05 12:00
5. **Ship order**: 2023-10-05 13:00
6. **Close order**: 2023-10-05 14:00

**Violation:**
- **"Authorize payment" before "Check inventory"**: The normative process specifies that "Check inventory" must occur before "Authorize payment." In Case 1, "Authorize payment" is scheduled after "Check inventory," which is the correct sequence. Hence, there is no violation here.

### Case 2:
1. **Receive order**: 2023-10-06 09:00
2. **Check inventory**: 2023-10-06 09:30
3. **Package items**: 2023-10-06 10:00
4. **Authorize payment**: 2023-10-06 10:30
5. **Ship order**: 2023-10-06 11:00
6. **Close order**: 2023-10-06 11:30

**Violation:**
- **"Package items" before "Authorize payment"**: According to the normative process, "Authorize payment" should occur before "Package items." In Case 2, "Package items" is scheduled before "Authorize payment," which is a violation.

### Case 3:
1. **Receive order**: 2023-10-07 09:00
2. **Check inventory**: 2023-10-07 09:20
3. **Authorize payment**: 2023-10-07 09:40
4. **Cancel order**: 2023-10-07 10:00
5. **Ship order**: 2023-10-07 10:30
6. **Close order**: 2023-10-07 11:00

**Violation:**
- **"Ship order" after "Cancel order"**: The normative process states that "Ship order" should never occur after "Cancel order." In Case 3, "Ship order" is scheduled after "Cancel order," which is a violation.

### Case 4:
1. **Receive order**: 2023-10-08 09:00
2. **Check inventory**: 2023-10-08 09:10
3. **Cancel order**: 2023-10-08 09:20
4. **Close order**: 2023-10-08 09:50

**No Violation:**
- The sequence follows the normative process for insufficient inventory scenarios. After "Receive order" and "Check inventory" reveal that there is not enough stock, "Cancel order" is followed by "Close order," which is correct.

### Case 5:
1. **Receive order**: 2023-10-09 09:00
2. **Check inventory**: 2023-10-09 10:00
3. **Authorize payment**: 2023-10-09 10:30
4. **Ship order**: 2023-10-09 11:00
5. **Close order**: 2023-10-09 11:30

**Violation:**
- **"Authorize payment" before "Check inventory"**: The normative process specifies that "Check inventory" must occur before "Authorize payment." In Case 5, "Authorize payment" is scheduled after "Check inventory," which is the correct sequence. Hence, there is no violation here.
- **"Ship order" before "Close order"**: The normative process specifies that "Close order" should be the final activity. In Case 5, "Close order" occurs after "Ship order," which is a violation.

### Summary of Violations:
1. **Case 2**: "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
2. **Case 3**: "Ship order" after "Cancel order."
3. **Case 5**: "Ship order" before "Close order."

### Conclusion:
Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process as described in the text. The violations are due to incorrect sequences of activities, specifically the rules that "Authorize payment" should precede "Package items," and that "Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios, while "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and never after "Cancel order."
