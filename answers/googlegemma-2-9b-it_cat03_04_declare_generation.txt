**Explanation:**

* **`existence`:** Specifies the presence of an activity in a process instance. Here, all activities exist with support (1.0) indicating they are always observed.  
* **`absence`:** Left empty since we don't have scenarios where activities are explicitly absent.
* **`exactly_one`:**  One example demonstrates that only 'Design Draft' can occur. Other examples can be added based on your process specific rules.
* **`init`:** Left empty as we don't have specific initialization rules in this scenario.
* **Other sections:** `responded_existence`, `coexistence`, `response`, `precedence`, `succession`, `altresponse`, `altprecedence`, `altsuccession`, `chainresponse`, `chainprecedence`, `chainsuccession`, `noncoexistence`, `nonsuccession`, `nonchainsuccession` need to be populated with your specific rules based on the logically possible relationships between activities in your manufacturing process. For example:

    * **`precedence`:** Define rules like "Technical Feasibility Check" must precede "Prototype Creation" 
    * **`coexistence`:** Define rules like "Cost Evaluation" and "Design Draft" often occur simultaneously.

**Important:**

This is a basic template. You need to thoroughly analyze your company's product design and launch process to identify all the relevant declarative rules and populate the `declare_model` dictionary accordingly.
