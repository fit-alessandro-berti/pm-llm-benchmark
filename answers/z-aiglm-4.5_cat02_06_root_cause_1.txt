### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Event Log

#### 1. **Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**
The total resolution time for each case (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") is calculated below:

- **Case 101**:  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00, End: 2024-03-01 10:15  
  - Duration: **2 hours 15 minutes** (135 minutes).  

- **Case 102**:  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05, End: 2024-03-02 09:15  
  - Duration: **25 hours 10 minutes** (1,510 minutes).  

- **Case 103**:  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10, End: 2024-03-01 09:30  
  - Duration: **1 hour 20 minutes** (80 minutes).  

- **Case 104**:  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20, End: 2024-03-02 08:30  
  - Duration: **24 hours 10 minutes** (1,450 minutes).  

- **Case 105**:  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25, End: 2024-03-03 09:30  
  - Duration: **49 hours 5 minutes** (2,945 minutes).  

**Average Resolution Time**:  
- Total duration for all cases: 135 + 1,510 + 80 + 1,450 + 2,945 = **6,120 minutes**.  
- Average: 6,120 / 5 = **1,224 minutes** (~20.4 hours).  

**Identification of Long Cases**:  
- Cases exceeding **1.5× the average** (1,836 minutes) are flagged as significantly longer:  
  - **Case 102**: 1,510 minutes (1.23× average).  
  - **Case 104**: 1,450 minutes (1.18× average).  
  - **Case 105**: 2,945 minutes (2.41× average).  
- **Conclusion**: Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times, with **Case 105 being the most severe** (2.41× average). Cases 101 and 103 resolved efficiently (<2 hours).

#### 2. **Root Causes of Performance Issues**
Key patterns causing delays in Cases 102, 104, and 105:

##### **a) Escalations to Level-2 Agents**  
- **Cases 102 and 105** involved escalations to Level-2 teams.  
- **Impact**:  
  - **Case 102**: Escalation occurred 2.5 hours after assignment ("Assign to Level-1 Agent" at 09:00  "Escalate" at 11:30). Resolution was delayed until the next day.  
  - **Case 105**: Escalation happened quickly (50 minutes after investigation), but Level-2 investigation started **28 hours later** ("Escalate" at 10:00  "Investigate Issue" at 14:00 next day).  
- **Root Cause**: Level-2 teams likely have **high workloads, limited availability, or inefficient handoff processes**. The 28-hour gap in Case 105 suggests Level-2 agents are backlogged or work only during specific hours.

##### **b) Overnight Delays Between Investigation and Resolution**  
- **Pattern**: In all long cases (102, 104, 105), there was a **~19-hour gap** between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket":  
  - Case 102: Investigate at 14:00  Resolve at 09:00 next day (19 hours).  
  - Case 104: Investigate at 13:00  Resolve at 08:00 next day (19 hours).  
  - Case 105: Investigate at 14:00  Resolve at 09:00 next day (19 hours).  
- **Root Cause**: Resolution steps are **deferred to the next business day**, even when investigations complete mid-day. This suggests:  
  - Lack of same-day resolution policies.  
  - Agents may lack authority to resolve immediately after investigation.  
  - End-of-day handoffs introduce unnecessary delays.

##### **c) Long Waiting Times Between Activities**  
- **Case 102**:  
  - Triage took 25 minutes (08:05  08:30).  
  - Assignment took 30 minutes (08:30  09:00).  
  - **Critical Delay**: 150 minutes between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Escalate" (09:00  11:30). Level-1 agents struggled to handle the issue quickly.  
- **Case 104**:  
  - **Critical Delay**: 210 minutes between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (09:30  13:00). No escalation occurred, yet Level-1 agents took 3.5 hours to start investigation.  
- **Root Cause**: **Level-1 agents are overloaded or inefficient**. Long waits indicate:  
  - Poor workload balancing.  
  - Lack of prioritization for new tickets.  
  - Inadequate tools/training for faster investigation.

##### **d) Unnecessary Delays in Non-Escalated Cases**  
- **Case 104** did not escalate but still took 24+ hours. Delays stemmed from:  
  - Slow triage (40 minutes) and assignment (30 minutes).  
  - 3.5-hour wait before investigation.  
  - Overnight resolution delay.  
- **Root Cause**: **Process inefficiencies exist even without escalations**, suggesting systemic issues in Level-1 operations.

#### 3. **Insights and Recommendations**
##### **How These Factors Increase Cycle Times**  
- **Escalations**: Introduce dependencies on specialized teams, creating bottlenecks if Level-2 is overloaded.  
- **Overnight Delays**: Add fixed ~19-hour delays for tickets investigated after noon, unnecessarily extending timelines.  
- **Long Waits**: Indicate poor resource utilization, where tickets queue due to agent unavailability or inefficiency.  
- **Compounding Effect**: In Case 105, escalation (Level-2 delay) + overnight delay + slow Level-1 steps compounded to 49 hours.

##### **Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**  
1. **Optimize Escalation Process**:  
   - Implement **SLAs for Level-2 response times** (e.g., investigate within 4 hours of escalation).  
   - **Cross-train Level-1 agents** to handle common Level-2 issues, reducing escalation volume.  
   - Use **automated triage** to route complex tickets directly to Level-2, skipping Level-1 delays.  

2. **Eliminate Overnight Resolution Delays**:  
   - **Allow same-day resolution** for tickets investigated before 3:00 PM. Empower agents to resolve immediately post-investigation.  
   - Introduce **evening/night shifts** for critical tickets to avoid 19-hour gaps.  

3. **Reduce Waiting Times in Level-1 Workflow**:  
   - **Rebalance workloads**: Distribute tickets evenly among agents using AI-driven assignment.  
   - **Set time limits** for each step (e.g., investigate within 1 hour of assignment).  
   - **Provide real-time dashboards** to managers for monitoring queue lengths and agent availability.  

4. **Process Automation and Training**:  
   - **Automate routine tasks** (e.g., initial triage via chatbots) to free agent time.  
   - **Train Level-1 agents** on common issues to reduce escalations and investigation times.  

5. **Monitor and Iterate**:  
   - Track **key metrics**:  
     - Time between assignment and investigation.  
     - Escalation rate and Level-2 response time.  
     - % of tickets resolved same-day.  
   - Use **process mining tools** to visualize bottlenecks and test improvements.  

**Expected Outcome**:  
- Reducing overnight delays could cut ~19 hours from long cases.  
- Faster Level-1 responses and optimized escalations could lower average resolution time by 30–50%.  
- Case 105 (49 hours) could potentially resolve in <24 hours with these changes.
