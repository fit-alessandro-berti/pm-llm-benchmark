Short answer  
The log for Group B (the “un-protected” candidates) is the one that contains bias.  
The bias is introduced through the +5 “Association Boost” that is automatically added to the Cultural-Fit score whenever the applicant belongs to the “LocalBusinessLeadersClub.”  
Group A applicants never receive such an adjustment, although they follow exactly the same process steps.

How the bias appears in the data  
1. Extra variable and extra logic  
   • In Group A the field ScoreAdjustment is always 0.  
   • In Group B the field ScoreAdjustment can be “+5 (Association Boost).”

2. Concrete effect on otherwise similar cases  
   • P002 (Group A): Skill = 78, Personality = 75, Cultural-Fit = 60  Not Hired.  
   • U001 (Group B): Skill = 80, Personality = 72, Cultural-Fit = 60  65 after boost  Hired.  
     – Without the boost U001 would also have had 60 and would most likely have been rejected just like P002.  
   • U003 is hired with lower Skill and Personality scores than P003 because its Cultural-Fit reaches 63 only after the +5 boost.

3. Selectionrate parity conceals individual discrimination  
   • Both groups show 2 hires out of 3 (66 %).  
   • But that parity is achieved by granting a hidden advantage to the un-protected group; individual members of the protected group must meet a stricter effective threshold (Cultural-Fit  65 without any help).

Why this is problematic  
• Disparate treatment: membership in a private networking club—strongly correlated with socio-economic status and locality—is used as an explicit decision factor.  
• Transparency: the adjustment is not documented in the policy steps that candidates see; only the event log reveals it.  
• Legal compliance: many jurisdictions prohibit giving preference based on off-job club membership unless there is a strong, job-related justification (which is absent here).  
• Fairness: equally or better-qualified protected-group candidates (e.g., P002) are rejected while less-qualified un-protected candidates (e.g., U003) are hired.

Implications & mitigation  
1. Remove or neutralise the “Association Boost” unless a validated business necessity can be demonstrated.  
2. Institute a fairness audit: compare outcomes with and without the adjustment, test for disparate impact, and document justification for every scoring factor.  
3. Adopt blind or “fair-ranking” methods during Cultural-Fit checks so that personal affiliations do not leak into scoring.  
4. Provide the same, clearly defined adjustment opportunities to every applicant (e.g., industry certifications) rather than selective, socially skewed ones.  
5. Monitor not just aggregate hire rates but also decision consistency for similarly qualified individuals across groups.

Until such corrective measures are taken, Group B’s log clearly evidences a systemic bias that undermines equity in the hiring process.
