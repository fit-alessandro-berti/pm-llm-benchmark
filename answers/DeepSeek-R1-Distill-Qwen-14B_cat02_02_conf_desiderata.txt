Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to make sure I understand each part thoroughly.

First, the task has two main parts: normative rules and desiderata. I need to check each case against these.

Starting with **Case 1**.

**Case 1:**
- Activities in order: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- Looking at the sequence, it follows the exact order required by the normative constraints. Each step is done in the correct sequence, and after approval, documentation is finalized before closing. No issues here.

**Case 2:**
- Activities: Application Received  Risk Assessment (no Credit Check before)  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation (after rejection)  Close Case
- The first thing I notice is that Risk Assessment happened before Credit Check. According to the normative constraints, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. This is a clear violation.
- Also, after the rejection, they tried to finalize documentation, which isn't allowed. So two normative violations here.

**Case 3:**
- Activities: Application Received  Credit Check (2 days later)  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant (2 days after decision)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- No missing steps in the sequence. Credit Check came after Application, then Risk Assessment, etc. So normative rules are followed.
- Now, looking at desiderata: Credit Check was done 2 days later, which is beyond the recommended 24 hours. That's a desideratum violation.
- Informing the applicant took 2 days, which is over the 48-hour recommendation. Another desideratum violation.
- Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is another desideratum. So three desideratum issues here.

Now, for the second part, desiderata.

**Case 1:**
- All activities are timely and within the recommended windows. They also included a follow-up call, so no issues here.

**Case 2:**
- The Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative issue, but let's see desiderata. The timestamps are 8:00, 8:20, 9:00, etc. The Credit Check was done 1 hour after Risk Assessment, but since the order was wrong, it's not about timing. They might have done it quickly, but the main issue is the sequence. So desiderata-wise, maybe checking if any timing recommendations were violated. It seems they did the Credit Check relatively quickly after the application (8:00 to 9:00), but since the order was wrong, I think the desiderata here is about the promptness, but the main issue is the normative. Maybe they didn't violate desiderata timing, but the main issue is the normative.

Wait, in Case 2, the Credit Check was done 1 hour after Risk Assessment. The application was received at 8:00, Risk Assessment at 8:20, Credit Check at 9:00. So the Credit Check was done after, but the order was wrong. The desiderata says Credit Check should be done promptly after application, which they didn't do because they did Risk Assessment first. But actually, the Credit Check was done the same day, so maybe within the 24 hours. So perhaps the timing is still okay, but the order is not. So for desiderata, maybe they didn't violate the timing, but the order is the normative issue.

Wait, the desiderata is about timing, not about order. So in Case 2, the Credit Check was done within 24 hours, so that's fine. The Loan Decision was done 9:30, which is same day. Informing the applicant was done 10:00, same day, which is within 48 hours. So maybe the timing is okay, but the order is wrong. So for desiderata, maybe only the Follow-up Call is missing. But in the event log, there's no mention of a Follow-up Call for Case 2 either. So they missed that, which is a desideratum.

Wait, in the description, the event log for Case 3 doesn't have a Follow-up Call, but it's not specified for Case 2. So perhaps both Case 2 and 3 missed the Follow-up Call.

Wait, in the problem statement, the event logs are given:

Case 2 has no Follow-up Call, same as Case 3.

So for desiderata, both Case 2 and 3 have missing Follow-up Calls.

But in Case 2, the other timing recommendations were met. The Credit Check was done next day at 8:00, but the application was received at 8:00, so same day as Risk Assessment and Credit Check, but the order was wrong. So the timing for Credit Check was same day, so within 24 hours, so no desideratum violation there. The Loan Decision was same day, and Inform Applicant was same day, so within 48 hours. So only desideratum violations in Case 2 are the missing Follow-up Call.

In Case 3, the Credit Check was done 2 days later, which is beyond 24 hours, so violates desiderata. The Inform Applicant was done 2 days after Loan Decision, which is beyond 48 hours, so another violation. Also, no Follow-up Call.

So summarizing:

**Normative violations:**
- Case 2: Risk Assessment before Credit Check; Finalize Documentation after Rejection.
- Case 3: No normative violations.

**Desiderata violations:**
- Case 1: No issues.
- Case 2: Missing Follow-up Call.
- Case 3: Late Credit Check, late Inform Applicant, missing Follow-up Call.

Now, for the interpretations.

Case 2: Maybe the staff wasn't following the correct procedure, perhaps due to urgency or oversight. They might have started with Risk Assessment without realizing the Credit Check was pending. After the rejection, they might have mistakenly tried to finalize documentation, perhaps due to a system error or misunderstanding.

Case 3: The delay in Credit Check could be due to high volume or resource constraints. Similarly, the delay in informing the applicant might be due to backlogs or priority of cases. The missing Follow-up Call could be an oversight or not a priority in their process.

I think that covers it.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

1. **Identifying Normative Violations:**
   - **Case 2** violates the normative rules in two ways:
     - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** The Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment, but in this case, the Risk Assessment was done first (Application Received  Risk Assessment  Credit Check). This violates the required sequence.
     - **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection:** After the Loan Decision was Rejected, the process should close without finalizing documentation. However, Finalize Documentation was performed before closing the case, which is not allowed.

2. **Identifying Desiderata Failures:**
   - **Case 2:** Fails to meet the desiderata by not performing a Follow-up Call before closing the case.
   - **Case 3:** Fails in multiple desiderata aspects:
     - The Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the Application Received, exceeding the recommended time window.
     - The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision, not adhering to the prompt notification recommendation.
     - No Follow-up Call was conducted, missing another recommended best practice.

3. **Interpretations and Justifications:**
   - **Case 2:** The sequence error might result from staff oversight or system issues, leading to incorrect task prioritization. The post-rejection documentation could be due to a system glitch or procedural misunderstanding.
   - **Case 3:** The delays might stem from workflow inefficiencies or resource allocation, such as high caseloads. The missing Follow-up Call could be an oversight or a low priority in their process.

**Summary of Findings:**

- **Normative Violations:**
  - Case 2: Incorrect sequence (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and improper documentation post-rejection.
  
- **Desiderata Failures:**
  - Case 2: No Follow-up Call.
  - Case 3: Delayed Credit Check, delayed notification, and no Follow-up Call.

**Conclusion:**

Only **Case 2** has normative violations. **Case 3** primarily has desiderata issues.
