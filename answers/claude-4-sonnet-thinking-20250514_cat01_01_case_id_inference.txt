Looking at this interleaved sequence, I can identify **3 distinct cases** based on patient demographics (age, gender) and logical process flows. Here's my analysis:

## Case Grouping Analysis

### Case A: 45-year-old Male (ER Visit)
**Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15**
- Event 1: Register patient (08:05) - ER, 45M, private insurance
- Event 4: Initial triage (08:10) - ER, 45M, triage_code=3
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (08:15) - Radiology, 45M, left_leg
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (08:23) - ER, 45M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture
- Event 15: Patient discharged (08:30) - ER, 45M, followup=outpatient_clinic

**Process Flow:** Registration  Triage  X-ray  Diagnosis  Discharge

### Case B: 62-year-old Female (ER Visit)
**Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17**
- Event 2: Register patient (08:07) - ER, 62F, public insurance
- Event 5: Initial triage (08:12) - ER, 62F, triage_code=2
- Event 8: Lab test requested (08:16) - ER, 62F, blood_panel
- Event 10: Lab test completed (08:20) - Laboratory, 62F, normal_levels
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (08:22) - ER, 62F, diagnosis=minor_infection
- Event 14: Prescription created (08:27) - ER, 62F, antibiotics
- Event 17: Patient discharged (08:35) - ER, 62F, followup=pharmacy_pickup

**Process Flow:** Registration  Triage  Lab Tests  Diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge

### Case C: 28-year-old Male (Scheduled Surgery)
**Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18**
- Event 3: Register patient (08:07) - Surgery, 28M, private insurance
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (08:13) - Surgery, 28M, scheduled_knee_surgery
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (08:16) - Surgery, 28M, general_anesthesia
- Event 13: Surgery performed (08:25) - Surgery, 28M, arthroscopy
- Event 16: Recovery room (08:31) - Surgery, 28M, stable
- Event 18: Patient discharged (08:40) - Surgery, 28M, followup=physiotherapy

**Process Flow:** Registration  Pre-op Consultation  Surgery Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

## Key Identification Factors:
1. **Patient Demographics:** Consistent age/gender combinations across events
2. **Department Continuity:** Logical department progression for each case type
3. **Activity Sequence:** Each case follows expected hospital workflow patterns
4. **Timeline Logic:** Chronological progression makes sense within each case
5. **Clinical Context:** Additional info fields support the case groupings (e.g., fractureoutpatient, infectionantibiotics, surgeryphysiotherapy)
