**Explanation of Logic**

1. **Case Identification:** The events are grouped into cases based on the logical context of user work activities within a single application and document flow. Each case starts with an opening activity (e.g., "Editing Quarterly Report" at Case ID 1) and continues until the final closing event ("Closing Microsoft Word Document") at Case ID 16.

2. **Activity Naming:** High-level process steps have been assigned standardized names such as "Editing", "Typing Intro Paragraph", etc. These are derived from observed user actions (e.g., FOCUS, TYPING) and aim to represent the intent of each activity within a business context rather than raw system log verbs.

3. **Temporal Context:** The timestamps were preserved in their original order while grouping events into cases that reflect continuous work sessions across applications like Microsoft Word or Excel without breaks indicated by abrupt action switches (e.g., SWITCH).

4. **Derived Attributes:** Case IDs uniquely identify each case, providing a coherent identifier for the user's work session within process mining tools. The timestamps are included to track activity duration and timing between operations.

5. **Coherent Narrative:** By organizing events into logical cases that follow sequential user actions on documents (Quarterly_Report.docx) followed by interaction with external applications like Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Excel, the resulting event log narratively represents a typical workday involving document preparation for an annual meeting and subsequent updates in budgeting software.
