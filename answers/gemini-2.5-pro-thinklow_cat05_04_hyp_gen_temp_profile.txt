Based on the provided temporal profile model and database schema, here is an analysis of process anomalies, hypotheses for their causes, and SQL queries for verification.

### 1. Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile

The temporal profile model reveals several significant anomalies that suggest irregularities in the insurance claim handling process:

*   **Long Delay from Approval to Notification (`P` to `N`):** The average time of 7 days (604,800 seconds) between a claim being approved and the customer being notified is excessively long. The high standard deviation of 2 days indicates this delay is also highly inconsistent.
*   **Suspiciously Rigid Timing from Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`):** An average time of approximately 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with a very low standard deviation of only 1 hour is unusual for a process step that typically involves human evaluation. This suggests an automated or artificially constrained process.
*   **Premature Closure After Assignment (`A` to `C`):** The average time of 2 hours from an adjuster being assigned to a claim being closed is very short. This implies that key intermediate steps like Evaluation (`E`) and Approval (`P`) may be getting skipped for a subset of claims.
*   **Instantaneous Transition from Evaluate to Notify (`E` to `N`):** The 5-minute average time between evaluation and notification is too rapid to accommodate a proper approval (`P`) step, suggesting this step is bypassed in certain scenarios.

### 2. Hypotheses for Anomalies

Here are potential explanations for the observed anomalies:

| Anomaly                               | Hypothesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Long Delay (`P` to `N`)**           | **1. Batch Processing:** Customer notifications might be generated in a weekly batch job, causing approvals from early in the week to wait several days. <br/> **2. Manual Bottleneck:** The notification step could be a manual process (e.g., drafting and mailing letters) handled by an understaffed team, creating a significant backlog. |
| **Rigid Timing (`R` to `P`)**         | **1. Automated Approval Rules:** A system rule may automatically approve certain low-value or low-risk claims exactly 24 hours after submission to meet a strict Service Level Agreement (SLA). <br/> **2. Inflexible Batch Job:** An overnight batch job may be responsible for the approval step, leading to a fixed, non-variable time interval.   |
| **Premature Closure (`A` to `C`)**    | **1. Fast-Track Rejections:** Claims that are immediately identifiable as invalid (e.g., duplicate submission, missing information) may be closed by adjusters without a full evaluation. <br/> **2. Low-Value Auto-Closure:** A policy might exist to automatically close claims below a certain monetary threshold immediately after assignment.       |
| **Instantaneous Transition (`E` to `N`)** | **1. Skipped Approval for Denials:** When an adjuster evaluates and decides to deny a claim, the system may log the `E` and `N` events simultaneously, bypassing the `P` (Approve) step entirely. <br/> **2. Automated Adjudication:** For simple claims, an automated system might perform the evaluation and trigger the notification in a single, rapid transaction.         |

### 3. Verification Approaches with SQL Queries

The following PostgreSQL queries can be used to investigate these hypotheses.

---

#### **Query 1: Investigate Long Delays from Approval to Notification (`P` to `N`)**

This query identifies claims with a `P` to `N` delay of more than 5 days and aggregates them by the day of the week the approval occurred. This can help verify the "weekly batch job" hypothesis.

```sql
WITH p_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, "timestamp" AS p_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
),
n_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, "timestamp" AS n_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'N'
)
SELECT
    -- Extract the day of the week for the approval event
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM p.p_time) AS approval_day_of_week, -- 0=Sun, 1=Mon... 6=Sat
    COUNT(*) AS num_delayed_claims,
    -- Calculate average delay in days
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - p.p_time))) / 86400.0 AS avg_delay_days
FROM p_events p
JOIN n_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
-- Filter for claims where the P -> N delay is greater than 5 days
WHERE (n.n_time > p.p_time) AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.n_time - p.p_time)) > 432000)
GROUP BY approval_day_of_week
ORDER BY approval_day_of_week;
```

---

#### **Query 2: Investigate Rigid Timing from Receive to Approve (`R` to `P`)**

This query checks for claims approved with suspiciously consistent timing (24-26 hours after receipt) and groups them by `claim_type` and `adjuster_specialization` to see if this pattern is tied to specific rules or teams.

```sql
WITH r_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, "timestamp" AS r_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'R'
),
p_events AS (
    SELECT claim_id, "timestamp" AS p_time, resource
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
)
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    a.specialization,
    COUNT(c.claim_id) AS num_rigidly_timed_claims
FROM r_events r
JOIN p_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON p.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
-- Filter for a time difference between 24 and 26 hours (86400 to 93600 seconds)
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.p_time - r.r_time)) BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600
GROUP BY c.claim_type, a.specialization
ORDER BY num_rigidly_timed_claims DESC;
```

---

#### **Query 3: Identify Claims Closed Prematurely After Assignment (`A` to `C`)**

This query finds claims that were closed within 3 hours of being assigned and did not have an `E` (Evaluate) or `P` (Approve) event logged in between. It analyzes these claims by `claim_type` and average `claim_amount` to test the "fast-track rejection" or "low-value auto-closure" hypotheses.

```sql
WITH event_sequences AS (
    -- Get the sequence of activities for each claim
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '' ORDER BY "timestamp") AS activity_path,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN "timestamp" END) AS assign_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN "timestamp" END) AS close_time
    FROM claim_events
    GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(es.claim_id) AS num_prematurely_closed,
    AVG(c.claim_amount) AS avg_claim_amount
FROM event_sequences es
JOIN claims c ON es.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    -- Check for the "Assign then Close" path without evaluation/approval
    es.activity_path LIKE '%AC%' AND
    es.activity_path NOT LIKE '%A%E%C%' AND
    es.activity_path NOT LIKE '%A%P%C%' AND
    -- Check that the closure happened within 3 hours of assignment
    es.assign_time IS NOT NULL AND es.close_time IS NOT NULL AND
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (es.close_time - es.assign_time)) < 10800
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY num_prematurely_closed DESC;
```

---

#### **Query 4: Find Claims Skipping Approval (`E` directly to `N`)**

This query identifies claims where notification happened within 10 minutes of evaluation, but no approval event exists between them. This helps verify the "skipped approval for denials" hypothesis.

```sql
WITH event_pairs AS (
    -- Use LEAD() to find the next event for each 'E' event
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        "timestamp" AS e_time,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY "timestamp") as next_activity,
        LEAD("timestamp", 1) OVER(PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY "timestamp") as next_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'E'
)
SELECT
    ep.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ep.next_time - ep.e_time)) AS seconds_to_notify
FROM event_pairs ep
JOIN claims c ON ep.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE
    -- The next activity is 'N' (Notification)
    ep.next_activity = 'N'
    -- The transition happened in under 10 minutes (600 seconds)
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ep.next_time - ep.e_time)) < 600
ORDER BY seconds_to_notify ASC;
```
