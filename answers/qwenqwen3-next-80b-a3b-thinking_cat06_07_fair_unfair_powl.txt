<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to create two POWL models based on the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process described. The first model should include the potential unfairness through the XOR branch for community affiliation, and the second should remove that bias by having a uniform cultural fit check.

First, I need to recall what POWL models are. They're partially ordered workflows with activities, choices (XOR), loops, and partial orders. The key operators are XOR for choices, LOOP for loops, and StrictPartialOrder for defining the order between nodes.

Looking at the process description:

1. Initial screening: Resume parsing and data check. This has a loop for missing info. So maybe a loop where if data is incomplete, they request more info, then check again.

2. Preliminary skill assessment: After the data check, they take the skill test. If below threshold, they're disqualified. But the description says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified", so perhaps after the skill assessment, there's a check. Wait, but the problem description says the first step is resume parsing and data check with a loop. Then skill assessment.

Wait, the initial steps:

- Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: automated system scans resumes. If missing info, loop to request more details. So that's a loop where if data is incomplete, they request more info, then check again. So maybe the loop is between "DataCompletenessCheck" and "RequestMoreInfo", but how?

Wait, the description says: "Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding. If the resume is complete and structured correctly, the process continues."

So perhaps the process for the data check is: check if complete. If not, request more info, then go back to check. So it's a loop where you have a check activity, and if incomplete, you request more info and loop back.

But in POWL terms, the loop would be between a "DataCompletenessCheck" and a "RequestMoreInfo" activity. So the loop operator would have two parts: the activity that checks and the activity that requests more info. But how does that work?

Wait, the standard loop in POWL is * (A, B), which means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So for a loop where you check, if incomplete, request more info, then check again.

So maybe the DataCompletenessCheck is part of the loop. Let's say the loop is * (Check, RequestMoreInfo). But actually, the check would be the condition. Wait, but in POWL, the loop operator * (A, B) means that you first do A, then you can either exit or do B and then A again. So perhaps A is the check, and B is the request more info.

Wait, but the check might be part of the loop. Let me think. Suppose the process is: check if complete. If not, request more info, then check again. So the loop would be:

- Start with Check (if complete, proceed; else, go to RequestMoreInfo and then loop back to Check).

But in POWL, the loop is * (A, B), where A is the first part, B is the part to repeat. So perhaps:

The loop is * (Check, RequestMoreInfo), but Check would have a condition. However, POWL doesn't model conditions explicitly; the loop structure itself handles the repetition. So maybe the Check activity would have a condition that if it's incomplete, it leads to RequestMoreInfo, which then loops back. But in POWL, the loop is defined as * (A, B), where A is executed first, then you can choose to exit or do B and then A again.

Wait, the standard LOOP operator in POWL is defined as * (A, B), which means that you execute A, then you can either exit the loop or execute B and then A again. So for example, if you have a loop where you check, and if not complete, request more info and loop back.

So the Check activity would be A, and RequestMoreInfo would be B. So when Check is done, if it's incomplete, you do B (RequestMoreInfo), then A (Check again). If complete, you exit the loop.

So the loop model would be * (Check, RequestMoreInfo). But how is that modeled in POWL?

Yes, the LOOP operator takes two children: A and B. So the loop model is OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children [A, B].

So for the DataCompletenessCheck step, the loop would be * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). But wait, DataCompletenessCheck might be part of the loop. Let's see.

But the description says: "Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding. If the resume is complete and structured correctly, the process continues."

So the process is: check if complete. If yes, proceed. If no, request more info, then check again. So the loop is between checking and requesting more info.

So the loop would have two activities: DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop structure would be * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo), but how does that work?

Wait, in the LOOP operator, * (A, B), you first execute A, then you can either exit or execute B and then A again. So in this case, A is DataCompletenessCheck. If it's complete, exit the loop. If not, do B (RequestMoreInfo), then A again.

But DataCompletenessCheck would have a condition. However, in POWL, the model doesn't specify the conditions; the structure just defines the order. So perhaps the DataCompletenessCheck activity would be part of the loop. So when DataCompletenessCheck is done, if it's incomplete, you go to RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck. If complete, you exit.

So in the loop * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo), the first step is DataCompletenessCheck. If it's complete, exit. If not, do RequestMoreInfo, then DataCompletenessCheck again.

Yes, that makes sense. So the loop is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). But in POWL terms, the LOOP operator's children are [A, B], where A is the first part and B is the part to repeat. So in this case, DataCompletenessCheck is A, RequestMoreInfo is B.

Now, after the loop, the process continues to the SkillAssessment.

Then, after SkillAssessment, there's a possible disqualification. But the problem description says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed." So perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a check. If score below threshold, reject; else proceed. But how is that modeled?

Wait, the problem description says the process steps are:

1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check (with loop for missing info)

2. Preliminary Skill Assessment (scored automatically; below threshold disqualified)

3. Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (XOR branch)

4. Managerial Review & Final Decision

But in the first model, the XOR branch is after the SkillAssessment. So after SkillAssessment, if they pass, they go to the XOR choice between standard cultural fit or community affiliation check.

Wait, the description says: "At this stage, the company attempts to gauge whether applicants align with the company’s stated values. However, the process is not purely merit-based. Applicants who indicate membership in the “Global Business Leaders Club” or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation. This step is often an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

So the XOR branch is based on whether the applicant has community affiliation or not. So for the first model (with unfairness), after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between two paths: one for standard cultural fit check, and another for CommunityAffiliationCheck which gives a boost.

Wait, but the description says "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments." So the XOR branch is between two options: standard check or community check.

But how is the condition determined? Like, if the applicant has community affiliation, they go to CommunityAffiliationCheck, else standard. But the problem says that the process has an XOR choice, so perhaps the branching is based on some condition, but in POWL, the XOR operator is a choice between two options without a condition; the choice is made by the process. However, in reality, the condition would be whether the applicant has community affiliation, but the POWL model would model the choice as an XOR between the two paths.

But in the context of the problem, the first model should have an XOR branch where one path is standard cultural fit check and the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck. So the XOR would split into those two.

Wait, but the description says "either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments." So the XOR branch would have two options: one is the standard check, the other is a specific community check.

So for the first model (with unfairness), the structure after SkillAssessment would be an XOR between CulturalFitCheck (standard) and CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives advantage). Then after that, both paths lead to ManagerialReview.

Wait, but the problem says that CommunityAffiliationCheck is a path where the community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments. So maybe after the CommunityAffiliationCheck, the score is adjusted, but then it's part of the cultural fit evaluation.

But the exact details might not matter for the model; the key is that there's an XOR branch where one path includes the community-based check which introduces bias.

So the first model would have:

- Loop for data completeness (DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)

- Then SkillAssessment

- Then XOR between two options: standard CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck

- Then after both paths, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But wait, the description says that the Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check step is an XOR choice. So after SkillAssessment, the process branches into either standard cultural fit assessment or community affiliation check path.

Then, after that step, they proceed to Managerial Review.

But perhaps the CommunityAffiliationCheck activity would be a specific step that adds a boost, while the standard CulturalFitCheck is another. Then both lead to ManagerialReview.

Now, for the second model, without unfairness, there should be no XOR branch. Instead, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck, without any community-specific path.

So the second model would have the same loop, same SkillAssessment, then a single CulturalFitCheck (not branched), then ManagerialReview.

But let's check the steps again.

The process steps are:

1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check (loop for missing info)

2. Preliminary Skill Assessment (scored; below threshold may be disqualified)

But how is disqualification modeled? The description says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed." So after SkillAssessment, there's a check: if score < threshold, reject; else proceed.

So perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a decision point. But the problem description for the first model says that the XOR branch is for cultural fit and community affiliation check. So maybe the disqualification is part of the SkillAssessment step.

Wait, the problem says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified", so perhaps after SkillAssessment, if they fail, they are rejected. So there's a check after SkillAssessment to see if they passed.

But how to model that? Maybe the SkillAssessment activity is followed by a check. If passed, proceed to next steps; else, reject.

But in the POWL model, perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between passing and failing. But the problem description for the first model says that the XOR branch is for cultural fit and community affiliation check. So maybe the SkillAssessment is followed by a check for passing, but perhaps the disqualification is handled as part of the process.

Wait, but the problem says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed." So perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a decision: if passed, proceed to cultural fit check; else, reject.

But in the description of the process steps, the cultural fit check is step 3, which comes after skill assessment. So the SkillAssessment is followed by a check for passing. If passed, proceed to cultural fit; else, reject.

So for both models, after SkillAssessment, there's a check to see if they passed. If not, they're rejected. If yes, then proceed to cultural fit.

But in the first model, the cultural fit step has an XOR branch. In the second model, it's a single cultural fit check.

So the structure would be:

For both models:

- ReceiveApplication (maybe)

- DataCompletenessCheck (loop with RequestMoreInfo)

- SkillAssessment

- CheckPass (if score >= threshold, proceed; else, reject)

Then for the first model:

- XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck

- Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But wait, the description says that the cultural fit and community affiliation check is step 3. So after SkillAssessment, if passed, then the cultural fit step happens, which includes the XOR.

But the disqualification after SkillAssessment would be part of the process. So perhaps the SkillAssessment leads to a decision: if passed, go to cultural fit; else, reject.

So the model would have:

After SkillAssessment, there's a choice between two paths: one for rejection (if failed) and one for proceeding to cultural fit. But the problem description doesn't mention this in the XOR part. The XOR is specifically about the cultural fit step.

So maybe the SkillAssessment is followed by a check. If failed, reject. If passed, then proceed to the cultural fit step, which has the XOR.

But in POWL, how to model the rejection? For example, after SkillAssessment, if the score is low, then reject. So perhaps the SkillAssessment is followed by a choice between Reject and proceed to cultural fit.

But the problem description for the first model's XOR is about the cultural fit step. So the XOR is between two options for cultural fit, but only for those who passed the skill assessment.

So the structure would be:

- Loop for data completeness

- SkillAssessment

- Then a choice: if passed, then XOR between standard cultural fit and community check; else, reject.

But how to model the passing condition. In POWL, perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and proceeding to the cultural fit steps.

But the problem description says that the disqualification is part of the skill assessment step. So maybe the SkillAssessment activity itself includes the pass/fail check. Or perhaps there's a separate check.

But for simplicity, perhaps the SkillAssessment is followed by a Reject step if failed, and proceed if passed.

But in the POWL model, perhaps after SkillAssessment, there's a XOR between Reject and the next step (cultural fit).

But in the problem's description, the initial steps are:

1. Resume Parsing & Data Check (loop)

2. Skill Assessment (scored; below threshold disqualified)

So perhaps the SkillAssessment step includes the pass/fail check. So maybe the SkillAssessment is followed by a Reject if failed, or proceed to next steps.

But in the POWL model, the SkillAssessment would be an activity that leads to either Reject or next steps. So for example, after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and the next step.

But the problem says that the first model's XOR is for cultural fit and community affiliation check. So the XOR happens after the skill assessment pass.

So let's outline the first model:

- Start with ReceiveApplication (though maybe it's not explicitly mentioned, but perhaps the process starts with the application)

But the problem says "applicants first submit their resumes and are then prompted to fill out a detailed questionnaire..." So perhaps the initial step is ReceiveApplication, then DataCompletenessCheck.

But maybe the Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check is the first step.

But let's see the activities mentioned in the problem statement:

"ReceiveApplication," "DataCompletenessCheck," "RequestMoreInfo" for the loop, "SkillAssessment," "CulturalFitCheck," "CommunityAffiliationCheck," "ManagerialReview," "FinalDecision".

So possible activities:

- ReceiveApplication (maybe)

- DataCompletenessCheck

- RequestMoreInfo

- SkillAssessment

- CulturalFitCheck (standard)

- CommunityAffiliationCheck (biased path)

- ManagerialReview

- FinalDecision

- Reject (for those below skill threshold)

But perhaps the Reject step is part of the process after SkillAssessment.

So for the first model (with unfairness):

The process starts with ReceiveApplication (maybe), then DataCompletenessCheck loop.

Wait, the DataCompletenessCheck is part of the initial screening. So the loop for data completeness.

So the first step is DataCompletenessCheck. If incomplete, RequestMoreInfo, then back to DataCompletenessCheck. If complete, proceed.

So the loop is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment.

After SkillAssessment, check if passed. If not, Reject. If yes, proceed to XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then after those, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

But how to model the Reject. So after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and the XOR branch.

But in POWL, the XOR operator can have two options: Reject and the next step.

But perhaps the SkillAssessment leads to a choice between Reject and ProceedToCulturalFit.

But the problem says that the XOR branch is for the cultural fit step. So maybe after passing the skill assessment, the process branches into the two cultural fit paths.

So the structure would be:

After SkillAssessment, if passed, then XOR between standard cultural fit and community check.

But how to model the pass/fail. Perhaps the SkillAssessment activity includes the pass/fail check, but in POWL, the model would have a choice after SkillAssessment.

Alternatively, perhaps the SkillAssessment is followed by a check step. But to simplify, maybe the SkillAssessment leads to a choice between Reject and the next step.

But in the problem's description, the SkillAssessment step says "applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed." So the disqualification is part of the skill assessment step.

So for the POWL model, after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and proceeding to the next steps.

But in the first model, the next steps after passing skill assessment would be the XOR between the two cultural fit paths.

So the first model's structure would be:

- Loop for DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.

- SkillAssessment

- Then XOR between Reject and ProceedToCulturalFit.

But ProceedToCulturalFit would then have another XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But perhaps the Reject is a separate path.

Wait, the XOR after SkillAssessment would be between Reject and the cultural fit steps.

But then, the cultural fit steps would have their own XOR.

But in POWL, the model would have:

After SkillAssessment, there's a XOR between Reject and a sub-model for the cultural fit.

But the cultural fit sub-model would itself have an XOR between the two paths.

Alternatively, perhaps the SkillAssessment leads to a choice between Reject and the CulturalFitCheck (which includes the XOR).

But maybe the process after SkillAssessment is:

If passed, then go to the XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

So the structure is:

After SkillAssessment, the next step is an XOR between Reject and the CulturalFitXOR.

But perhaps the Reject is part of the SkillAssessment's outcome. So SkillAssessment leads to two possibilities: Reject or proceed to next steps.

So the model would have:

- SkillAssessment

- XOR between Reject and [CulturalFitXOR]

Where CulturalFitXOR is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, both lead to ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So for the first model, the structure would be:

Loop for data completeness.

Then SkillAssessment.

Then XOR between Reject and a sub-model that is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Wait, but the XOR after SkillAssessment would have two options: Reject and ProceedToCulturalFit. But ProceedToCulturalFit is another XOR.

So the model would have:

After SkillAssessment, a XOR between Reject and [CulturalFitXOR], where CulturalFitXOR is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, both lead to ManagerialReview.

Then ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

But in POWL terms, the structure would be:

- DataCompletenessCheck loop.

- SkillAssessment

- Then a XOR between Reject and another XOR (CulturalFitXOR)

But perhaps the CulturalFitXOR is part of the same level.

Alternatively, after SkillAssessment, if passed, then the process goes to a XOR between the two cultural fit paths.

So the structure would be:

After SkillAssessment, the next step is a XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

But CulturalFitXOR is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, they both lead to ManagerialReview.

But in POWL, how to model that.

Let's think step by step.

First, the loop for data completeness.

The loop is * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo). So the loop model is OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP, children [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo].

Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment.

Then, after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and ProceedToCulturalFit.

But ProceedToCulturalFit would be a sub-model that includes the XOR between the two cultural fit paths.

So the structure after SkillAssessment would be:

XOR between Reject and [XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck]

But then, after both paths of the inner XOR, they need to go to ManagerialReview.

So for the inner XOR (CulturalFitXOR), the two children are CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then both of those need to lead to ManagerialReview.

So the model would have:

- After SkillAssessment, a XOR between Reject and the CulturalFitXOR.

- CulturalFitXOR is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

- Then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, both lead to ManagerialReview.

- ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

But how to model the order. Because after the XOR, both branches need to lead to the same next step.

So for example, after the inner XOR (CulturalFitXOR), both options lead to ManagerialReview.

So the structure would be:

After SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

But CulturalFitXOR's children are CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after both of those, they proceed to ManagerialReview.

So in the POWL model, after the SkillAssessment, the next step is a XOR between Reject and the CulturalFitXOR.

Then, for the CulturalFitXOR, the two children are CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after those, both go to ManagerialReview.

So the partial order would have edges from CulturalFitCheck to ManagerialReview and from CommunityAffiliationCheck to ManagerialReview.

Similarly, the Reject path leads to FinalDecision? Or does Reject lead directly to FinalDecision?

Wait, if the applicant is rejected after SkillAssessment, then the process ends. So Reject would be followed by FinalDecision (but as a rejection).

But in the process description, the final decision is made after ManagerialReview. But if they are rejected after SkillAssessment, maybe they don't go through ManagerialReview.

Wait, the problem says:

"applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed."

So the disqualification happens before the cultural fit step. So the process for disqualified applicants would end there.

So perhaps the Reject step is a separate path that leads to FinalDecision (as rejection), while the passed applicants go through cultural fit steps.

But the FinalDecision step would be the same for both paths.

So perhaps after Reject, it's FinalDecision (with rejection), and after ManagerialReview, FinalDecision (with approval).

But maybe the FinalDecision is the same step, but the outcome is determined by the path.

But for the model, perhaps the Reject is a separate step that leads directly to FinalDecision.

So the structure would be:

- Loop for data completeness.

- SkillAssessment

- XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

- CulturalFitXOR is XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

- Then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, they lead to ManagerialReview.

- ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

- Reject leads to FinalDecision.

So the FinalDecision is the end step for both paths.

But in the first model, the CulturalFitXOR has two paths: standard and community-affiliated, which introduces bias.

Now, for the second model, without unfairness, there's no CommunityAffiliationCheck. So after SkillAssessment, if passed, they go to a single CulturalFitCheck (no XOR), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

So the structure for the second model:

- Loop for data completeness.

- SkillAssessment

- XOR between Reject and CulturalFitCheck (but wait, no, the CulturalFitCheck is a single path, so after SkillAssessment, if passed, go to CulturalFitCheck.

But the XOR after SkillAssessment would be between Reject and CulturalFitCheck.

Then CulturalFitCheck leads to ManagerialReview, which leads to FinalDecision.

So in the second model, there's no XOR for the cultural fit step; it's a single CulturalFitCheck.

Now, how to model this in POWL.

Let's recall the POWL structure.

POWL models can be built using:

- Transition for activities (with label)

- SilentTransition for silent activities

- OperatorPOWL for XOR, LOOP, etc.

- StrictPartialOrder for partial orders.

So for the first model (with unfairness):

Let's define each part.

First, the loop for data completeness.

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

But wait, the LOOP operator takes two children: A and B. So * (A, B) where A is executed first, then either exit or B and then A again.

So in this case, DataCompletenessCheck is A, RequestMoreInfo is B.

So LoopData = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, after the loop, SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Then, after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between Reject and the CulturalFitXOR.

So first, Reject = Transition(label="Reject")

Then, the CulturalFitXOR is an XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then, after CulturalFitXOR, both paths lead to ManagerialReview.

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

But also, the Reject path leads to FinalDecision.

So the structure after SkillAssessment:

XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

Then, the output of CulturalFitXOR (both branches) must go to ManagerialReview.

Then ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

Reject leads to FinalDecision.

So the partial order for the entire model would have:

- LoopData is first.

- Then SkillAssessment comes after LoopData.

- Then after SkillAssessment, there's a XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

- Then, after CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, they both lead to ManagerialReview.

- Reject leads to FinalDecision.

- ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

But how to model the XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

So after SkillAssessment, the next step is a XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

So the XOR operator would have children [Reject, CulturalFitXOR].

But in POWL, the XOR operator is a single node with two children.

So after SkillAssessment, we have an XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

Then, for the CulturalFitXOR's children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck), each of them must lead to ManagerialReview.

So the partial order would have edges from CulturalFitCheck to ManagerialReview and from CommunityAffiliationCheck to ManagerialReview.

Similarly, the Reject node leads to FinalDecision.

ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

So the entire structure would be:

- LoopData

- SkillAssessment

- XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR

- CulturalFitXOR has children CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck

- ManagerialReview comes after both CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

- FinalDecision after ManagerialReview and after Reject.

But how to model the edges.

Let's build the model step by step.

First, define the nodes.

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Reject = Transition(label="Reject")

CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, the order:

- LoopData must be executed before SkillAssessment.

- SkillAssessment must be executed before the XOR (Reject and CulturalFitXOR)

- The XOR node (let's call it SkillPassXOR) is the XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

Wait, the XOR after SkillAssessment is a node that has two children: Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

So SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

Then, after SkillPassXOR, the two children (Reject and CulturalFitXOR) must lead to their next steps.

For the Reject branch: Reject leads to FinalDecision.

For the CulturalFitXOR branch: CulturalFitXOR's children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) each lead to ManagerialReview.

ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision.

So the partial order for the entire root model would have:

- LoopData is first.

- Then SkillAssessment comes after LoopData.

- Then SkillPassXOR comes after SkillAssessment.

- Then, for the Reject path: Reject -> FinalDecision.

- For the CulturalFitXOR path: CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview, CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview.

- ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

So the StrictPartialOrder for the root would have all these nodes and the order edges.

Let's see.

The root would be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes including LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, Reject, CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.

But perhaps the root is built by combining these.

Alternatively, the entire model can be structured as follows:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, Reject, CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

Then add edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but wait, no. The SkillPassXOR is the XOR node, which has children Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So the edges from SkillPassXOR to its children are part of the XOR operator.

Wait, in POWL, the OperatorPOWL for XOR has children, and the partial order between the XOR node and its children is implicit. Because the XOR node is a container.

Wait, perhaps the way to build it is:

The SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and children [Reject, CulturalFitXOR].

So when you have SkillPassXOR, the children are Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So the partial order would have edges from SkillPassXOR to Reject and to CulturalFitXOR.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges are between the nodes.

Wait, perhaps the entire model is built as follows.

Let's start building the model step by step.

First, define the LoopData.

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Then, SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, the partial order for the root:

The root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes:

[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject]

Wait, but Reject is a child of SkillPassXOR, so it's part of the SkillPassXOR's children.

Similarly, CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of CulturalFitXOR.

So when building the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes include all the individual activities and the operator nodes.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the order edges define the dependencies.

So:

- LoopData must be before SkillAssessment.

- SkillAssessment must be before SkillPassXOR.

- SkillPassXOR must be before its children (Reject and CulturalFitXOR), but in POWL, the operator nodes have their children as part of their structure.

Wait, perhaps the StrictPartialOrder's nodes are the immediate children, and the order edges are between them.

For example, the root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision], but also the children of operators are part of the nodes.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the example given in the problem statement.

In the example:

A = Transition(label="A")

B = Transition(label="B")

C = Transition(label="C")

skip = SilentTransition()

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[C, skip])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])

root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

So in this example, the root is a StrictPartialOrder with two nodes: loop (which is an OperatorPOWL) and xor (another OperatorPOWL). Then the order has an edge from loop to xor.

So the loop is executed first, then the xor.

But in this case, the loop is a single node in the StrictPartialOrder, and the xor is another.

Similarly, in our case, the root would be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes for the main components.

So for the first model:

- LoopData is a node (OperatorPOWL for loop)

- SkillAssessment is a Transition

- SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL with XOR children [Reject, CulturalFitXOR]

- CulturalFitXOR is an OperatorPOWL with XOR children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]

- ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are Transitions.

But the StrictPartialOrder's nodes would include all these.

But in the example, the loop and xor are the nodes of the root StrictPartialOrder.

So perhaps the root is built as follows:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

But then, the SkillPassXOR's children are not part of the StrictPartialOrder nodes. Wait, no. In the example, the loop and xor are the children of the root StrictPartialOrder. But the loop itself is an OperatorPOWL with children [A,B], which are separate.

So for the root, the nodes are the top-level nodes. For example, in the example, the root's nodes are [loop, xor], which are the two OperatorPOWLs.

So for our first model:

LoopData is a node (OperatorPOWL)

SkillAssessment is a Transition

SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL

CulturalFitXOR is an OperatorPOWL

ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are Transitions.

But then, the order between them.

So:

LoopData must be before SkillAssessment.

SkillAssessment must be before SkillPassXOR.

SkillPassXOR must be before ManagerialReview and FinalDecision? No.

Wait, after SkillPassXOR, the Reject and CulturalFitXOR are executed. Then, for the Reject path, it leads to FinalDecision. For the CulturalFitXOR path, the CulturalFitXOR's children are executed, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

- LoopData -> SkillAssessment

- SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

- SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but in the model, SkillPassXOR's children are Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So the edges from SkillPassXOR to its children are part of the operator.

Similarly, CulturalFitXOR's children are CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

So the StrictPartialOrder for the root would have nodes [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, CulturalFitXOR, Reject, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck] ?

But in the example, the root's nodes are the two OperatorPOWLs (loop and xor), and the children of those are separate.

But in the example, the loop node has children A and B. So when the root is built as StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor]), and then the order edge loop->xor.

So in our case, the root's nodes would be the top-level components.

Let's see:

LoopData is an OperatorPOWL (children are DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo)

SkillAssessment is a Transition.

SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL with children [Reject, CulturalFitXOR]

CulturalFitXOR is an OperatorPOWL with children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]

ManagerialReview is a Transition.

FinalDecision is a Transition.

So the root's StrictPartialOrder would have nodes [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, CulturalFitXOR] ?

But the CulturalFitXOR is a child of SkillPassXOR, so perhaps it's part of the SkillPassXOR's children.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are the top-level elements.

Wait, perhaps the root is built as follows:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

Then, for the SkillPassXOR, it has children Reject and CulturalFitXOR.

CulturalFitXOR has children CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck.

So the edges would be:

- LoopData -> SkillAssessment

- SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

- SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview (but no, because SkillPassXOR's children are Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So the edges from SkillPassXOR to its children are part of the operator.

But the StrictPartialOrder's order would need to have edges between the nodes.

For example, after SkillPassXOR is executed, then Reject and CulturalFitXOR are executed. Then, Reject leads to FinalDecision. CulturalFitXOR's children are executed, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

- LoopData -> SkillAssessment

- SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

- SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but in the model, SkillPassXOR's children are Reject and CulturalFitXOR, so the order is that after SkillPassXOR, both Reject and CulturalFitXOR can be executed in parallel? No, because it's an XOR, so only one of them is executed.

Wait, in POWL, the XOR operator means that exactly one of the children is executed.

So for the SkillPassXOR (XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR), when it's executed, either Reject or CulturalFitXOR is executed.

Then, after Reject is executed, it leads to FinalDecision.

After CulturalFitXOR is executed, then its children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) are executed, but since it's an XOR, one of them is executed. Then, whichever is executed leads to ManagerialReview.

So for the CulturalFitCheck path: CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview.

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview.

Then ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.

So the StrictPartialOrder nodes would include all these.

But how to model this in the StrictPartialOrder.

Let's think:

The root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes:

LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But perhaps the root's nodes are the main components.

Alternatively, the root is built as follows.

First, LoopData is a node.

Then SkillAssessment is a node that must come after LoopData.

Then SkillPassXOR must come after SkillAssessment.

Then, the children of SkillPassXOR are Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So after SkillPassXOR, either Reject or CulturalFitXOR is executed.

If Reject is executed, then it leads to FinalDecision.

If CulturalFitXOR is executed, then its children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck) are executed (one of them), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

- LoopData -> SkillAssessment

- SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

- SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but in the model, the XOR operator's children are part of the structure)

- SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

- CulturalFitXOR -> CulturalFitCheck (but CulturalFitXOR is an XOR, so it's one of the children)

- CulturalFitXOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck

- CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

- CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

- ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

- Reject -> FinalDecision

So in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges would be added as such.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are the individual activities and operators.

So the root's nodes would include all these.

But how to construct this in code.

Let's try to build the first model.

First, define all the activities.

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Reject = Transition(label="Reject")

CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, create the loop for DataCompletenessCheck.

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

But CulturalFitXOR needs to be defined first.

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Now, the root is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all these nodes.

But the StrictPartialOrder's nodes would be [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

Wait, but the Reject and CulturalFitCheck etc. are part of the children of the operators.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes must include all the top-level elements.

Alternatively, the root's nodes are:

- LoopData (OperatorPOWL)

- SkillAssessment (Transition)

- SkillPassXOR (OperatorPOWL)

- CulturalFitXOR (OperatorPOWL)

- ManagerialReview (Transition)

- FinalDecision (Transition)

Then, the order edges would be:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR (since CulturalFitXOR is a child of SkillPassXOR, but in the StrictPartialOrder, the edge would be from SkillPassXOR to CulturalFitXOR)

But also, SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but Reject is a child of SkillPassXOR, so in the StrictPartialOrder, the edge from SkillPassXOR to Reject)

Wait, but in the example, the root's nodes are loop and xor, and the edge is loop->xor.

So for our case, the root's nodes would include LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.

Then, edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but Reject is a child of SkillPassXOR, so maybe the edge is part of the operator structure)

Wait, perhaps the StrictPartialOrder only includes the top-level nodes, and the child nodes of operators are part of the structure.

For example, SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL with children Reject and CulturalFitXOR. So when you have SkillPassXOR in the root's nodes, the children are part of it.

Then, the edges between SkillPassXOR and its children are implicit.

But for the order between SkillPassXOR and ManagerialReview, etc.

So for example, after CulturalFitXOR is executed (which is a child of SkillPassXOR), then its children CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are executed. Then, those lead to ManagerialReview.

So the edges would be:

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Reject -> FinalDecision

So in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes are:

LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision

But also, the CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of CulturalFitXOR, so they are part of the CulturalFitXOR's structure.

Similarly, Reject is a child of SkillPassXOR.

So when building the StrictPartialOrder, the edges would be between the top-level nodes.

So:

- LoopData must be before SkillAssessment.

- SkillAssessment must be before SkillPassXOR.

- SkillPassXOR must be before ManagerialReview and FinalDecision? Not directly.

Because SkillPassXOR's children are executed. Then, for the Reject path, it leads to FinalDecision. For the CulturalFitXOR path, it leads to CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview? No. Because SkillPassXOR's children are executed, and then after that, ManagerialReview is executed.

But ManagerialReview is after CulturalFitXOR's children.

So perhaps:

- After CulturalFitXOR is executed (which is part of SkillPassXOR's children), then CulturalFitXOR's children are executed, then ManagerialReview.

So the edges would be:

CulturalFitXOR -> ManagerialReview

But CulturalFitXOR is an OperatorPOWL with children, so the execution of CulturalFitXOR leads to its children, which then lead to ManagerialReview.

So in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges would be:

- LoopData -> SkillAssessment

- SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

- SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR (but CulturalFitXOR is a child of SkillPassXOR)

- CulturalFitXOR -> ManagerialReview

- ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

- SkillPassXOR -> Reject

- Reject -> FinalDecision

But how to model this.

The StrictPartialOrder would have nodes:

LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject

Wait, Reject is a child of SkillPassXOR, so it's part of the SkillPassXOR's structure. But in the StrictPartialOrder, the nodes might include Reject as a separate node.

This is getting complicated. Let's look at the example again.

In the example:

A = Transition(label="A")

B = Transition(label="B")

C = Transition(label="C")

skip = SilentTransition()

loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])

xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[C, skip])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])

root.order.add_edge(loop, xor)

So the root's nodes are loop and xor, which are OperatorPOWLs. The edges are between them.

So for our case, the root's nodes would include:

LoopData (OperatorPOWL), SkillAssessment (Transition), SkillPassXOR (OperatorPOWL), ManagerialReview (Transition), FinalDecision (Transition), and perhaps CulturalFitXOR (OperatorPOWL), but CulturalFitXOR is a child of SkillPassXOR.

Wait, no. In the example, the loop and xor are the top-level nodes.

In our case, the top-level nodes would be:

- LoopData (OperatorPOWL)

- SkillAssessment (Transition)

- SkillPassXOR (OperatorPOWL)

- ManagerialReview (Transition)

- FinalDecision (Transition)

But CulturalFitXOR is part of the SkillPassXOR's children, so it's not a top-level node. Similarly, Reject is part of SkillPassXOR's children.

So the StrictPartialOrder's nodes are [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision]

Then, the edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview (but no, because ManagerialReview comes after CulturalFitXOR)

Wait, perhaps the edges are:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview (but this is not correct, because ManagerialReview comes after the CulturalFitXOR's children)

Alternatively, the CulturalFitXOR is part of SkillPassXOR's children, so the execution of CulturalFitXOR leads to its children, which then lead to ManagerialReview.

So the edges would be:

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

But CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of CulturalFitXOR, so they are part of CulturalFitXOR's structure.

So the StrictPartialOrder for the root would have edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview? No.

Because SkillPassXOR's children are executed (either Reject or CulturalFitXOR), then after that, the next steps.

But for the Reject path: Reject leads to FinalDecision.

For the CulturalFitXOR path: CulturalFitXOR's children lead to ManagerialReview, which leads to FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

- Reject -> FinalDecision

- ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

- CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

- CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

But how to model these in the StrictPartialOrder.

The StrictPartialOrder's nodes would include:

LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But Reject is part of SkillPassXOR's children, but in the StrictPartialOrder, we need to include it as a node.

So the root's nodes would be all these.

Then, the edges would be:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but in the XOR operator, the children are part of the structure, so the edge from SkillPassXOR to Reject is part of the operator's definition. But in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges are between the nodes.

Wait, perhaps the StrictPartialOrder's nodes are the top-level elements, and the edges between them.

For example:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> ManagerialReview (no, because ManagerialReview is after CulturalFitXOR)

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to build the model step by step.

First, create all the Transition objects:

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Reject = Transition(label="Reject")

CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

Now, create the loop for data completeness:

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Create the CulturalFitXOR:

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Create SkillPassXOR, which is XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR:

SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

Now, the root is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all these components.

But the root's nodes would be:

LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision

Because LoopData is an OperatorPOWL, SkillAssessment is a Transition, SkillPassXOR is an OperatorPOWL, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision are Transitions.

But the CulturalFitXOR is part of SkillPassXOR's children, so it's not a top-level node.

Now, the edges:

- LoopData must be executed before SkillAssessment.

- SkillAssessment must be executed before SkillPassXOR.

- After SkillPassXOR is executed, the children of SkillPassXOR are executed (either Reject or CulturalFitXOR).

- For the Reject path: Reject must be executed before FinalDecision.

- For the CulturalFitXOR path: CulturalFitXOR must be executed before ManagerialReview (since CulturalFitXOR's children are executed, then ManagerialReview).

- ManagerialReview must be executed before FinalDecision.

So the edges would be:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

Reject -> FinalDecision

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitXOR -> ManagerialReview

But how to model CulturalFitXOR -> ManagerialReview.

CulturalFitXOR is a child of SkillPassXOR, so in the StrictPartialOrder, the edge would be from CulturalFitXOR to ManagerialReview.

But CulturalFitXOR is part of the SkillPassXOR's children, so in the StrictPartialOrder nodes, we need to include CulturalFitXOR.

Wait, maybe the root's nodes should include CulturalFitXOR.

So the root's nodes would be:

[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject]

But Reject is part of SkillPassXOR's children, so it's a separate node.

So in the StrictPartialOrder:

nodes = [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject]

Then add edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject (but this is part of the XOR structure, but in the StrictPartialOrder, the edge would be from SkillPassXOR to Reject)

Similarly, SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

CulturalFitXOR -> ManagerialReview

Reject -> FinalDecision

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Also, the CulturalFitXOR's children are CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, which must be executed before ManagerialReview.

So edges from CulturalFitCheck to ManagerialReview and CommunityAffiliationCheck to ManagerialReview.

But CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are children of CulturalFitXOR, so they are part of CulturalFitXOR's structure.

Thus, the StrictPartialOrder's nodes would include them as well.

This is getting really complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to include all the Transition nodes in the StrictPartialOrder nodes.

So for the first model:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then add edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

Reject -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitXOR -> CulturalFitCheck

CulturalFitXOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

But wait, the CulturalFitXOR is an XOR, so only one of its children is executed. So the edge from CulturalFitXOR to CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck is part of the XOR structure.

But in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges would be between the nodes.

So for example, CulturalFitXOR is a node, and CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck are nodes. The edge from CulturalFitXOR to CulturalFitCheck would mean that CulturalFitCheck can only be executed after CulturalFitXOR is completed.

Similarly for CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But in reality, for an XOR, the CulturalFitXOR node's execution leads to either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck. So the edges would be from CulturalFitXOR to CulturalFitCheck and to CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But since it's an XOR, only one path is taken.

So in the StrictPartialOrder, the edges are added from CulturalFitXOR to both children.

Then, the children lead to ManagerialReview.

So the edges would be:

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

Yes.

So the full edges for the first model:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

Reject -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitXOR -> CulturalFitCheck

CulturalFitXOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Now, for the second model, without unfairness, there's no CommunityAffiliationCheck. So after SkillAssessment, if passed, they go to a single CulturalFitCheck.

So the structure would be:

LoopData (same loop)

SkillAssessment

Then XOR between Reject and CulturalFitCheck (no XOR for cultural fit, just a single path)

Then CulturalFitCheck leads to ManagerialReview, which leads to FinalDecision.

So the second model would have:

- Same LoopData

- SkillAssessment

- SkillPassXOR is XOR between Reject and CulturalFitCheck (no CulturalFitXOR)

- CulturalFitCheck leads to ManagerialReview

- ManagerialReview leads to FinalDecision

- Reject leads to FinalDecision

So the edges would be:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitCheck

Reject -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Now, to model this in code.

For the first model:

Let's define all the transitions.

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")

RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

Reject = Transition(label="Reject")

CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")

FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

Now, the root StrictPartialOrder:

nodes = [LoopData, SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, Reject, CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]

Then add edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitXOR

Reject -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitXOR -> CulturalFitCheck

CulturalFitXOR -> CommunityAffiliationCheck

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

CommunityAffiliationCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

For the second model, no CommunityAffiliationCheck. So:

LoopData (same)

SkillPassXOR is XOR between Reject and CulturalFitCheck.

So:

SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitCheck])

Then edges:

LoopData -> SkillAssessment

SkillAssessment -> SkillPassXOR

SkillPassXOR -> Reject

SkillPassXOR -> CulturalFitCheck

Reject -> FinalDecision

CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview

ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

Also, the CulturalFitCheck is a single Transition, not part of an XOR.

Now, let's code this.

First, for the first model (with unfairness):

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness
LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create CulturalFitXOR
CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Create SkillPassXOR (XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR)
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

# Define root StrictPartialOrder with all nodes
nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    CulturalFitXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    CommunityAffiliationCheck
]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add edges
root.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR)
root.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

This would be the first model.

For the second model (without unfairness), we don't have the CommunityAffiliationCheck. So:

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# SkillPassXOR is XOR between Reject and CulturalFitCheck
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitCheck])

nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck
]
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

root.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Yes, this would be the second model.

But in the second model, there's no CommunityAffiliationCheck, so all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck.

So that's correct.

Now, to check if this matches the problem's requirements.

First model has an XOR between standard cultural fit and community affiliation check, which introduces bias.

Second model has only a single CulturalFitCheck, no special branch for community affiliation.

Yes.

Now, in the first model, the CulturalFitXOR is between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck, so the community affiliation path is part of the XOR, which could lead to preferential treatment.

In the second model, no such branch exists; all go through CulturalFitCheck.

Perfect.

Now, the code for the two models.

But the problem says "produce two POWL models", so the answer should be two code snippets.

But the user probably expects the code as per the example given.

So for the first model (with unfairness), the code is as above.

For the second model, the code without CommunityAffiliationCheck.

But let's make sure all the edges are correctly added.

Yes.

Now, to write this in the answer.

The user wants the two POWL models as code.

So the first model's code would be:

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness
LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create CulturalFitXOR (XOR between standard and community check)
CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Create SkillPassXOR (XOR between Reject and CulturalFitXOR)
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

# Define root StrictPartialOrder
nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    CulturalFitXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    CommunityAffiliationCheck
]
root_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add edges
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Then the second model:

import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# SkillPassXOR is XOR between Reject and single CulturalFitCheck
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitCheck])

nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck
]
root_without_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

root_without_bias.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

Yes, this should be correct.

But in the second model, there's no CommunityAffiliationCheck, so the CulturalFitCheck is a single activity.

This matches the requirement: the second model removes the special community-based branch, so all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation.

Perfect.

Now, to present this as the answer.

</think>
### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an XOR branch after the skill assessment where applicants with community affiliations are routed through a biased "CommunityAffiliationCheck" path, while others follow a standard "CulturalFitCheck". This creates an unfair advantage for applicants with local community ties.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness
LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation (biased path)
CulturalFitXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Create XOR for skill pass/reject decision
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitXOR])

# Define root StrictPartialOrder
nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    CulturalFitXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    CommunityAffiliationCheck
]
root_with_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add execution order edges
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitXOR)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitXOR, CommunityAffiliationCheck)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_with_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model removes all biased pathways. All applicants undergo the **same** cultural fit evaluation after passing the skill assessment, eliminating preferential treatment based on community affiliations.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
Reject = Transition(label="Reject")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

LoopData = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Single cultural fit check for all applicants (no XOR branching)
SkillPassXOR = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Reject, CulturalFitCheck])

nodes = [
    LoopData,
    SkillAssessment,
    SkillPassXOR,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision,
    Reject,
    CulturalFitCheck
]
root_without_bias = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add execution order edges
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(LoopData, SkillAssessment)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, SkillPassXOR)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, Reject)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(SkillPassXOR, CulturalFitCheck)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(Reject, FinalDecision)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root_without_bias.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Key Differences
- **With Unfairness**: The `CulturalFitXOR` node creates two distinct paths: one standard (`CulturalFitCheck`) and one biased (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`). This introduces a subtle advantage for applicants with community affiliations.
- **Without Unfairness**: All applicants follow the **same** `CulturalFitCheck` path after passing the skill assessment. The XOR branch only separates rejected candidates from those proceeding to a uniform cultural fit evaluation, eliminating bias.
