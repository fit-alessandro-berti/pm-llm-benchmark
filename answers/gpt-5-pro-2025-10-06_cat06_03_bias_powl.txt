Short answer: the XOR after PreliminaryScoring creates an optional, positive-only checkpoint (D) that some applicants get and others don’t. If routing to D is correlated with local ties or social networks, those applicants systematically receive a score uplift while otherwise similar applicants do not. That asymmetry can produce disparate impact and undermine procedural fairness, even if “local affiliation” is not itself a protected attribute.

How the bias arises
- Asymmetric opportunity for uplift: D only helps. Applicants routed to skip can never gain that incremental score, so expected scores diverge for otherwise similar risk profiles.
- Selection bias in routing: Who gets D? If it’s based on being a local resident or part of a known community group, selection is linked to social capital and geography—features often correlated with race, ethnicity, income, or immigration status. That creates proxy discrimination risks.
- Threshold effects: Small uplifts matter most near decision thresholds. Borderline cases from the “affiliated” group will clear ManualReview/FinalDecision more often than nonaffiliated peers with the same true risk.
- Procedural unfairness: Similar applicants are processed differently (some get extra evidence considered, others don’t). This violates “individual fairness” (treat similar individuals similarly).
- Auditability gap: Using a SilentTransition for skip means there is no explicit “we skipped D” event. That makes it harder to explain or audit why some applicants received the uplift opportunity and others didn’t.
- Feedback loops: If historical logs are used to retrain scoring/review policies, the uplifted approvals can reinforce the advantage for the affiliated group over time.

Implications of advantaging a nonprotected group
- Disparate impact via proxies: Even if “local affiliation” is not a protected class, it may correlate with protected attributes. Regulators often scrutinize practices that cause significant adverse impact unless there’s a validated business necessity and no less discriminatory alternative.
- Equity concerns: The design privileges social connectedness/local networks, which many disadvantaged applicants lack. This can entrench existing inequalities in access to credit.
- Consistency and transparency: Applicants with indistinguishable risk can receive different outcomes without a clear, consistently available path to the uplift, undermining trust and explainability.
- Portfolio and compliance risk: If the uplift isn’t strongly predictive of default, you get fairness risk without commensurate riskmanagement benefit—and potential regulatory and reputational exposure.

What to consider doing
- Make D symmetric and accessible: Either remove the XOR (apply the check to everyone) or provide an equivalent, universally accessible mechanism (e.g., standardized “community stability” evidence that any applicant can supply).
- Validate business necessity: Empirically test whether local affiliation adds predictive power after controlling for other features; calibrate the uplift to that incremental signal.
- Govern routing: If capacity limits preclude applying D to all, use unbiased allocation (e.g., randomized or stratified by risk) rather than network membership; log the routing decision explicitly (no silent skip).
- Audit for fairness: Monitor approval rates, TPR/FPR, and margins around thresholds by protected class and plausible proxies (ZIP code, language, immigrant status) to detect disparate impact; check for less discriminatory alternatives.
- Document and explain: Provide applicants with clear criteria for receiving any uplift and how to qualify without relying on insider networks.

Bottom line: The XOR branch embeds an optional, positive check that is likely to favor socially connected or local applicants. Without careful governance and validation, this design can produce disparate impact and procedural unfairness, even if the advantaged group is not itself legally protected.
