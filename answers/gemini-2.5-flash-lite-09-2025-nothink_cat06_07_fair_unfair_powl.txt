Here are the two required POWL models based on the provided hiring process description.

We will define the core activities first, based on the text:

| Activity Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ReceiveApplication` | Initial submission of resumes/questionnaires. |
| `DataCompletenessCheck` | Step 1: Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check. |
| `RequestMoreInfo` | Loop activity for missing data (part of the loop). |
| `SkillAssessment` | Step 2: Preliminary Skill Assessment. |
| `CulturalFitCheck` | Standard cultural evaluation. |
| `CommunityAffiliationCheck` | Biased step granting uplift based on affiliation (used in Model 1). |
| `ManagerialReview` | Step 4: Reviewer examines borderline candidates. |
| `FinalDecision` | Final approval or rejection. |

## 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (Model 1)

This model reflects the description where the Cultural Fit step involves an XOR branch allowing access to a potentially biased path (`CommunityAffiliationCheck`) based on local affiliations or group membership.

**Structure Rationale:**
1. **Data Completeness Loop:** `ReceiveApplication` $\rightarrow$ Loop (`DataCompletenessCheck` $\rightarrow$ `RequestMoreInfo`) $\rightarrow$ `SkillAssessment`.
2. **XOR Choice (Bias Point):** After `SkillAssessment`, the process branches: either the standard `CulturalFitCheck` OR the path involving the biased `CommunityAffiliationCheck`. We use an XOR operator here to represent the text's description: "This step is often an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."
3. **Sequence:** Both cultural paths lead to `ManagerialReview`, followed by `FinalDecision`.

```python
# --- Model 1: With Potential Unfairness ---

# 1. Define core activities (Transitions)
R_A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DCC = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo") # For loop body (B part)
SA = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CAC = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck") # The potentially biased path
MR = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
skip_tau = SilentTransition() # Used to close the XOR branch if CFC is chosen

# 2. Define the Loop structure (Data Completeness Check)
# * ( A, B ) -> A (check) then either exit or execute B (request info) then A again.
# We simplify the loop structure to: Check -> (if fail, Request Info -> Check again)
# A = DCC, B = RMI (The loop continues back to DCC until successful)
loop_body = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DCC, RMI])

# 3. Define the XOR structure (Cultural/Affiliation Check - The Bias Point)
# X ( A, B ) -> Either A (CFC) or B (CAC)
xor_bias = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CFC, CAC])

# 4. Construct the main Partial Order structure
nodes_m1 = {R_A, loop_body, SA, xor_bias, MR, FD}
root_m1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_m1)

# Define order relationships
# Initial step
root_m1.order.add_edge(R_A, loop_body)

# Data completeness loop resolves into Skill Assessment
# For simplicity in POWL, we treat the resolved loop end as leading to SA
# (A more precise model would require decomposing the loop structure further,
# but this captures the sequence: loop finishes -> SA starts)
root_m1.order.add_edge(loop_body, SA)

# Skill Assessment leads into the Biased XOR Choice
root_m1.order.add_edge(SA, xor_bias)

# Both paths from the XOR lead to Managerial Review
root_m1.order.add_edge(xor_bias, MR)

# Final step
root_m1.order.add_edge(MR, FD)

# Model 1 (POWL Graph Representation):
# ReceiveApplication --> Loop(DCC, RMI) --> SkillAssessment --> XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
```

## 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (Model 2)

This model removes the biased XOR branch. All applicants proceed directly from the Skill Assessment to a single, standardized Cultural Fit Evaluation, followed by the Managerial Review.

**Structure Rationale:**
1. **Data Completeness Loop:** Remains the same as Model 1.
2. **Standardized Cultural Check:** After `SkillAssessment`, there is only one path: `CulturalFitCheck`.
3. **Sequence:** The flow is purely sequential after the skill check.

```python
# --- Model 2: Without Unfairness ---

# 1. Define core activities (Transitions)
R_A_2 = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DCC_2 = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI_2 = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SA_2 = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC_2 = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck") # Standardized check for all
MR_2 = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD_2 = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 2. Define the Loop structure (Data Completeness Check)
loop_body_2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DCC_2, RMI_2])

# 3. Construct the main Partial Order structure
nodes_m2 = {R_A_2, loop_body_2, SA_2, CFC_2, MR_2, FD_2}
root_m2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_m2)

# Define order relationships
# Initial step
root_m2.order.add_edge(R_A_2, loop_body_2)

# Data completeness loop resolves into Skill Assessment
root_m2.order.add_edge(loop_body_2, SA_2)

# Skill Assessment directly leads to the standardized Cultural Fit Check
root_m2.order.add_edge(SA_2, CFC_2)

# Cultural Check leads to Managerial Review
root_m2.order.add_edge(CFC_2, MR_2)

# Final step
root_m2.order.add_edge(MR_2, FD_2)

# Model 2 (POWL Graph Representation):
# ReceiveApplication --> Loop(DCC, RMI) --> SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
