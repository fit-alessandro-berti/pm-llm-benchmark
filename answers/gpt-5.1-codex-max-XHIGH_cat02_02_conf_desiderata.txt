Based on the trace you provided, the strict constraints and the softer recommendations play out as follows:

1. **Normative compliance/violations:**
- **Case1** follows the prescribed order: ApplicationCredit CheckRisk AssessmentLoan Decision (Approved)Inform ApplicantFinalize DocumentationClose Case. There are no violations of the strict rules.
- **Case2** breaches several hard rules:
  * The Risk Assessment at 08:20 precedes the Credit Check at 09:00, which is against the required ordering.
  * “Inform Applicant” is part of the mandatory sequence after a decision, but it never occurs.
  * The loan was rejected, yet “Finalize Documentation” was performed; that activity should not occur in a rejection path.
- **Case3** respects the required ordering: Credit Check precedes Risk Assessment, which precedes Loan Decision; Inform Applicant comes after the decision; because it was approved, Finalize Documentation precedes Close Case. No strict violations.

2. **Desiderata (recommended but not strict):**
- **Case1** meets the timing recommendations for the credit check and informing the applicant; the only recommended step not present is the optional Followup Call before closing.
- **Case2** completed the credit check within 24hours and would have been within the 48hour window to inform the applicant, but the notification step is missing for normative reasons. A Followup Call did not occur, but that is optional.
- **Case3** shows two timing deviations: the Credit Check occurred more than 24hours after the application, and the applicant was informed more than 48hours after the decision. The Followup Call is also absent. These are suboptimal but not hard violations.

3. **Possible interpretations:**
- The misordering and inappropriate finalization in Case2 could stem from data entry errors or an escalation process that bypassed the standard flow; in any case it conflicts with the defined controls.
- The delays in Case3 may reflect workload peaks or additional checks that extended turnaround times. The lack of followup calls across cases could be due to resource constraints or a decision to skip nonmandatory customer outreach.
