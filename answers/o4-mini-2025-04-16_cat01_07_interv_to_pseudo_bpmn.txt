Notes on Variations & Ambiguities  
• Invoices with no PO may be handled by the Supplier Relationship Manager directly if there’s a contract discrepancy.  
• NonPO invoices (e.g., adhoc services) are escalated to the AP Supervisor who works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or reject the invoice.  
• Occasionally Purchasing Officer (Dan) performs both goodsreceipt confirmation and lineitem matching, then notifies AP Clerk to proceed. In some implementations, Dan’s confirmation step and Mary’s matching step are merged.  
• The “Schedule for Payment Run” may be automated or batched daily/weekly depending on system configuration.
