The main difference between these process variants is that they have different frequencies and performance metrics for discharge.

1. Frequency: The frequency varies significantly from group to group, with some groups having high frequencies of diagnosis successful treatments (e.g., FD), while others like ER might see lower numbers of these processes (e.g., ER).
2. Performance: Similar to process variants in clinical decision support systems, the performance metrics are based on diagnostic accuracy or treatment outcomes, which can vary from patient to patient.
3. Treatment successful: In some cases, patients may see high rates of treatment success after being treated for a longer period of time (e.g., ER).
4. Treatment unsuccessful: Similar to the FD variant, treatments are unsuccessful in this scenario and not seen as part of the process variants.

These differences are important because they indicate different levels of care or treatments provided by practitioners such as ER, FD, or others. Different approaches can lead to varying outcomes or require a longer treatment period before patients receive further care. It is crucial for healthcare providers to understand these variations so they can tailor their interventions and improve patient outcomes.
