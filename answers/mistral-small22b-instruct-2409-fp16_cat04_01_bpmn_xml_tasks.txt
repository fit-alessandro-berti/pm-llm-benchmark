 To identify and list the tasks in a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) process model, we typically look for `task` elements within the `process` element. Based on the provided XML snippet, it does not include any explicit `task` definitions. Instead, it primarily defines sequence flows (`sequenceFlow`) which connect different elements within the process model.

Assuming there are tasks defined elsewhere in the full BPMN diagram or missing from this snippet, here is a general way to identify and list tasks if they were present:

1. **Look for `task` elements**: These elements define individual tasks within the process flow.
2. **Extract `id` attributes**: Each task will have an `id` attribute which uniquely identifies it.
3. **List task names (optional)**: If `name` attributes are provided, include those for clarity.

Given that no explicit task elements are present in the snippet, I cannot list specific tasks. However, if you provide a complete BPMN diagram or additional XML content with tasks defined, I can help you extract and list those tasks.
