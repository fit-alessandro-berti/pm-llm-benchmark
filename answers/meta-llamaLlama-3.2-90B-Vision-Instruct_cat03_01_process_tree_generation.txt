To model the complex hospital patient management scenario into a process tree, we'll follow the steps and decision points as outlined. The construction of the process tree involves using the operators -> (sequence), X (exclusive choice), + (true concurrency), and * (loop), along with explicitly setting the parent-child relationships for each ProcessTree object.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Starting with the root node, which is a concurrency block to model the entire process
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Initial sequence of Arrival, Registration, and Intake Assessment
initial_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=initial_seq)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=initial_seq)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=initial_seq)
initial_seq.children.append(A)
initial_seq.children.append(RG)
initial_seq.children.append(IA)
root.children.append(initial_seq)

# Sequence block for Triage Interview and Triage Classification
triage_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage_seq)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage_seq)
triage_seq.children.append(TI)
triage_seq.children.append(TC)
root.children.append(triage_seq)

# Exclusive choice for initial diagnostic tests
initial_diagnostic_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=initial_diagnostic_choice)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=initial_diagnostic_choice)
initial_diagnostic_choice.children.append(CE)
initial_diagnostic_choice.children.append(FBP)
root.children.append(initial_diagnostic_choice)

# Loop for abnormal results evaluation and treatment
abnormal_results_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
abnormal_results_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)  # Loop body
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=abnormal_results_seq)

# Exclusive treatment choice
treatment_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=abnormal_results_seq)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=treatment_choice)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=treatment_choice)
treatment_choice.children.append(TM)
treatment_choice.children.append(SPT)
abnormal_results_seq.children.append(SC)
abnormal_results_seq.children.append(treatment_choice)

# Re-diagnostic test choice
RDT_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=abnormal_results_seq)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=RDT_choice)
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=RDT_choice)
RDT_choice.children.append(FCE)
RDT_choice.children.append(FBA)
abnormal_results_seq.children.append(RDT_choice)
abnormal_results_loop.children.append(abnormal_results_seq)
root.children.append(abnormal_results_loop)

# Concurrency block for Advanced Imaging and Nutritional Counseling
diagnostic_support = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=diagnostic_support)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=diagnostic_support)
diagnostic_support.children.append(AI)
diagnostic_support.children.append(NC)
root.children.append(diagnostic_support)

# Sequence block for Follow-up Appointment Scheduling and Detailed Discharge Instructions
final_admin_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=final_admin_seq)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=final_admin_seq)
final_admin_seq.children.append(FAS)
final_admin_seq.children.append(DDI)
root.children.append(final_admin_seq)

# Concurrency block for Billing, Insurance Claims Processing, and Medical Records Finalization
final_admin_tasks = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=final_admin_tasks)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=final_admin_tasks)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=final_admin_tasks)
final_admin_tasks.children.append(BL)
final_admin_tasks.children.append(ICP)
final_admin_tasks.children.append(MRF)
root.children.append(final_admin_tasks)
```

This code constructs the process tree as per the complex hospital patient management scenario's description. Each segment of the scenario is modeled using the appropriate process tree operators (sequence, exclusive choice, loop, and concurrency) and activities or silent steps as leaf nodes. The relationships between ProcessTree objects are established through their parent and children properties.
