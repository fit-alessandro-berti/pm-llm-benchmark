This is a consolidated “process-mining” style map showing three major end-to-end flows—procure-to-pay, returns, and order-to-cash—running side by side, each fed by its own upstream event-streams, with counts and average hand-off times annotated at every step.

1. Top-row sources  
   • VendorInvoiceItem (1.2 M objects, green)  
   • ReturnOrderItem (0.8 M objects, red)  
   • PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0 M objects, purple)  
   • SalesOrderItem (3.5 M objects, blue)  
   • PurchaseOrderItem (5.0 M objects, orange)  
   Each of these feeds a small “Start” oval, from which a colored arrow (matching the source) carries it into the first activity, with the arrow labelled by the average transit time in milliseconds.

2. Procure-to-Pay (left side)  
   – PurchaseRequisitionItem  Start  Create Requisition (Overall 3.0 M) in ~300 ms  
   – Create Requisition  Approve Requisition (Overall 5.7 M) in ~250 ms  
     • Approve Requisition also receives VendorInvoiceItem (600 ms) and ReturnOrderItem (450 ms)  
   – From Approve Requisition three branches:  
     a) Send Order (Overall 5.2 M) in ~200 ms  End (150 ms)  
     b) Check Stock (Overall 1.0 M) in ~320–500 ms  Approve Payment (1.5 M) in ~120 ms  Create Invoice (2.0 M) in ~500 ms  End (180 ms)  
     c) Process Return (Overall 0.8 M) in ~650 ms  Create Invoice (green/red flows) in ~300 ms  End (220 ms)  

3. Order-to-Cash (right side)  
   – SalesOrderItem  Start  Create Order (Overall 8.5 M) in ~400 ms  
   – PurchaseOrderItem  Start  Create Order (same node) in ~350 ms  
     • The Create Order box shows two dots (blue + orange), indicating it handles both sales and purchase orders  
   – Create Order fans into:  
     1) Pack Goods (2.0 M) in ~300 ms  
     2) Ship Goods (1.8 M) in ~200 ms  
     3) Confirm Delivery (1.7 M) in ~220 ms  
     4) Close Order (1.7 M) in ~180 ms  End (100 ms)  

4. Color-coding & volumes  
   • Every activity box carries one or more colored dots showing which upstream streams contribute to it.  
   • “Overall: X M” inside each box is the total number of objects seen at that step (including re-entries/loops).  
   • Arrow labels (e.g. “250 ms”, “600 ms”, etc.) are the average elapsed times between completion of the source step and start of the target step.

By laying out all five raw streams and their convergences (at “Approve Requisition” and “Create Order”), plus the subsequent fan-outs and end points, this view instantly highlights where volumes peak, which activities serve multiple processes, and which hand-offs are slowest—ideal for spotting bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
