Alright — let’s walk through this event log carefully using general knowledge of the **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** process.

---

## **1. Expected "Textbook" P2P Sequence**

The typical P2P cycle is:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  internal request.
2. **Approval** for requisition.
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)** to vendor.
4. **Receive Goods** (or services) from vendor.
5. **Receive Vendor Invoice**.
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (three-way match with Goods Receipt).
7. **Release Payment**.
8. **Close Case**.

The flow generally sticks to this order because:

- You shouldn’t approve or issue a PO without requisition approval.
- You shouldn’t pay before receiving goods and matching with invoice.
- Receiving goods **before** issuing the PO is atypical (goods shouldn't arrive without an order).
- Payment before invoice or before goods receipt can indicate control breakdowns and potential fraud.

## **2. Case-by-Case Analysis**

### **Case 1001 – Looks Standard**
```
Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Received  Invoice  Invoice Match  Payment  Close
```
- All steps are in logical order.
- No anomalies here.

---

### **Case 1002 – Multiple Sequence Problems**

**Observed sequence:**

1. Create Purchase Requisition (OK)
2. **Issue Purchase Order** (OK, but note: no recorded approval here before PO)
3. Vendor Invoice Received (OK so far, but before goods receipt)
4. **Release Payment** immediately after invoice – ***before requisition approval***, before receiving goods, and before invoice matching — major red flag.
5. **Approve Purchase Requisition** occurs **after** payment (!)
6. Goods Received happens after payment.
7. Match Invoice to PO is even **after payment**.
8. Close Case.

**Anomalies:**
- **PO issued before requisition approval**  weak controls.
- **Payment released before goods received or invoice matched**  financial & fraud risk.
- **Approval of requisition happens after payment**  process control failure; approval is meaningless if payment already made.
- Out-of-sequence activities suggest poor segregation of duties or logging issues.

**Why problematic:**
- Vendors are paid without assurance goods have been received.
- Approval process is circumvented, increasing chance of unauthorized expenditure.

### **Case 1003 – Payment Before Invoice**

**Observed sequence:**

1. Create Purchase Requisition  Approval  PO (OK)
2. **Release Payment** before invoice received or goods receipt.
3. Vendor Invoice comes afterward.
4. Goods received even later.
5. Invoice matched after goods receipt (finally correct here).
6. Close case.

**Anomalies:**
- Payment issued on Feb 8 but invoice not received until Feb 9 — this is backward.
- Payment before goods receipt (goods only on Feb 10)  again, paying before verifying fulfillment.
- It disrupts the standard P2P control flow.

**Why problematic:**
- Could lead to overpayment, duplicate payment, or payment for goods never received.
- Violates best practice to delay payment until the “3-way match” is complete.

---

### **Case 1004 – Goods Received Before PO Issued**

**Observed sequence:**

1. Requisition  Approval.
2. **Receive Goods** *before* PO issued (Feb 6 goods receipt; PO only issued 15 min later).
3. Invoice received, matched, payment, close.

**Anomalies:**
- Vendors shipped goods before an official PO existed — this is highly irregular.
- The PO serves as contractual authorization to supply goods. Shipments before POs mean procurement is not in control.
- Could be a result of retrospective ordering (“after-the-fact” POs).

**Why problematic:**
- Weakens procurement negotiation position.
- Increases risk of unapproved buying under “maverick spend” behavior.
- Creates reconciliation issues — goods may be received without proper contractual terms.

## **3. Summary of Anomalies**

| Case | Anomaly | Risk/Impact |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **1002** | PO issued before requisition approval; Payment before goods receipt and invoice matching; Approval after payment | Loss of control; possible fraud; payment for unreceived goods; approval is meaningless |
| **1003** | Payment before invoice received and goods receipt | Overpayment risk; poor financial controls; possible fraud |
| **1004** | Goods received before PO issued | Maverick buying; lack of formal contract; increases procurement risk |

---

## **4. General Control and Compliance Concerns**

These anomalies matter because:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Sarbanes–Oxley or similar financial control laws mandate approvals before commitments.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Early payments can be a fraud vector.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Out-of-order steps complicate reconciliation and vendor management.
- **Contractual Enforcement**: Purchase orders protect the buyer; receiving or paying without a PO puts the buyer at a disadvantage.
- **Audit Flagging**: These sequence errors are red flags for auditors.

---

 **Final takeaway:**  
Cases **1002**, **1003**, and **1004** involve serious deviations from best-practice sequencing in the Procure-to-Pay process. These deviations could indicate broken internal controls, logging errors, or intentional circumvention of approval rules. They pose financial, compliance, and operational risks.

If you’d like, I can **visually map these event sequences** into timeline diagrams so that the anomalies become even clearer at a glance. Would you like me to do that?
