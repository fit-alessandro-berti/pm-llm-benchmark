Based on the process variants provided for the protected and unprotected groups, there are several notable differences that could indicate unfair treatment. Here are the main differences I've identified using my domain knowledge of loan application processes:

1. Appointment Denials:
   - Protected group: 599 denials (19.9% of total)
   - Unprotected group: 363 denials (5.2% of total)
   The protected group faces a significantly higher rate of appointment denials, which could indicate bias at the initial stage.

2. Application Rejections:
   - Protected group: 960 rejections (31.9% of total)
   - Unprotected group: 664 rejections (9.5% of total)
   The protected group experiences a much higher rate of early application rejections, suggesting potential discriminatory practices in initial screening.

3. Loan Approval Rates:
   - Protected group: Approximately 141 approvals (4.7% of total)
   - Unprotected group: Approximately 2,461 approvals (35.2% of total)
   The unprotected group has a significantly higher loan approval rate, indicating a possible systemic bias against the protected group.

4. Complexity of Process:
   - Protected group: More frequent requests for co-signers and multiple collateral assessments
   - Unprotected group: Simpler processes with fewer steps on average
   The protected group often faces more complex and lengthy processes, which could be a form of indirect discrimination.

5. Skipped Examination:
   - Only present in the unprotected group (332 cases)
   This suggests that the unprotected group may benefit from expedited processes not available to the protected group.

6. Time Differences:
   - Protected group: Generally longer processing times
   - Unprotected group: Often shorter processing times for similar outcomes
   The protected group typically experiences longer wait times, which could be seen as unfair treatment.

7. Co-Signer Requests:
   - More frequent and earlier in the process for the protected group
   This suggests that the protected group is more often required to provide additional guarantees, which could be discriminatory.

These differences indicate potential systemic bias against the protected group, manifesting in higher rejection rates, more complex processes, longer wait times, and lower approval rates. Such disparities could be grounds for concern regarding fair lending practices and potential violations of anti-discrimination laws in financial services.
