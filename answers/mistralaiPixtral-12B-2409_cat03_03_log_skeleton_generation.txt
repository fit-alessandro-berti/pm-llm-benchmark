Certainly! Let's create a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process and define the corresponding Log Skeleton model with the specified constraints.

### Hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay Process
1. **Request for Purchase (RFP)**
2. **Approval of Purchase Request (APR)**
3. **Placing Order (PO)**
4. **Receiving Goods (RG)**
5. **Invoicing (INV)**
6. **Payment (PAY)**

### Log Skeleton Model

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RFP', 'APR'),  # Both must occur together
        ('PO', 'RG'),    # Both must occur together
        ('INV', 'PAY')   # Both must occur together
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('RFP', 'APR'),  # APR must come after RFP
        ('APR', 'PO'),   # PO must come after APR
        ('PO', 'RG'),    # RG must come after PO
        ('INV', 'PAY')   # PAY must come after INV
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RFP', 'APR'),  # APR must come after RFP
        ('APR', 'PO'),   # PO must come after APR
        ('PO', 'RG'),    # RG must come after PO
        ('INV', 'PAY')   # PAY must come after INV
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('RFP', 'PO'),   # RFP and PO should not occur together
        ('APR', 'RG'),   # APR and RG should not occur together
        ('PO', 'INV'),   # PO and INV should not occur together
        ('RG', 'PAY')    # RG and PAY should not occur together
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'RFP': {0, 1},    # RFP can occur 0 or 1 time
        'APR': {0, 1},    # APR can occur 0 or 1 time
        'PO': {0, 1},     # PO can occur 0 or 1 time
        'RG': {0, 1},     # RG can occur 0 or 1 time
        'INV': {0, 1},    # INV can occur 0 or 1 time
        'PAY': {0, 1}     # PAY can occur 0 or 1 time
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RFP', 'APR'),  # APR must immediately follow RFP
        ('APR', 'PO'),   # PO must immediately follow APR
        ('PO', 'RG'),    # RG must immediately follow PO
        ('INV', 'PAY')   # PAY must immediately follow INV
    }
}

print(log_skeleton)
```

### Explanation
- **Equivalence**: Activities that must occur together.
  - `('RFP', 'APR')`: Request for Purchase and Approval of Purchase Request must occur together.
  - `('PO', 'RG')`: Placing Order and Receiving Goods must occur together.
  - `('INV', 'PAY')`: Invoicing and Payment must occur together.

- **Always Before**: Activities that must occur before another activity.
  - `('RFP', 'APR')`: Approval must come after Request.
  - `('APR', 'PO')`: Placing Order must come after Approval.
  - `('PO', 'RG')`: Receiving Goods must come after Placing Order.
  - `('INV', 'PAY')`: Payment must come after Invoicing.

- **Always After**: Similar to Always Before, but it's redundant in this case since the constraints are symmetric.

- **Never Together**: Activities that should not occur together.
  - `('RFP', 'PO')`: Request and Placing Order should not occur together.
  - `('APR', 'RG')`: Approval and Receiving Goods should not occur together.
  - `('PO', 'INV')`: Placing Order and Invoicing should not occur together.
  - `('RG', 'PAY')`: Receiving Goods and Payment should not occur together.

- **Activity Occurrences**: The number of times an activity can occur.
  - Each activity can occur 0 or 1 time.

- **Directly-Follows Constraints**: Activities that must immediately follow another.
  - `('RFP', 'APR')`: Approval must immediately follow Request.
  - `('APR', 'PO')`: Placing Order must immediately follow Approval.
  - `('PO', 'RG')`: Receiving Goods must immediately follow Placing Order.
  - `('INV', 'PAY')`: Payment must immediately follow Invoicing.

This Log Skeleton model encapsulates the declarative constraints for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process.
