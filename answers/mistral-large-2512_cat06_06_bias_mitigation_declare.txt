Here’s the updated `declare_model` with bias-mitigating constraints, followed by a rationale for each addition:

### Updated `declare_model`:
```python
declare_model = {

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
1. **`existence` of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`**:
   - Ensures these activities are present in traces where sensitive attributes are involved, forcing accountability.

2. **`responded_existence` for sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, etc.)**:
   - If a sensitive attribute is checked, a `ManualReview` must exist somewhere in the trace to ensure scrutiny.

3. **`coexistence` for decisions involving sensitive groups (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Female`, etc.)**:
   - Decisions for applicants from sensitive demographics must coexist with `ManualReview` to prevent biased outcomes.

4. **`response` constraints for sensitive attribute checks**:
   - After checking a sensitive attribute (e.g., race), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow to interrupt potential bias.

5. **`precedence` for `FinalDecision` and `Reject`**:
   - Ensures decisions are preceded by bias mitigation or manual review, reducing the chance of unchecked bias.

6. **`chainresponse` for sensitive attribute checks**:
   - Forces an *immediate* `BiasMitigationCheck` after checking sensitive attributes, preventing direct transitions to decisions.

7. **`nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession`**:
   - Prevents direct (or immediate) succession from sensitive attribute checks to `Reject`, breaking potential biased pathways.

These constraints collectively enforce:
- **Separation of concerns**: Sensitive attributes cannot directly influence decisions.
- **Accountability**: Manual reviews or bias checks must accompany decisions for sensitive groups.
- **Temporal separation**: Bias mitigation must occur between attribute checks and decisions.
