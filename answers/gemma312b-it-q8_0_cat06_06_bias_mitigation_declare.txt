# Explanation of Added Constraints:

# 1. Existence Constraints:
#    - "ManualReview": Ensures that a manual review activity is always present in the trace.
#    - "BiasMitigationCheck": Ensures that a bias mitigation check is always present in the trace.

# 2. Coexistence Constraints:
#    - "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: If an applicant from a minority group is approved, a manual review must coexist.
#    - "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: If an applicant from a minority group is rejected, a manual review must coexist.
#    - "RequestAdditionalInfo_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: If an applicant from a minority group requires additional information, a manual review must coexist.
#    These constraints ensure that decisions involving sensitive demographics are subject to additional scrutiny.

# 3. Non-succession Constraints:
#    - "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: Prevents a direct succession from checking an applicant's race to a rejection decision.
#    - "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: Prevents a direct succession from checking an applicant's gender to a rejection decision.
#    - "CheckApplicantAge": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}: Prevents a direct succession from checking an applicant's age to a rejection decision.
#    These constraints aim to prevent immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes by forcing an intermediate step (e.g., a bias mitigation check or a more thorough review).

# Overall, these added constraints promote fairness by ensuring that decisions involving sensitive attributes are subject to additional review and that immediate biased outcomes are prevented.  The use of "ManualReview" and "BiasMitigationCheck" activities introduces a layer of human oversight and encourages a more equitable decision-making process.
