### **High-Level Process Step Grouping and Justification**

Below is a structured representation of the proposed **high-level process steps**, derived from grouping low-level events. The grouping is based on **temporal proximity**, **logical sequence**, **resource type**, and **functional purpose**.

##  **Proposed High-Level Process Steps**

| **High-Level Step Name**     | **Description**                                                                 | **Included Low-Level Activities**                                                                                             | **Rationale for Grouping**                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Material Preparation** | Retrieves, identifies, positions, and prepares the raw material for processing. | - Retrieve raw metal sheet <br> - Scan barcode <br> - Place metal sheet on table <br> - Align metal sheet <br> - Preheat metal sheet | These activities logically form the preparation stage. Retrieving and scanning identifies the part. Placing and aligning ensures the material is correctly positioned. Preheating prepares it for the next operation (welding). All events are performed in sequence before any assembly begins. |
| **2. Assembly**             | Performs the physical construction of the product using tools and machines.         | - Pick up welding tool <br> - Weld corner A <br> - Weld corner B                                                              | These events represent the core construction phase. Picking up the welding tool and performing spot welds are part of assembling the structure. All welding actions are grouped under one resource (Operator B) and are contiguous in time. |
| **3. Quality Inspection (Weld)** | Verifies the structural integrity of the welds created during assembly.          | - Measure weld integrity                                                                                                      | This is a focused quality check specifically for the welds. The sensor measures a key quality metric (integrity score), which indicates whether the assembly meets standards. |
| **4. Surface Treatment**    | Applies protective finishing to the product to enhance durability and appearance. | - Apply protective coating <br> - Dry coating                                                                               | Coating and drying are logically connected finishing steps. Coating protects the product, and drying is a necessary follow-up step. Both are performed by specialized units. |
| **5. Final Quality Inspection** | Conducts a holistic visual inspection to ensure the entire product meets standards. | - Visual check                                                                                                               | This is the final gate before the product is signed off. It aggregates all previous steps and performs a human-led visual check to confirm overall quality. |

##  **Detailed Rationale & Grouping Logic**

### **1. Material Preparation**
- **Why it's a distinct step:**  
  This step sets the stage for all subsequent operations. Without preparing and positioning the raw material, no further processing can occur.  
- **Key Indicators:**
  - Temporal: Begins at the start of each case.
  - Logical Flow: Retrieval  Identification (barcode scan)  Positioning  Alignment  Preheating.
  - Resource Diversity: Involves both human operators and automated machines (Robot Arm), but all contribute to preparing the base material.

### **2. Assembly**
- **Why it's a distinct step:**  
  This represents the **core manufacturing** of the product — the physical construction.
- **Key Indicators:**
  - Logical: Tool pickup  Welding actions.
  - Resource: Same operator (Operator B) performs all welding-related actions.
  - Temporal: These actions occur after material preparation and before quality checks.
  - Functional: Adds structural integrity to the product.

### **3. Quality Inspection (Weld)**
- **Why it's a distinct step:**  
  This is a **specialized quality control** step focused solely on weld integrity.
- **Key Indicators:**
  - Functional: Directly measures a critical quality attribute post-welding.
  - Resource: Uses a dedicated Quality Sensor.
  - Placement: Occurs immediately after welding and before coating — ideal timing for weld inspection.

### **4. Surface Treatment**
- **Why it's a distinct step:**  
  This is a **post-assembly finishing** operation to protect and enhance the product.
- **Key Indicators:**
  - Logical Sequence: Coating  Drying (must happen after assembly but before final inspection).
  - Resource: Specialized coating and heating units.
  - Purpose: Ensures durability and aesthetics.

### **5. Final Quality Inspection**
- **Why it's a distinct step:**  
  This is the **last check** before the product is considered complete.
- **Key Indicators:**
  - Human-led: Conducted by Operator C.
  - Comprehensive: Evaluates overall product condition after all processing steps.
  - Timing: Performed after surface treatment — ensures final condition is assessed.

### **Aggregated into High-Level Steps:**

|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**     | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet |
| **Assembly**                  | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                                                           |
| **Quality Inspection (Weld)** | Measure weld integrity                                                                                       |
| **Surface Treatment**        | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                                                                        |
| **Final Quality Inspection**  | Visual check                                                                                                |

##  **Generalizable Grouping Rules**

These rules can be applied to the entire event log to automate the aggregation:

1. **Material Preparation**  
   - triggered by: `Retrieve raw metal sheet`  
   - includes: all events until `Preheat metal sheet`

2. **Assembly**  
   - triggered by: `Pick up welding tool`  
   - includes: all events until the next quality check or coating step

3. **Quality Inspection (Weld)**  
   - triggered by: `Measure weld integrity`

4. **Surface Treatment**  
   - triggered by: `Apply protective coating`  
   - includes: `Apply protective coating`, `Dry coating`

5. **Final Quality Inspection**  
   - triggered by: `Visual check`

##  **Summary**

By grouping low-level events into **five high-level process steps**, we achieve a **clear, interpretable view of the manufacturing workflow**. Each step reflects a logical phase in the production of the product — from preparing raw materials, to assembling the product, inspecting critical features, applying finishes, and conducting a final inspection. This abstraction enables better **process monitoring**, **bottleneck identification**, and **performance analysis** at a meaningful level of detail.
