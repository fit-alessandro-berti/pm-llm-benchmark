###  **Explanation of Transformation Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification: Single Coherent Work Session**
- All events occur within a continuous 9-minute window (08:59:50 to 09:08:15), with no significant breaks (>5 min gap) and no indication of a new user session (e.g., login/logout).
- The user is clearly working on **multiple interrelated documents**: a draft report (`Document1.docx`), a quarterly report (`Quarterly_Report.docx`), a budget spreadsheet (`Budget_2024.xlsx`), a PDF (`Report_Draft.pdf`), and an email thread.
- The workflow shows a **clear narrative**: drafting a report  checking email  reviewing supporting PDF  updating budget  integrating budget data back into draft  finalizing report.
- This sequence forms one **coherent work case**: preparing a quarterly report with supporting data and communication.
- Therefore, **all events are grouped into a single case: `Case_1`**.

> *Note: The initial FOCUS event at 08:59:50 on `Quarterly_Report.docx` is ignored as a likely system startup artifact or background focus, not a meaningful activity start. The first meaningful activity begins at 09:00:00 with `Document1.docx`.*

#### **2. Activity Naming: Semantic Enrichment**
Raw actions like `TYPING`, `SWITCH`, `CLICK` were transformed into **meaningful, analyst-friendly process activities**:

| Raw Action | Transformed Activity Name | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----------|
| `FOCUS`   | *Ignored or used as trigger* | Only used to infer context switch; not an activity itself |
| `TYPING`  | `Draft Intro Paragraph`, `Add Additional Details`, etc. | Contextualized by window title and content snippet (e.g., “Draft intro paragraph”) |
| `SAVE`    | `Save Draft Document`, `Save Budget Spreadsheet`, etc. | Annotated with document name to distinguish between artifacts |
| `SWITCH`  | `Switch to Email Client`, `Switch to PDF Review Tool`, etc. | Translated into purpose: “Switching to X to perform Y” |
| `CLICK`   | `Open Email: Annual Meeting`, `Reply to Email`, `Send Email` | Combined with window context to infer intent |
| `SCROLL`  | `Review Email Content`, `Review PDF Document` | Interpreted as document review behavior |
| `HIGHLIGHT` | `Highlight Key Findings in PDF` | Semantically meaningful action in review context |
| `CLOSE`   | `Close Draft Document`, etc. | Explicit end of activity on a document |

> Activity names follow **action-object** structure (e.g., “Update Q1 Budget Figures”) for consistency and traceability.

#### **3. Timestamp Preservation**
- All timestamps are preserved exactly as in the source log. No aggregation or sampling is applied to maintain temporal fidelity for process discovery (e.g., for conformance checking or performance analysis).

#### **4. Rationale for Excluding Initial FOCUS**
- The first event (`FOCUS, Quarterly_Report.docx`) occurs at 08:59:50, but no typing or editing follows until 09:00:00 on a *different* document (`Document1.docx`). This suggests the user may have opened Word earlier but didn't begin working until 09:00:00. Thus, the true “start of work” is marked at the first meaningful activity.

#### **5. Why Not Multiple Cases?**
- There is no evidence of a “session break.” The user moves fluidly between documents and tools, indicating a single work task: **preparing the quarterly report**.
- The email and PDF review are clearly **supporting activities** for the main task.
- The second Word document (`Quarterly_Report.docx`) is opened only *after* the draft (`Document1.docx`) is finalized — suggesting it is the **final version**, not a separate project.

###  **Final Notes for Process Mining Tools**
- This event log is ready for import into tools like **ProM, Celonis, or Disco**.
- Key attributes are clean and semantically rich, enabling:
  - **Process discovery** (e.g., discovering the sequence: Draft  Email  Review PDF  Update Budget  Integrate  Finalize)
  - **Conformance checking** (e.g., comparing against a model of “Quarterly Report Preparation”)
  - **Performance analysis** (e.g., time spent on email vs. drafting)
- Additional attributes (e.g., document name, app type) could be added as case or event attributes if needed for deeper analysis (e.g., `Document_Type: Draft` or `Tool: Word`).

This transformation turns a raw system log into a **meaningful, analyst-ready process event log** that captures the *intent* and *flow* of user work — not just keystrokes and clicks.
