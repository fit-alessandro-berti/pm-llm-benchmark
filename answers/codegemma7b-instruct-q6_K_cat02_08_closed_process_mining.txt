## Opposite Concepts:

* **Manual Process Discovery:** This involves manually collecting process data from various sources, such as logs, documents, or interviews, and then analyzing it to understand the process.
* **Reactive Monitoring:** This refers to monitoring the actual process execution in real-time, but only after an event has occurred.

## General Concepts:

* **Process Intelligence:** This broader term encompasses all activities related to understanding, improving, and optimizing processes. It goes beyond just discovering and analyzing processes to also include simulating them, predicting future events, and monitoring them in real-time.
* **Process Automation:** This refers to the use of technology to automate tasks within a process, potentially replacing manual work and increasing efficiency.

**Explanation:**

* The opposite of **Automated Process Discovery** is **Manual Process Discovery**.
* The opposite of **Predictive Monitoring** is **Reactive Monitoring**.
* The opposite of **Bottom-up Discovery** is **Top-down Discovery**. This refers to manually defining the process boundaries and then discovering the actual activities within them.
* The opposite of **Process Simulation** is **Process Description**. This refers to creating a simplified representation of the process without actually executing it.
* The opposite of **Process Efficiency** is **Process Inefficiency**.
* The opposite of **Real-time Monitoring** is **Offline Monitoring**. This refers to analyzing process data after it has been collected, rather than in real-time.

**Process intelligence** encompasses all of these activities, while being the broader term. **Process automation** is a specific technique used to improve process efficiency.
