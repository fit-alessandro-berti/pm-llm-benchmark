Certainly! Let's walk through the **pseudo-BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** diagram and explain the **underlying business process**, defining each step, gateway logic, branching paths, loopbacks, and decision conditions based on **request type** (Standard vs. Custom).

---

##  Overview of the Business Process

The process starts when a **customer sends a request**, either for a standard product/service or something custom. Depending on what the request is, the organization follows a different path involving validations, checks, quotations, approvals, and customer communication.

---

##  Step-by-Step Explanation

### **1. Start Event**
- **Trigger**: The process begins when a **customer request is received**.

---

### **2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose**: Intake or registration of the customer’s order/requirements.
- **Outcome**: The process understands the content/type of customer request.

---

### **3. XOR Gateway: "Check Request Type"**
- **Exclusive Decision (XOR)**: The process determines **whether the request is Standard or Custom**.
    - Only one path is taken based on this condition.

---

### **Standard Request Path:**

#### **4. Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose**: Ensures the standard product/service can be delivered as per normal operating procedures.
- Includes basic customer info validation, order completeness, SLA checks, etc.

#### **5. AND Gateway: "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Parallel Split (AND)**: Two activities must occur simultaneously:
    - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**
    - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
- These tasks **can be done in parallel** to save time.

#### **6. Join Gateway: "All Parallel Checks Completed"**
- **Parallel Join (AND)**: Waits for both credit and inventory checks to finish before moving forward.

#### **7. Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose**: Based on inventory and customer location, a delivery timeline is calculated.

---

### **Custom Request Path:**

#### **4. Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose**: Technical and operational assessment of whether the custom request can be met.
- Could involve engineers, procurement, and cost analysts.

#### **5. XOR Gateway: "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Decision Point**:
    - [If **Yes**]: Proceed to quotation preparation.
    - [If **No**]: Reject the request.

#### **6a. If Feasible  Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Purpose**: Identify pricing, delivery terms, and components needed for the custom request.

#### **6b. If Not Feasible  Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
- **End of Process** for this customer request.
- **Goes directly to End Event.**

---

##  Common Continuation After Either Path (Standard or Custom):

After either:
- Delivery Date is calculated (Standard Path), or
- Custom Quotation is prepared (Custom Path)



### **8. XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Decision Point**:
    - **[If Yes]**  Manager approval is needed (maybe due to high value, risk, or customization).
    - **[If No]**  Proceed directly to invoice generation.

---

### **If Approval Needed:**

#### **9. Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Manager reviews** order terms, profit margins, or technical risks.

#### **XOR Gateway: "Is Approval Granted?"**
- [If **Yes**]  Move forward to invoice.
- [If **No**]  Re-evaluation is triggered.

##### **[If Yes:]  Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**

##### **[If No:]  Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
- **Purpose**: Change conditions (pricing, delivery dates, specs) for a better proposal.

- **Loop Back Depending on Path**:
    - If from **Standard Path**, loop to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
    - If from **Custom Path**, loop to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**

    This is a loop to **refine** and **resubmit** until approval is granted or the process is canceled.

---

### **If Approval Not Needed:**

#### **10. Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- Prepare final cost breakdown for customer communication.

---

### **11. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose**: Final step—confirm to customer the order has been approved, invoiced, and is being processed.

---

### **End Event**
- Process terminates once the confirmation is sent or after rejection (in case customization is not feasible).

##  Path Differences: Standard vs Custom

| Feature                    | **Standard Request**                              | **Custom Request**                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Validation        | Basic validation only                            | Requires feasibility analysis                    |
| Parallel Tasks            | Credit Check & Inventory Check                   | None (only feasibility and quote)                |
| Delivery Estimation       | Yes (Task D)                                     | Not directly, implied via quotation             |
| Feasibility Decision      | Not required (assumed feasible)                  | Required after analysis                          |
| Quote Preparation         | Not applicable                                  | Mandatory if feasible                            |
| Re-evaluation Loop        | Goes to Task D (recalculate delivery)            | Goes to Task E1 (rework quotation)               |

##  Approval Logic Summary

| Condition                           | Outcome                                      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Approval Required & Approved       | Generate Final Invoice (Task G)              |
| Approval Required & Denied         | Re-evaluate Quote or Delivery Date           |
| Approval Not Required              | Directly generate Final Invoice              |

##  Key Gateway Types

| Gateway Type            | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **XOR (Exclusive)**     | Only one path can be taken based on a decision (e.g., request type or approval) |
| **AND (Parallel)**      | All outgoing branches are triggered simultaneously (e.g., credit + inventory)   |

---

##  Summary

The process **efficiently separates and handles standard vs. custom requests** by:
- Using **exclusive gateways (XOR)** to make logical decisions (custom vs. standard, approval outcomes).
- Utilizing **parallel gateways (AND)** to **reduce time** through simultaneous checks.
- Including flexible **loop-back mechanisms** to allow adjustment if approvals are denied.

This ensures:
- **Custom requests are properly evaluated** before quotations.
- **Standard requests move quickly** using streamlined validation.
- Organizational oversight is maintained via **conditional approvals**.
- The process ends either upon **sending confirmation** or **sending rejection notice** after infeasibility checks.
