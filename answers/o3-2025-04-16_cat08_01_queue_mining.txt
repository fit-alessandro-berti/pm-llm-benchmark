========================================
1. Queue Identification and Characterization
========================================
A. Operational definition of “waiting time”  
• For a given visit (case) i and two consecutive activities A and B executed in the discovered process model, the waiting (queue) time (AB) = Start timeB – Complete timeA.  
• This captures the patient’s idle time between the end of one touchpoint and the beginning of the next and is calculable directly from the START/COMPLETE pairs that exist in the log.  
• If two activities can occur in parallel, only “logical” successors identified in the process model (e.g., by an inductive miner) are considered to avoid inflating waits that are clinically intentional (e.g., bloodtest result turnaround done offline).

B. Metrics to compute per activity pair and per resource  
1. Centraltendency: mean, median waiting time.  
2. Dispersion: standard deviation, IQR, coefficient of variation.  
3. Extremes / service level: maximum, 90th/95th percentile, % of cases exceeding internal SLA (e.g., >15 min for RegistrationNurse).  
4. Frequency: number of visits that encounter the queue, % of all visits.  
5. Workinprocess profile: average queue length (Little’s Law: Lq =  × Wq).  
6. Blocking probability: % of time the downstream resource is busy when a patient is ready.

C. Prioritising “critical” queues  
Create a composite severity score for each activity pair:  
Severity = Normalised(Mean wait) × Weight1 + Normalised(%>SLA) × Weight2 + Normalised(Volume) × Weight3 + Optional urgency weight.  
Rank by severity. In pilots, the following queues typically surfaced:  
• Registration  Nurse Assessment (high volume, long tail).  
• Nurse Assessment  Doctor Consultation (high mean and very high 90th percentile; directly perceived by patients).  
• Doctor Consultation  Diagnostic Test (Cardio/ECG, XRay) (lower volume but extreme peaks that cause overtime).  
Crosstabulations by Patient Type and Urgency identify whether, for example, new patients experience 35 % longer waits in Registration while urgent patients are delayed mainly postconsultation.

========================================
2. RootCause Analysis
========================================
After locating the problematic queues, we drill down with specialised processmining views:

1. Resource bottlenecks  
   • Resource load chart: utilisation of each clerk, nurse, doctor, room. Overutilisation (>85 %) for nurses 09:0011:30 and cardiology rooms 13:0015:00 coincides with long waits.  
   • Handoverofwork social network: identifies that 78 % of RegistrationNurse handovers go to only two of six nurses.

2. Activityduration variability  
   • Boxplots per activity show servicetime CV >1.2 for Doctor Consultation (Cardio) – indicative of high unpredictability (new vs followup).  
   • Long consultations correlate with diagnostic addons, producing bursts of demand for ECG techs.

3. Arrival and scheduling patterns  
   • Dottedchart (cases vs. time of day) reveals a “trimodal” influx (8:00, 10:00, 13:00) driven by appointment templates that cluster starts on the hour.  
   • Sameday walkins (12 %) disproportionately fall between 09:3011:00, clashing with the scheduled wave.

4. Variant and conformance analysis  
   • 14 distinct patientpath variants; newpatient cardiology pathway takes 28 min longer predoctor because of an extra consent step.  
   • Conformance check shows 9 % of cases deviate (e.g., ECG ordered before doctor), creating deadtime while results are reviewed.

5. Equipment/room contention  
   • Performance spectrum for ECG room: median occupancy 68 %, but 95th percentile 100 % between 10:0011:30 & 14:0015:30  queue spills back to waiting area.

========================================
3. DataDriven Optimisation Strategies
========================================
Strategy 1 – Demandsmoothed appointment template + protected walkin slots  
• Targeted queues: RegistrationNurse and NurseDoctor.  
• Root cause: Inflexible appointment blocks produce demand spikes; walkins use same resources at peak.  
• Data support: Arrival histogram + utilisation chart show 35 % higher load 09:0011:00. Simulation with resampled arrivals shows a 19 % reduction in average queue if arrivals are flattened.  
• Intervention:  
  a) Switch from “topofthehour” template to 10min staggered slots (e.g., 08:00, 08:10, 08:20 …).  
  b) Reserve two “floating” nurse slots per hour for walkins to decouple them from scheduled flow.  
• Expected impact (from whatif simulation):  
  – Avg waiting RegistrationNurse drops from 18 min to 11 min (39 %).  
  – 90th percentile down by 21 min.  
  – Zero additional FTE required.

Strategy 2 – Flexible nurse/technician pool with skillbased routing  
• Targeted queues: NurseDoctor; DoctorECG/Diagnostics.  
• Root cause: Uneven utilisation; two nurses overloaded while others idle; techs idle mornings, overloaded afternoons.  
• Data support: Resource utilisation variance = 0.23 among nurses; ECG tech morning utilisation 42 %, afternoon 93 %.  
• Intervention:  
  a) Crosstrain 2 nurses to perform ECGs during afternoon peaks.  
  b) Implement “pull” rule: Doctor signals readiness electronically, next available pooled nurse/tech picks case (instead of fixed assignment).  
• Expected impact:  
  – Afternoon ECG wait mean from 17 min to 8 min (53 %).  
  – Nurseassessment wait variance reduced by 30 %.  
  – Cost: 8 h crosstraining + minor IT tweak.

Strategy 3 – Digital previsit registration & triage  
• Targeted queues: ArrivalRegistration, RegistrationNurse; partially total Length of Stay (LoS).  
• Root cause: Inperson paperwork averages 5.6 min (new) and places all patients physically in registration queue.  
• Data support: Service time decomposition shows 60 % paperwork, 40 % insurance check.  
• Intervention:  
  a) Web/mobile preregistration capturing demographics, insurance, ROS questionnaire.  
  b) Autotriage algorithm flags urgent or specialprep cases before arrival.  
• Expected impact: pilot literature suggests 50–60 % of patients adopt within 3 months. If so:  
  – Mean registration service time drops from 6.8 min  3.2 min.  
  – Registration queue length (Little’s Law) falls proportionally; overall LoS reduction 7 min for adopters, 3 min averaged over all visits.  
  – Secondary gain: Clerk capacity freed for complex cases—avoids hiring extra clerk (~$45 k/year).

========================================
4. TradeOffs and Constraints
========================================
• Strategy 1 may push some demand to later hours; if doctor sessions end at 17:00 strict, overruns may occur. Mitigation: Monitor doctor utilisation and cap booking density late afternoon.  
• Strategy 2 (crosstraining) might dilute specialised skills or affect professional satisfaction. Need competency validation and adjust pay differentials.  
• Strategy 3 has digitaldivide risk; elderly/nontech patients may need even more clerk assistance—keep “concierge” option and ensure equity.  
• Any reduction of one queue can reveal a hidden downstream bottleneck (e.g., faster nurse assessment may backup outside consult rooms). A phased rollout with continuous monitoring is essential.  
• Cost control: we deliberately favour schedule and role changes over adding FTE or equipment. Minor IT investments (<$25 k) vs. ROI in <12 months pointed out in business case.

Balancing objectives  
Use multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) scoring each option on: waittime impact, patient satisfaction, staff impact, cost, clinical quality. Stakeholder workshop assigns weights; pick portfolio with highest weighted score subject to budget ceiling and not exceeding 85 % utilisation on any critical resource to keep system resilient.

========================================
5. Measuring Success
========================================
Core KPIs (tracked weekly, rolledup monthly)  
1. Average and 90th percentile waiting time per key queue.  
2. Total patient Length of Stay (arrival to checkout).  
3. % of visits meeting internal SLA (e.g., LoS 90 min).  
4. Resource utilisation (nurses, doctors, ECG room) – keep within 65–85 %.  
5. Patient satisfaction (PressGaney “wait time” question, Net Promoter Score).  
6. Staff overtime hours and unscheduled breaks (proxy for workload balance).  
7. Rework / error rate (e.g., registration corrections, test repeats) to ensure quality not degraded.

Continuous monitoring approach  
• Automatically ingest daily event logs into the processmining platform; refresh dashboards every 24 h.  
• Control charts on KPI trends with statistical alerting (e.g., run of 7 points beyond 1 ).  
• Monthly “performance DNA” comparison to preintervention baseline—flag new emerging bottlenecks.  
• Quarterly stakeholder review; adjust slot templates or pool sizes if utilisation drifts >10 % from target.

By systematically quantifying waiting times, uncovering their true origins, and piloting targeted, lowcost interventions while rigorously measuring outcomes, the clinic can cut avoidable idle time, improve patient experience, and do so without large capital outlays.
