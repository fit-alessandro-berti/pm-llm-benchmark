### Analysis of Event Log Cases Against Normative Process

The normative process defines two valid paths:
- **Sufficient inventory**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- **Insufficient inventory**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.

Key constraints (directly from the description):
- Always starts with "Receive order".
- "Check inventory" must precede "Authorize payment" or "Cancel order".
- "Authorize payment" only after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
- "Package items" only after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
- "Ship order" only after "Package items" and **never** after "Cancel order".
- "Close order" must be the **final** activity.
- No fulfillment activities (e.g., Package, Ship) after "Cancel order".

All cases start correctly with "Receive order" followed by "Check inventory". Below, I evaluate each case for deviations.

#### Case 1: **Compliant** (No violations)
- Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close.
- Matches sufficient inventory path exactly.

#### Case 2: **Violates** (2 violations)
- Sequence: Receive  Check  **Package items**  **Authorize payment**  Ship  Close.
- **Violation 1**: "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment" (at 10:00 vs. 10:30). The description states "Authorize payment" must precede packaging ("payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and "Package items should only occur after authorization").
- **Violation 2**: "Ship order" occurs without prior "Package items" immediately before it (packaging was before authorization, violating the sequence). This breaks the constraint that packaging must precede shipping.

#### Case 3: **Violates** (2 violations)
- Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel order**  **Ship order**  Close.
- **Violation 1**: "Cancel order" after "Authorize payment". Cancellation path requires "Cancel order" *directly after* "Check inventory" (short sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close). Authorizing payment implies sufficient inventory, making later cancellation illogical and a deviation.
- **Violation 2**: "Ship order" after "Cancel order". The description explicitly prohibits this ("it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment such as shipping" after cancellation; "Ship order should never after a cancellation").

#### Case 4: **Compliant** (No violations)
- Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.
- Matches insufficient inventory path exactly.

#### Case 5: **Violates** (1 violation)
- Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship order**  Close.
- **Violation**: Missing "Package items" before "Ship order". The description requires "Package items" after authorization and before shipping ("items must be prepared before they can be shipped"; full sequence includes packaging explicitly). Skipping packaging deviates from the normative flow.

### Summary of Deviating Cases
- **Cases 2, 3, 5 deviate** from the normative process.
- Cases 1 and 4 fully comply.
- No ambiguities in the description meaningfully alter this analysis (e.g., it explicitly rejects shipping after cancellation or packaging before authorization; "Close order" is final in all cases here). Deviations reflect clear precedence violations or missing mandatory steps in the defined sequences.
