# **Optimizing E-Commerce Fulfillment Operations with Process Mining**

## **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

### **Process Mining Techniques for Constraint Identification**
To quantify the impact of instance-spanning constraints, we will use:
- **Conformance Checking**: Verify if the real process aligns with the intended model (e.g., are cold-packing stations truly a bottleneck?). 
- **Performance Analysis**: Measure delays caused by competition for shared resources.
- **Resource Usage Analysis**: Identify congestion and inefficiencies in station/resource allocation.

### **Key Metrics for Each Constraint**
| Constraint | Key Metrics | Distinguishing *Within* vs. *Between*-Instance Delays |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Cold-Packing Stations (limited resource)** | - Avg. waiting time for cold-packing <br> - Utilization rate of cold vs. standard stations | *Between-instance*: Wait occurs due to queueing; *Within-instance*: Time taken by packing task itself. |
| **Batching for Shipping** | - Avg. batch formation time (time from packing completion to label generation) <br> - Batches formed per region | *Between-instance*: Orders wait for others to form a batch. |
| **Priority Handling (Express Orders)** | - Avg. delay imposed on standard orders <br> - Express order cycle time reduction | *Between-instance*: Preemption of standard orders by express ones. |
| **Hazardous Material Limits** | - % time max capacity (10) is reached <br> - Avg. delay for hazmat orders | *Between-instance*: Congestion when regulatory limit is hit. |

**Differentiation Method**: Compare delays where resources are occupied (*between-instance*) versus long activity durations (*within-instance*) using timestamps. For example:
- If `Packing` takes 5 minutes but a standard order waits 15 min before starting, the latter is a *between-instance* delay caused by shared resource contention.

## **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**
Multiple constraints compound delays in complex ways:
- **Cold-Packing + Priority Handling**: If an express order requires cold-packing, it may jump the queue, causing congestion for standard cold orders.
- **Batching + Hazardous Limits**: Hazardous orders to the same region may accumulate, forcing delays until previous hazmat batches clear regulatory limits.
- **Priority + Hazmat**: Express orders with hazardous materials could block others beyond normal constraints.

Understanding these interactions helps avoid local optimizations that inadvertently worsen overall performance (e.g., prioritizing express hazmat orders may cause cascading delays).

## **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Cold-Packing Station Assignment**
- **Constraint Addressed**: Shared cold-packing stations.
- **Changes Proposed**: 
  - Use real-time demand prediction (from historical patterns) to temporarily convert standard stations to cold-packing when queues exceed a threshold.
  - Prioritize cold orders based on a **weighted scoring system** (express > standard, but penalize long waiters to avoid starvation).
- **Data Leveraged**: 
  - Predict cold-packing demand using clustering (e.g., time of day, order mix).
  - Model station conversions’ impact on overall throughput.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - Reduced cold-packing wait times by 20–30%.
  - Balanced express vs. standard order delays.

### **Strategy 2: Smart Batching with Deadlines**
- **Constraint Addressed**: Batching delays.
- **Changes Proposed**: 
  - Implement **deadline-driven batching**: If an order waits > *X* mins for a batch, ship it immediately (even if suboptimal for routing).
  - Use **predictive batching**: Group orders likely to arrive soon based on historical arrival rates per region.
- **Data Leveraged**: 
  - Analyze historical batch formation times to set *X* optimally.
  - Forecast regional order inflows with time-series models.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - 15% reduction in batch wait times for time-sensitive orders.

### **Strategy 3: Hazardous Order Scheduling Window**
- **Constraint Addressed**: Regulatory hazmat limits + priority handling.
- **Changes Proposed**: 
  - Introduce **reservation slots** for hazardous orders (e.g., max 3/hr), smoothing flow.
  - Allow express hazmat orders to preempt only if slots permit (else delay slightly).
- **Data Leveraged**: 
  - Simulate hazmat order arrival distributions to set slot sizes.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - Compliance maintained, while avoiding sudden hazmat congestion.

## **4. Simulation & Validation**
- **Simulation Approach**: 
  - Use **discrete-event simulation** with constraints modeled (e.g., cold-station limits, hazmat caps).
  - Input: Order arrival patterns from log, resource availability.
  - Test if strategies improve KPIs (throughput, avg. cycle time).
- **Key Focus Areas**: 
  - **Resource contention**: Does dynamic station allocation reduce cold-packing queues?
  - **Batching trade-offs**: Does deadline-driven batching hurt routing efficiency?
  - **Priority fairness**: Are standard orders excessively delayed?

## **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**
- **Dashboards**:
  - **Real-time cold-packing queue** + utilization.
  - **Batch wait times** per destination.
  - **Hazmat throughput** (max 10 in system).
- **Alerts**: 
  - Cold-packing wait > threshold.
  - Batches forming too slowly.
  - Hazmat capacity breaches.

**Continuous Improvement**: Re-run process mining periodically to detect new bottlenecks introduced by changes.
