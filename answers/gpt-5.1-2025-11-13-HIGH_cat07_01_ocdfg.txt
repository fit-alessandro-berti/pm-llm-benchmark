This is a processflow / processmining visualization that shows how several related business object types move through a combined procuretopay and ordertocash process.

**1. Object types at the top**

Across the top are five object classes, each with a count of instances:

- **VendorInvoiceItem** (green)
- **ReturnOrderItem** (red)
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (purple)
- **SalesOrderItem** (orange)
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (blue)

Under each object type is a **Start** event. From these starts, colored paths (matching the object color) show how that object travels through the process.

**2. Activities (boxes)**

Rectangular boxes are activities or process steps, for example:

- Create Requisition  
- Approve Requisition  
- Send Order  
- Check Stock  
- Process Return  
- Approve Payment  
- Create Invoice  
- Create Order  
- Pack Goods  
- Ship Goods  
- Confirm Delivery  
- Close Order  

Each box has:

- A label with the activity name.
- “Overall: X.XM” — the total number of object occurrences that passed through that activity.
- One or more colored dots indicating **which object types** participate in that activity (e.g., Approve Requisition involves multiple object classes, so it has several colored dots).

**3. Flows and timing (arrows)**

Arrows show the order of activities. Their color indicates the object type, and the small label on each arrow is a typical time between the two activities (e.g., 300ms, 600ms).

Examples of visible flows:

- **Requisition side (purple, green)**  
  PurchaseRequisitionItem starts  **Create Requisition**  **Approve Requisition**.  
  From Approve Requisition, the flow can go to **Send Order**, **Check Stock**, and further into approval and invoicing.

- **Orderfulfilment side (orange, blue)**  
  SalesOrderItem / PurchaseOrderItem start  **Create Order**.  
  From Create Order the flow continues to **Pack Goods**  **Ship Goods**  **Confirm Delivery**  **Close Order**  End.

- **Returns (red)**  
  ReturnOrderItem start  **Process Return**, which then links into approval / invoicing steps similarly to normal orders.

- **Financial side (green / multicolor)**  
  After operational steps, objects move into **Approve Payment**  **Create Invoice**  End.

**4. End events**

At the bottom are several **End** nodes, showing where different object types finish their lifecycle (after Send Order, after Create Invoice, after Close Order, etc.).

**Overall**

The figure is a multiobject process map: it overlays several related processes (requisitions, purchase orders, sales orders, returns, invoices) on the same diagram, using colors and counts to show:

- which activities each object type goes through,
- how often those activities occur, and
- how long the transitions between them typically take.
