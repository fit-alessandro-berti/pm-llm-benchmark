Here are open-ended questions you can ask to clarify and deepen understanding of the property onboarding process. I’ve grouped them by phase/topic to help you target gaps, decisions, roles, timing, and exception handling.

Intake and documentation
- What exact documents are required from the landlord at intake, and what makes a document acceptable vs. needing updates?
- How do you determine if a document is “outdated” or no longer valid (e.g., licenses, insurance, safety certificates)?
- What is the process for missing or invalid documents (who initiates updates, how are deadlines communicated, what are the consequences if not provided)?
- How do you verify the authenticity and relevance of documents (e.g., certificates of compliance, inspection reports)?
- Are there regional variations in required documents or timing? If so, how are those managed?

Property data capture and data quality
- Which property attributes are mandatory (square footage, units, location, amenities, pricing) and which are optional?
- How is data entered, reviewed, and approved? Who owns data quality and accuracy?
- How do you handle changes to property details after listing activation (renovations, changes in amenities, updated square footage)?
- What validation rules exist to prevent inconsistent or conflicting data from entering the system?
- How is data versioning handled across systems (CRM, PMS, marketing content)?

Roles and assignment of the property manager
- How is the “best match” property manager determined for a new property (weighting factors, thresholds, geographic coverage)?
- How do you manage workload fluctuations or scenarios where no manager feels like the best fit?
- What is the onboarding handoff like between the property coordinator and the assigned property manager?
- How is the manager’s performance tracked for similar properties, and how are adjustments made if outcomes are not meeting targets?

Introductory meeting with landlord
- What is the standard agenda for the introductory call/meeting, and what decisions must be captured?
- How do you document expectations, policies (pets, maintenance responsibilities, payment channels), and any special conditions?
- How do you handle landlord pushback or requests for exceptions during this initial meeting?
- What is the process for updating or re-sharing the agreed terms if the landlord’s requirements change?

Vendor coordination: photographer and inspector
- How do you select the photographer and inspector (criteria, licensing, insurance, track record)?
- Are there approved vendor lists, or is choice completely at the property manager’s discretion?
- What standards or criteria are used to evaluate the quality of photos and the thoroughness of inspections?
- How do you handle scheduling conflicts or vendor unavailability?
- How are inspector findings communicated to the landlord, and what is the landlord’s role in remediation planning?

Inspection and remediation
- When issues are found, who decides the scope, budget, and timeline for required repairs?
- What is the process to obtain landlord approval for repairs or additional services, and what SLAs apply?
- How do you handle urgent safety issues vs. non-urgent items, and how is time-critical remediation tracked?
- How is progress tracked and verified once remediation is complete?

Marketing, pricing, and activation
- How is the target rent range determined (data sources, comps, demand signals, landlord input)?
- What interdependencies exist between pricing, marketing strategy, and listing content?
- How often are prices reviewed and updated, and who approves changes?
- What criteria must be met before activation (listing completeness, photos approved, inspector clearance, lease templates in place)?
- How is the listing staged across channels, and what governance exists to prevent inconsistent information?

Activation and tenant-facing processes
- What does “activation” entail in the rental portal and internal systems, and who is responsible for each step?
- How do you determine when a listing is ready for prospective tenants to view?
- How long does the typical activation-to-listing-live timeline take, and what are the common bottlenecks?
- How are applications routed, and what criteria determine whether an application is approved, denied, or escalated?

Tenant screening and selection
- What screening checks are mandatory (credit, employment verification, rental history, references), and who administers them?
- How are screening results interpreted and reconciled when they conflict (e.g., strong credit but weak income verification)?
- How do you handle high-demand scenarios (multiple strong applicants) and what criteria drive prioritization (lease term, reliability, move-in date)?
- What is the policy on co-signers or guarantors, and how are their qualifications assessed?
- How are landlord preferences incorporated into decision-making while maintaining fairness and compliance?

Lease negotiation and finalization
- Which lease terms are negotiable and which are fixed? What governance exists for approving deviations?
- How are custom clauses (e.g., specific pet conditions, special insurance) evaluated and approved?
- What is the standard process for drafting, reviewing, and executing the lease with the landlord and tenant?
- How is timing coordinated to align with the move-in date and occupancy planning?

Move-in readiness and occupancy
- What steps occur between lease signing and move-in date (deposits, disclosures, key handover, utility setup)?
- How do you handle security deposits, insurance requirements, and utility transitions?
- What are the landlord’s responsibilities just prior to move-in, and how are tenant expectations managed?

Compliance, governance, and risk management
- How do you ensure adherence to fair housing laws and local regulations throughout onboarding and leasing?
- Who conducts compliance reviews (e.g., lease language, marketing content, pricing practices) and how often?
- How are audits (compliance, financial, IT) scheduled, executed, and acted upon?
- What are the major risk indicators you monitor (e.g., mispriced listings, inadequate disclosures, data gaps), and how are they mitigated?

Data, systems, and integration
- What systems are involved (CRM, property management system, marketing platforms, financial systems), and how is data synchronized across them?
- Who has access to sensitive property and landlord data, and how is access controlled and audited?
- How do you handle data quality issues and reconcile discrepancies across systems?
- What are your data retention and privacy practices, especially for landlord and tenant information?

Exceptions, escalation, and decision governance
- What are the common types of exceptions (insurance gaps, custom lease clauses, unusual property types), and who has authority to approve them?
- What is the escalation path when a decision cannot be made at the local level (who is involved, timelines, documentation)?
- How are urgent decision points handled to minimize delays without compromising policy?

Metrics, feedback, and continuous improvement
- What KPIs do you track for onboarding (time-to-listing, data accuracy, inspection pass rate, vacancy risk, onboarding cost)?
- How are results reviewed and used to drive process improvements (cadence, forums, ownership)?
- What triggers formal process reviews or redesigns, and who participates?

Roles and governance clarifications
- Can you provide a clear, high-level RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for each major phase and handoff?
- How do regional variations get standardized across the organization while preserving local flexibility?

Scenarios and examples
- Could you walk me through a typical onboarding scenario from initial inquiry to move-in, including what decisions are made at each step and who approves them?
- Can you share a recent edge case (e.g., landlord insisting on an unusual lease clause or a property requiring special insurance) and how it was resolved?
- How would you handle a situation where a property passes inspection but the landlord cannot provide updated documents in time?

If you’d like, I can tailor these questions to a specific role (landlord relations, property manager, leasing agent, IT/finance) or to a particular region or property type.
