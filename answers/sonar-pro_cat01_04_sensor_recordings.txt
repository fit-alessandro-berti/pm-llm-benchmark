Based on the event log provided, I've identified distinct patterns that likely correspond to different manufacturing activities. Here's my analysis of the process:

1. Idle/Standby (Events 1-3, 13-15)
Temperature: ~20°C
Pressure: 1 bar
Vibration: 0 Hz
Material Flow: 0 units/s
Tool Position: 0 mm
Energy: 0.40-0.50 kWh

Rationale: Low, stable readings across all sensors indicate the machine is in a standby state.

2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)
Temperature: Rises from 50°C to 58°C
Pressure: Increases to 1.5 bar
Vibration: Increases from 30 to 38 Hz
Material Flow: Steady at 5 units/s
Tool Position: Moves from 5 to 10 mm
Energy: Increases from 2.00 to 3.00 kWh

Rationale: Rising temperature, vibration, and energy consumption, along with tool movement, suggest a cutting operation.

3. Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)
Temperature: Stable at 40°C
Pressure: 2 bar
Vibration: 10 Hz
Material Flow: 2 units/s
Tool Position: Stable at 15 mm
Energy: Steady at 2.00 kWh

Rationale: Moderate, stable conditions with consistent material flow indicate an assembly process.

4. Welding (Event 9)
Temperature: Spikes to 80°C
Pressure: 2 bar
Vibration: Increases to 50 Hz
Material Flow: 0 units/s
Tool Position: 15 mm
Energy: Peaks at 5.00 kWh

Rationale: High temperature spike, increased vibration, and peak energy consumption are characteristic of a welding operation.

5. Quality Inspection (Events 10-12)
Temperature: Drops to 25-30°C
Pressure: Returns to 1 bar
Vibration: Low at 1-5 Hz
Material Flow: 0-1 units/s
Tool Position: Moves to 20 mm
Energy: 1.00-1.60 kWh

Rationale: Cooling down period with low activity and slight tool movement suggests an inspection phase.

This process mining analysis reveals a manufacturing sequence of: Idle  Cutting  Assembling  Welding  Inspection  Idle. The patterns in sensor data allow us to infer these high-level activities without explicit labels, demonstrating the power of process mining in understanding complex manufacturing processes.
