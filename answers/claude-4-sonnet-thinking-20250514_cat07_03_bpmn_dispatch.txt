This is a business process flowchart (likely using BPMN notation) that illustrates a shipping and logistics workflow. The diagram is organized into three swim lanes representing different organizational roles:

**Swim Lanes:**
1. **Logistics** (top)
2. **Computer Hardware Store Secretary** (middle) 
3. **Warehouse** (bottom)

**Key Process Flow:**
The process begins with "Ship goods" and follows this main sequence:

1. **Shipment Clarification**: Starts with clarifying the shipment method and checking for special handling requirements
2. **Insurance Assessment**: Checks if insurance is required, with access to customer information and user details databases
3. **Documentation**: If insurance is needed, the parcel is insured, followed by writing package labels
4. **Logistics Selection**: Gets quotes from 3 logistics companies and selects one to place the order
5. **Warehouse Operations**: Moves to packaging goods with a 48-hour timer constraint
6. **Final Steps**: Includes potential customer delay notifications, filling out shipment paperwork, and moving packages to pickup area

**Process Elements:**
- **Decision points** (diamond shapes) for special handling, insurance requirements, and timing
- **Data stores** (cylinder shapes) for customer information and user details  
- **Activities** (rectangles) for various tasks like packaging, writing labels, etc.
- **Timer events** showing the 48-hour packaging timeframe
- **Start/end events** (circles) marking process boundaries

The workflow ends with "Shipment prepared," indicating the package is ready for pickup and delivery.
