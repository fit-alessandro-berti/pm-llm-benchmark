Below is one sensible way to reconstruct the hidden “case IDs.”  
I assign simple synthetic IDs – Case #1, Case #2 and Case #3 – purely for clarity.

  
Case #1(ER male, 45 yrs – hairline-fracture pathway)  

1. 2024-03-15 08:05:13Register patient (ER, Admin Clerk)  
2. 2024-03-15 08:10:50Initial triage (Nurse Joy)  
3. 2024-03-15 08:15:42X-ray imaging (Radiology Tech)  
4. 2024-03-15 08:23:10Doctor consultation – diagnosis = hairline fracture (Dr Lee, ER)  
5. 2024-03-15 08:30:05Patient discharged – follow-up = out-patient clinic (Ward Clerk, ER)

Key clues  
• Unique demographic tuple (45 /M) never overlaps with any other age/gender pair.  
• All activities are typical ER, radiology, consultation, discharge for a minor fracture and their timestamps interleave logically with other cases.

  
Case #2(ER female, 62 yrs – minor infection pathway)  

1. 2024-03-15 08:07:02Register patient (ER, Admin Clerk)  
2. 2024-03-15 08:12:29Initial triage (Nurse Mark)  
3. 2024-03-15 08:16:10Lab test requested – blood panel (Dr Smith, ER)  
4. 2024-03-15 08:20:27Lab test completed – results = normal (Lab Technician)  
5. 2024-03-15 08:22:54Doctor consultation – diagnosis = minor infection (Dr Smith, ER)  
6. 2024-03-15 08:27:00Prescription created – antibiotics (Dr Smith, ER)  
7. 2024-03-15 08:35:29Patient discharged – follow-up = pharmacy pickup (Ward Clerk, ER)

Key clues  
• Distinctive demographic (62 /F).  
• Consistent ER flow: triage  lab order  lab result  consult  prescription  discharge.  
• No Surgery or Radiology activities; time stamps fit around other cases without conflict.

  
Case #3(Scheduled knee surgery, male 28 yrs – surgical pathway)  

1. 2024-03-15 08:07:15Register patient (Surgery, Admin Clerk)  
2. 2024-03-15 08:13:00Doctor consultation – reason = scheduled knee surgery (Dr Lee, Surgery)  
3. 2024-03-15 08:16:45Surgery preparation – general anesthesia (Surgical Nurse)  
4. 2024-03-15 08:25:19Surgery performed – arthroscopy (Dr Lee, Surgery)  
5. 2024-03-15 08:31:37Recovery room – condition = stable (Recovery Nurse)  
6. 2024-03-15 08:40:13Patient discharged – follow-up = physiotherapy sessions (Ward Clerk, Surgery)

Key clues  
• Only patient with Surgery-department events.  
• Age/gender (28 /M) never appear in ER events.  
• Logical surgical sequence: registration  pre-op consult  prep  OR  recovery  discharge.

  
Why only three cases?

• Each age/gender combination (45 /M, 62 /F, 28 /M) is unique and recurs consistently.  
• Activities for each combination form coherent clinical pathways with no temporal contradictions.  
• No event features two different age/gender values simultaneously, so overlap is excluded.

Thus the interleaved log unambiguously splits into three separate patient journeys:  
Case #1 (hairline-fracture ER visit), Case #2 (minor infection ER visit), and Case #3 (scheduled knee surgery).
