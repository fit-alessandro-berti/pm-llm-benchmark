### High-Level Process Steps and Grouping Justification  

#### **1. High-Level Step: Material Preparation**  
**Included Low-Level Events:**  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale:**  
This step consolidates all activities required to prepare the raw material for the manufacturing process. The sequence begins with sourcing the material (retrieval/scanning) and progresses to physical setup (placing, aligning, and preheating). These tasks are performed by a mix of humans and automated systems but share the common goal of ensuring the material is correctly positioned, identified, and thermally conditioned for subsequent steps. Temporal proximity (all within 15 seconds in the sample) and functional continuity (no intermediate tasks) further justify grouping.  

**Name:** **Material Preparation**

#### **2. High-Level Step: Welding Assembly**  
**Included Low-Level Events:**  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Rationale:**  
These events represent the physical assembly of the product. The operator’s tool acquisition precedes manual spot-welding operations, which form the core of the structural fabrication. While "Pick up welding tool" is a preparatory action, it is inseparable from the assembly task as it enables the subsequent welds. The repeated "Weld corner" activities indicate a pattern of joining components (corners) during assembly.  

**Name:** **Welding Assembly**

#### **3. High-Level Step: Quality Inspection (Weld Integrity)**  
**Included Low-Level Event:**  
- Measure weld integrity  

**Rationale:**  
This standalone event follows welding and directly assesses a critical manufacturing parameter (weld integrity) using a sensor. It is a validation step to ensure the structural integrity of the welded product before proceeding to finishing processes. Its distinct purpose (diagnostic vs. preparatory/assembly) and use of specialized equipment justify its standalone status.  

**Name:** **Quality Inspection (Weld Integrity)**

#### **4. High-Level Step: Protective Coating Application**  
**Included Low-Level Events:**  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Rationale:**  
These sequential tasks ensure the product’s protective finish is applied and cured. The coating (chemical application) and drying (thermal curing) are interdependent steps that transform the product’s surface properties. Although performed by different resources (Coating Unit vs. Heating Unit), they belong to a unified finishing phase. The proximity (15-second gap between application and drying) and thermal dependency ( drying requires prior coating) reinforce the grouping.  

**Name:** **Protective Coating Application**

#### **5. High-Level Step: Final Visual Inspection**  
**Included Low-Level Event:**  
- Visual check  

**Rationale:**  
This manual check occurs after all mechanical/automated processes and ensures the product meets visual quality standards. It acts as a final gatekeeper before the product is deemed complete. Its distinct role (holistic inspection vs. parameter-specific checks) and human operator involvement justify its separation from earlier quality steps.  

**Name:** **Final Visual Inspection**

### Key Insights  
- **Phased Grouping:** Steps are organized into **preparation  assembly  validation  finishing  final assurance**, aligning with standard manufacturing workflows.  
- **Interdependency:** Logical sequences (e.g., welding must precede coating) and resource coordination (e.g., heating units for preheating vs. drying) are preserved.  
- **Domain Relevance:** Step names reflect the manufacturing industry’s terminology (e.g., "spot welding," "protective coating"), ensuring clarity for stakeholders.  

This grouping simplifies analysis, enables root-cause identification (e.g., defects in welding vs. coating), and supports process optimization by isolating functional blocks.
