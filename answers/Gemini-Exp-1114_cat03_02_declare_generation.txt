Absolutely! Let's design a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process and then create a corresponding DECLARE model in the specified format.

**Hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay Process (Simplified)**

1. **Create Purchase Requisition (PR):**  Initiates the purchase process.
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition:**  Managerial approval of the requisition.
3. **Create Purchase Order (PO):**  Formal document sent to the supplier.
4. **Receive Goods/Services:**  Goods are delivered or services are performed.
5. **Receive Invoice:**  Supplier sends the invoice for payment.
6. **Verify Invoice:**  Confirm the invoice matches PO and goods/services received.
7. **Approve Invoice:**  Authorization to make payment.
8. **Make Payment:**  Payment is issued to the supplier.

**DECLARE Model**

Now, let's translate this process into a DECLARE model using the constraints you've provided. Remember, we'll set support to 1.0 and confidence to 1.0 for simplicity.

```python
declare_model = {

        'Create Purchase Requisition': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
