To identify the root causes for the performance issues in your process based solely on the provided process variants and their performance metrics, we should look for patterns related to specific process steps and their frequencies. Here are several observations and potential root causes:

### 1. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:**
   - **Process Variants Involving Multiple Rejections:**
     - Submissions being rejected and resubmitted multiple times by both Administrators and Supervisors.
     - Example: 
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=345, performance=1604595.638)
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=77, performance=1728631.623)
     - Multiple resubmissions due to rejections add significant delays, increasing the overall performance time.
   
### 2. **Approval Bottlenecks:**
   - **Processes Involving Multiple Approval Steps:**
     - Example:
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=2473, performance=1084338.407)
     - The need for multiple levels of approval increases the lead time, particularly when rejections lead to resubmissions.
     - Bottlenecks can occur in steps like "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" when there are fewer approvers or longer delays in their response.
   
### 3. **Specific Approver Delays:**
   - **Processes Involving Specific Approvers:**
     - Example:
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=575, performance=861058.409)
     - The "PRE_APPROVER" step may have delays or high processing times, affecting the overall performance.
   
### 4. **Incomplete or Aborted Processes:**
   - **Processes That Never Reach Final Approval:**
     - Example:
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" (frequency=31, performance=713794.452)
     - These processes never reach the payment handling stage, indicating incomplete or aborted workflows which also contribute to high performance times due to unresolved issues.
   
### 5. **Saving State Delays:**
   - **Processes That Are Saved But Not Submitted:**
     - Example:
       - “Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE” (frequency=134, performance=0.000)
     - While these do not directly affect main processing times, they can indicate bureaucratic delays or lack of immediate action.
   
### 6. **Unspecified Rejection Reasons:**
   - **Rejections That Escalate Without Specific Reasons:**
     - Example:
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=40, performance=1947246.400)
     - The "REJECTED by MISSING" step implies that necessary information or approvals are not available, causing significant delays.
   
### 7. **Ad-Hoc Process Variations:**
   - **Processes With Unusual Variants:**
     - Example:
       - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" (frequency=10, performance=2054847.800)
     - These variations suggest that there are irregularities or exceptions that extend processing times.

### Summary of Possible Root Causes:
1. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions:** These significantly increase processing times.
2. **Multiple Approval Steps:** Delays in each step, particularly if there are rejections leading to resubmissions.
3. **Specific Approver Delays:** Bottlenecks in approvals by certain roles like PRE_APPROVER or BUDGET OWNER.
4. **Incomplete or Aborted Processes:** Processes that are never finalized add to performance metrics without contributing to successful completions.
5. **Ad-Hoc and Exceptional Process Variations:** Unusual process steps that introduce delays.
6. **Unspecified Rejections:** Rejections with unclear reasons add uncertainty and delays.

### Recommendations:
- Minimize retries and resubmissions through better initial validation.
- Streamline approval processes to reduce the number of levels.
- Assign additional approvers in critical roles or improve response times.
- Implement mechanisms to track and escalate incomplete processes.
- Standardize process steps to reduce variability and exceptions.
- Identify and address unclear rejection reasons to reduce uncertainty and delays.

By focusing on these specific process and data considerations, you can identify and mitigate the root causes of performance issues in your process.
