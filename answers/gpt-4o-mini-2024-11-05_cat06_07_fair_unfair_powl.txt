To construct the two POWL models based on the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, we will follow the given structure, where one model introduces a potential unfairness (with the community affiliation check that could give some applicants an advantage) and the other model eliminates that unfairness (with all applicants undergoing the same cultural fit check). Let's build both models step by step.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching. One branch leads to a standard **CulturalFitCheck**, and the other leads to a **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, which provides an implicit advantage to candidates associated with certain groups. This introduces potential unfairness due to biased treatment in the cultural fit evaluation.

**Steps for this model:**
- **ReceiveApplication**
- **DataCompletenessCheck** (loop to ensure all necessary data is complete)
- **SkillAssessment**
- **XOR choice**:
  - **CulturalFitCheck**: Standard evaluation of cultural fit.
  - **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: This check provides an implicit advantage for candidates with community affiliations.
- **ManagerialReview**
- **FinalDecision**

Here’s how the POWL model would be represented:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define XOR operator between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define Loop for DataCompletenessCheck (to ensure data is complete)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, ReceiveApplication])

# Define the main process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order of activities
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
root.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, we eliminate the community affiliation advantage and instead treat all applicants equally in the **CulturalFitCheck** step, ensuring that no implicit bias is introduced. The rest of the process remains similar to the previous one but without the XOR choice related to community affiliation.

**Steps for this model:**
- **ReceiveApplication**
- **DataCompletenessCheck** (loop to ensure all necessary data is complete)
- **SkillAssessment**
- **CulturalFitCheck** (a single cultural fit check without any bias)
- **ManagerialReview**
- **FinalDecision**

Here’s how the POWL model would be represented:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define Loop for DataCompletenessCheck (to ensure data is complete)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, ReceiveApplication])

# Define the main process flow
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the order of activities
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### Key Differences Between the Two Models:
- **First Model (With Unfairness):**
  - There is an XOR operator after the **SkillAssessment** step, where candidates are either directed to a **CulturalFitCheck** or **CommunityAffiliationCheck**. The latter provides an implicit advantage based on community affiliation.
  
- **Second Model (Without Unfairness):**
  - After **SkillAssessment**, all candidates go through the same **CulturalFitCheck**. There is no XOR branching or community affiliation advantage.

These models effectively capture the two approaches to hiring, illustrating the potential unfairness in the first model and a fairer, more uniform process in the second.
