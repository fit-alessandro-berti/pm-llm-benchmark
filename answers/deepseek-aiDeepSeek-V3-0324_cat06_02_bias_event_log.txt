### **Analysis of Bias in the Event Log**

The event log reveals several potential sources of bias in the decision-making process, particularly concerning **community group affiliation** and **local residency status**. Here’s a breakdown of where and how bias manifests:

#### **1. Community Group Bonus Favors Certain Applicants**
- **Observation:**  
  - Cases **C001** and **C004** (both members of the *Highland Civic Darts Club*) received a **+10 adjustment** to their preliminary score due to their community affiliation.  
  - Cases **C002, C003, and C005** (with no community group) received **no adjustment**.
- **Implications:**  
  - This adjustment **artificially inflates scores** for applicants in specific groups, even if their **baseline creditworthiness (preliminary score) is similar or lower** than non-affiliated applicants.  
  - Example:  
    - **C004** (690 → 700 after adjustment) was **approved**, while **C003** (715, no adjustment) was **rejected**.  
    - Without the adjustment, **C004** would have had a **lower score than C003**, yet C003 was rejected.  
  - This suggests that **community affiliation plays an outsized role** in approvals, disadvantaging those without such ties.

#### **2. Local Residents vs. Non-Locals**
- **Observation:**  
  - All **approved cases (C001, C002, C004, C005)** were **local residents (LocalResident = TRUE)**, except **C005**, which had a very high preliminary score (740).  
  - The **only rejected case (C003)** was a **non-local (LocalResident = FALSE)**, despite having a **higher preliminary score (715) than C004 (690 → 700 after adjustment)**.  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Non-locals may face stricter scrutiny**, even when their financial metrics are comparable or better.  
  - The system (or manual reviewers) might **implicitly favor locals**, possibly due to perceived stability or lower risk—**a geographic bias**.

#### **3. Manual Review Subjectivity**
- **Observation:**  
  - The **ManualReview** step does not document **specific reasons for adjustments or overrides**, making it unclear whether reviewers apply consistent criteria.  
  - Example:  
    - **C003 (715)** was rejected, while **C004 (700 after adjustment)** was approved—**without clear justification**.  
- **Implications:**  
  - If underwriters **unconsciously favor certain groups** (e.g., community affiliates or locals), this introduces **human bias** into the process.  
  - Lack of transparency in adjustments makes it difficult to audit fairness.

#### **4. Threshold Discrepancies**
- **Observation:**  
  - **C005 (740, non-local)** was approved, but **C003 (715, non-local)** was rejected.  
  - This suggests a **higher approval threshold for non-locals** than locals (since locals like C004 got approved at 700).  
- **Implications:**  
  - **Non-locals may need significantly higher scores** to qualify, indicating **systemic geographic bias**.

### **Conclusion: Key Biases Identified**
1. **Community Affiliation Bias:**  
   - **+10 adjustments** favor applicants in certain groups, **skewing approvals** in their favor.  
   - Applicants without such affiliations are **disadvantaged even with similar/better creditworthiness**.  

2. **Geographic (Local vs. Non-Local) Bias:**  
   - **Locals are more likely to be approved** at lower scores than non-locals.  
   - Non-locals face **stricter thresholds**, reducing approval chances despite comparable financials.  

3. **Lack of Transparency in Adjustments:**  
   - Manual reviews do not document reasoning, allowing **unconscious biases** to influence decisions.

### **Recommendations for Fairer Processing**
- **Remove or justify group-based adjustments** unless proven statistically relevant to risk.  
- **Audit approval thresholds** for locals vs. non-locals to ensure equitable treatment.  
- **Document manual review rationales** to reduce subjective bias.  
- **Test for disparate impact**—e.g., compare approval rates for locals vs. non-locals with similar scores.  

This analysis suggests that the current process **may systematically favor certain demographics**, undermining fairness. Addressing these biases could lead to more equitable outcomes.
