Here's a sample DECLARE model for the "Purchase-to-Pay" process:
```python
declare [
  existence = {
    "Order": 1.0,     # Order must exist in the trace.
    "OrderPlaced": 1.0,  # Order Placed must exist in the trace.
    "PaymentProcessed": 1.0,   # PaymentProcessed should have existed in the process before PaymentReceived
    "Purchase": 1.0,
    "ReceivePayment": 1.0,
    "RequestPayment": 1.0,
    "ShipProduct": 1.0,
  },
  absence = {
    "OrderPlaced": 1.0,   # Order Placed should not exist in the trace.
    "PurchaseRefund": 1.0,
    "RequestProductReturn": 1.0,
  },
  exactly_one = {
    "OrderPlacementRequest": 1.0,     # Order Placement Request can only occur once
    "PaymentApprovalRequest": 1.0,   # Payment Approval Request can only occur once
  },
  init = {
    "Purchase": 1.0,    # The trace starts with either Purchase or Order.
    "Order": 1.0,
  },
  responded_existence = {
    "OrderPlaced" : {
      "PaymentReceived" : 1.0,
    },
    "RequestPayment" : {
      "OrderPlacementRequest" : 1.0
    }
  },
  coexistence = {
    "ShipProduct": {
      "Order": 1.0
    },
    "ReceivePayment": {
      "Purchase": 1.0
    },
    "Refund" : {
      "OrderPlaced" : 1.0
    }
  },
  
  response = {
    "OrderPlaced" : {
      "OrderCancellationRequest" : 1.0,
      "PurchaseCancellationRequest" : 1.0
    },
    "RequestPayment" : {
      "PurchasePaymentConfirmation" : 1.0
    },
    "Receive_payment": {
      "Send_refund_request": 1.0,
    }
  },

  precedence = {
    "OrderPlaced" : {
        "ConfirmOrderCancellation": 1.0, 
       # PaymentProcessed was previously needed to occur before Order placed as well
    },
     "Purchase": {
       "PaymentReceived" : 1.0,
    },

    "RequestPayment" : {
      "Receive_payment" : 1.0
    },
    "OrderPlaced" : {
        "ConfirmRefundRequest" : 1.0,  
   # This follows the same precedence of Order before Send_refund_request to ensure proper PaymentProcessed occurence    
     
    },

    "Order": {
      "ProcessPaymentRequest": 1.0,
    }
],

  succession = {
    "ShipProduct": {
      "OrderPlaced" : 1.0, 
      "Responded existence": {
        "Order cancellation request": {
          Response: {
            "Send_refund_request" : 1.0
          }
        },
        "Cancel purchase request": {
          Response: {
            "Confirm refund": 1.0
          }
          
        }

      }
      
    }
    


    

  }

]
```
This model includes the following constraints:

*   Existence constraints, ensuring that each activity occurs at least once in the trace.
    
*   Absence constraints, specifying activities that should not occur.

*   Exactly one constraints, defining processes where a single occurrence is required for certain activities.  

*   Initialization constraint, marking the start of processes as either a "Purchase" or an "Order".

*   Responded existence constraints to ensure that when one activity occurs, another specific activity also occurs at the same time.

*   Co-existence constraints specifying shared activities, whether immediately occurring at the same time or being dependent at the response. 

*   Response constraints, determining future connections while ensuring no repetition of prior relationships in sequence.

*   Precedence constraints establishing order in sequences to provide additional support for co-existence.

*   Succession constraints integrating both response and precedence dependencies into a larger cohesive chain sequence where all relationships adhere consistently throughout.

*   Alternate response, alternate precedence and alternate succession strengthen those same concepts. By ensuring consecutive events do not occur without an alternation period

*   Chain succession similarly ensures that no separation exists between related activities in succession but will only proceed via a successful link or step which allows chain linkage to build upon the previous steps accordingly.

**Non-coexistence, Non-succesion and Nonchain Succession:** constraints to control the unlikeliness of certain activity orderings in sequence like `non chain Succesion` ensures that while there is **No Chain**: an Order was not preceded by another.
