Here's a sample DECLARE model for a simple "Purchase-to-Pay" process:

```python
import pm4py

declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'OrderPlaced': 1.0,
        'InvoiceCreated': 1.0,
        'PaymentReceived': 1.0,
        'OrderShipped': 1.0
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {
        'PurchaseRequest': 1.0,
        'ReturnRequest': 1.0
    },
    'init': {
        'OrderPlaced': 1.0,
        'InvoiceCreated': 1.0,
        'PaymentReceived': 1.0
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'InvoiceCreated': 1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0}
    },
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0, 'OrderShipped': 1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0, 'ReturnRequest': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        'OrderPlaced': {},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'OrderPlaced': 1.0},
        'PaymentReceived': {}
    },
    'succession': {
        'OrderShipped': {'OrderPlaced': 1.0, 'InvoiceCreated': 1.0}
    },
    'altresponse': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0, 'OrderShipped': 1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'ReturnRequest': 1.0}
    },
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {
        'PaymentReceived': {'OrderPlaced': 1.0, 'InvoiceCreated': 1.0},
        'ReturnRequest': {'OrderPlaced': 1.0}
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'OrderShipped': 1.0, 'ReturnRequest': 1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0}
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        'OrderShipped': {},
        'PaymentReceived': {}
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'OrderShipped': 1.0, 'ReturnRequest': 1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'PaymentReceived': 1.0}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'ReturnRequest': -1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'OrderShipped': -1.0}
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'PaymentReceived': -1.0, 'ReturnRequest': -1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'OrderShipped': -1.0, 'ReturnRequest': -1.0}
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        'OrderPlaced': {'OrderShipped': -1.0, 'PaymentReceived': -1.0},
        'InvoiceCreated': {'ReturnRequest': -1.0}
    }
}

# To generate the DECLARE model in PM4Py format
pm4py.declare_model(declare_model)
```

In this model:

*   We define a Purchase-to-Pay process with five activities: Order Placed, Invoice Created, Payment Received, Order Shipped and Return Request.
*   The 'existence' constraint indicates that each activity should occur at least once in the trace.
*   The 'exactly_one' constraint specifies that there can be exactly one purchase request and one return request.
*   The 'init' constraint states that the trace starts with either an Order Placed or Invoice Created event. Since we want a single starting point, both are set to 1.0.
*   We define several response constraints (responded_existence, response) which state how certain events are triggered by others in the process.
*   The 'coexistence' and 'precedence' constraints specify how certain activities can co-occur or precede each other in the trace.
*   We also define succession, altresponse, altprecedence, altsuccession, chainresponse, chainprecedence, chainsuccession, noncoexistence, nonsuccession and nonchainsuccession constraints to handle specific relationships among activities.
*   Finally, we use 'noncoexistence' constraint to indicate that an event (e.g., Order Placed) should not occur alongside another event (e.g., Return Request), the 'nonsuccession' constraint indicates that certain events can't be in sequence with others, and the 'nonchainsuccession' constraint further specifies this for specific pairs of activities.

This DECLARE model captures various relationships among these activities to create a coherent and logical Purchase-to-Pay process.
