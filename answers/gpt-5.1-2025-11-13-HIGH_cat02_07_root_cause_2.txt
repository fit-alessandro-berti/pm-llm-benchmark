### 1. Cases with performance issues

Compute end-to-end lead time per case (Submit Claim  Close Claim):

| Case | Complexity | Region | Start                      | End                        | Duration            |
|------|------------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| 2001 | Low        | A      | 2024-04-01 09:00           | 2024-04-01 10:30           | 1.5 hours           |
| 2004 | Low        | B      | 2024-04-01 09:20           | 2024-04-01 10:45           | 1.4 hours           |
| 2002 | Medium     | B      | 2024-04-01 09:05           | 2024-04-02 11:00           | ~26 hours (1.1 days)|
| 2003 | High       | A      | 2024-04-01 09:10           | 2024-04-03 09:30           | ~48 hours (2.0 days)|
| 2005 | High       | B      | 2024-04-01 09:25           | 2024-04-04 14:30           | ~77 hours (3.2 days)|

“Normal” low-complexity cases (2001, 2004) close in ~1.4–1.5 hours.  
Significantly slower cases:

- **Moderately slow:** Case **2002** (~1 day)  
- **Clearly problematic:** Cases **2003** (~2 days) and **2005** (~3+ days, the worst)

### 2. Attribute-based root cause analysis

#### 2.1 Complexity & “Request Additional Documents”

Strong pattern between complexity, number of document requests, and duration:

| Case | Complexity | # of “Request Additional Documents” | Duration          |
|------|------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2001 | Low        | 0                                    | 1.5 hours         |
| 2004 | Low        | 0                                    | 1.4 hours         |
| 2002 | Medium     | 1                                    | ~26 hours         |
| 2003 | High       | 2                                    | ~48 hours         |
| 2005 | High       | 3                                    | ~77 hours         |

Observations:

- **Low complexity:** Straight-through processing (no document requests), very fast.
- **Medium complexity:** Exactly one document request, lead time jumps to ~1 day.
- **High complexity:** Multiple document requests (2–3 loops), lead time grows to 2–3+ days.
- The **main driver of long durations is repeated “Request Additional Documents” cycles**, which are only seen in medium/high complexity cases.

Looking at where the time is spent:

- Case 2002: biggest gap is **Request Docs (2024-04-01 14:00)  Approve (2024-04-02 10:00)** (~20 hours).
- Case 2003: large gaps between **Request Docs events and Approve** (~23 hours) and between **Evaluate  first Request** and **first  second Request**.
- Case 2005: very long gaps between **Request 2 (2024-04-01 17:00)  Request 3 (2024-04-03 15:00)** (~46 hours) and then to Approve (~19 hours).

So the performance issue is mainly **waiting for documents and rework around incomplete submissions**, not execution time of simple steps like Pay or Close.

#### 2.2 Region

By complexity and region:

- **Low complexity**  
  - Region A (2001): 1.5 hours  
  - Region B (2004): 1.4 hours  
   **Regions perform similarly** when complexity is low and no rework is required.

- **High complexity**  
  - Region A (2003): ~48 hours, 2 document requests (Adjuster_Mike)  
  - Region B (2005): ~77 hours, 3 document requests (Adjuster_Lisa)  
   For high complexity, **Region B has the slower case**, driven by **more document request iterations**.

- **Medium complexity**  
  - Only Region B case (2002): ~26 hours with 1 document request, so we cannot compare cross-region at this level, but it’s clearly slower than low complexity in either region.

Conclusion:

- **Region itself is not the main root cause.**  
  Performance is similar for simple cases.  
  The extreme delay in Region B (case 2005) coincides with **more rework** rather than the region alone.

#### 2.3 Resources

**Customer Service Reps (CSR_Jane, CSR_Paul, CSR_Mary)**  
- Submit and Close steps are always quick and near-continuous with surrounding activities.
- No significant waiting time around Submit/Close  **CSRs don’t explain long durations.**

**Finance (Finance_Alan, Finance_Carl)**  
- Delays from Approve  Pay are small (15–60 minutes).
- Payments are not bottlenecks.

**Managers (Manager_Ann vs Manager_Bill)**  
- Ann (low/medium cases: 2001, 2002, 2004): approvals follow promptly after documents are apparently complete.
- Bill (high cases: 2003, 2005): Approve occurs ~19–23 hours after the last doc request, similar magnitude to Ann’s medium case.  
   **Manager queues contribute some hours but are not the dominant factor** compared to days of document waiting.

**Adjusters (Adjuster_Mike vs Adjuster_Lisa)**

- Low complexity:
  - Mike (2001) and Lisa (2004) both lead to very fast cases.
- Medium/high complexity:
  - Mike (Region A):
    - 2003 (High): 2 document requests, ~48 hours total.
  - Lisa (Region B):
    - 2002 (Medium): 1 document request, ~26 hours.
    - 2005 (High): 3 document requests, ~77 hours.

Patterns:

- **All rework (Request Additional Documents) is initiated by adjusters.**
- High complexity cases are assigned to adjusters and lead to **multiple, sequential document requests**, especially with **Lisa in case 2005**, where there are 3 separate requests and the longest overall duration.
- The combination **High complexity + Adjuster_Lisa + Region B** appears in the single worst-performing case (2005).

This suggests:

- Adjusters may be **discovering missing information piecemeal**, rather than defining a complete set of requirements up front—more pronounced in Lisa’s high-complexity case.

### 3. Explanations & mitigation actions

#### 3.1 Why these attributes contribute to performance issues

1. **High Complexity  more uncertainty & missing data**
   - Complex claims have more conditions, documents, and validations.
   - Missing or ambiguous information at submission forces repeated requests.
   - Each additional “Request Additional Documents” loop adds ~1–2 days of lead time.

2. **Adjuster behavior & guidelines**
   - Adjusters (especially in high complexity) appear to **request documents incrementally**:
     - Case 2003: 2 rounds.
     - Case 2005: 3 rounds.
   - This indicates possible lack of:
     - Comprehensive checklists for complex claims.
     - Standardized assessment criteria.
   - In Region B, Adjuster_Lisa’s high-complexity case shows the **heaviest rework**, suggesting:
     - Either stricter/less clear regional requirements, or
     - Less effective upfront assessment.

3. **Manager workload contributes but is secondary**
   - Time from last document request to approval is ~19–23 hours in high/medium cases, likely including overnight and normal working patterns.
   - Manager approval queues add some delay but **don’t explain multi-day differences** between, e.g., 2003 and 2005.

4. **Region differences likely reflect process differences on complex claims**
   - For low complexity, regions A and B perform similarly.
   - Differences on high complexity are therefore more likely due to **how complex cases are handled in Region B** (e.g., adjuster practice, documentation standards) than region-level capacity alone.

#### 3.2 Suggestions to mitigate root causes

1. **Strengthen upfront intake for medium/high complexity claims**
   - Introduce **complexity-specific checklists** of required documents (by product type, claim type, etc.).
   - For “High” complexity:
     - Require an **initial deep-dive review** where the adjuster determines *all* needed documents in one step.
     - Optionally trigger a **welcome/triage call** to explain requirements to the claimant and verify what they already have.

2. **Reduce multiple document-request loops**
   - Set a guideline: **“Request all reasonably foreseeable documents in one go”**, limiting the number of document request iterations.
   - Track **KPI: number of ‘Request Additional Documents’ per case**, and flag cases with more than 1–2 loops for review.
   - Provide targeted coaching for adjusters with above-average rework (e.g., review Lisa’s high-complexity cases).

3. **Standardize across regions and adjusters**
   - Create **standard templates** for document requests per claim type/complexity.
   - Harmonize policies between Regions A and B so complex claims have the same documentation expectations.
   - Encourage peer review for the first batch of high-complexity claims (e.g., Mike and Lisa reviewing each other’s initial assessments).

4. **Improve visibility and SLAs for high-complexity cases**
   - Define SLAs such as:
     - Maximum allowed number of document-request iterations.
     - Maximum time from last document receipt to approval (e.g., 1 working day).
   - Implement monitoring dashboards that highlight:
     - Cases open >2 days.
     - Cases with >2 “Request Additional Documents” events.

5. **Support customers to respond faster**
   - Use digital channels (portal, app) for document upload with **clear real-time checklists**.
   - Send automated reminders and show **progress status** so customers know what is missing and by when.

---

**Summary**

- **Problem cases:** 2002 (medium), 2003 (high), and especially 2005 (high, Region B, Adjuster_Lisa).
- **Primary root cause:** High and medium complexity claims needing one or more **“Request Additional Documents”** cycles; multiple iterations dramatically lengthen lead times.
- **Secondary factors:** Adjuster practices (particularly in Region B) and normal manager approval queues.
- **Key mitigations:** Better upfront requirements (checklists), reduction of iterative document requests, standardized processes across regions/adjusters, and clear SLAs/monitoring for complex claims.
