Let’s construct a process tree for the described hospital patient management scenario using the provided operators (`->` for sequence, `X` for exclusive choice, `+` for parallel execution, and `*` for loops) and the `ProcessTree` class structure from the `pm4py` library. I will break this down step by step to reflect the hierarchical nature of the process and then provide the complete Python code to build the tree.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Process Tree

1. **Root Structure**: The entire process is a sequence of major phases (from arrival to discharge). Thus, the root of the tree will be a `SEQUENCE` operator (`->`) that connects all high-level stages.

2. **Initial Sequence (Arrival to Triage)**: 
   - The process starts with `Arrival (A)`, followed by `Registration (RG)`, and then `Intake Assessment (IA)`. After this, there is a sequence of `Triage Interview (TI)` and `Triage Classification (TC)`.
   - This forms a sequence: `A -> RG -> IA -> (TI -> TC)`.

3. **Exclusive Choice for Initial Diagnostic Test**:
   - After triage, there is an exclusive choice (`X`) between `Comprehensive ECG (CE)` and `Full Blood Panel (FBP)`.

4. **Loop for Abnormal Results**:
   - If results are abnormal, a loop (`*`) starts with `Specialist Consultation (SC)` as the main activity. The loop continuation involves an exclusive choice (`X`) between `Targeted Medication (TM)` or `Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT)`, followed by a re-diagnostic test (`RDT`) which itself is an exclusive choice (`X`) between `Follow-up ECG (FCE)` or `Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA)`.
   - Loop structure: `* (SC, (X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA)))`.

5. **Post-Loop Parallel Activities**:
   - Once the loop ends (normal results), there is a parallel block (`+`) for `Advanced Imaging (AI)` and `Nutritional Counseling (NC)`.

6. **Final Administrative Sequence**:
   - After the parallel activities, there is a sequence (`->`) of `Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (FAS)` and `Detailed Discharge Instructions (DDI)`.

7. **Final Parallel Block for Discharge**:
   - The process ends with a parallel block (`+`) for `Billing (BL)`, `Insurance Claims Processing (ICP)`, and `Medical Records Finalization (MRF)`.

### Process Tree Hierarchy
- **Root (SEQUENCE)**:
  - **Stage 1 (SEQUENCE)**: `A -> RG -> IA -> (TI -> TC)`
  - **Stage 2 (XOR)**: Choice between `CE` or `FBP`
  - **Stage 3 (LOOP)**: Loop with `SC` and continuation `(X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA))`
  - **Stage 4 (PARALLEL)**: `AI + NC`
  - **Stage 5 (SEQUENCE)**: `FAS -> DDI`
  - **Stage 6 (PARALLEL)**: `BL + ICP + MRF`

### Python Code to Construct the Process Tree

Below is the complete code to construct the process tree using the `pm4py` library's `ProcessTree` class and `Operator` enumeration.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Root of the process tree (overall sequence of stages)
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)

# Stage 1: Initial Sequence (A -> RG -> IA -> (TI -> TC))
stage1_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
A = ProcessTree(label="A", parent=stage1_seq)
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG", parent=stage1_seq)
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA", parent=stage1_seq)
triage_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=stage1_seq)
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI", parent=triage_seq)
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC", parent=triage_seq)
triage_seq.children.extend([TI, TC])
stage1_seq.children.extend([A, RG, IA, triage_seq])

# Stage 2: Exclusive Choice for Initial Diagnostic Test (CE or FBP)
stage2_xor = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root)
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE", parent=stage2_xor)
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP", parent=stage2_xor)
stage2_xor.children.extend([CE, FBP])

# Stage 3: Loop for Abnormal Results
stage3_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC", parent=stage3_loop)
loop_body_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=stage3_loop)
treatment_xor = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop_body_seq)
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM", parent=treatment_xor)
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT", parent=treatment_xor)
treatment_xor.children.extend([TM, SPT])
rdt_xor = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=loop_body_seq)
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE", parent=rdt_xor)
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA", parent=rdt_xor)
rdt_xor.children.extend([FCE, FBA])
loop_body_seq.children.extend([treatment_xor, rdt_xor])
stage3_loop.children.extend([SC, loop_body_seq])

# Stage 4: Parallel Activities after Loop (AI + NC)
stage4_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=stage4_parallel)
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=stage4_parallel)
stage4_parallel.children.extend([AI, NC])

# Stage 5: Final Administrative Sequence (FAS -> DDI)
stage5_seq = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS", parent=stage5_seq)
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI", parent=stage5_seq)
stage5_seq.children.extend([FAS, DDI])

# Stage 6: Final Parallel Block for Discharge (BL + ICP + MRF)
stage6_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=root)
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL", parent=stage6_parallel)
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP", parent=stage6_parallel)
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF", parent=stage6_parallel)
stage6_parallel.children.extend([BL, ICP, MRF])

# Add all stages to the root
root.children.extend([stage1_seq, stage2_xor, stage3_loop, stage4_parallel, stage5_seq, stage6_parallel])
```

### Explanation of the Code
- Each node in the process tree is created as a `ProcessTree` object with the appropriate `operator` (from `Operator` enum) or `label` (for leaf nodes representing activities).
- The `parent` attribute is explicitly set for each node to maintain the hierarchy.
- The `children` list of each non-leaf node is populated with its child nodes to complete the tree structure.
- The structure adheres to the described process flow, ensuring sequences, choices, loops, and parallel executions are correctly modeled.

### Resulting Process Tree Notation
In the notation provided in the problem statement, the process tree can be represented as:
```
-> (
    -> ('A', 'RG', 'IA', -> ('TI', 'TC')),
    X ('CE', 'FBP'),
    * ('SC', -> (X ('TM', 'SPT'), X ('FCE', 'FBA'))),
    + ('AI', 'NC'),
    -> ('FAS', 'DDI'),
    + ('BL', 'ICP', 'MRF')
)
```

This notation captures the hierarchy and operators used in the process tree, reflecting the complex hospital patient management scenario. The Python code above translates this conceptual model into a concrete `ProcessTree` object that can be used with the `pm4py` library for further analysis or simulation.
