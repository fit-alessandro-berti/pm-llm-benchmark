Step-1: Observation of one complete cycle  
Looking at Events 1–15, the sensor values rise and fall back to their starting level twice (EV1–13 and EV14–15 are again at the idle state).  
Hence we can safely wrap the first rise-and-fall (EV1–13) into one full manufacturing cycle and then simply repeat the same labels for the following restarts.

Step-2: Group consecutive events that show similar “signatures”

Segment A: Events 1-3 – Room conditions, no processing  
- Temperature/T  20 °C (room)  
- Pressure/P = 1 bar (ambient)  
- Vibration/Vib = 0 Hz, Flow = 0, Tool = 0 mm  
- Energy very low (0.45 kWh) – idle power draw only  

Segment B: Events 4-6 – Sharp increase of T, rise of Energy and Vibration, moderate Flow, Tool starts moving  
- EV4: T jumps to 50 °C, Vib 30 Hz, Energy doubles to 2 kWh within 5 s  
- EV5-6: T climbs further to 58 °C, Vib to 38 Hz, Tool positional change 5710 mm with constant Material Flow 5 units/s  
Signature: heavy tool-work on material with accompanied elevated temperature and vibration  Cutting / milling action where material is being removed.

Segment C: Events 7-8 – Parameters stabilise at a lower vibration and temperature, though above idle; Tool continues to move linearly (15 mm) while Flow has dropped to 2 units/s  
- Energy halves compared to B (2 kWh) but still ~ 4× idle  
Profile: controlled placing/orienting of already-cut parts, no heavy heating; matches mechanical assembling/fitting of parts.

Segment D: Events 9 – Dramatic spike  
- T shoots to 80 °C, Vib peaks at 50 Hz but Flow = 0, Tool stationary at 15 mm  
- Energy spikes to 5 kWh – highest value of the cycle  
The zero flow plus sudden intense heating at a fixed tool position is characteristic of a joint-fusion or welding operation (heat source fixed, material fixed, strong vibration perhaps from ultrasonic or arc source).

Segment E: Events 10 – Quick cool-down  
- Temperature falls by 50 °C within the same 5-s slot, energy drops; machine effectively doing nothing but cooling – post-weld stand-by.

Segment F: Events 11-12 – Gentle re-activation  
- Low-level Vib and Flow, Tool now moves to 20 mm (loading/unloading movement)  
- Energy low-medium (1.5-1.6 kWh) – operator or robotic arm moving part into a fixture / carton aligning and sealing the workpiece.

Segment G: Events 13 – Return to initial state -> one production cycle finished, ready for the next.

Step-3: Labels applied

| Activity                          | Events | Key Extracted Features Used for Labelling |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1. Idle / Startup                 | 1-3    | All sensors at stand-by low values, no material movement. |
| 2. Cutting Metal                  | 4-6    | Sudden jump in T & vibration while material feed + tool-engagement observed; high energy; precursor to machined geometry. |
| 3. Assembling Parts               | 7-8    | Moderate but steady pressure/energy, vibration lowered from cutting level, tool roaming steadily to final position 15 mm; implies placing / fastening parts. |
| 4. Welding                        | 9      | Highest T (80 °C), extreme vibration, flow 0, tool locked; classic signature for fixed-position welding. |
| 5. Cool-down/Post-Weld Hold       | 10     | Rapid temperature drop, minimal inputs; letting joint solidify. |
| 6. Packaging / Hand-off           | 11-12  | Low energy, light vibration + low material motion; moving finished product to packaging zone (tool reaches final position 20 mm). |
| 7. Idle (end of cycle)            | 13-15  | Values again fall to the same idle baseline seen in events 1-3. |

Step-4: rationale in plain English  
- A real-world cutting phase shows both mechanical (vibration > 30 Hz) and thermal (T rise 2055 °C+) footprints because of friction between tool and workpiece; the combination is unmistakable.  
- Once material is cut, the machine still consumes noticeable energy (2 kWh) but vibration lessens—human/placing activity rather than machining.  
- The welding interval requires a concentrated heat source; values stop any material transport to keep parts in place.  
- Post-weld cooldown is brief (single 5-s event) but recognised by the steep T drop; energy falls too as no power-intensive action occurs.  
- Packing activity is marked by low-level positional motions and gentle material handling at the tail end of the cycle before resetting position.

Thus the raw numeric log has been abstracted into an interpretable manufacturing process: Idle  Cutting  Assembling  Welding  Cool-down  Packaging  Idle.
