# Visualization Description: Business Process Flow Diagram

This is a comprehensive process flow diagram showing multiple interconnected business workflows, likely from an enterprise resource planning (ERP) or order management system. Here are the key elements:

## Main Process Flows

The diagram shows **four primary workflow streams**:

1. **Purchase Requisition Process** (Purple path, left-center)
   - Starts with PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)
   - Flows through: Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Multiple endpoints

2. **Sales Order Process** (Orange/Red path, center-right)
   - Starts with SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects)
   - Flows through: Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  Confirm Delivery  Close Order

3. **Purchase Order Process** (Blue path, right)
   - Starts with PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)
   - Connects to the order creation process

4. **Supporting Processes**:
   - **Vendor Invoice** (1.2M objects, left)
   - **Return Order** (0.8M objects, center)

## Key Process Steps

Major activities shown include:
- **Send Order** (5.2M overall)
- **Check Stock** (1.0M overall)
- **Approve Payment** (1.5M overall)
- **Create Invoice** (2.0M overall)
- **Process Return** (0.8M overall)

## Visual Elements

- **Arrows with timing**: Show process flow with execution times (e.g., 300ms, 450ms, 600ms)
- **Colored dots**: Indicate different process variants or paths
- **Object counts**: Display volume of records for each entity
- **Multiple end points**: Show various process termination scenarios

This appears to be a process mining visualization showing actual system behavior, execution times, and process frequencies.
