Here is a list of 20 relevant questions about the provided process, along with confidence scores for each:

1. **Which process variants have the highest frequency, and what might this indicate about the typical workflow?**  
   *Confidence: High*

2. **What are the average performance times for each process variant, and how do they compare to each other?**  
   *Confidence: High*

3. **Are there specific steps in the process that significantly increase the total performance time?**  
   *Confidence: High*

4. **How does the involvement of different approvers (e.g., ADMINISTRATION, SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER) affect the performance and frequency of process variants?**  
   *Confidence: High*

5. **What is the impact of rejections and resubmissions on the overall performance time of the process?**  
   *Confidence: High*

6. **Which process variants result in the fastest completion times, and what steps do they include or omit?**  
   *Confidence: High*

7. **How often do declarations get rejected at each approval stage, and what are the reasons for these rejections?**  
   *Confidence: High*

8. **Is there a correlation between the number of approval steps and the total performance time of the process?**  
   *Confidence: High*

9. **What percentage of declarations are saved but not submitted, and what might be causing this?**  
   *Confidence: Medium*

10. **Do certain approvers tend to approve or reject declarations more frequently than others?**  
    *Confidence: Medium*

11. **Are there patterns or commonalities in declarations that undergo multiple cycles of rejection and resubmission?**  
    *Confidence: High*

12. **How does the process differ for declarations that are processed directly without any rejections compared to those that experience rejections?**  
    *Confidence: High*

13. **What is the role of the 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' event, and how does it affect the process flow?**  
    *Confidence: Medium*

14. **Are there process variants that bypass certain approval stages, and what are the implications of this on compliance and efficiency?**  
    *Confidence: Medium*

15. **How does the frequency and performance of the most common process variant compare to the overall averages?**  
    *Confidence: High*

16. **What improvements can be made to reduce the performance time of process variants with long durations?**  
    *Confidence: High*

17. **Are there seasonal or temporal trends affecting the frequency and performance of these process variants?**  
    *Confidence: Low*

18. **What is the impact of repeatedly rejected declarations on employee satisfaction and process efficiency?**  
    *Confidence: Medium*

19. **Could automation or policy changes at certain stages reduce the number of rejections and resubmissions?**  
    *Confidence: High*

20. **How does the performance time correlate with the complexity or length of the process variants?**  
    *Confidence: High*
