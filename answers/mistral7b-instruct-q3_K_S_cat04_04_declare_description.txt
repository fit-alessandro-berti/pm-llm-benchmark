This DECLARE declarative process model contains a set of constraints that govern the behavior of the system. Here are the details of each constraint:

1. Existence: This constraint requires that certain events must occur at least once in the system. In other words, the system must be able to handle the situation where one or more activities have not occurred yet.
2. Absence: This constraint prohibits certain events from occurring under any circumstances. For example, it might be required that an employee cannot submit a declaration if they have previously submitted another one.
3. Exactly 1: This constraint ensures that each activity can only occur exactly once during the execution of the process. If the system is designed to support multiple declarations, this constraint would need to be relaxed or removed.
4. Initialization: This constraint specifies the initial state of the system. In this case, it specifies that the process must begin with a declaration submitted by an employee.
5. Responsiveness: This constraint requires the system to respond in real-time to certain events. For example, it might be required that any payments received from customers are recorded and processed immediately.
6. Robustness: This constraint specifies how the system should behave in error conditions or unexpected scenarios. For example, it might require that if a declaration is rejected, it can only be submitted again after being reviewed and approved by a manager.
7. Security: This constraint ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data, such as financial information. It might involve implementing access controls, encryption, and authentication mechanisms to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

Overall, this data provides a detailed description of the requirements for a complex process involving multiple declarations, payments, and approvals.
