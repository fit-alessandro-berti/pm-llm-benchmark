### **Explanation of Case Grouping and Activity Naming**

#### **Case Identification Logic:**

- **Case = Application + Document/Email/Context:**  
  Each case corresponds to a unique file or item being worked on in an application (e.g., editing `Document1.docx` in Word, working on `Budget_2024.xlsx` in Excel, reading a specific email in Gmail).  
- **Document-based Cases:**  
  For office apps (Word, Excel, Acrobat), the window/document name is the key identifier for a case. If a document is closed and later reopened in the same session, it's considered part of the same case.
- **Email-based Case:**  
  The email subject or identifying action (e.g., "Open Email about Annual Meeting") marks the start of an email-handling case; subsequent interactions with the same email are grouped together.
- **Application Context Switch:**  
  Switch or focus events that simply change the window are only logged as "reopen" actions if it brings the user back to a previously worked document in the same case.

#### **Activity Naming Logic:**

- **Standardized Activity Names:**  
  Raw low-level actions are mapped to meaningful, analyst-friendly steps:
  - `FOCUS` (if the document is not already open)  "Open Document"
  - `TYPING`  "Edit Document" / "Edit Spreadsheet" / "Compose Email" depending on application
  - `SAVE`  "Save Document" / "Save Spreadsheet"
  - `CLOSE`  "Close Document"
  - `SWITCH` used to infer "Reopen" if revisiting the same document
  - `CLICK` with context (e.g., "Open Email" / "Reply Email" / "Send Email")
  - `SCROLL` in email or PDF  "Read Email" / "Read Document"
  - `HIGHLIGHT`  "Highlight Text"
- **Details as Additional Info:**  
  Content of typing, selection/text highlights, and other specific actions are included as additional information for enhanced analysis.

#### **Event Attributes:**

- **Case ID:**  
  Concatenation of Application type (abbreviated) and unique document/context identifier.
- **Activity Name:**  
  Standardized as per the above mapping to reflect typical user steps.
- **Timestamp:**  
  Retained from the original event.
- **Application / Document / Additional Info:**  
  Provided for context.

**This event log now tells the story of the user working sequentially on:**
- Editing a report (`Quarterly_Report.docx`), then switching to a new document (`Document1.docx`), editing, saving, and returning later;
- Handling an important email thread (opening, reading, replying, sending);
- Reviewing and highlighting a PDF draft;
- Updating, saving, and switching between Excel budgets and Word reports.

This format is ready for process mining analysis and reveals the major work cases and their activities, allowing you to discover patterns such as handovers, document editing cycles, and multitasking sequences.
