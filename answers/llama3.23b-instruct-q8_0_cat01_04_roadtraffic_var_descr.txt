The provided data appears to be a log or record of various processes related to fines and appeals in a judicial system. Based on the names and frequency columns, I'll break down the general process into distinct stages:

**Stage 1: Create Fine**

* The process begins with creating a fine, which results in sending (focusing on the initial stage of processing).

**Sub-Stages: Insert Fine Notification**

* After creating a fine, a notification is inserted, and the date for appeal to the prefecture is specified.

**Further Sub-Stages:**

* **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**: The process continues with additional stages, such as sending an appeal to the prefecture, receiving results from the prefecture, notifying the offender, and finally appealling to a judge.
	+ These sub-stages often involve repetitive cycles of sending an appeal, receiving results, and either adding penalties, modifying penalties, or notifying the result to the offender.

**Other Sub-Stages**

* **Add penalty**: Various stages include adding penalties as part of the process.
* **Send Appeal**:

    * **To Prefecture**: The fine is sent for further action, such as appeal review by a local authority (prefecture).
	+ Often resulting in:
        - Receiving results from the prefecture: Further review or processing within the prefedure's jurisdiction
        - Notify Result Appeal to Offender:
            + Appealing the decision to a judge (appeal)
			- The judge reviews and settles the result of the appeal.
*   Payment:
    * **Sending**:
        + Receiving payments, either as part of settling the fine, modifying existing penalties or sending for credit collection.

The frequency column indicates that most processes happen 8 times in a block.
