	* Create Fine (multiple frequencies): This is the starting point of the process, where a new fine is created.
2. **Fine Processing and Notification**:
	* Send Fine (multiple frequencies): After creating a fine, it may be sent to the debtor for notification.
	* Insert Fine Notification: If necessary, a fine notification is inserted into the system to alert the relevant parties.
3. **Penalty Application**:
	* Add penalty (multiple frequencies): A penalty is applied to the fine, which can affect the overall amount owed.
4. **Credit Collection and Appeal Management**:
	* Send for Credit Collection (multiple frequencies): The debt is sent for credit collection, indicating that the organization will take further action to recover the fine.
	* Payment (multiple frequencies): Payments are made towards the fine, either directly or through a payment processing system.
	* Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture: If an appeal is filed, this step is triggered.
	* Send Appeal to Prefecture: The appeal is sent to the relevant authority for review and processing.
	* Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture: The result of the appeal is received, and the next steps are determined accordingly.
5. **Appeal Resolution and Payment**:
	* Notify Result Appeal to Offender: The result of the appeal is notified to the original offender.
	* Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture -> Send for Credit Collection (multiple frequencies): If an appeal is successful, the debt is sent for credit collection.
	* Payment (multiple frequencies): Additional payments are made towards the fine, and any penalties are applied.

Some notable process variants include:

* **Create Fine** processes that branch out into different paths, depending on whether a payment or other action is taken.
* Processes that involve multiple steps, such as creating a fine notification, sending it for credit collection, and then following up with additional payments.
* Variants that involve appeals and their resolution, which can affect the subsequent actions in the process.

Overall, this data represents a complex business process involving multiple stakeholders, fine creation, processing, and collection, as well as appeal management and payment handling.
