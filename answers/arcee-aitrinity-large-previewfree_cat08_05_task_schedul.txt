## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

Process mining techniques can reconstruct the actual job flow and task execution sequences from the MES event logs, providing unprecedented visibility into scheduling performance. The fundamental approach involves extracting the directly-follows relationships between activities (e.g., "Task End (Cutting)"  "Queue Entry (Milling)") and analyzing the timing between these events to understand the true flow dynamics.

**Process Mining Techniques and Metrics:**

For job flow times and lead times, I would apply the **performance perspective** in process mining to analyze the duration between "Job Released" and "Job Completed" events. This reveals the actual makespan distribution and identifies outliers. The **conformance perspective** would help identify deviations from planned schedules by comparing actual task durations against planned durations extracted from the logs.

To quantify task waiting times at each work center, I would analyze the time difference between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events for each machine. This reveals the queue time distribution per resource, highlighting which machines consistently experience long queues.

**Resource utilization analysis** requires examining the time intervals between "Task Start" and "Task End" events, as well as "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events. The total time a machine is occupied includes both productive processing time and setup time. Idle time can be calculated by comparing the machine's availability window against the sum of all occupied intervals.

For sequence-dependent setup times, the key insight is that the MES log captures the "previous job" information during setup events. By analyzing all "Setup Start" events and extracting the "Previous job" field, I can build a setup time matrix showing the average setup duration between every pair of jobs that were processed sequentially on the same machine. This requires aggregating setup times across all instances where job A was followed by job B on machine M, then calculating the average and variance. This matrix becomes the foundation for setup-aware scheduling.

Schedule adherence and tardiness measurement involves comparing the actual completion time of each job against its due date. By extracting the "Job Completed" timestamp and comparing it with the "Order Due Date" field, I can calculate tardiness for each job. Aggregating this data reveals the percentage of jobs delivered late and the average tardiness magnitude.

Disruption impact analysis requires correlating disruption events (breakdowns, priority changes) with subsequent performance degradation. By analyzing the time intervals between "Breakdown Start" and "Breakdown End" events, and examining queue lengths and waiting times during these periods, I can quantify the disruption's ripple effects. Similarly, priority changes can be analyzed by comparing the performance of jobs before and after their priority was elevated.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Process mining reveals several critical pathologies in the current scheduling approach. **Bottleneck identification** becomes straightforward by analyzing resource utilization metrics. A machine consistently operating at 90%+ utilization with long queue times represents a bottleneck. The **critical path analysis** can identify which bottlenecks most significantly impact overall throughput by examining which long-waiting jobs at bottleneck machines cause downstream starvation.

Poor task prioritization manifests in the data through analysis of **tardiness by priority level**. If high-priority jobs frequently miss their due dates while low-priority jobs complete on time, this indicates ineffective prioritization. **Variant analysis** comparing the process flows of on-time versus late jobs reveals systematic differences. Late jobs might show longer queue times at specific machines or more frequent disruptions during their processing.

Suboptimal sequencing evidence appears in the setup time analysis. If the historical setup time matrix shows that certain job sequences consistently require much longer setups than others, but the current scheduling ignores this, it indicates a major inefficiency. The total setup time across all machines can be compared against the theoretical minimum achievable through optimal sequencing.

Downstream starvation becomes visible through **waiting time analysis at downstream machines**. If a downstream machine shows long idle periods while its upstream neighbor has long queues, this suggests poor coordination. The **token replay feature** in process mining can visualize these imbalances dynamically.

The bullwhip effect in WIP levels appears as increasing variance in WIP as you move through the production sequence. Process mining can quantify this by analyzing WIP levels at each stage and calculating the variance amplification factor.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

Process mining helps differentiate between scheduling logic issues and resource capacity problems through comparative analysis. If all machines show similar utilization patterns and queue lengths, the issue likely lies in the scheduling logic rather than specific resource constraints. However, if one machine consistently shows 95% utilization while others hover around 60%, this indicates a capacity limitation at that specific resource.

The limitations of static dispatching rules become evident through **analysis of decision points**. By identifying where jobs enter queues and which dispatching rule determined their position, I can correlate specific rules with poor outcomes. For instance, if "First-Come-First-Served" consistently results in high-priority jobs waiting behind low-priority ones, this reveals a fundamental flaw.

Lack of real-time visibility manifests in the data as **reactive rather than proactive scheduling behavior**. Analysis of how the system responds to disruptions shows whether it can adapt quickly or whether jobs pile up waiting for unavailable resources. The time between a breakdown occurring and the schedule being adjusted indicates the system's responsiveness.

Inaccurate duration estimations become apparent through **analysis of planned versus actual durations**. If actual task times consistently exceed planned times by a significant margin, this suggests the planning parameters are unrealistic. The variance in actual durations can be analyzed to build more accurate statistical models.

Ineffective setup time handling shows in the **sequence-dependent setup analysis**. If the current scheduling doesn't consider the setup time matrix derived from historical data, it will make suboptimal sequencing decisions that increase total setup time.

Poor coordination between work centers appears in the **inter-machine waiting time analysis**. If jobs frequently wait at machine B while machine A has availability, this indicates a lack of coordination in the scheduling decisions across work centers.

## 4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching with Setup Awareness**

This strategy enhances traditional dispatching rules by incorporating multiple weighted factors dynamically adjusted based on current shop floor conditions. The dispatch priority score for each waiting job would be calculated as:

Priority Score = w(Due Date Proximity) + w(Remaining Processing Time) + w(Current Priority) + w(Downstream Load) + w(Setup Cost)

The weights (w through w) would be dynamically adjusted based on current performance metrics. During high congestion, due date proximity and setup cost might receive higher weights. The setup cost component uses the historical setup time matrix to estimate the additional time required if this job follows the current last-job on the machine.

Process mining insights inform this strategy by providing the historical data needed to calculate the setup cost component and by revealing which factors historically correlate most strongly with on-time completion. The strategy addresses the pathology of suboptimal sequencing by explicitly considering setup costs, and it improves high-priority job handling by weighting due date proximity appropriately.

**Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Uncertainty Modeling**

This approach uses historical task duration distributions and predictive maintenance insights to generate probabilistic schedules rather than deterministic ones. Task durations would be modeled as statistical distributions (e.g., log-normal) parameterized from historical data, potentially stratified by factors like operator skill, job complexity, or time of day.

Predictive maintenance insights, derived from analysis of breakdown patterns in the logs, would be used to adjust machine availability windows. If certain machines show periodic breakdown patterns, the schedule would include buffer times or alternative routing options.

The scheduling algorithm would use **Monte Carlo simulation** to generate multiple schedule scenarios, each sampling from the task duration distributions and incorporating predicted breakdowns. The final schedule would optimize for robustness across these scenarios rather than just a single deterministic outcome.

This strategy addresses inaccurate duration estimations by using statistical distributions instead of point estimates, and it improves disruption handling by incorporating predictive maintenance insights. Process mining provides the historical data to build the statistical models and identify patterns in breakdowns.

**Strategy 3: Bottleneck-Optimized Sequencing with Setup Batching**

This strategy focuses specifically on optimizing sequencing at identified bottleneck machines to minimize both waiting times and setup costs. The approach involves:

1. Identifying bottleneck machines through utilization analysis
2. Analyzing the setup time matrix to identify job families with low setup costs between them
3. Implementing a batching logic that groups similar jobs together when they approach the bottleneck
4. Using a traveling salesman problem (TSP) solver to find the optimal sequence within each batch that minimizes total setup time

The strategy uses process mining insights in multiple ways: bottleneck identification, setup time matrix construction, and analysis of historical batching effectiveness. It directly addresses the pathology of suboptimal sequencing by explicitly optimizing for setup minimization at the most critical resources.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Simulation Framework:**

Discrete-event simulation would be parameterized using process mining-derived data:
- Task duration distributions (mean, variance, distribution type)
- Routing probabilities between work centers
- Breakdown frequencies and duration distributions for each machine
- Setup time matrix for sequence-dependent setups
- Initial WIP levels and job arrival patterns

The simulation would test multiple scenarios:
- **High load scenario:** 120% of average capacity to test system limits
- **Disruption-heavy scenario:** Increased breakdown frequency (e.g., 50% above average)
- **Mixed priority scenario:** Higher proportion of urgent jobs
- **Setup-sensitive scenario:** Jobs with high setup variability

For each scenario, I would compare the three proposed strategies against the baseline (current scheduling approach) on metrics like average tardiness, maximum WIP, resource utilization balance, and schedule stability (variance in completion times).

**Continuous Improvement Framework:**

The continuous monitoring system would involve:
1. **Automated KPI tracking:** Daily calculation of tardiness rate, average lead time, WIP levels, and utilization metrics
2. **Drift detection:** Statistical process control charts to identify when KPIs deviate significantly from expected ranges
3. **Root cause mining:** When KPIs degrade, process mining would automatically analyze recent event logs to identify the underlying causes (e.g., new bottleneck formation, change in setup patterns)
4. **Adaptive parameter tuning:** The scheduling strategy parameters (e.g., weights in the multi-criteria dispatching) would be automatically adjusted based on recent performance data

The system would maintain a **performance history database** that tracks which scheduling parameter configurations performed best under different conditions. Machine learning models could be trained on this data to predict optimal parameter settings based on current shop floor conditions.

This framework ensures that the scheduling strategy evolves with the manufacturing environment, continuously adapting to new patterns, changing product mixes, and evolving resource constraints identified through ongoing process mining analysis.
