This task requires a multi-stage SQL query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to define the variants, count their frequency, filter down to the top K, and finally retrieve the corresponding raw events.

We will use **K=5** as the placeholder value for the top K variants.

```sql
-- K: Define the number of top variants to retrieve
-- SET K = 5;

WITH 
-- 1. Construct the ordered sequence (variant) for every case_id.
CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        -- Use STRING_AGG to concatenate activities into a single string, 
        -- ensuring the order is determined by the timestamp.
        STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS process_variant_sequence
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),

-- 2. Identify the unique variants, count their frequency, and filter down to the Top K.
TopKVariants AS (
    SELECT
        process_variant_sequence
    FROM 
        CaseVariants
    GROUP BY 
        process_variant_sequence
    ORDER BY 
        COUNT(case_id) DESC  -- Order by frequency descending
    LIMIT 5                  -- Placeholder for K=5
)

-- 3. Retrieve all original events that belong to cases whose variant 
-- matches one of the identified Top K sequences.
SELECT
    t1.case_id,
    t1.activity,
    t1.timestamp
FROM
    event_log AS t1
-- Join the original log with the derived sequence information
INNER JOIN 
    CaseVariants AS t2
    ON t1.case_id = t2.case_id
-- Filter cases: only keep cases whose sequence exists in the TopK list
INNER JOIN 
    TopKVariants AS t3
    ON t2.process_variant_sequence = t3.process_variant_sequence
ORDER BY 
    t1.case_id, 
    t1.timestamp;
```
