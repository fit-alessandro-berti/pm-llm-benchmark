To create a representative temporal profile for the given global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics, we need to estimate the average and standard deviation of the times between various pairs of activities. Here is a constructed dictionary for a subset of these activity pairs, including some pairs that are separated by multiple steps:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (estimated_average_time_SS_OP, estimated_stdev_SS_OP),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (estimated_average_time_OP_RC, estimated_stdev_OP_RC),
    ('OP', 'QI'): (estimated_average_time_OP_QI, estimated_stdev_OP_QI),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (estimated_average_time_RC_QI, estimated_stdev_RC_QI),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (estimated_average_time_QI_CA, estimated_stdev_QI_CA),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (estimated_average_time_CA_PT, estimated_stdev_CA_PT),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (estimated_average_time_PT_PK, estimated_stdev_PT_PK),
    ('PT', 'WS'): (estimated_average_time_PT_WS, estimated_stdev_PT_WS),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (estimated_average_time_PK_WS, estimated_stdev_PK_WS),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (estimated_average_time_WS_DT, estimated_stdev_WS_DT),
    ('PT', 'AS'): (estimated_average_time_PT_AS, estimated_stdev_PT_AS),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (estimated_average_time_DT_AS, estimated_stdev_DT_AS),
    ('QI', 'PT'): (estimated_average_time_QI_PT, estimated_stdev_QI_PT),
    ('SS', 'CA'): (estimated_average_time_SS_CA, estimated_stdev_SS_CA),
    ('OP', 'PK'): (estimated_average_time_OP_PK, estimated_stdev_OP_PK),
    ('RC', 'PT'): (estimated_average_time_RC_PT, estimated_stdev_RC_PT),
    ('QI', 'PK'): (estimated_average_time_QI_PK, estimated_stdev_QI_PK),
    ('CA', 'DT'): (estimated_average_time_CA_DT, estimated_stdev_CA_DT),
    ('PT', 'DT'): (estimated_average_time_PT_DT, estimated_stdev_PT_DT),
    ('WS', 'AS'): (estimated_average_time_WS_AS, estimated_stdev_WS_AS),
    ('SS', 'AS'): (estimated_average_time_SS_AS, estimated_stdev_SS_AS)
}
```

In this dictionary, the activity pairs and their associated average times and standard deviations are placeholders for the actual estimated values. These values should be estimated based on historical data, operational knowledge, and insights into the variability of the process times for each pair of activities.

Here are some examples of how you might estimate these values:

1. **('SS', 'OP'):**
   - **Average Time:** The average time between selecting a supplier and placing an order might be relatively quick, say a few hours.
   - **Standard Deviation:** This could vary based on the complexity of supplier selection criteria and negotiation times.

2. **('RC', 'QI'):**
   - **Average Time:** The time between receiving components and starting quality inspection might be immediate or a few minutes to hours, depending on the volume.
   - **Standard Deviation:** This could be low if the inspection process is well-organized and automated.

3. **('CA', 'DT'):**
   - **Average Time:** The time between completing assembly and shipping the product could be a few days, depending on testing, packaging, and storage times.
   - **Standard Deviation:** This could be higher due to variability in testing and packaging processes.

4. **('PT', 'AS'):**
   - **Average Time:** The time between product testing and providing after-sales support might be several weeks, considering the time to reach customers and initial support requests.
   - **Standard Deviation:** This could be relatively high due to the variability in customer feedback and support needs.

These estimates should be refined based on actual data and operational insights to create a more accurate temporal profile for the supply chain process.
