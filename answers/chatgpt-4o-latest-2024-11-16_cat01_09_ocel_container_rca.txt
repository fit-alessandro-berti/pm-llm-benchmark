In examining the object-centric directly follows graph that you provided, there are several indicators of performance issues related to specific combinations of activities, triggers, and object behaviors. Let’s go through the key observations by object type and determine potential **data-driven root causes** contributing to performance inefficiency:

### 1. **Handling Unit**
   - **Activities**: "Collect Goods" -> "Load Truck"
   - **Observation**: The frequency of events and objects is 10553, and the duration is 7820.93.
   - **Issue**: While the frequency of these events is relatively high, the time taken to transition from "Collect Goods" to "Load Truck" (7820.93 time units) may be contributing to bottlenecks if "Collect Goods" is a frequent task. This suggests potential delays between goods collection and loading, likely caused by handling inefficiencies, resource shortages, or delays in synchronizing with truck loading.
   
### 2. **Truck**
   - **Repeated Activity**: "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" (8559 events over 6 objects, duration = 5259.71)
   - **Observation**: The transition "Load Truck" -> "Load Truck" occurs frequently with a considerable duration. Given that there are only 6 trucks, this suggests repeating the loading process multiple times for each truck. 
   - **Issue**: The constant reloading of trucks can indicate either inefficient truck utilization (e.g., partial truck loads leading to multiple loading cycles) or inadequate handling capacity. The duration (5259.71 time units for each cycle) is non-trivial and could indicate time wasted in reloading trucks rather than optimizing truck capacity.
   
   - **"Drive to Terminal" -> "Load Truck" with 84119.09 duration**:
       - The long duration between "Drive to Terminal" and returning to "Load Truck" suggests that trucks spend excessive time away from the terminal. This could be due to travel inefficiencies, possible delays at destination places (terminal), or routing issues. Given that only 6 trucks are involved, such long durations can result in idle loading operations.

### 3. **Container**
   - **Critical Activity**: "Order Empty Containers" -> "Pick Up Empty Container" has a **duration of 368943.92**.
   - **Observation**: It takes a substantial amount of time to move from "Order Empty Containers" to actually "Pick Up Empty Container". The high frequency of objects involved (1995) coupled with the long waiting time suggests a major bottleneck in either obtaining or preparing containers for pickup.
   - **Issue**: This likely signals a delay in supplier response times, availability issues, or logistical problems in the container preparation stage. These delays could severely influence the capacity to load trucks and move goods forward.
   
   - **Other activities related to containers**: "Place in Stock" takes a staggering **743380.51 time units** to transition to "Bring to Loading Bay." Given the frequency of this pattern (1794 events), this suggests major delays related to on-site storage processes or resource allocation to move containers to the loading bay after being stored.
   - **Weighing and logistical inefficiencies**:
     - The consistent high frequency and non-trivial durations associated with "Weigh" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" and related processes indicate inefficiencies in physical goods movement. Repeated weighing and loading actions show recurring delays related to warehouse logistics, leading to performance slowdowns.

### 4. **Vehicle**
   - **Booking Delays**: "Book Vehicles" -> "Book Vehicles" (585 events with a duration of 295965.56).
   - **Observation**: Vehicle booking steps are highly frequent, yet they include extremely long waiting times (nearly 296k time units).
   - **Issue**: This indicates a major bottleneck related to availability or processing of vehicles. Perhaps the system is struggling to find available vehicles or encounters delays in confirmation or resource planning. This could hinder the loading process and result in other tasks being delayed downstream.

   - **High durations for Rescheduling**: The transition "Reschedule Container" -> "Load to Vehicle" (152433.14 units) and "Reschedule Container" -> "Reschedule Container" (40,895.81 units) shows that once rescheduling is triggered, the process becomes very slow. These delays, likely due to planning or availability issues, impact the entire logistics flow, especially when coordinating between vehicles, containers, and other resources.

### 5. **Forklift**
   - **"Place in Stock" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" with 112,600.53**:
     - Observation: When transitioning containers from stock to loading bay, the forklift takes an excessive amount of time (112600.53 time units). Given the moderate frequency of involved transitions, this indicates a significant delay or bottleneck in the handling or transportation process, which could be related to resource shortages (e.g., not enough forklifts) or inefficient processes in the warehouse.
   
   - **Inefficient cycles** in Forklift logistics: "Load to Vehicle" -> "Bring to Loading Bay" and vice versa show long durations in repeated transitions. The lack of parallel resources or excessive gatekeeping procedures between these activities may introduce latency into critical operations.

### 6. **Customer Order**
   - **Long Delays Between Registration and Documentation**: "Register Customer Order" -> "Create Transport Document" has a duration of 329005.22.
   - **Issue**: Delays at this stage can result from slow customer handling, inefficient order processing systems, or manual steps that block the process of moving towards logistics (creating transport documents). This can cascade delays across the subsequent steps, affecting container and vehicle booking.

### 7. **Transport Document**
   - **Significant Delays Across Multiple Transitions**:
     - The transition between "Order Empty Containers" and "Depart" takes **1,007,066.16 time units**, essentially representing a major span of time required to initiate key logistics. Similarly, long delays between "Order Empty Containers" -> "Reschedule Container" or "Reschedule Container" -> subsequent activities reveal significant obstacles in process flow. These could involve physical container shortages, delays in approvals, or misalignments in document processing related to available containers and vehicles.

### **Key Causes of Performance Issues:**
1. **Resource Shortage**: Multiple object types, particularly Forklifts, Vehicles, and Containers, repeatedly go through long durations between critical actions, suggesting insufficient availability of these resources.
   
2. **Long Delays in Ordering and Picking Empty Containers**: The duration between ordering empty containers and picking them up is one of the largest performance bottlenecks. This issue can be linked to inefficiencies in supplier coordination or internal resource planning.

3. **Rework and Continuous Reprocessing (e.g., Reschedules)**: Significant rework loops (e.g., re-booking vehicles or re-scheduling containers) increase process complexity and contribute to delays. The particularly long durations observed in re-scheduling suggest systematic issues with availability or prioritization.

4. **Physical Movement Inefficiencies**: Long durations for moving containers from “Place in Stock” to “Bring to Loading Bay” (and vice versa) further indicate that warehouse and material handling processes are not well-optimized, contributing to logistical bottlenecks.
   
5. **Documentation Delays**: The transition from “Register Customer Order” to “Create Transport Document” suffers from considerable delays, which could indicate a lack of automation or manual, time-consuming steps that affect broader process performance.

These points suggest that the primary bottlenecks arise from a mixture of inefficiencies in resource planning, coordination, and internal logistics—particularly in handling units, trucks, containers, and document processing.
