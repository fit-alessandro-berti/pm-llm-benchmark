Great, let's reconstruct the individual patient journeys (cases) from this interleaved event log by analyzing **timestamps, department flow, patient attributes (age/gender), and logical process sequences**.

We’ll look for continuity in:
- Patient demographics (age, gender) — if two events have different age/gender, they likely aren’t the same case.
- Department workflow — e.g., ER  Radiology  ER  discharge; Surgery  Surgery  Recovery  discharge.
- Timestamp order — events for a single case should be in a plausible chronological and causal sequence.
- Activity patterns — e.g., registration before triage, lab test requested before completed, surgery before recovery.

Let’s go step by step.

### Step 1: Identify unique patient profiles

From `Register patient` events (first activity likely in any case):

- **Event 1**: 45M, ER, private
- **Event 2**: 62F, ER, public
- **Event 3**: 28M, Surgery, private

Already, we see **three distinct patients** by age/gender/department. Likely **3 cases**.

Let’s trace each.

---

###  Case A: 45-year-old Male, ER (private insurance)

- **1.** `2024-03-15T08:05:13Z` – Register patient (ER)
- **4.** `2024-03-15T08:10:50Z` – Initial triage (ER, Nurse Joy, triage_code=3)
- **7.** `2024-03-15T08:15:42Z` – X-ray imaging (Radiology, left_leg)
- **12.** `2024-03-15T08:23:10Z` – Doctor consultation (ER, Dr. Lee, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- **15.** `2024-03-15T08:30:05Z` – Patient discharged (ER, followup=outpatient_clinic)

 All events match: same age/gender, timestamps increase, flow makes sense:
Register  triage  imaging  consult  discharge.

 This is a **coherent ER case with imaging and fracture diagnosis**.

###  Case B: 62-year-old Female, ER (public insurance)

- **2.** `2024-03-15T08:07:02Z` – Register patient (ER)
- **5.** `2024-03-15T08:12:29Z` – Initial triage (ER, triage_code=2)
- **8.** `2024-03-15T08:16:10Z` – Lab test requested (ER, blood_panel)
- **10.** `2024-03-15T08:20:27Z` – Lab test completed (Lab, results=normal_levels)
- **11.** `2024-03-15T08:22:54Z` – Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- **14.** `2024-03-15T08:27:00Z` – Prescription created (antibiotics)
- **17.** `2024-03-15T08:35:29Z` – Patient discharged (ER, pharmacy_pickup)

 All events consistent: same patient profile, timestamp order, logical ER pathway:
Register  triage  lab request  lab result  consult  prescription  discharge.

 **Standalone ER case with lab testing and prescription.**

###  Case C: 28-year-old Male, Surgery (private insurance)

- **3.** `2024-03-15T08:13:00Z` – Register patient (Surgery)
- **6.** `2024-03-15T08:13:00Z` – Doctor consultation (Surgery, scheduled_knee_surgery) — same timestamp? Possibly simultaneous or fast sequence.
- **9.** `2024-03-15T08:16:45Z` – Surgery preparation
- **13.** `2024-03-15T08:25:19Z` – Surgery performed (arthroscopy)
- **16.** `2024-03-15T08:31:37Z` – Recovery room (stable)
- **18.** `2024-03-15T08:40:13Z` – Patient discharged (Surgery, physiotherapy_sessions)

 All same patient (28M), all in Surgery/Radiology-adjacent path. Note: no ER involvement — this is a **scheduled surgery case**, started directly in Surgery dept.

The timestamp of registration and consultation both at `08:13:00Z` is likely a data resolution (same second), so acceptable.

 **Elective surgery pathway complete.**

### Final Case Groupings

---

####  **Case 1 (45M, ER)**
- 1. Register patient  
- 4. Initial triage  
- 7. X-ray imaging

- 15. Patient discharged  

---

####  **Case 2 (62F, ER)**
- 2. Register patient  
- 5. Initial triage  
- 8. Lab test requested  
- 10. Lab test completed  
- 11. Doctor consultation  
- 14. Prescription created  
- 17. Patient discharged  

---

####  **Case 3 (28M, Surgery)**
- 3. Register patient  
- 6. Doctor consultation  
- 9. Surgery preparation  
- 13. Surgery performed  
- 16. Recovery room  
- 18. Patient discharged

### Summary: 3 distinct patient cases inferred.

No ambiguity in patient attributes or logical flow — all events are cleanly grouped by **demographics + department + time + process logic**.
