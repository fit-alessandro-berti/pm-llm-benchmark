1. A "Declaration" starts its journey when it is "SUBMITTED by an EMPLOYEE". This step has multiple pathways that could lead to either approval, rejection, or further processing. The declaration can be sent for pre-approval ("FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER") and then later approved by an administrator. If it is rejected at any point during this process, it may return to the "SUBMITTED BY EMPLOYEE" status.

2. A declaration can be "APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION". This approval step could lead to rejection by a supervisor or budget owner later on, which would cause the declaration to be rejected by the employee again. If approved, it will proceed towards "DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".

3. Similarly, an approved declaration can be sent for approval by a "BUDGET OWNER". Like previous steps, rejection of the declaration at this stage would lead to rejection by the employee. If it is approved, however, it will also proceed towards "DECLARATION FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR".

4. Once a declaration is finally approved by a supervisor, there are two main pathways that can occur. Firstly, a "Request Payment" may be initiated. This request could lead to a rejection due to missing information ("DECLARATION REJECTED by MISSING"). If no issues are found, the payment process continues until it is finally handled in the last step, "Payment Handled". Secondly, if there's an issue with the final approved declaration, it might be rejected causing the process to go back to the employee for resubmission.

5. There are also some rare cases mentioned such as a declaration being saved by an employee but not submitted for payment handling, or declarations being rejected at different stages which cause them to return to the "SUBMITTED BY EMPLOYEE" step.
