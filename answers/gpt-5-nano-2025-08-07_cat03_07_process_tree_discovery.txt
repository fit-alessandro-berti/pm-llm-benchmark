Final process tree structure (representing the discovered process)

- SEQUENCE
  - Leaf: "Receive Application (RA)"
  - Leaf: "Validate Form (VF)"
  - LOOP
    - A: Leaf: "Assess Eligibility (AE)"
    - B: SEQUENCE
      - Leaf: "Request Missing Info (RMI)"
      - Leaf: "Validate Form (VF)"  # re-validation after missing info
  - Leaf: "Approval Decision (AD)"
  - Leaf: "Send Confirmation (SC)"
  - Leaf: "Archive Case (AC)"

Notes
- The main flow is RA -> VF -> AE -> (zero or more iterations of RMI followed by VF) -> AD -> SC -> AC.
- The loop between AE and the RMI/VF pair captures repeated requests for missing information and subsequent re-validation before final approval and archival.
