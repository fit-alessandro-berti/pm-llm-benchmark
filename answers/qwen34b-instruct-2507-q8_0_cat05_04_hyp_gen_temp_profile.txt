**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

1. **(R, P) – Receive to Approve: Average ~25 hours, very low standard deviation (1 hour)**  
   - The extremely low standard deviation suggests a highly consistent and predictable approval timeline, which is unusual in a real-world claims process. This rigidity may indicate either a rule-based automation that enforces a fixed approval window, or a lack of human judgment in approvals—possibly due to a default policy or system override.

2. **(P, N) – Approve to Notify: Average 7 days, high standard deviation (2 days)**  
   - A long average delay with significant variation suggests inconsistent notification timing. This could reflect a bottleneck in the notification workflow—such as manual follow-ups, missing email routing, or delays in customer service response—leading to unpredictable wait times.

3. **(A, C) – Assign to Close: Average 2 hours, with no intermediate activities observed**  
   - The short time between assignment and closure, without clear evidence of evaluation or approval, implies that some claims may be closed prematurely. This could indicate a failure in process adherence, such as skip steps or misrouting of claims, or that certain low-value claims are being expedited without proper review.

4. **(E, N) – Evaluate to Notify: Average 5 minutes, very low standard deviation (1 minute)**  
   - Such a rapid transition from evaluation to notification is highly suspicious. It suggests either a procedural shortcut (e.g., skipping validation or customer confirmation), or that the notification step is being automated immediately after evaluation with no human intervention or oversight, which may violate business rules.

**Hypotheses on the Root Causes**

- **(R, P) – Too rigid approval timing**:  
  The low standard deviation may stem from automated approval rules triggered by predefined thresholds (e.g., claim amount under $1000), leading to uniform processing. This could be a compliance or efficiency measure, but it may also indicate a lack of flexibility in handling complex or high-risk claims.

- **(P, N) – Long and variable delay**:  
  The delay might be due to a manual notification process where adjusters or customer service agents are responsible for sending notifications, and their availability or workload varies. Alternatively, email or SMS systems might be failing to deliver or being delayed, causing inconsistencies.

- **(A, C) – Premature closure**:  
  This may occur when claims are assigned to adjusters who close them without performing evaluation or approval. It could be due to flawed workflow logic, misaligned role assignments, or a lack of audit controls. It may also reflect a practice of closing claims too early to meet performance targets.

- **(E, N) – Excessively fast notification**:  
  This could result from an automated system that sends notifications immediately after evaluation, bypassing necessary customer confirmation or escalation steps. It may also reflect a lack of escalation protocols for disputed claims or missing validation checks.

**Verification SQL Queries**

1. **Identify claims with abnormal (R, P) timing (deviation from expected profile)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       c.customer_id,
       c.claim_type,
       c.submission_date,
       e1.timestamp AS receive_time,
       e2.timestamp AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) AS time_to_approve_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e1.activity = 'R'
   JOIN claim_events e2 ON e2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'P'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) < 25*3600 OR 
         EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) > 25*3600 + 1*3600
   ORDER BY time_to_approve_seconds DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Find claims where (P, N) delay exceeds 7 days or is unusually variable**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       c.customer_id,
       c.claim_type,
       e1.timestamp AS approve_time,
       e2.timestamp AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) AS delay_seconds,
       ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) - 7*86400) AS deviation_from_avg
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events e2 ON e2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) > 7*86400 
       OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) < 5*86400
   ORDER BY delay_seconds DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

3. **Detect claims closed immediately after assignment (A to C in <2 hours)**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       c.customer_id,
       c.claim_type,
       a.name AS adjuster_name,
       e1.timestamp AS assign_time,
       e2.timestamp AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) AS time_to_close_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e1.activity = 'A'
   JOIN claim_events e2 ON e2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'C'
   JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = e1.resource
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) < 7200
   ORDER BY time_to_close_seconds ASC
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

4. **Investigate claims with (E, N) transitions under 5 minutes**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       c.customer_id,
       c.claim_type,
       e1.timestamp AS evaluate_time,
       e2.timestamp AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) AS time_to_notify_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e1.activity = 'E'
   JOIN claim_events e2 ON e2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'N'
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) < 300
   ORDER BY time_to_notify_seconds ASC
   LIMIT 30;
   ```

5. **Correlate anomalies with adjuster, region, or claim type**  
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       a.region,
       a.specialization,
       c.claim_type,
       COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp))) AS avg_delay_seconds
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events e1 ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e1.activity = 'P'
   JOIN claim_events e2 ON e2.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e2.activity = 'N'
   JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = e1.resource
   WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) > 7*86400
   GROUP BY a.region, a.specialization, c.claim_type
   ORDER BY avg_delay_seconds DESC;
   ```

These queries allow for targeted investigation into process deviations and can help pinpoint whether anomalies are tied to specific adjusters, regions, claim types, or workflow stages—enabling root cause analysis and process optimization.
