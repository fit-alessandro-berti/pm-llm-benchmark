The comparison between the event logs of **Group A (Protected Group)** and **Group B (Unprotected Group)** reveals clear indications of potential bias in the decision-making process. Here's a detailed analysis:

---

### **1. Evidence of Bias in Scoring Adjustments**
- **Group A (Protected Group)**:
  - There are no **ScoreAdjustments** across all cases.
  - All cases are evaluated solely on their **PreliminaryScore**, and no external factors (such as community or residency) influence the scoring or final decision.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group)**:
  - Cases with affiliation to a **CommunityGroup** (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club") consistently receive a **+10 ScoreAdjustment** labeled as a "Community Boost."
  - For instance:
    - Case U001: PreliminaryScore of 720 increased to 730 due to the boost.
    - Case U003: PreliminaryScore of 695 increased to 705 due to the boost.
  - This boost directly impacts the **FinalDecision**, as scores close to the threshold for approval become eligible due to the adjustment (e.g., U003 is approved, whereas a similar case in Group A might not be).

---

### **2. Influence of LocalResident Attribute**
- **Group A (Protected Group)**:
  - All cases indicate `LocalResident = FALSE`.
  - No apparent benefit or adjustment is given for being a local resident.

- **Group B (Unprotected Group)**:
  - All cases indicate `LocalResident = TRUE`.
  - While there is no explicit adjustment linked to this attribute, being a **LocalResident** correlates with potential eligibility for the **CommunityGroup Boost**, which disproportionately benefits applicants in Group B.

---

### **3. Systematic Differences in Final Decisions**
- Despite having **comparable PreliminaryScores**:
  - **Group A** shows less favorable outcomes, with no adjustments provided to boost scores:
    - P001: Approved with a score of 720.
    - P002: Rejected with a score of 710.
    - P003: Approved with a score of 740.
  - **Group B** benefits from the **Community Boost**, leading to approvals for cases with slightly lower scores:
    - U001: Approved with an adjusted score of 730.
    - U003: Approved with an adjusted score of 705.

- Without the adjustments, cases like U003 might have been rejected due to a PreliminaryScore of 695 (which is below the threshold seen in Group A).

---

### **4. CommunityGroup Influence**
- Membership in a **CommunityGroup** has a direct impact on scoring and decisions in Group B:
  - Cases associated with "Highland Civic Darts Club" received consistent boosts, which improved their eligibility for approval.
  - In contrast, no similar mechanism exists in Group A, despite equivalent PreliminaryScores.
  - This creates a systematic disparity, as Group B applicants tied to specific groups gain an advantage not afforded to Group A.

---

### **Conclusion**
The logs reveal **bias in favor of Group B** due to:
1. **Community Boost** adjustments exclusive to Group B.
2. Correlation between **LocalResident** status and eligibility for such boosts.

### **Implications**
- These factors systematically disadvantage **Group A (Protected Group)** by applying different rules or criteria, which is a violation of equity principles.
- The process could perpetuate disparities, as applicants in Group B are more likely to belong to a qualifying community group, further increasing the likelihood of approval.

### **Recommendations**
1. **Standardize Scoring Criteria**:
   - Eliminate or extend the "Community Boost" to all applicants, regardless of group affiliation.
2. **Audit the Role of LocalResident**:
   - Evaluate whether this attribute indirectly leads to unequal treatment.
3. **Enhance Transparency**:
   - Document and justify all score adjustments to ensure fairness and accountability.
