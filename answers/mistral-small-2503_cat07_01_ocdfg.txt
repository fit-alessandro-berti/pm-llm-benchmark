Each object type is represented by a distinct color: purple for PurchaseRequisitionItem, orange for SalesOrderItem, blue for PurchaseOrderItem, green for VendorInvoiceItem, and red for ReturnOrderItem. The diagram includes annotations indicating the overall number of objects processed and the time taken for each step, measured in milliseconds. The processes are interconnected, showing how different objects flow through various stages, with some processes branching out to handle specific tasks like stock checking, return processing, and payment approval. The overall concept conveyed by the diagram is the complex interplay and sequential processing of different business objects within a supply chain or order management system, highlighting the time and resource allocation at each stage.
