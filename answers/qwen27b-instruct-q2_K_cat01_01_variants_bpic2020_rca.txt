To analyze the performance issues within the described processes based solely on provided data:

Firstly identify the most common patterns where the Declaration is REJECTED early along the process chain:

1. Employee-submitted Declaration -> Approval by Supervisor or BUDGET_OWNER: These rejections may indicate problems with the employee's initial submission not meeting requirements properly understood, or the supervisor/BUDGET_OWNER needing clear criteria to approve.

2. Multiple rejected-resubmitted cycles within a process flow indicate discrepancies often due to unclear guidelines, misunderstanding from the employees on what qualifies approval conditions are met.

3. Delayed response times from supervisors/ BUDGET_OWNER can lead to accumulation of rejected declarations pending resolution which subsequently causes delays downstream processes.

4. Communication gaps might be present between employees and supervisors regarding necessary changes or additional requirements that were not communicated upfront causing misunderstandings resulting in rejection/re-submission cycles.

5. Potential systemic errors: In some cases, the system used for tracking statuses or processing submissions may have an error leading to unexpected rejection alerts or delays in notifications that employees received approval or rejection messages timely enough.

6. Technical barriers or flaws within the process flows (e.g., frequency and performance metrics) might suggest there are underlying technical issues with how tasks are assigned or processed which lead inefficiencies causing higher volumes of rejected declarations.

To address these root causes effectively requires identification through further data collection analysis beyond what's provided here involving detailed logs of system operations, employee feedback sessions regarding understanding of requirements before submission/approval/rejection process(es), and regular audits of the system used for handling such processes.

This insight can be extended into solutions focused on enhancing clarity in communication guidelines prior submissions, ensuring timely updates via notifications, regular system maintenance to prevent technical flaws impacting operations workflows efficiency across all stages involved.

Please note these are general considerations that require data specific analysis to be valid within this context
