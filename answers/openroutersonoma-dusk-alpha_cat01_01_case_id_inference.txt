### Inferred Case Groupings

Based on the event attributes, I inferred the case groupings by analyzing patterns such as:
- **Patient demographics**: Exact matches in `patient_age` and `patient_gender` across events indicate the same patient.
- **Timestamp proximity and sequence**: Events for the same patient are logically sequential (e.g., registration followed by triage, consultation, treatment, discharge) and occur in close temporal proximity (within minutes to hours, without large gaps that would suggest a new case).
- **Activity flow**: Standard hospital process flows (e.g., ER path: register  triage  consultation  tests  discharge; Surgery path: register  consultation  preparation  surgery  recovery  discharge).
- **Department consistency**: Events stay within the same department (ER or Surgery) for a given case, except for inter-departmental tests (e.g., Radiology or Lab).
- **Resource and additional info**: Consistent doctors/nurses (e.g., Dr. Smith for ER cases) and linked details (e.g., triage codes or diagnoses tying back to the same patient).

This results in **3 distinct cases**, each representing a unique patient journey. No events appear to cross cases, and all events are accounted for. Below, I list the cases with their grouped events, including a brief rationale for each grouping.

#### Case 1: ER Patient with Hairline Fracture (45-year-old Male, Private Insurance)
- **Events**: 1, 4, 7, 13 (wait, no—event 13 is surgery for the 28M; correction: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15)
- **Patient Profile**: Age 45, Gender M, Department ER, Insurance private.
- **Sequence Summary**:
  1. Register patient (08:05:13)  Initial ER registration.
  4. Initial triage (08:10:50, triage_code=3)  Follows immediately after registration.
  7. X-ray imaging (08:15:42, body_part=left_leg)  Diagnostic step post-triage.
  12. Doctor consultation (08:23:10, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)  Diagnosis based on X-ray.
  15. Patient discharged (08:30:05, followup=outpatient_clinic)  Logical ER discharge after treatment.
- **Rationale**: Tight timeline (~25 min from reg to discharge). All events share exact demographics and ER department. Logical ER flow for injury (triage  imaging  diagnosis  discharge). No overlap with other patients.

#### Case 2: ER Patient with Minor Infection (62-year-old Female, Public Insurance)
- **Events**: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Patient Profile**: Age 62, Gender F, Department ER, Insurance public.
- **Sequence Summary**:
  2. Register patient (08:07:02)  Initial ER registration.
  5. Initial triage (08:12:29, triage_code=2)  Shortly after registration (higher priority code=2 suggests urgency).
  8. Lab test requested (08:16:10, test_type=blood_panel)  Ordered post-triage by Dr. Smith.
  10. Lab test completed (08:20:27, results=normal_levels)  Quick lab turnaround.
  11. Doctor consultation (08:22:54, diagnosis=minor_infection)  Follows lab results, by same Dr. Smith.
  14. Prescription created (08:27:00, medication=antibiotics)  Treatment step post-diagnosis.
  17. Patient discharged (08:35:29, followup=pharmacy_pickup)  ER discharge after prescription.
- **Rationale**: Events span ~28 min, all in ER with exact demographics. Consistent involvement of Dr. Smith and Nurse Mark. Standard infection workflow (triage  lab  diagnosis  meds  discharge). Timestamps interleave with Case 1 but don't overlap logically.

#### Case 3: Scheduled Surgery Patient (28-year-old Male, Private Insurance)
- **Events**: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
- **Patient Profile**: Age 28, Gender M, Department Surgery, Insurance private.
- **Sequence Summary**:
  3. Register patient (08:07:15)  Surgery department registration (scheduled, not ER).
  6. Doctor consultation (08:13:00, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)  Pre-op consult by Dr. Lee.
  9. Surgery preparation (08:16:45, prep_type=general_anesthesia)  Prep follows consult.
  13. Surgery performed (08:25:19, procedure=arthroscopy)  Main procedure by Dr. Lee.
  16. Recovery room (08:31:37, condition=stable)  Immediate post-op monitoring.
  18. Patient discharged (08:40:13, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)  Discharge after recovery.
- **Rationale**: Events span ~33 min, all in Surgery with exact demographics. Consistent Dr. Lee involvement. Clear elective surgery flow (register  consult  prep  surgery  recovery  discharge). Distinct from ER cases by department and scheduled nature (knee-related details align). Timestamps interleave but follow independent sequence.
