From the provided information, determining which attributes are sensitive in terms of fairness involves understanding whether these attributes can be used to discriminate against certain groups or individuals, especially concerning protected characteristics such as gender, ethnic origin, age, or financial status.

Based on the attributes listed, the most likely sensitive attributes are:

1. **Case: German Speaking**: This attribute could potentially be used to identify individuals who may be at a disadvantage in terms of language proficiency if the process is not designed to accommodate non-German speaking applicants.

2. **Case: Citizen Status**: While "Case: Citizen" is listed and is binary (True/False), it does not provide enough context to determine if it is sensitive. However, if a distinction between citizens and non-citizens exists and is significant, it could be considered sensitive.

3. **Resource**: The resource responsible for handling the loan application could potentially be a sensitive attribute. Different resources (Loan Officers, Systems) might have varying levels of discriminatory practices or varying levels of fairness in their handling of applications.

4. **Concept: Name (activity or resource)**: This could also be sensitive, especially in the context of discrimination based on the name or the identity of the person involved in the process.

5. **Start Timestamp and Time**: These attributes are time-related and might have implications regarding the timing of decisions and processes, but they are less directly linked to individual characteristics and more to systemic or procedural fairness.

6. **Time: timestamp**: This is similar to the start timestamp and relates more to process timing rather than individual characteristics.

### Potential Sensitivity Analysis:

- **Case: German Speaking**: If language proficiency is a critical factor but not equally supported across the board, it could create a fairness issue.
- **Case: Citizen Status**: If citizenship status affects loan approvals, it could be a significant fairness concern.
- **Resource**: The allocation of different resources might introduce bias if there are disparities in how different resources (based on their identity, preference, or practices) handle loan applications.
- **Activity (concept:name)**: The specific activities or resources involved might have varying levels of fairness if there are biases in how they operate.

### Conclusion:
The potentially sensitive attributes for fairness in this context are:

- **Case: German Speaking**
- **Case: Citizen Status**
- **Resource**
- **Concept: Name (activity/resource)**

To ensure fairness, it's important to consider the distribution and impact of these attributes on loan application outcomes and to implement measures to mitigate any potential biases.
