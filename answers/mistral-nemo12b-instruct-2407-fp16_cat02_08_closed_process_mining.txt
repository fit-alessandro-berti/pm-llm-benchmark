**Opposite Concepts:**

1. **Manual Process Documentation** (vs. *Automated Process Discovery*) - Instead of automatically learning processes from event data, this involves human experts manually documenting their understanding of the process steps and flows.

2. **Descriptive Analysis** (vs. *Predictive Monitoring*) - Rather than predicting future behavior or identifying anomalies, descriptive analysis focuses on summarizing historical data to understand what has happened in the past.

3. **Top-down Design** (vs. *Bottom-up Discovery*) - Top-down design starts with a high-level view and breaks it down into smaller components, while bottom-up discovery aggregates small units to form a larger picture.

4. **Process Static Analysis** (vs. *Process Simulation*) - Instead of simulating process dynamics to understand its behavior, static analysis involves examining the process model without considering time or resource allocation.

5. **Process Inefficiency Identification** (vs. *Process Efficiency*) - While process efficiency focuses on identifying ways to improve performance, inefficiency identification aims to find issues causing delays or suboptimal outcomes.

6. **Post-hoc Analysis** (vs. *Real-time Monitoring*) - Post-hoc analysis involves examining data after it has been collected and stored, rather than monitoring events as they occur in real-time.

**More General Concepts:**

1. **Process Intelligence** (more general than *Automated Process Discovery*) - This encompasses all techniques used to gain insights into how processes behave, including but not limited to automated discovery.

2. **Proactive Management** (more general than *Predictive Monitoring*) - Proactive management involves anticipating future needs or issues and taking action accordingly, which could include predictive monitoring as a tool.

3. **Data-Driven Process Improvement** (more general than *Bottom-up Discovery*) - This approach uses data to identify improvement opportunities in processes, with bottom-up discovery being one way to obtain such insights.

4. **Process Analysis** (more general than *Process Simulation*) - Process analysis is the broader field that encompasses all methods used to examine and understand how a process works, including simulation as one technique.

5. **Process Performance Management** (more general than *Process Efficiency*) - This involves managing processes to achieve desired outcomes, which could include improving efficiency but also other performance aspects like quality or flexibility.

6. **Continuous Monitoring** (more general than *Real-time Monitoring*) - While real-time monitoring focuses on immediate actions based on current events, continuous monitoring encompasses all forms of ongoing observation and assessment of process behavior over time.
