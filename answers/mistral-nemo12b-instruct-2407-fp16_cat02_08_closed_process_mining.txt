Sure, here are the opposites and more general concepts for each process mining term:

1. **Automated Process Discovery**
   - *Opposite*: Manual Process Modeling (requiring human effort to create process models)
   - *More General*: Process Mining (encompassing automated discovery, conformance checking, and extension)

2. **Predictive Monitoring**
   - *Opposite*: Descriptive Monitoring (only providing facts about the past)
   - *More General*: Advanced Analytics in Process Mining (including predictive, prescriptive, and diagnostic aspects)

3. **Bottom-up Discovery**
   - *Opposite*: Top-down Modeling (starting with a high-level view and gradually adding details)
   - *More General*: Data-driven Process Mining (using data to drive the mining process, regardless of the starting perspective)

4. **Process Simulation**
   - *Opposite*: Real-world Execution (the actual running of processes without simulation)
   - *More General*: In-silico Experimentation (performing experiments in a digital environment to understand and predict behavior)

5. **Process Efficiency**
   - *Opposite*: Process Inefficiency (poor performance or wastefulness in processes)
   - *More General*: Process Performance (encompassing efficiency, effectiveness, and other aspects of process quality)

6. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - *Opposite*: Historical Analysis (looking at data after it has been collected)
   - *More General*: Live Process Analytics (monitoring processes as they happen, in real or near-real time)
