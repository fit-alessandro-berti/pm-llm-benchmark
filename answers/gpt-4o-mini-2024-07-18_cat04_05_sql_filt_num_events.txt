Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task of filtering out cases with more than six events and returning only the events from cases that have six or fewer events.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inner Query**: 
   - The inner query groups the `event_log` by `case_id` and counts the number of events for each case using `COUNT(*)`.
   - The `HAVING` clause filters these groups to include only those where the count of events is six or fewer.

2. **Outer Query**:
   - The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table.
   - It uses a `WHERE` clause to filter the events, retaining only those events whose `case_id` is in the set of `case_id`s returned by the inner query.

This efficiently retrieves only the necessary events from cases that meet the specified criteria.
