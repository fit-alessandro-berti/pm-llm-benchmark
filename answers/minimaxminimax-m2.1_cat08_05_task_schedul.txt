# Data-Driven Scheduling Optimization for Precision Parts Inc.: A Process Mining-Enhanced Approach

## Executive Summary

Precision Parts Inc. faces a classic challenge in high-mix, low-volume manufacturing: the complexity of job shop scheduling exceeds the capabilities of simple dispatching rules. The company's MES generates rich event logs that, when analyzed through advanced process mining techniques, reveal the actual dynamics of job flows, resource interactions, and scheduling inefficiencies. This analysis demonstrates how transforming historical event data into actionable insights enables the design of sophisticated, adaptive scheduling strategies that directly address the diagnosed pathologies of tardiness, excessive WIP, unpredictable lead times, and inefficient resource utilization.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### 1.1 Reconstructing the Actual Process Reality through Process Mining

The foundation of any improvement initiative lies in developing an accurate understanding of the current state. Process mining provides the methodological framework to transform Precision Parts Inc.'s MES event logs into a comprehensive model of actual shop floor operations. Unlike traditional manufacturing analytics that rely on aggregated statistics, process mining operates at the event level, preserving the temporal relationships, resource dependencies, and sequential patterns that define real-world scheduling performance.

The reconstruction process begins with converting the MES event log into a standard process mining format, where each event represents a state change in a job's lifecycle. The event snippet provided reveals the granularity available: timestamps capture activities at the sub-minute level, case IDs track individual jobs across their entire routing, resource IDs identify specific machines and operators, and additional attributes capture priority changes, setup requirements, and planned versus actual durations. This richness enables multiple analytical perspectives on the same underlying reality.

Process discovery algorithms such as the Inductive Miner or Heuristic Miner would be applied to construct a process model representing the actual flow of jobs through the facility. Unlike the planned routing documents that assume idealized flows, the discovered model captures the reality of rework loops, unexpected transfers between alternative machines, and the actual sequences in which different job types visit different workstations. The divergence between planned and discovered processes immediately highlights scheduling inefficiencies: jobs that take unexpected routes indicate downstream resource starvation, while activities that appear in the log but not in planned routings suggest unrecorded workarounds adopted by operators to cope with scheduling problems.

Social network analysis applied to the resource perspective reveals collaboration patterns and hand-off dynamics between workstations. By analyzing which machines frequently process jobs in sequence, we can identify natural job families and potential for family-based scheduling approaches. The analysis of operator interactions uncovers knowledge clusters and potential single points of failure where specific operators possess unique skills for particular machine-task combinations.

### 1.2 Quantifying Temporal Performance Metrics

The MES logs contain the raw material for computing comprehensive temporal metrics that characterize scheduling performance. Job flow time, defined as the elapsed time from job release to completion, represents the customer-relevant measure of lead time. By computing flow time distributions for different job types, customer segments, or order priorities, we establish baseline performance levels and identify which job categories suffer most from excessive lead times. The comparison between planned and actual flow times reveals the accuracy of quoted lead times and the magnitude of systematic over- or under-estimation.

Makespan analysis at the job level aggregates the total processing time across all operations, but the real insight comes from decomposing makespan into its constituent components: actual processing time, setup time, queue time, and move time. The event log's distinction between planned and actual task durations enables calculation of processing time variance, distinguishing inherent process variability from scheduling-induced delays. Jobs exhibiting systematically longer actual processing times than planned suggest estimation biases that could be corrected using the historical data.

Queue time analysis focuses on the intervals between task completion and subsequent task start, captured in the log as the duration between "Queue Entry" and "Task Start" events. Aggregate queue time statistics identify workstations with systematic capacity constraints, while job-level queue time analysis reveals whether certain job types or priorities experience disproportionate waiting. The temporal distribution of queue times—captured at each workstation for each job type—provides the data necessary for queueing network models that predict the impact of load changes on future performance.

### 1.3 Resource Utilization and Setup Time Analysis

Resource utilization metrics transform the event log into a picture of asset efficiency. For each machine, utilization decomposes into productive time (actual processing), setup time (the interval between "Setup Start" and "Setup End"), idle time (available but not processing), and unavailable time (breakdowns, maintenance). The event log explicitly captures setup activities through the "Setup Start" and "Setup End" events, enabling precise quantification of setup time as a proportion of total machine time.

Sequence-dependent setup time analysis represents one of the most valuable applications of process mining for Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling problem. The event log records not just setup duration but also the previous job processed on each machine through the "Previous job" note. By extracting all setup sequences for each machine and correlating setup duration with the identity or attributes of the preceding job, we can construct a setup transition matrix. This matrix reveals which job transitions incur minimal setups (representing similarity in required configurations) and which incur lengthy setups (indicating substantial reconfiguration needs). Machines with high setup-to-processing time ratios represent prime candidates for setup optimization strategies.

The analysis extends to operator utilization, identifying skilled operators as potential constraints and revealing patterns in how operator availability affects task scheduling. Correlating operator assignment with task duration and quality metrics provides insights into skill-based routing opportunities and training needs.

### 1.4 Schedule Adherence and Disruption Impact Analysis

Tardiness measurement requires linking each job's completion time to its due date, available in the event log attributes. Average tardiness, maximum tardiness, and the proportion of late jobs provide summary metrics, but richer insights come from analyzing tardiness patterns. Does tardiness concentrate at particular workstations? Do certain job types exhibit chronic lateness? Do late jobs share common characteristics in their routing sequences? Variant analysis comparing on-time and late job variants—their sequences of activities, resources used, and processing durations—identifies the root causes of missed due dates.

Disruption impact analysis leverages the resource event types in the log. Breakdown events like the MILL-02 breakdown at 2025-04-21 11:05:15 create cascading effects that propagate through the schedule. By correlating breakdown events with subsequent job delays, we quantify the disruption impact factor for each machine. Priority changes, such as the JOB-7005 priority elevation at 2025-04-21 11:30:00, reveal how urgent job insertion affects existing schedules. The analysis traces how high-priority interruptions increase queue times and delays for displaced jobs, providing the data necessary to evaluate alternative disruption response strategies.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### 2.1 Identifying and Characterizing Bottleneck Resources

Bottleneck identification through process mining moves beyond simple utilization averages to capture the dynamic nature of capacity constraints. The activity frequency statistics from process discovery naturally highlight work centers that appear in many job instances, but bottleneck analysis requires distinguishing between high frequency (many jobs passing through) and high load (substantial time consumed per visit). The decomposition of utilization into productive, setup, and idle components enables identification of bottlenecks through multiple indicators: utilization levels exceeding 85%, systematic queue buildup, and high wait times relative to processing times.

The critical insight from bottleneck analysis concerns not just identification but quantification of bottleneck impact on overall throughput. By analyzing the correlation between bottleneck machine availability and job completion rates, we establish the bottleneck's constraint strength. Jobs that pass through identified bottlenecks should exhibit systematically longer flow times than similar jobs avoiding the bottleneck, confirming its systemic impact. The temporal pattern of bottleneck saturation—identifying peak utilization periods and the jobs affected—informs the design of load-leveling strategies.

### 2.2 Evidence of Poor Task Prioritization

The current scheduling approach mixing First-Come-First-Served with Earliest Due Date rules creates predictable pathologies that process mining can detect and quantify. Priority inversion occurs when an older job with an earlier due date blocks processing of a newer, higher-priority job, or when an urgent job arrives after a lower-priority job has begun processing. By tracing job sequences through workstations and correlating priority levels with queue waiting times, we can identify instances where priority rules failed to protect time-sensitive jobs.

Conformance analysis comparing actual job sequences against theoretically optimal sequences based on priority rules reveals the magnitude of rule violations and their causes. When jobs deviate from priority-based sequences, the event log captures the actual sequencing logic employed, which may reflect operator preferences, setup minimization considerations, or responses to unexpected events. Quantifying the gap between intended and actual prioritization illuminates the practical limitations of the current dispatching approach.

The analysis of near-due-date jobs—those with due dates approaching or passed at the time of scheduling decisions—reveals whether the current rules adequately protect jobs at risk of tardiness. If jobs within 24 hours of their due dates consistently experience delays at certain workstations, the prioritization logic fails to provide sufficient protection for time-critical work.

### 2.3 Suboptimal Sequencing and Setup Time Inefficiencies

The sequence-dependent setup times inherent in Precision Parts Inc.'s operations create opportunities for significant efficiency gains through intelligent sequencing. The process mining analysis of historical setup transitions reveals whether the current dispatching rules consider setup compatibility or sequence jobs arbitrarily. If machines frequently transition between job types requiring lengthy setups, with no apparent pattern minimizing transition times, the scheduling approach ignores a substantial optimization opportunity.

Variant analysis comparing similar jobs processed under different sequence conditions quantifies the setup time premium paid for suboptimal sequencing. Jobs processed after a dissimilar predecessor incur higher setup times than those following similar jobs; aggregating these premiums across all jobs reveals the total efficiency loss from sequence-agnostic dispatching. The analysis can identify specific transition pairs that consistently generate excessive setups, representing low-hanging fruit for optimization.

### 2.4 Starvation, Contention, and WIP Dynamics

Downstream resource starvation occurs when upstream scheduling decisions create uneven work releases that leave downstream machines starved for input or overwhelmed with WIP. Process mining enables reconstruction of the complete job flow, revealing temporal correlations between upstream completions and downstream queue lengths. If certain workstation pairs exhibit systematic patterns where downstream idle time follows upstream processing bursts, the scheduling approach fails to balance the workflow.

Resource contention analysis identifies periods when multiple jobs compete for the same machine, creating queue buildup and scheduling complexity. The event log's timestamp resolution enables identification of contention hotspots by time of day, day of week, or during specific production campaigns. Understanding contention patterns informs decisions about job release timing, batch sizing, and alternative routing during peak contention periods.

WIP bullwhip analysis examines the variability in work-in-progress levels over time. High variability in WIP, with oscillations between excessive inventory and starvation, indicates scheduling policies that amplify disturbances rather than dampening them. The correlation between WIP variability and downstream performance degradation quantifies the cost of unstable workflow.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### 3.1 Limitations of Static Dispatching Rules

The fundamental limitation of Precision Parts Inc.'s current dispatching approach lies in its reduction of a complex multi-constraint optimization problem to simple local rules applied without coordination. First-Come-First-Served ignores job criticality, treating all queued jobs as equally urgent regardless of due dates or downstream impacts. Earliest Due Date provides some protection for time-sensitive jobs but creates new pathologies: jobs with artificially early due dates received preemptive treatment, while the rule provides no consideration for processing time or sequence-dependent setups that affect actual feasibility.

Static rules cannot adapt to changing conditions. When a machine breakdown shifts workload to alternative resources, static rules continue applying the same prioritization logic despite fundamentally altered constraints. When an urgent job insertion disrupts existing sequences, the rules provide no framework for intelligent resequencing that minimizes total impact. The event log reveals the accumulated consequences of these limitations: jobs that became tardy not because of inherent processing constraints but because scheduling failed to anticipate and respond to predictable dynamics.

Process mining provides evidence for these limitations by demonstrating the gap between schedule reality and optimal performance. The comparison between actual job sequences and sequences generated by alternative dispatching rules simulated on historical data reveals the performance premium paid for rule-based simplicity. If advanced rules consistently outperform current approaches on historical traces, the case for replacing static dispatching becomes quantitative rather than merely theoretical.

### 3.2 Visibility, Estimation, and Coordination Deficits

The absence of real-time visibility into shop floor status forces scheduling decisions based on outdated or aggregated information. When a workstation reports its queue length, that information may be hours old, missing recent completions, arrivals, or status changes. The MES event log captures the complete temporal evolution of shop floor state, but if this information is not integrated into active scheduling decisions, its analytical value remains unrealized.

Inaccurate task duration estimations undermine all scheduling calculations. If planned durations systematically underestimate actual processing times, quoted lead times become promises the schedule cannot keep. The comparison between planned and actual durations in the event log reveals estimation biases: systematic underestimation for certain operations, operator-specific variations, or complexity-related factors not captured in current estimation models. These biases propagate through the schedule, creating systematic tardiness that no dispatching rule can overcome.

Coordination failures between work centers manifest as the starvation and contention patterns identified through process mining. Upstream workstations making local optimization decisions without visibility into downstream constraints create externalities that propagate through the system. The analysis of job transfer patterns between workstations reveals coordination failures: excessive transfer frequencies suggesting unnecessary movements, or inadequate transfers indicating failed handoffs.

### 3.3 Differentiating Scheduling, Capacity, and Variability Issues

A critical contribution of process mining to root cause analysis lies in its ability to distinguish between problems amenable to scheduling improvement and problems requiring capacity investment or inherent process changes. Not all performance limitations respond to better scheduling; some reflect fundamental capacity deficits that no dispatching rule can overcome.

Capacity limitations reveal themselves through systematic congestion that persists regardless of scheduling approach. If bottleneck machines exhibit utilization approaching 100% with persistent queues despite optimal sequencing, capacity expansion represents the appropriate response rather than scheduling optimization. Process mining identifies capacity limitations through the observation that performance degradation continues even when applying ideal scheduling logic to historical traces.

Process variability manifests as unpredictable duration variations, rework, and quality-related disruptions. Even optimal scheduling cannot compensate for inherent process instability. The decomposition of actual duration variance into controllable and uncontrollable components, informed by process mining analysis, distinguishes scheduling problems from process problems. Jobs exhibiting consistent duration patterns across operators and time periods suggest controllable processes where scheduling optimization applies; jobs with high duration variance unexplained by observable factors suggest process instability requiring engineering attention.

The interaction between scheduling, capacity, and variability creates compound effects that process mining can disentangle. High variability at a bottleneck amplifies scheduling difficulties; low utilization at a non-bottleneck may mask coordination failures rather than indicate adequate capacity. The multivariate analysis enabled by event log data supports nuanced diagnosis that simple performance metrics cannot provide.

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy One: Multi-Factor Dynamic Dispatching with Setup Awareness

The first proposed strategy enhances dispatching decisions at each workstation through a weighted scoring function that integrates multiple factors derived from process mining analysis. Rather than applying simple rules sequentially, the approach evaluates all queued jobs against a composite score that captures scheduling relevant attributes simultaneously.

The dispatching score for each queued job incorporates five primary factors, each weighted according to its contribution to overall scheduling performance. The time-based factor captures due date proximity, computed as the ratio of remaining time until due date to estimated remaining processing time; jobs at risk of tardiness receive elevated scores. The setup factor incorporates the estimated sequence-dependent setup time based on the current machine configuration and the preceding job's characteristics, favoring transitions with minimal setup requirements. The priority factor reflects explicit job priority levels while applying diminishing returns to prevent extreme priority inflation. The downstream factor considers the load status of subsequent workstations in the job's routing, avoiding jobs that would create downstream bottlenecks. The wait time factor provides gradual aging for jobs waiting excessively, preventing starvation in favor of newer arrivals.

The weights for these factors derive from historical process mining analysis that correlates factor values with tardiness outcomes. Regression analysis on historical dispatching decisions identifies which factors most strongly predict on-time completion, enabling data-driven weight calibration rather than arbitrary assignment. The weights adapt dynamically as shop floor conditions change, with periodic recalibration based on recent performance.

This strategy directly addresses the diagnosed pathologies of poor task prioritization and suboptimal sequencing. By considering sequence-dependent setup times in the dispatching decision, the approach captures efficiency opportunities that current rules ignore. The downstream load consideration creates coordination across workstations, reducing starvation and contention. The multi-factor integration prevents any single consideration from dominating, creating balanced schedules that balance urgency, efficiency, and fairness.

Implementation requires real-time integration with the MES to access current queue states, job attributes, and machine status. The setup time estimates derive from the historical setup transition matrices constructed through process mining, updated periodically to capture changes in machine characteristics or product mix. Expected impacts include 15-25% reduction in average tardiness, 10-20% reduction in average flow time through setup efficiency gains, and more balanced utilization across workstations.

### 4.2 Strategy Two: Predictive Scheduling with Risk-Adjusted Lead Times

The second strategy shifts from reactive dispatching to proactive schedule generation that anticipates future conditions and builds in buffers where risks are highest. Historical process mining provides the foundation for predictive models that estimate task durations, identify likely disruption sources, and predict bottleneck evolution.

The predictive scheduling engine generates stochastic job schedules rather than deterministic plans. Task duration estimates incorporate not just point predictions but confidence intervals derived from historical duration distributions. The analysis of duration patterns by operator, job complexity, machine condition, and time of day enables nuanced predictions that adapt to context. Jobs scheduled during periods of historically high variability receive larger buffers, while operations performed by skilled operators on stable machines receive tighter estimates.

Disruption prediction draws on the historical analysis of breakdowns and priority changes. Machines with patterns of frequent breakdowns receive schedule protection through alternative routing assignments or expedited processing before predicted failure windows. The temporal patterns of urgent job arrivals inform release timing decisions that minimize disruption to in-progress work.

The schedule optimization algorithm generates multiple scenario realizations using Monte Carlo simulation, evaluating each job's completion time distribution rather than single-point estimates. Robust optimization selects schedules that perform well across scenario ensembles, sacrificing some optimistic performance to reduce downside risk. The output provides not just a schedule but a risk profile indicating the probability of meeting each job's due date.

This strategy addresses the root causes of inaccurate estimations and inadequate disruption response. By embedding historical variability into schedule estimates, the approach produces realistic commitments rather than optimistic projections. The scenario-based planning framework explicitly addresses disruption response, providing predetermined contingency actions rather than requiring real-time crisis decision-making. Expected impacts include 30-40% improvement in quote accuracy, 20-30% reduction in tardiness variability, and reduced customer dissatisfaction from more reliable delivery commitments.

### 4.3 Strategy Three: Bottleneck-Centered Setup Optimization

The third strategy specifically targets the substantial efficiency losses from sequence-dependent setup times, focusing optimization effort where impact is greatest. The process mining analysis of setup patterns identifies bottleneck machines with high setup-to-processing ratios and significant variation in setup times based on job sequence.

The setup optimization approach operates at two levels. At the scheduling level, jobs arriving at bottleneck machines are sequenced to minimize total setup time, accepting potential inefficiencies at non-bottleneck machines to protect bottleneck throughput. This philosophy recognizes that optimizing non-bottlenecks merely creates more work-in-progress waiting at bottlenecks.

At the operational level, the strategy implements intelligent batching that groups similar jobs for consecutive processing, amortizing setup costs across multiple jobs. The process mining analysis of job similarities—based on product family, material type, or required machine configuration—defines the similarity metrics that guide batching decisions. Dynamic batching adjusts group sizes based on current queue composition, creating larger batches when queue diversity is low and smaller batches when urgent jobs require immediate processing.

The strategy incorporates proactive setup preparation that reduces effective setup time. When the scheduler sequences jobs, it communicates upcoming requirements to maintenance and setup crews, enabling parallel preparation of tools, fixtures, and materials. The event log analysis of historical setup activities identifies preparation opportunities that compress the visible setup time recorded in the MES.

Implementation requires coordination between scheduling and execution systems, with setup planning interfaces that communicate pending job sequences and preparation requirements. The optimization engine balances setup efficiency against job flow time, avoiding extreme batching that sacrifices responsiveness for setup reduction. Expected impacts include 25-40% reduction in setup time at bottleneck machines, 10-15% improvement in bottleneck throughput, and corresponding reductions in overall flow time and WIP.

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### 5.1 Discrete-Event Simulation Framework

Before deploying any scheduling strategy in Precision Parts Inc.'s actual operations, discrete-event simulation provides a risk-free environment for rigorous evaluation. The simulation model parameterizes all scheduling-relevant dynamics using data derived from process mining analysis, creating a digital twin of the manufacturing system.

The simulation architecture models each workstation as a server with capacity equal to available machines, processing times drawn from historical distributions, and setup requirements following the transition probabilities observed in the event log. Job arrivals follow patterns extracted from historical release data, including temporal variations by day of week and seasonal effects. Disruption events—breakdowns, priority changes, rush orders—occur according to statistically modeled occurrence processes calibrated to historical frequencies.

Each proposed scheduling strategy translates into simulation dispatching logic that the model executes in response to job arrivals and completion events. The simulation tracks the same KPIs monitored in actual operations: job flow time, tardiness, WIP levels, machine utilization, and setup efficiency. Multiple simulation replications for each strategy provide statistical confidence in performance comparisons.

The experimental design tests strategies under multiple scenarios representing different operating conditions. The baseline scenario replicates current operating conditions, validating that the simulation accurately represents historical performance before testing alternatives. High-load scenarios increase job arrival rates to identify strategy robustness under capacity stress. Disruption scenarios inject elevated breakdown frequencies and urgent job arrivals to test resilience. Sensitivity analyses vary individual parameters to identify critical assumptions and strategy limitations.

The simulation comparison provides quantitative evidence for strategy selection, identifying which approaches offer the greatest improvement potential for Precision Parts Inc.'s specific conditions. The exercise may reveal that the multi-factor dispatching strategy provides substantial benefits under normal conditions but degrades under high disruption, while predictive scheduling maintains more consistent performance across scenarios.

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring and Adaptive Improvement

The implementation of advanced scheduling strategies creates ongoing requirements for performance monitoring and strategy refinement. Process mining continues to play a central role in the operational phase, transforming real-time event streams into scheduling-relevant insights.

The continuous monitoring framework extracts key performance indicators from the live event stream, comparing actual performance against simulation-derived expectations. Significant deviations trigger alerts requiring investigation. If actual tardiness exceeds expected levels, analysis determines whether the deviation reflects strategy execution problems, inaccurate input data, or changing process conditions requiring strategy adjustment.

Drift detection algorithms monitor the stability of relationships that the scheduling strategies depend upon. If setup time patterns diverge from historical distributions used in optimization, the strategy may make suboptimal sequencing decisions. If job arrival patterns shift from historical norms, dispatching weights may require recalibration. The monitoring system detects these drifts automatically and recommends strategy updates.

The adaptive improvement cycle closes the loop between execution and optimization. Scheduling strategy parameters update periodically based on accumulated performance data, with the multi-factor weights recalibrated to reflect recent experience. New process mining discoveries—unexpected job variants, emerging resource patterns, novel disruption types—integrate into the scheduling logic through structured update procedures.

The framework maintains a digital archive of scheduling decisions and outcomes, enabling retrospective analysis of strategy effectiveness. This archive supports process mining for scheduling insight, extending the analytical techniques applied to historical data to the ongoing stream of scheduling decisions and results. The continuous improvement cycle ensures that Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling capability evolves with changing conditions rather than becoming obsolete as operations mature.

## Conclusion

Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling challenges, while severe, respond to systematic analysis and sophisticated response. The MES event logs contain the detailed records necessary to understand current performance, diagnose root causes, and design targeted improvements. Process mining transforms these logs from passive records into active intelligence, revealing the patterns and pathologies that simple metrics obscure.

The three proposed strategies—multi-factor dynamic dispatching, predictive scheduling with risk-adjusted lead times, and bottleneck-centered setup optimization—address different aspects of the diagnosed problems. Together, they provide a comprehensive approach that improves upon current performance through better local decisions, more accurate planning, and targeted efficiency gains where impact is greatest.

The simulation-based evaluation framework enables confident strategy selection by comparing alternatives under controlled conditions before live deployment. The continuous monitoring and adaptation capability ensures that improvements persist as conditions evolve, creating a sustainable competitive advantage in scheduling excellence.

Implementation requires investment in analytical infrastructure and organizational commitment to data-driven decision making, but the potential returns—reduced tardiness, lower WIP, predictable lead times, and improved resource utilization—directly address Precision Parts Inc.'s most pressing operational challenges. The path from current performance to desired performance runs through the systematic application of process mining insight to scheduling strategy design.
