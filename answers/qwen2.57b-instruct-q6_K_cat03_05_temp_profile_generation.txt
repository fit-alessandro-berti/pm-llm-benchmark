Given the complexity of the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics, it is essential to estimate average times and standard deviations for various pairs of activities based on general industry practices and common delays associated with each step. Hereâ€™s a Python dictionary representing a plausible temporal profile:

```python
{
    ('SS', 'OP'): (2.5, 0.5),      # Average time: 2.5 days; Standard Deviation: 0.5 day
    ('OP', 'RC'): (3.0, 1.0),      # Average time: 3.0 days; Standard Deviation: 1.0 day
    ('RC', 'QI'): (1.0, 0.25),     # Average time: 1.0 day; Standard Deviation: 0.25 day
    ('QI', 'CA'): (1.5, 0.75),     # Average time: 1.5 days; Standard Deviation: 0.75 day
    ('CA', 'PT'): (3.0, 1.5),      # Average time: 3.0 days; Standard Deviation: 1.5 days
    ('PT', 'PK'): (2.0, 1.0),      # Average time: 2.0 days; Standard Deviation: 1.0 day
    ('PK', 'WS'): (0.75, 0.375),   # Average time: 0.75 days; Standard Deviation: 0.375 day
    ('WS', 'DT'): (2.0, 1.0),      # Average time: 2.0 days; Standard Deviation: 1.0 day
    ('DT', 'AS'): (4.0, 2.0),      # Average time: 4.0 days; Standard Deviation: 2.0 days

    # More complex pairs that span multiple steps:
    ('SS', 'CA'): (6.5, 2.0),     # From Supplier Selection to Component Assembly
    ('OP', 'PT'): (13.0, 4.5),    # From Order Placement to Product Testing
    ('RC', 'AS'): (7.25, 2.875),  # From Receive Components to After-Sales Support
    ('QI', 'DT'): (9.5, 3.75)     # From Quality Inspection to Distribution
}
```

### Explanation:
- **SS** to **OP**: Supplier selection can take a bit longer due to vetting the supplier, which is around 2.5 days with some variability.
- **OP** to **RC**: Order placement and receiving components involves logistics coordination and can vary significantly.
- **QI** to **CA**: Quality inspection and component assembly are interdependent; delays here can impact both activities.
- **PT** to **PK**: Product testing is a thorough process that could take multiple days, with some variation depending on the complexity of the product.
- **WS** to **DT**: Packaging and storage might have variability in time based on inventory management processes.
- **AS** after **DT**: After-sales support can be requested at any point post-delivery, which could span several weeks.

### Complex Pairs:
- **SS** to **CA**: This pair spans the supplier selection, order placement, receiving components, and quality inspection steps. The average time is around 6.5 days.
- **OP** to **PT**: Order placement to product testing involves receiving, inspecting, assembling, and testing the product, making this a longer process with significant variability.
- **RC** to **AS**: This pair covers receiving components, inspection, assembly, and then moving through testing and packaging steps before reaching after-sales support.
- **QI** to **DT**: Quality inspection to distribution involves testing the product, potential rework or replacement of components, and eventually shipping it out.

This dictionary provides a high-level estimate for each temporal relationship in the supply chain process.
