Here is a high-level segmentation of the event log into inferred activities, followed by the rationale for each label.

Activity A: Idle / Standby
Events: 1–3 and 13–15
Signature: Low temperature (~20–21°C), baseline pressure (1 bar), zero vibration, zero flow, tool at home (0 mm), very low energy.
Rationale: All operational signals are at rest with minimal energy usage, indicating the machine is powered but not processing.

Activity B: Cutting / Machining
Events: 4–6
Signature: Rapid increase in temperature (5058°C), elevated vibration (3038 Hz), steady material flow (5 units/s), tool advancing (510 mm), energy ramping (2.03.0 kWh), slight pressure rise (11.5 bar).
Rationale: Cutting or machining typically shows sustained tool engagement (tool position change), higher vibration from tool–material contact, moderate temperature rise from friction, and consistent material feed.

Activity C: Positioning / Assembly Alignment
Events: 7–8
Signature: Temperature drops from cutting peak to 40°C, pressure increases to 2 bar, low vibration (~10 Hz), reduced material flow (2 units/s), tool holding at 15 mm, moderate energy (2.0 kWh).
Rationale: After cutting, the machine likely repositions parts or aligns components. Lower vibration and flow with higher pressure suggest clamping/fixturing rather than active cutting.

Activity D: Welding / Heat Joining
Event: 9
Signature: Sharp temperature spike to 80°C, high vibration (50 Hz), zero material flow, fixed tool position (15 mm), high energy draw (5.0 kWh), pressure steady at 2 bar.
Rationale: Welding or a brief heat-joining operation creates a pronounced thermal and energy peak with minimal material movement. Clamping pressure is maintained while heat is applied.

Activity E: Cooling / Release
Event: 10
Signature: Temperature drops to 30°C, pressure back to 1 bar, minimal vibration (1 Hz), zero flow, tool still at 15 mm, low energy (1.0 kWh).
Rationale: Immediately after welding, systems cool down and clamps may be released, with low activity and energy consumption.

Activity F: Quality Inspection / Light Handling
Events: 11–12
Signature: Moderate temperature (25°C), baseline pressure (1 bar), low vibration (5 Hz), low but nonzero flow (1 unit/s), tool moves slightly to 20 mm, modest energy (1.5–1.6 kWh).
Rationale: Inspection or measurement steps often show low mechanical activity, slight tool repositioning, and small, steady energy use. The low flow could reflect air jets, sensors, or minor part handling.

Process sequence summary:
Idle (1–3)  Cutting/Machining (4–6)  Positioning/Alignment (7–8)  Welding/Heat Joining (9)  Cooling/Release (10)  Quality Inspection/Light Handling (11–12)  Idle (13–15)

This sequence and the sensor signatures align with a plausible manufacturing workflow transitioning from raw processing to joining and verification.
