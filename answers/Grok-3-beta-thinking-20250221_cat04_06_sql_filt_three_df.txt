<think>
So I have this problem here that involves analyzing an event log stored in a DuckDB table. The table is named event_log and has at least three columns: case_id, activity, and timestamp. I need to write a SQL query to filter out certain cases based on specific conditions and then return all events from the remaining cases.

Let me first understand what exactly is being asked. I need to identify cases that have a specific sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', and then immediately by 'Confirm Order'. Moreover, among these cases, I need to further filter those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, I should exclude these cases from the final result, meaning I want all events from cases that do not have this specific sequence with the timing condition.

Alright, so to break it down:

Find cases where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' occurs in direct succession.
Among those, find cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
Exclude these cases from the final result, meaning I want all events from cases that do not satisfy both conditions above.
First, I need to identify the cases that have the specific sequence in direct succession. Since the events must be in direct succession, that means there are no other events from the same case between them.

One way to approach this is to use window functions to look at the sequence of activities within each case. I can order the events by timestamp within each case and then check for the specific sequence.

Let me think about how to do that. I can use the LEAD or LAG functions to look at the next or previous activities in the sequence.

Wait, actually, since I need to check for a sequence of three activities, I might need to look at the current activity and the next two activities.

Alternatively, I can use ROW_NUMBER or assign some kind of sequence number to each event within a case and then join the table with itself based on consecutive sequence numbers.

Hmm, maybe I can assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp, and then join the table to itself where the row numbers are consecutive.

For example, I can do something like:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH numbered_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT 
    a.case_id
FROM 
    numbered_log a
JOIN 
    numbered_log b ON a.case_id = b.case_id AND a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1
JOIN 
    numbered_log c ON a.case_id = c.case_id AND a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2
WHERE 
    a.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND b.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c.activity = 'Confirm Order'
Wait, actually, in this join, since a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1 and a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2, that would mean c.seq_num = a.seq_num + 2, so it's checking three consecutive events.

Yes, this should give me the cases where these three activities happen in direct succession.

But wait, actually, in the join condition, since a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1 and a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2, that implies b.seq_num = a.seq_num + 1 and c.seq_num = a.seq_num + 2, so yes, it's checking for three consecutive events.

So this query would select the case_ids where there exists at least one set of three consecutive events with the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in that order.

Wait, but actually, in the WHERE clause, it's a.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', b.activity = 'Create Order', and c.activity = 'Confirm Order', and since a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1 and a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2, which means b.seq_num = a.seq_num + 1 and c.seq_num = a.seq_num + 2, so yes, it's checking for the sequence where the first event is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

So this seems correct for identifying the cases that have this sequence.

But wait, I need to be careful because a case might have multiple sequences, but as long as there is at least one such sequence, I need to consider that case.

Actually, in the query above, it will return the case_id for each occurrence of the sequence, so if a case has multiple such sequences, it will appear multiple times, but since I'm only interested in the case_ids, I can use DISTINCT or group by case_id.

Wait, actually, for the next step, I need to check the timing condition for each such sequence.

Wait, the problem says: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

So, it's not just that the case has the sequence, but specifically for that sequence, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Wait, and since a case might have multiple such sequences, I need to check for each sequence whether that condition holds, and if there is at least one sequence in the case where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days, then that case should be excluded.

Wait, actually, re-reading the prompt: "further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

So, it's per sequence. Meaning, for each occurrence of the sequence in a case, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that specific sequence is more than 5 days.

Then, if there is at least one such sequence in the case where this condition holds, the case should be excluded.

Wait, actually, the prompt says: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

Hmm, the phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Does "that sequence" refer to the specific sequence identified, meaning for each sequence, check the time condition, or does it mean that in the case, there exists a sequence where the time condition holds.

Wait, but in the context, since it's saying "further refine the selection to only those where...", it seems that it's selecting cases where there exists at least one sequence that satisfies both the sequence condition and the timing condition.

Moreover, in the excluding part, it says "exclude them from your final result", meaning exclude cases that have at least one such sequence with the timing condition.

So, to clarify: I need to exclude cases that have at least one occurrence of the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and for that specific sequence, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

So, for each case, if there is at least one such sequence where the time condition holds, then exclude that case.

Otherwise, include all events from that case.

Wait, actually, to be precise, the prompt says: "After identifying such cases, exclude them from your final result. You should only return events from cases that do not meet the above criteria."

So, the criteria are: having the sequence with the timing condition.

Therefore, I need to find cases where there exists at least one sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and for that sequence, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Then, exclude those cases, meaning return all events from cases that do not have any such sequence satisfying both conditions.

Alternatively, include cases where either they do not have the sequence at all, or if they have the sequence, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is not more than 5 days for all such sequences.

Wait, more precisely, since it's "do not meet the above criteria", meaning do not have any sequence where both the sequence exists and the time condition holds.

So, in other words, include cases where for all occurrences of the sequence, the time condition does not hold, or there is no such sequence.

But actually, since the condition is to exclude cases that have at least one sequence with the time condition, it's equivalent to including cases where there is no sequence with the time condition.

Meaning, cases where either there is no such sequence, or for all such sequences, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is 5 days or less.

But in terms of implementation, it's easier to first find the cases that need to be excluded, i.e., cases that have at least one sequence where the sequence exists and the time condition holds, and then exclude those cases from the final result.

So, let's try to write a query to find those cases to exclude.

First, I need to find the sequences where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and for those sequences, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

So, extending the previous query, I can select the case_ids where there exists such a sequence with the time condition.

To do that, I need to access the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence.

So, in the previous join, I have a, b, c corresponding to the three events.

So, a is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', b is 'Create Order', c is 'Confirm Order', and they are consecutive.

Then, I can calculate the time difference between c.timestamp and b.timestamp.

Wait, actually, since the events are ordered by timestamp, and they are consecutive, I can assume that c.timestamp > b.timestamp, but to be safe, I should use the difference.

In DuckDB, I can use theDATEDIFF function to calculate the difference in days.

Wait, actually, in SQL, the standard way is to subtract the timestamps and check the interval.

But in DuckDB, which is based on SQLite, I think it supports date functions.

Wait, actually, DuckDB has its own date functions.

Looking it up quickly, DuckDB supports various date and time functions, including AGE, DATEDIFF, etc.

Wait, actually, for timestamps, I can use the - operator to get the interval, and then extract the days.

But perhaps the easiest way is to use DATEDIFF with 'day' as the unit.

Wait, in DuckDB, the DATEDIFF function can be used like DATEDIFF('day', start_date, end_date), which returns the number of days between start_date and end_date.

So, in this case, I can use DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5.

Wait, actually, since b is 'Create Order' and c is 'Confirm Order', and assuming c.timestamp > b.timestamp, then DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) should give the number of days between them.

But to be precise, DATEDIFF('day', date1, date2) in DuckDB returns the number of days from date1 to date2, so if date2 > date1, it's positive.

So, yes, I can use DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5 to check if the time elapsed is more than 5 days.

Therefore, I can modify the previous query to:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH numbered_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT 
    a.case_id
FROM 
    numbered_log a
JOIN 
    numbered_log b ON a.case_id = b.case_id AND a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1
JOIN 
    numbered_log c ON a.case_id = c.case_id AND a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2
WHERE 
    a.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND b.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND c.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5
This should give me the distinct case_ids that have at least one sequence where the three activities are in direct succession and the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Wait, actually, in the join condition, since a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1 and a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2, but wait, actually, for c, since c.seq_num = a.seq_num + 2, because a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2 implies c.seq_num = a.seq_num + 2, assuming seq_num is increasing.

Wait, actually, in the ROW_NUMBER(), I ordered by timestamp, so seq_num increases with time.

Therefore, for three consecutive events, their seq_num would be, say, 1,2,3, so for a.seq_num=1, b.seq_num=2, c.seq_num=3, and since a.seq_num = b.seq_num -1 (1=2-1), and a.seq_num = c.seq_num -2 (1=3-2), yes, it holds.

Alternatively, I could write it as b.seq_num = a.seq_num +1 and c.seq_num = a.seq_num +2.

But the way I have it is fine.

So, this query should give me the case_ids to exclude.

Then, to get the final result, I need to select all events from event_log where the case_id is not in this list.

So, I can use a NOT IN subquery or a LEFT JOIN with a filter.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    -- the subquery above
)
But to make it more efficient, especially since DuckDB might optimize it better, I can use a LEFT JOIN with a condition.

Alternatively, since it's a subquery, it should be fine.

Wait, another way is to use a CTE to find the cases to exclude and then filter.

So, let's put it all together.

First, I'll define the CTE for the numbered log, then find the cases to exclude, and then select from event_log where case_id not in those cases.

Wait, but actually, since the subquery already gives distinct case_ids, I can directly use it in the NOT IN clause.

Alternatively, to avoid repeating the CTE, I can define another CTE for the cases to exclude.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH numbered_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT a.case_id
    FROM 
        numbered_log a
    JOIN 
        numbered_log b ON a.case_id = b.case_id AND a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1
    JOIN 
        numbered_log c ON a.case_id = c.case_id AND a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2
    WHERE 
        a.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND b.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND c.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
This should work.

Wait, but actually, in DuckDB, since it's based on SQLite, and SQLite supports subqueries, this should be fine.

Alternatively, I can use a LEFT JOIN with a filter.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH numbered_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT a.case_id
    FROM 
        numbered_log a
    JOIN 
        numbered_log b ON a.case_id = b.case_id AND a.seq_num = b.seq_num - 1
    JOIN 
        numbered_log c ON a.case_id = c.case_id AND a.seq_num = c.seq_num - 2
    WHERE 
        a.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND b.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND c.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND DATEDIFF('day', b.timestamp, c.timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
LEFT JOIN cases_to_exclude cte ON el.case_id = cte.case_id
WHERE cte.case_id IS NULL
This is another way, using a LEFT JOIN and filtering where the join didn't match, meaning the case_id is not in cases_to_exclude.

Either way should work.

I think the NOT IN version is simpler and should be efficient enough.

Wait, but actually, in some SQL databases, NOT IN can be less efficient, but since DuckDB is optimized, it should be fine.

Alternatively, I can use NOT EXISTS, which might be better.

For example:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT *
FROM event_log el
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM cases_to_exclude cte
    WHERE el.case_id = cte.case_id
)
But since cases_to_exclude is derived from the same table, perhaps it's better to integrate it.

Wait, actually, another way to think about it is to flag the cases that need to be excluded and then filter.

But I think the way I have it is acceptable.

Wait, one thing to consider: in the subquery, I'm using ROW_NUMBER() to assign sequence numbers, but I need to ensure that the timestamps are unique within each case, or at least, the ordering is correct.

In event logs, it's possible to have multiple events at the same timestamp, but typically, the log should have a total order.

If there are ties in timestamps, the ROW_NUMBER() might not be deterministic, but in practice, for this problem, as long as the sequence is correct, it should be fine.

Alternatively, if the log has an event_id or some other ordering, I could use that, but since the problem specifies to order by timestamp, I'll assume that's sufficient.

Also, I need to make sure that the timestamp is of a datetime type that DuckDB can handle for DATEDIFF.

Assuming that the timestamp column is of type TIMESTAMP or similar, it should work.

Another thing to consider is whether the sequence can overlap.

For example, if a case has four events: A -> B -> C -> D, where A='Approve Purchase Requisition', B='Create Order', C='Confirm Order', D='Something else', then the sequence A->B->C satisfies the condition, and if the time between B and C is more than 5 days, the case should be excluded.

Similarly, if there is another sequence later, but as long as there is at least one such sequence with the time condition, the case is excluded.

So, the query I have should capture that, since it checks for the existence of at least one such sequence.

Wait, actually, in the subquery, since I'm selecting DISTINCT case_id, and the WHERE condition checks for the sequence and the time condition, yes, it will include the case if there is at least one such sequence.

So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I could write it without using ROW_NUMBER(), perhaps using self-joins with conditions on timestamps, but using ROW_NUMBER() is more straightforward and efficient.

Another way is to use LAG or LEAD functions to check the previous and next activities, but since I need to check three consecutive activities, it might be more complicated.

For example, I could use LEAD to get the next two activities and their timestamps, and then filter based on that.

Actually, that might be a cleaner way.

Let me try to think about it.

I can do something like:

sql
Wrap
Copy
SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
FROM event_log
Then, I can filter where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Create Order' AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5

Wait, actually, since 'Create Order' is the next activity, and 'Confirm Order' is the next next activity, then the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp.

So, yes, I can do:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH extended_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM extended_log
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
This would give me the case_ids where there exists at least one event where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', the next next is 'Confirm Order', and the time between the next and next next is more than 5 days.

Wait, and since it's partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp, the LEAD function will get the next activities in sequence.

So, this seems even better, as it directly checks the sequence without needing multiple joins.

Yes, this is a more efficient and cleaner way.

Then, I can use this to find the cases to exclude.

So, updating the query:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH extended_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM extended_log
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
This should achieve the desired result.

Alternatively, to make it more concise, I can combine the CTEs.

But for clarity, keeping them separate is fine.

Wait, actually, since I only need the case_ids to exclude, I don't necessarily need to select all the columns in extended_log, but since I'm using window functions, it's okay.

Moreover, in terms of performance, DuckDB should handle it efficiently.

Another thing to consider is that if there are cases with fewer than three events, the LEAD functions will return NULL, and the WHERE conditions will not be satisfied, which is correct, as those cases do not have the sequence.

Similarly, if the sequence is not present, or if the time condition is not met, they won't be selected in cases_to_exclude.

Therefore, this seems correct.

So, to summarize, the final query is:

sql
Wrap
Copy
WITH extended_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM extended_log
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
Wait, but actually, in the final SELECT, I should make sure to include all events from the cases that are not in cases_to_exclude.

Yes, that's what it does.

Alternatively, to make it even more efficient, perhaps I can use a single query with window functions, but I think this is clear enough.

One more thing: in the problem statement, it says "exclude them from your final result", meaning exclude the cases that meet the criteria, and return all events from the other cases.

So, yes, this query should do that.

I think this should be the correct solution.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to analyze an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, which contains at least three columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to write a SQL query that filters out certain cases based on specific conditions and returns all events from the remaining cases. Here's the complete solution:

### Problem Breakdown

We need to:
1. **Identify cases with a specific sequence**: Find cases where the activities 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' occur in direct succession, meaning they are consecutive events within the case with no other events in between.
2. **Apply a timing condition**: Among those cases, select only those where, for at least one occurrence of this sequence, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. **Exclude these cases**: Return all events from cases that do not satisfy both the sequence and timing conditions above.

### Solution Approach

To achieve this, we'll use DuckDB SQL with window functions to detect the sequence and calculate time differences, then filter accordingly. Here's the query:

```sql
WITH extended_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM extended_log
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude);
```

### How the Query Works

#### Step 1: Extend the Event Log with Next Activities and Timestamps
- **CTE**: `extended_log`
- **Purpose**: For each event, we need to access the next two activities and their timestamps within the same case to check for the sequence.
- **Method**: Use the `LEAD` window function:
  - `LEAD(activity, 1)` gets the next activity.
  - `LEAD(activity, 2)` gets the activity after that.
  - `LEAD(timestamp, 1)` and `LEAD(timestamp, 2)` get the corresponding timestamps.
- **Partitioning**: `PARTITION BY case_id` ensures we look at sequences within each case.
- **Ordering**: `ORDER BY timestamp` ensures events are processed in chronological order, so the "next" activities are the subsequent events in time.

This creates a view where each row includes the current event's details plus the details of the next two events (if they exist).

#### Step 2: Identify Cases to Exclude
- **CTE**: `cases_to_exclude`
- **Purpose**: Find cases that have at least one occurrence of the specified sequence with the timing condition.
- **Conditions**:
  - `activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`: The current event is the start of the sequence.
  - `next_activity = 'Create Order'`: The next event is 'Create Order'.
  - `next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'`: The event after that is 'Confirm Order'.
  - `DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5`: The time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
- **Direct Succession**: Since `LEAD` fetches the immediate next events based on the timestamp order, this ensures no other events occur between them within the case.
- **DISTINCT**: We use `DISTINCT case_id` because a case may have multiple such sequences, but we only need to identify the case once for exclusion.

This CTE results in a list of `case_id`s that meet both the sequence and timing criteria.

#### Step 3: Select All Events from Remaining Cases
- **Main Query**: Selects all columns (`*`) from `event_log`.
- **Filter**: `WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)` excludes all events belonging to cases identified in `cases_to_exclude`.
- **Result**: Returns all events from cases that either:
  - Do not have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, or
  - Have the sequence but the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is 5 days or less in all such occurrences.

### Validation

- **Sequence Detection**: The use of `LEAD` with offsets 1 and 2, ordered by timestamp, correctly identifies three consecutive events.
- **Timing Condition**: `DATEDIFF('day', ...)` computes the day difference between timestamps, and `> 5` ensures more than 5 days.
- **Exclusion**: `NOT IN` ensures that if a case has even one sequence meeting both conditions, all its events are excluded.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Cases with fewer than three events: `LEAD` returns `NULL`, and the `WHERE` conditions fail, so these cases are not excluded (correctly).
  - Ties in timestamps: Assuming timestamps provide a total order (or ties are rare), the ordering is sufficient; otherwise, an additional tiebreaker (e.g., event ID) might be needed, but the problem doesn’t specify this.

### Final Query

```sql
WITH extended_log AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM extended_log
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND DATEDIFF('day', next_timestamp, next_next_timestamp) > 5
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude);
```

This query efficiently and accurately returns all events from cases that do not meet the specified criteria, fulfilling the requirements of the prompt.
