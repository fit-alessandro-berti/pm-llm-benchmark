# Analysis of Order Process Anomalies

Based on the provided event logs and process flow, I've identified several anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the order processing system. Here's my analysis:

## Identified Anomalies

### 1. Out-of-Sequence Activities (Case ID 1002 and 1003)
- **Observation**: In case 1002, "Confirm Shipment" occurs before "Perform Credit Check" and "Validate Stock"
- **Observation**: In case 1003, "Ship Goods" occurs before "Confirm Shipment"
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Process compliance violations
  - System errors allowing out-of-order execution
  - Manual overrides bypassing standard workflow
  - Possible training gaps for staff

### 2. Missing Activities (Case ID 1003)
- **Observation**: "Validate Stock" activity is missing from case 1003
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Process shortcuts being taken
  - System error preventing activity recording
  - Possible inventory management issues

### 3. Premature Payment (Case ID 1004)
- **Observation**: Payment received before invoice is issued and before shipment confirmation
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Prepayment policy violations
  - Possible fraud or error in payment processing
  - System allowing payments without proper order validation

### 4. Early Shipment Attempt (Case ID 1002)
- **Observation**: "Confirm Shipment" occurs just 5 minutes after order registration
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Overly aggressive logistics team
  - System error in shipment scheduling
  - Possible process optimization opportunity

## Investigation Queries

### Query 1: Find all cases with out-of-sequence activities
```sql
WITH expected_sequence AS (
    SELECT 'Register Order' AS activity, 1 AS seq_num UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Perform Credit Check', 2 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Validate Stock', 3 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Confirm Shipment', 4 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Ship Goods', 5 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Issue Invoice', 6 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Receive Payment', 7
),
case_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS actual_seq
    FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT
    c1.case_id,
    c1.activity AS activity1,
    c1.actual_seq AS seq1,
    c2.activity AS activity2,
    c2.actual_seq AS seq2,
    e1.seq_num AS expected_seq1,
    e2.seq_num AS expected_seq2
FROM case_sequences c1
JOIN case_sequences c2 ON c1.case_id = c2.case_id AND c1.actual_seq + 1 = c2.actual_seq
JOIN expected_sequence e1 ON c1.activity = e1.activity
JOIN expected_sequence e2 ON c2.activity = e2.activity
WHERE e1.seq_num + 1 <> e2.seq_num
ORDER BY c1.case_id, c1.actual_seq;
```

### Query 2: Find cases missing expected activities
```sql
WITH expected_activities AS (
    SELECT 'Register Order' AS activity UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Perform Credit Check' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Validate Stock' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Confirm Shipment' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Ship Goods' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Issue Invoice' UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Receive Payment'
),
case_activities AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id, activity
    FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT
    e.activity AS missing_activity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.case_id) AS case_count,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT CAST(c.case_id AS TEXT), ', ') AS affected_cases
FROM expected_activities e
LEFT JOIN case_activities c ON e.activity = c.activity
WHERE c.case_id IS NULL OR
      (e.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
       AND c.case_id NOT IN (
           SELECT DISTINCT case_id
           FROM case_activities
           WHERE activity = 'Register Order'
       ))
GROUP BY e.activity
ORDER BY case_count DESC;
```

### Query 3: Find cases with premature payments
```sql
SELECT
    oel1.case_id,
    oel1.timestamp AS payment_time,
    oel2.timestamp AS invoice_time,
    oel1.timestamp - oel2.timestamp AS time_difference,
    o.order_value,
    oel1.additional_info AS payment_info,
    oel2.additional_info AS invoice_info
FROM order_event_log oel1
JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
JOIN orders o ON oel1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp
ORDER BY time_difference DESC;
```

### Query 4: Analyze resource behavior patterns
```sql
SELECT
    r.resource_id,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oel.case_id) AS cases_handled,
    COUNT(oel.event_id) AS total_events,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT oel.activity, ', ' ORDER BY oel.activity) AS activities_performed,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (LEAD(oel.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.timestamp) - oel.timestamp))) AS avg_time_between_events
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY r.resource_id, r.role, r.department
ORDER BY cases_handled DESC;
```

### Query 5: Find cases with unusually fast or slow processing
```sql
WITH case_durations AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(timestamp) AS start_time,
        MAX(timestamp) AS end_time,
        MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS total_duration,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
activity_durations AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        AVG(timestamp - LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)) AS avg_time_between_events
    FROM order_event_log
    GROUP BY case_id, activity
)
SELECT
    cd.case_id,
    o.order_type,
    o.order_value,
    cd.total_duration,
    cd.event_count,
    ad.activity,
    ad.avg_time_between_events,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY cd.total_duration) AS duration_percentile
FROM case_durations cd
JOIN activity_durations ad ON cd.case_id = ad.case_id
JOIN orders o ON cd.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE cd.total_duration < INTERVAL '1 hour' OR cd.total_duration > INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY duration_percentile;
```

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Process Compliance Audit**: Review all cases with out-of-sequence activities to determine if these were legitimate exceptions or process violations.

2. **System Workflow Review**: Examine the order processing system to identify why it allows activities to occur out of sequence.

3. **Training Assessment**: Evaluate if staff training needs improvement, particularly for logistics and finance teams.

4. **Payment Process Review**: Investigate the payment processing system to understand how payments can be received before invoices are issued.

5. **Resource Performance Analysis**: Examine the behavior of specific resources (like LogisticsMgr_2) who appear to be involved in multiple anomalous cases.

6. **Process Optimization**: Consider whether some of these "anomalies" might actually represent process optimization opportunities (like faster credit checks for certain customers).

The provided SQL queries should help uncover the extent of these issues and identify patterns that might explain their root causes.
