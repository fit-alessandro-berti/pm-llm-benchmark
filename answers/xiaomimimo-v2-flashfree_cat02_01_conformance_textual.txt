Based on the provided normative process description and the event log, here is an analysis of the cases and their adherence to the defined rules.

### 1. Identification of Deviating Cases

The following cases deviate from the normative process flow:
*   **Case 2**
*   **Case 3**
*   **Case 5**

*(Note: Case 1 follows the "sufficient inventory" flow perfectly, and Case 4 follows the "insufficient inventory" flow perfectly.)*

### 2. Explanation of Violations

#### Case 2
*   **Observed Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Normative Expectation:**
    *   The text states: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'"*
    *   It further clarifies: *"'Authorize payment' should only occur after 'Check inventory' and before packaging."*
*   **Violation:** **Activities performed out of order (Illogical Sequence).**
*   **Explanation:** This case violates the required sequence of the "fulfillment" path. The "Package items" activity occurred at 10:00, but "Authorize payment" did not occur until 10:30. According to the normative description, payment must be authorized *before* items are packaged. Packaging items that have not yet been paid for is a deviation from the intended workflow.

#### Case 3
*   **Observed Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Normative Expectation:**
    *   The text explicitly states: *"If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... the process must branch into a cancellation scenario... Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."*
    *   It also warns: *"...shipping after cancellation... would be considered a violation."*
*   **Violation:** **Process Anomaly and Prohibited Activity.**
*   **Explanation:** This case violates the process in two ways:
    1.  **Illogical Sequence:** The case performed "Authorize payment" (usually associated with sufficient inventory) but then proceeded to "Cancel order." While the description allows for interpretation, cancelling a paid order immediately after payment is generally considered a process error or requires a refund handling step (which is absent here).
    2.  **Prohibited Activity:** The most severe violation is the **"Ship order"** activity occurring *after* the **"Cancel order"** activity. The normative text explicitly forbids shipping after cancellation, as the order is no longer valid.

#### Case 5
*   **Observed Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
*   **Normative Expectation:**
    *   The text states: *"Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"*
    *   It further clarifies: *"'Package items' should only occur after authorization and before shipping."*
*   **Violation:** **Missing Mandatory Activity.**
*   **Explanation:** This case skips the "Package items" activity entirely. The normative flow for a fulfilled order is strictly defined as: Authorize Payment  Package items  Ship order. Jumping directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order" bypasses the necessary preparation step, violating the expected workflow constraints.
