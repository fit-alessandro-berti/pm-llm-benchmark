This visualization is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** diagram illustrating the flow of tasks between two main “lanes” or departments: **Logistics** (top lane) and **Warehouse** (bottom lane). Each shape and symbol corresponds to a BPMN element (tasks, gateways, events) that defines how a shipping process moves from start to finish. Here’s a step-by-step rundown:

---

### 1. Lanes (Swimlanes)
- **Logistics (Top Lane):** Responsible for steps like checking resources, selecting a shipping company, and preparing documentation.  
- **Warehouse (Bottom Lane):** Responsible for physical tasks like packaging goods, notifying the customer if there is a delay, and moving the parcel to the pickup area.

BPMN uses these lanes to show which role or department performs each task.

### 2. Process Flow (Sequence of Activities)

1. **One order (Start):** The process presumably begins when an order is placed and received by the Warehouse.

2. **Check if resources & required (Logistics lane):** The Logistics team checks whether any special materials or resources (e.g., special packaging) are needed.

   - **(Sub-checks)**  
     - *Measure necessary?*  
     - *Special handling?*  

   These checks help determine if additional steps or specific shipping methods are required.

3. **Carry shipment method / Get 3 offers from shipping companies (Logistics lane):**  
   - If the package needs special handling or competitive shipping quotes, Logistics gathers offers from shipping providers.
   - Otherwise, they may directly proceed to choose a standard shipping method.

4. **Select logistic company and place order (Logistics lane):** Once they have the necessary shipping information (offers, requirements), they select the shipping company and finalize the order for shipment.

5. **Write package label (Logistics lane):** Logistics generates or writes the label containing destination, handling instructions, and other relevant details.

6. **Fill out shipment paperwork (Warehouse lane):** The Warehouse staff completes any necessary paperwork, which might include customs forms, invoices, or internal shipping documents.

7. **Move package to pickup area (Warehouse lane):** The packaged and labeled goods are physically moved to a designated spot for pickup by the chosen shipping company.

8. **Shipment prepared (End):** Once the package is in the pickup area with all documents completed, the shipment is ready.

### 3. Parallel Activities and Gateways
- **Diamond Shapes (Gateways):** These represent decision points or branching in the process. For instance, one gateway leads to either “Notify customer about delay” (if something is not ready) or continues on to packaging.  
- **Multiple Paths:** Sometimes you see more than one arrow from a gateway, indicating different possible paths based on conditions (e.g., special handling needed or not).

---

### 4. Exceptions or Additional Steps
- **Notify customer about delay (Warehouse lane):** If the Warehouse identifies a delay (e.g., materials not in stock, shipping method not available), they must inform the customer.  
- **Package goods (Warehouse lane):** This is the core task of preparing the physical item for shipment (wrapping, sealing, adding cushioning, etc.).  

Depending on conditions (such as special handling or measuring requirements), certain steps can occur in parallel or in sequence.

### Putting It All Together
Overall, the diagram describes a **shipping fulfillment process** from the moment an order is received to the point where a shipment is fully prepared for pickup. Each step shows who (Logistics or Warehouse) does what, how decisions are made (gateways), and how the process proceeds to completion (the “Shipment prepared” end state).
