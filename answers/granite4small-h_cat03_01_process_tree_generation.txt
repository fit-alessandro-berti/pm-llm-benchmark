To model the described hospital patient management scenario into a single process tree, we need to apply the provided notations and operators carefully. Let's begin by outlining the structure of our ProcessTree according to each step in the complex process description:

1. Start with **Arrival (A)** and proceed to **Registration (RG)** and then **Intake Assessment (IA)**:
```
->( A, ->( RG, IA ) )
```

2. After intake assessment comes an evaluation by the triage team, which is a sequence of two activities: 
   - Triage Interview (**TI**)
   - Triage Classification (**TC**)
```
->( TI, TC )
```

3. This leads us to make an exclusive choice on initial diagnostic tests depending on suspected issues:
   - If **cardiovascular issue**, then Comprehensive ECG (**CE**).
   - Otherwise (non-cardiac suspicion), Full Blood Panel (**FBP**).

We use the XOR operator (X) for this decision making.
```
X( CE, FBP )
```

4. After an initial diagnostic test, we evaluate results and if abnormal, enter a loop that consists of:
   - **Specialist Consultation (SC)** 
   - Then choose between **Targeted Medication (TM)** or **Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT)**
   - Follow up with a **Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT)** which is again an exclusive choice leading to either:
     * Follow-up ECG (**FCE**) if cardiac issues persist
     * Follow-up Blood Analysis (**FBA**) for non-cardiac problems
   
This loop continues until normal results are obtained. For the loop, we use `*` operator.
```
*( SC,
    X( TM, SPT ),
    RDT ) 
```

5. Once normal diagnostic results are confirmed, proceed with true concurrency of:
   - **Advanced Imaging (AI)**
   - **Nutritional Counseling (NC)**

Using the parallel operator (`+`) for these two activities.
```
+( AI, NC )
```

6. Afterward, we must follow a sequence of final steps which include:
   - Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (**FAS**)
   - Detailed Discharge Instructions (**DDI**)

Sequentially arranged using the `->` operator.
```
->( FAS, DDI )
```

7. Lastly, before discharge and process end, there's a concurrency block for administrative procedures which are:
   - **Billing (BL)**
   - **Insurance Claims Processing (ICP)**
   - **Medical Records Finalization (MRF)**

These activities happen in true concurrency using the `+` operator.
```
+( BL, ICP, MRF )
```

Now let's combine all these structures into a comprehensive process tree. Our root will be a parallel operation that starts with Registration and Intake Assessment followed by the subsequent steps of triage, diagnostics, looped treatments if necessary, advanced imaging & nutritional counseling, scheduling & discharge instructions, and finally, administrative tasks.

The full ProcessTree construction in pm4py notation would look something like this:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Activities (leaf nodes)
A = ProcessTree(label="A")
RG = ProcessTree(label="RG")
IA = ProcessTree(label="IA")
TI = ProcessTree(label="TI")
TC = ProcessTree(label="TC")
CE = ProcessTree(label="CE")
FBP = ProcessTree(label="FBP")
SC = ProcessTree(label="SC")
TM = ProcessTree(label="TM")
SPT = ProcessTree(label="SPT")
RDT = ProcessTree(label="RDT")
FCE = ProcessTree(label="FCE")
FBA = ProcessTree(label="FBA")
AI = ProcessTree(label="AI")
NC = ProcessTree(label="NC")
FAS = ProcessTree(label="FAS")
DDI = ProcessTree(label="DDI")
BL = ProcessTree(label="BL")
ICP = ProcessTree(label="ICP")
MRF = ProcessTree(label="MRF")

# Sequence nodes
seq1 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE)
seq2 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=seq1) # This sequence node will contain TI and TC

# XOR choice between CE or FBP
xor_diag_test = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR)

# Loop components (SC, TM/SPT, RDT)
loop_components = *( SC,
                      xor_treatment_choice := X( TM, SPT ),
                      RDT )

# Parallel activities for advanced imaging and nutritional counseling
parallel_imaging_counseling = +( AI, NC )

# Sequence of FAS followed by DDI
seq_final_steps = ->( FAS, DDI )

# Parallel administrative tasks (BL, ICP, MRF)
parallel_admin_tasks = +( BL, ICP, MRF )

# Putting together the process tree
seq1.children.append(RG)
seq2.parent = seq1
seq2.children.append(TI)
seq2.children.append(TC)

xor_diag_test.children.append(CE)  # If cardiac issue
xor_diag_test.children.append(FBP)  # Otherwise

root_parallel = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[
    ->( A, seq1 ),
    xor_diag_test,
])

# Construct the loop and connect it to the root process tree if needed.
loop_condition = RDT  # Simplified for this representation. In reality, we should evaluate whether a new test is necessary.

root_parallel.children.append(
    *( SC,
       xor_treatment_choice,
       parallel_imaging_counseling,
       seq_final_steps,
       parallel_admin_tasks
     )
)

# Note: the actual loop structure would involve more intricate condition checks which cannot be directly represented in this flat description.
```

Please note that the above code is a simplified representation of how you might construct such a ProcessTree. For an accurate and functional implementation, each activity or node within loops, conditions, and concurrency blocks should properly reference their parents and children according to pm4py's object model rules.

This structured approach ensures all activities are correctly sequenced, decision points appropriately modeled with exclusive choices (X), parallel actions handled by true concurrency (+), and iterative processes encapsulated in loop (*).
