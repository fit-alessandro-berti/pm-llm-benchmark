To identify the root causes of performance issues in the process, we need to analyze the event log and the directly follows graph for patterns that indicate delays, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies. Here are some specific performance issues and their root causes based on the provided data:

### 1. **High Duration in "Order Empty Containers" to "Pick Up Empty Container"**
   - **Duration:** 368,943.92
   - **Frequency (events):** 1,995
   - **Frequency (objects):** 1,995
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration suggests a significant delay between ordering empty containers and picking them up. This could be due to:
     - **Supplier delays:** The supplier might be slow in fulfilling the orders.
     - **Logistical issues:** There might be issues with transportation or logistics that delay the pickup.

### 2. **Long Duration in "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay" for Containers**
   - **Duration:** 743,380.51
   - **Frequency (events):** 1,794
   - **Frequency (objects):** 1,794
   - **Root Cause:** The long duration indicates a significant delay in moving containers from stock to the loading bay. This could be due to:
     - **Inventory management issues:** Poor inventory management leading to containers being misplaced or not easily accessible.
     - **Resource constraints:** Not enough forklifts or personnel to move containers efficiently.

### 3. **High Duration in "Place in Stock" to "Load to Vehicle" for Forklifts**
   - **Duration:** 128,603.05
   - **Frequency (events):** 20
   - **Frequency (objects):** 3
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration suggests inefficiencies in the process of moving containers from stock to loading vehicles. This could be due to:
     - **Forklift availability:** Insufficient forklifts to handle the workload.
     - **Coordination issues:** Poor coordination between forklift operators and loading teams.

### 4. **Long Duration in "Order Empty Containers" to "Depart" for Transport Documents**
   - **Duration:** 1,007,066.16
   - **Frequency (events):** 561
   - **Frequency (objects):** 561
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration indicates a significant delay between ordering empty containers and the departure of the transport. This could be due to:
     - **Multiple bottlenecks:** Delays in the entire process chain, including ordering, picking up, loading, and departure.
     - **Inefficient planning:** Poor planning and coordination between different stages of the process.

### 5. **High Duration in "Book Vehicles" to "Book Vehicles" for Vehicles**
   - **Duration:** 295,965.56
   - **Frequency (events):** 585
   - **Frequency (objects):** 124
   - **Root Cause:** The long duration suggests inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process. This could be due to:
     - **Resource constraints:** Not enough vehicles available to meet the demand.
     - **Bureaucratic delays:** Excessive administrative or approval processes.

### 6. **High Duration in "Drive to Terminal" to "Load Truck" for Trucks**
   - **Duration:** 84,119.09
   - **Frequency (events):** 1,988
   - **Frequency (objects):** 6
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration indicates a significant delay in the process of driving to the terminal and then loading the truck. This could be due to:
     - **Logistical issues:** Long travel times or traffic delays.
     - **Terminal efficiency:** Inefficiencies at the terminal in processing trucks for loading.

### 7. **High Duration in "Weigh" to "Load to Vehicle" for Forklifts**
   - **Duration:** 29,836.64
   - **Frequency (events):** 449
   - **Frequency (objects):** 3
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration suggests inefficiencies in the process of weighing containers and then loading them onto vehicles. This could be due to:
     - **Weighing equipment:** Inefficient or slow weighing processes.
     - **Resource constraints:** Not enough forklifts or personnel to handle the workload.

### 8. **High Duration in "Place in Stock" to "Place in Stock" for Forklifts**
   - **Duration:** 469.57
   - **Frequency (events):** 23
   - **Frequency (objects):** 3
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration indicates inefficiencies in the process of placing containers in stock. This could be due to:
     - **Storage management:** Poor storage management leading to containers being moved multiple times.
     - **Forklift availability:** Insufficient forklifts to handle the workload.

### 9. **High Duration in "Bring to Loading Bay" to "Bring to Loading Bay" for Forklifts**
   - **Duration:** 112,295.00
   - **Frequency (events):** 4
   - **Frequency (objects):** 2
   - **Root Cause:** This high duration suggests significant delays in the process of bringing containers to the loading bay. This could be due to:
     - **Forklift availability:** Insufficient forklifts to handle the workload.
     - **Coordination issues:** Poor coordination between forklift operators and loading teams.

### 10. **High Duration in "Weigh" to "Weigh" for Forklifts**
   - **Duration:** 219,774.00
   - **Frequency (events):** 1
   - **Frequency (objects):** 1
   - **Root Cause:** This very high duration for a single event indicates a significant issue in the weighing process. This could be due to:
     - **Weighing equipment:** Severe issues with the weighing equipment.
     - **Process anomalies:** Unusual circumstances or errors in the weighing process.

### Summary of Root Causes
1. **Supplier and Logistical Delays:** Delays in ordering and picking up empty containers.
2. **Inventory and Resource Management:** Poor inventory management and insufficient resources (forklifts, personnel) for moving containers.
3. **Coordination and Planning:** Inefficient planning and coordination between different stages of the process.
4. **Vehicle and Terminal Inefficiencies:** Inefficiencies in vehicle booking and terminal processing.
5. **Weighing and Storage Processes:** Slow or inefficient weighing processes and poor storage management.

Addressing these specific issues through targeted improvements in logistics, resource management, and process coordination can help improve the overall performance of the process.
