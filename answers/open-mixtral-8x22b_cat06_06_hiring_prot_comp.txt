Based on the provided process variants for the protected and unprotected groups, here are some main differences:

1. Frequency of process variants: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants compared to the protected group. This indicates that the unprotected group may have more instances of receiving treatment or care.
2. Thorough and expert examinations: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving thorough and expert examinations compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may receive more comprehensive examinations.
3. Treatment success rates: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving treatment success compared to the protected group. This indicates that the unprotected group may have higher rates of successful treatment outcomes.
4. Treatment unsuccessful rates: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving treatment unsuccessful compared to the protected group. However, this does not necessarily mean that the unprotected group has a higher rate of unsuccessful treatment outcomes, as the higher frequency could be due to a larger sample size.
5. Discharge rates: The unprotected group has a higher frequency of process variants involving discharge compared to the protected group. This suggests that the unprotected group may have a higher rate of being discharged from care.
6. Performance times: The performance times for the unprotected group are generally longer than those for the protected group. This may indicate that the unprotected group experiences longer wait times or longer treatment durations.

Based on these differences, it appears that the unprotected group may be receiving more comprehensive care, with higher rates of successful treatment outcomes and discharge. However, the longer performance times and higher rates of treatment unsuccessful suggest that there may be areas for improvement in the care provided to the unprotected group. Additionally, the higher frequency of process variants for the unprotected group may indicate that they have more instances of receiving care, which could be due to a larger sample size or other factors.
