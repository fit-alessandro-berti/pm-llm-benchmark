```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) as event_count
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
  HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
INNER JOIN case_counts cc ON e.case_id = cc.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**
1. **CTE `case_counts`**: Groups events by `case_id`, counts events per case, and filters to keep only cases with 6 events using `HAVING`.
2. **Main query**: Joins the full `event_log` back to the filtered case counts, returning all columns (`*`) for qualifying cases.
3. **`ORDER BY`**: Ensures results are sorted by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability (optional but recommended).

This query efficiently identifies valid cases first, then retrieves their complete event sets without scanning the full table multiple times.
