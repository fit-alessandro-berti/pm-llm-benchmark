It’s a Petrinet–style process model of a request/claim handling workflow.

- Start: a – “register request.”
- After registration, the case is examined either thoroughly (b) or casually (c) while the ticket can be checked (d) in parallel.
- These activities synchronize at e – “decide.”
- From the decision, the process can:
  - g – “pay compensation”  z – “end,” or
  - h – “reject request”  z – “end,” or
  - f – “reinitiate request,” which loops the case back to the examination/checking steps.
- Small black dots are the routing places/gateways. The legend at bottom right illustrates the types of splits/joins used: XOR, AND, and OR for both splitting and joining flows.
