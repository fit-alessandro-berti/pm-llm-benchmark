Here’s a concise description of the visualization:

- It is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram showing an endtoend order fulfillment process.
- The process is divided into four swimlanes (roles/departments):
  - Sales
  - Production
  - Procurement
  - Warehouse

Sales:
- Starts on Monday morning.
- Checks the order for completeness.
- Verifies if the customer exists in the database:
  - If not, adds the customer.
- Once validated, sends the order details to Production.
- After the product is sent, prepares a draft invoice.

Production:
- Receives order details.
- Plans production.
- Requests/relies on materials (linked via a gateway/event to Procurement).
- If materials are okay, manufactures the product.
- When complete, signals the Warehouse to proceed with shipping.

Procurement:
- Triggered by order details/production needs.
- Contains a “Material Compensation Subprocess”:
  - Orders materials.
  - If needed, returns material (loop/compensation behavior).
- Checks materials:
  - If materials are faulty or issues arise, can lead to order cancellation.
  - If acceptable, supports Production to continue.

Warehouse:
- Waits for notification that the product is complete.
- Sends the product to the customer.
- This “product sent” event links back to Sales for invoicing.

Overall:
- The diagram depicts the coordinated flow of information and goods among departments from order receipt to shipment and invoicing, including customer verification, material procurement, production, and potential order cancellation.
