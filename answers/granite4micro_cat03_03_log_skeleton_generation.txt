Below is one way you could capture all of the constraints that describe the orderfulfillment workflow as a **Log Skeleton** – i.e. a Python dictionary whose keys map to the different declarative constraints and whose values hold the concrete activity pairs (or occurrence bounds) that satisfy each rule.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    # 1 EQUIVALENCE   – two activities occur exactly together.
    #
    # Example: “Check Availability” must happen before “Reserve Items”
    # and also after it.  In the skeleton we encode both directions:
    "equivalence": {
        ("CA", "RI"): set(),               # no ordering rule implied
        ("RI", "CA"): set()
    },

    # 2 ALWAYS BEFORE – activity A must be finished before B can start.
    #
    # • CA (Check Availability) always precedes RI (Reserve Items)
    # • PI (Pick Items) must happen after CA and RI
    # • QC (Quality Check) follows PI but not yet RI/CA
    "always_before": {
        ("RI", "CA"): set(),
        ("PI", "CA"): {"CA"},
        ("PI", "RI"): {"RI", "CA"},
        ("QC", "PI"): {"PI"}
    },

    # 3 ALWAYS AFTER – activity A must finish after B.
    #
    # • PO (Pack Order) is always executed after QC, but before GSL/D
    # • GSL (Generate Shipping Label) follows PO
    # • D (Dispatch) follows GSL
    "always_after": {
        ("QC", "PO"): {"PO"},
        ("GSL", "D"): {"D"}
    },

    # 4 NEVER TOGETHER – the two activities cannot occur simultaneously in a case.
    #
    # The following pairs are forbidden from cooccurring (e.g., PO and IC
    # cannot happen at the same time):
    "never_together": {
        ("PO", "IC"): set(),
        ("GSL", "IC"): set()
    },

    # 5 ACTIVITY OCCURRENCE BOUNDS – how many times each activity can appear.
    #
    # The warehouse expects most orders to be singleitem shipments,
    # but a batch or bulk order may need multiple iterations of picking
    # (PI) and packaging (PO).  Here we allow:
    #
    #   - RO: either never or exactly one time (a new order comes in)
    #   - CA, RI: typically zero or once per order
    #   - PI: from zero up to two times (some orders need picking of several items)
    #   - QC: usually zero or once after picking
    #   - PO: exactly one time per package assembled
    #   - GSL/D/IC/RP: always executed once when the order is fully processed.
    "activ_freq": {
        "RO": {0, 1},
        "CA": {0, 1},
        "RI": {0, 1},
        "PI": {0, 1, 2},          # pick items may be required more than once
        "QC": {0, 1},
        "PO": {1},
        "GSL": {1},
        "D":   {1},
        "IC":  {1},
        "RP":  {1}
    },

    # 6 DIRECTLY-FOLLOWING CONSTRAINTS – if A occurs then B must happen immediately next.
    #
    # • RI (Reserve Items) must be directly followed by PI (Pick Items)
    #   because the reservation is cancelled only after picking is done.
    "directly_follows": {
        ("RI", "PI"): set()
    }
}
```

### How to read / extend this skeleton

| Constraint | What it means in plain English | Example from the skeleton |
|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Equivalence** | Two activities happen together (or never). | `("CA","RI")` – both must be finished before the order can move on. |
| **Always Before** | ActivityA must finish *before* activityB starts. | `("PI","CA")` tells us that picking cannot begin until we know stock is available. |
| **Always After** | ActivityB must finish *after* activityA started (or be completed). | `("QC","PO")` – quality check only happens after the items are picked and packed. |
| **Never Together** | The two activities cannot cooccur in any event of a case. | `("PO","IC")` – packing can’t happen while invoicing is being sent out. |
| **Activity Occurrences** | How many times each activity may appear per order (or per transaction). | `"PI": {0,1,2}` means an order could require no picking or up to two separate pick actions. |
| **DirectlyFalls** | If A occurs then B must be the *next* activity in that case. | `("RI","PI")` enforces “reserve  immediately pick”. |

### Using the skeleton

You can plug this dictionary into any loganalysis or conformancechecking engine (e.g., PSL, CSL) to:

1. **Validate a trace** – check whether it respects all of the constraints.
2. **Detect violations** – see which rule is broken when an activity occurs unexpectedly (e.g., `PO` after `IC`).
3. **Enforce bounded occurrence rules** – ensure you never exceed the allowed number of occurrences for any subprocess.

Feel free to adjust the sets (`{0,1}` etc.) or add more pairs as your operational policies evolve!
