### Process Mining Event Log

Based on the provided system log, I have transformed the raw events into a process mining event log. Here's the event log suitable for process mining tools:

### Explanation of Logic

**Case Identification:**
- Each set of activities where the user focuses on a specific document or application and performs a series of actions (like typing, scrolling, replying, and saving) is grouped into a single case.
- The "Close" event marks the end of a specific document activity, signaling the end of a case.

**Activity Naming:**
- "Edit Document1" and "Edit Report" are higher-level activities representing the overall editing process.
- "Type Intro Paragraph" and "Type Summary" are more specific actions within the editing process.
- "Save Document" and "Save Report" represent the actions of saving the document, which is a critical step in the process.
- "Switch to Email" and "Switch to Report" represent the user switching applications or documents.

**Event Attributes:**
- **Case ID**: Each case is assigned a unique ID (1 in this example, as only one case is present).
- **Activity Name**: Descriptive names for the activities derived from the raw events.
- **Timestamp**: The original event timestamp.
- **Application Name**: The application in which the activity occurred.
- **Window Title**: The title of the window, which helps in identifying the specific document or task.

### Summary
The event log was created by identifying logical units of work based on the user's interaction with different applications and documents. Each case represents a coherent set of activities related to editing a document or working on a task. The activities were named to reflect the higher-level steps in the process, such as editing, replying to emails, and saving documents. This log will be useful for process mining tools to analyze the user's workflow and identify potential inefficiencies or bottlenecks.
