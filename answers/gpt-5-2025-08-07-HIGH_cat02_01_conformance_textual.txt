Summary of the intended flows (interpreting the text strictly):
- Fulfillment path: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- Cancellation path (insufficient stock): Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
Key constraints: Check inventory precedes any authorization/fulfillment; Authorize occurs only after Check and before Packaging; Package occurs before Shipping; Shipping never happens after a Cancel; Close order is last.

Cases that conform:
- Case 1: Matches the fulfillment path exactly.
- Case 4: Matches the cancellation path exactly.

Cases that violate the normative process:
- Case 2:
  - Violation: Package items occurred before Authorize payment.
  - Rule violated: “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping.” Also implies “Authorize payment should occur after Check inventory and before packaging.”
- Case 3:
  - Violation: Cancel order occurs after Authorize payment.
    - Interpretation: Under the given model, if the outcome is cancellation due to insufficient stock, Cancel should follow Check inventory directly; authorization should not happen in the cancellation branch.
  - Violation: Ship order occurs after Cancel order.
    - Rule violated: “Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.”
  - Violation: Ship order occurred without any prior Package items step.
    - Rule violated: “Ship order should only occur after packaging.”
  - Violation: After cancellation, the next step should be Close order (no fulfillment steps in between).
- Case 5:
  - Violation: Ship order occurred without a preceding Package items step.
  - Rule violated: “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping,” and “Ship order should only occur after packaging.”

Therefore, violating cases: 2, 3, and 5.
