Certainly! Here is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task described:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    case_event_counts cec
ON
    el.case_id = cec.case_id
WHERE
    cec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `case_event_counts`**:
   - This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the events and counting them.
   - The result is a table with `case_id` and the corresponding `event_count`.

2. **Main Query**:
   - The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table.
   - It joins the `event_log` table with the `case_event_counts` CTE on `case_id`.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters out the cases where the event count is greater than six.

This query ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.
