Based on the event attributes and logical flow patterns, I can identify **3 distinct cases** from this interleaved sequence:

## **Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER - Leg Injury)**
- Event 1: Register patient (ER, 08:05:13)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, 08:10:50, triage_code=3)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology, 08:15:42, left_leg)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, 08:23:10, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, 08:30:05, followup=outpatient_clinic)

**Journey:** Registration  Triage  X-ray  Doctor diagnosis  Discharge

## **Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER - Infection)**
- Event 2: Register patient (ER, 08:07:02)
- Event 5: Initial triage (ER, 08:12:29, triage_code=2)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (ER, 08:16:10, blood_panel)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (Laboratory, 08:20:27, normal_levels)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, 08:22:54, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, 08:27:00, antibiotics)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, 08:35:29, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

**Journey:** Registration  Triage  Lab test  Results  Doctor diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge

## **Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery - Scheduled Knee Surgery)**
- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, 08:07:15)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, 08:13:00, scheduled_knee_surgery)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, 08:16:45, general_anesthesia)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, 08:25:19, arthroscopy)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, 08:31:37, stable)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, 08:40:13, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

**Journey:** Registration  Pre-op consultation  Surgery prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

## **Key Grouping Indicators Used:**
1. **Patient demographics consistency** (age + gender combinations)
2. **Department coherence** (ER vs Surgery pathways)
3. **Logical activity sequences** (e.g., triage follows registration in ER)
4. **Resource patterns** (same doctors treating same patients)
5. **Temporal proximity** of related activities
6. **Additional info continuity** (diagnoses matching treatments/follow-ups)

Each case represents a complete, logical patient journey with no gaps or contradictions in the flow.
