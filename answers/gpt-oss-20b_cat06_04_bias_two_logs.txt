We need to compare logs. Group A: Protected group, no community group, no score adjustment. Group B: Unprotected group, some have community group and get +10 boost. So bias is in favor of unprotected group with community membership. Also local resident attribute is true for all U cases but false for P cases; but that may not be relevant.

We should explain bias: systematic difference in final decisions due to score adjustments based on community membership, leading to higher scores and approvals for U001 and U003 vs P001/P003 etc.

Also mention that LocalResident being true might correlate with unprotected status? But the main bias is the CommunityGroup attribute leading to score adjustment.

We should discuss how this leads to systematic differences: e.g., U001 gets +10 boost -> approved; P001 had 720 -> approved too but no boost; but if threshold was 725 maybe would be rejected. Similarly U003 gets boost from 695 to 705 -> approved; if threshold 700 maybe would be rejected otherwise.

Also note that the presence of a community group only occurs for unprotected individuals, giving them advantage.

Thus log B exhibits bias due to differential treatment based on protected status via community membership and score adjustments.

Let's craft answer accordingly.

**Which log shows bias?**  
The event log for **Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits a systematic bias against the protected members in Group A.

### How the bias manifests

| Feature | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **LocalResident** | `FALSE` for every case | `TRUE` for every case |
| **CommunityGroup** | `None` (no club affiliation) | Some applicants belong to *Highland Civic Darts Club* |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always `0` or `N/A` – no extra points are added after preliminary scoring | +10 points are added when an applicant belongs to a community group (`+10 (Community Boost)`), which is applied at both the *PreliminaryScoring* and *ManualReview* stages |

Because the only difference between the two groups is that unprotected applicants can receive a +10‑point “community‑boost” while protected applicants cannot, any decision rule that uses the final score will systematically favor those who are members of a recognized community organization—i.e., those who are not part of the protected class.

### Concrete evidence from the logs

1. **U001 vs P001**
   - *P001*: Final score = \(720\). Decision = Approved.
   - *U001*: Final score = \(730\) (720 + 10). Decision = Approved.
   - If an approval threshold were set at \(725\), P001 would have been rejected while U001 would still be approved because of the boost.

2. **U003 vs P003**
   - *P003*: Final score = \(740\). Decision = Approved.
   - *U003*: Final score = \(705\) (695 + 10). Decision = Approved.
   - Here again, without the +10 boost U003’s final score would fall below many realistic thresholds (\(>710\)), potentially leading to rejection.

3. **No Community Boost Cases**
   - In both logs there are cases where no CommunityBoost applies (`U002`, all `P…`). The outcomes match exactly: both groups see one approval and one rejection when scores are identical or very close (\(710\)).  
     This indicates that when all other factors equalize, decisions align—suggesting that it is precisely the CommunityBoost that introduces disparity.

### Why this constitutes bias

- The **score adjustment** depends on an attribute (*CommunityGroup*) that correlates perfectly with being in an unprotected class in this dataset.
- The adjustment gives unprotected individuals an automatic advantage regardless of their underlying risk profile or application quality.
- Because protected individuals never receive such boosts, they face a higher effective decision threshold relative to their peers—a classic example of disparate impact stemming from policy design rather than individual merit.

In short, Group B’s event log demonstrates biased treatment through differential scoring tied to non‑protective attributes (*CommunityGroup*), which systematically improves outcomes for unprotected applicants while leaving protected ones at a disadvantage even though their raw scores are comparable or better.
