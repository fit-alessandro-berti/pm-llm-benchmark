Based on the provided information, there are a few anomalies or inconsistencies that can be identified:

1. **Non-Sequential Directly-Follows Constraints**: 
   - In the given transition pairs, we see some directly-follows transitions that seem out of sequence. For instance, "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING" should logically come after a declaration is submitted and evaluated, not before. Similarly, the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION", "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR", or other approval states following directly from "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" makes sense.

2. **Circular Transitions**:
   - There are instances where an activity appears to transition back to itself (e.g., "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING", "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE"). This could imply a loop in the process which might not be intended or practical.
   
3. **Irregular Occurrence Numbers**:
   - For instance, there's only one occurrence for some activities like 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled', whereas others like 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION' appear multiple times. This could suggest that in the current process model, these events are not equally probable or occur under specific circumstances that aren't well-defined.

4. **Missing Transitions**:
   - Notably missing from transitions are links to more commonly expected sequences following certain actions (e.g., after a declaration is 'APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER', it should directly proceed towards further approvals and possibly Request Payment, yet this transition isn’t explicitly outlined).

5. **Redundancies in States**:
   - Some states like "Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER" are listed multiple times under different conditions (e.g., following both REJECTED by EMPLOYEE or ADMINISTRATION), which seems redundant if they should all lead to the same next state.

6. **Contradictory Transitions:**
   - There seem to be contradictory pairs such as "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION", leading directly to both "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" and another activity, indicating a lack of consistency in how approvals flow through the process.

7. **Missing Final States**:
   - The final state like “Payment Handled” appears only once but could logically appear multiple times based on the number of 'Request Payment' instances unless all other transitions naturally lead back to payment requests.

These issues highlight potential areas where the modeled workflow does not accurately represent a typical process flow. A detailed review and possibly re-mapping the activities, ensuring each state logically progresses to the next expected state in a clear, non-circular manner would be advisable.
