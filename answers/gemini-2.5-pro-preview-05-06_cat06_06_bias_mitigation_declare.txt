To limit potential bias in the loan application process, we will introduce new DECLARE constraints. These constraints will revolve around newly defined activities that represent checking sensitive attributes and performing mitigation steps.

**New Activities Introduced:**

*   `CheckRaceMinority`: An activity that occurs if an applicant's race is identified as belonging to a minority group.
*   `CheckAgeProtected`: An activity that occurs if an applicant's age falls into a protected category (e.g., very young or elderly, as defined by policy).
*   `ManualReview`: An activity representing a thorough, human-led review of an application, typically triggered by specific conditions like the presence of sensitive attributes.
*   `BiasMitigationCheck`: An activity representing a specific procedural check designed to identify and counteract potential bias before a decision is made.
*   `Approve`: A specific decision activity indicating the loan application is approved.
*   `Reject`: A specific decision activity indicating the loan application is rejected.

The existing `FinalDecision` activity is kept as a general mandatory step, while `Approve` and `Reject` represent specific outcomes that are now governed by fairness constraints.

**Updated `declare_model`:**

        # New: Decisions (Approve/Reject) must be preceded by a ManualReview if one was triggered.
        "ManualReview": {
            "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}

        "CheckRaceMinority": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckAgeProtected": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

The newly added constraints aim to reduce bias by introducing mandatory checks and altering prohibited pathways when sensitive applicant attributes are involved:

1.  **`responded_existence` for `ManualReview`:**
    *   `responded_existence(CheckRaceMinority, ManualReview)`
    *   `responded_existence(CheckAgeProtected, ManualReview)`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints ensure that if an applicant is identified as belonging to a minority race (`CheckRaceMinority`) or a protected age group (`CheckAgeProtected`), a `ManualReview` activity *must* occur at some point within that case. This mandates a deeper, human-led examination for applications involving these sensitive attributes, helping to catch and mitigate potential biases that automated steps might miss.

2.  **`response` for `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
    *   `response(CheckRaceMinority, BiasMitigationCheck)`
    *   `response(CheckAgeProtected, BiasMitigationCheck)`
    *   **Rationale:** If a sensitive attribute (`CheckRaceMinority` or `CheckAgeProtected`) is noted, these constraints enforce that a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity *must* follow. This ensures a specific procedural check for fairness is performed whenever these sensitive attributes are present in an application.

3.  **`precedence` for `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` before decisions:**
    *   `precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, Reject)`, `precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, Approve)`
    *   `precedence(ManualReview, Reject)`, `precedence(ManualReview, Approve)`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints stipulate that if a `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview` is performed (likely triggered by the `response` or `responded_existence` constraints above), it *must* precede any `Approve` or `Reject` decision. This ensures that the findings of these fairness-enhancing activities are available and considered before a final outcome is determined, rather than being post-hoc or bypassed.

4.  **`nonsuccession` from sensitive attribute checks to `Reject`:**
    *   `nonsuccession(CheckRaceMinority, Reject)`
    *   `nonsuccession(CheckAgeProtected, Reject)`
    *   **Rationale:** These constraints prevent the direct, immediate sequence of identifying a sensitive attribute (e.g., `CheckRaceMinority`) and then issuing a `Reject` decision. This forces at least one other activity to occur between the attribute identification and a potential rejection, breaking a direct path that might represent a quick, unscrutinized, and potentially biased decision. This encourages a more deliberative process.

Together, these constraints introduce critical checkpoints and reviews into the process specifically when sensitive attributes are encountered, thereby aiming to ensure fairer and more equitable decision-making in the loan application process.
