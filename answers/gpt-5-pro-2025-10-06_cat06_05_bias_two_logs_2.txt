Which log exhibits bias
- Group B (Unprotected Group) shows bias. It applies a +5 “Association Boost” to the Cultural Fit score for candidates affiliated with the LocalBusinessLeadersClub; Group A does not receive any analogous adjustment.

How the bias manifests
- Unequal treatment for similar profiles: Candidates with similar job-relevant scores are treated differently based solely on club membership.
  - P002 (78 skill, 75 personality, 60 cultural fit) is Not Hired.
  - U001 (80 skill, 72 personality, 60 cultural fit) becomes Hired only after the +5 boost (to 65).
  - U003 (75, 65, 58) becomes Hired after the boost to 63, despite lower job-relevant scores than P002.
- Non–job-related factor affects outcomes: A social/professional affiliation (and being a local resident, which appears correlated with that affiliation) alters decisions, while Group A candidates never receive that boost.
- Process bias despite similar headline rates: Both groups show 2/3 hired, but parity in outcomes masks procedural unfairness—boosted candidates in Group B would likely have been rejected without the association advantage.

Implications for fairness and equity
- Violates individual fairness: Similar candidates do not receive similar treatment.
- Risks disparate treatment/impact: The advantage is tied to an affiliation unevenly available across groups (and correlated with “LocalResident”), potentially disadvantaging the protected group.
- Erodes merit-based hiring: Non-job-related boosts allow lower-qualified candidates to displace better-qualified ones.
- Legal, ethical, and reputational risk: Preference tied to club membership can be a proxy for socioeconomic or demographic factors, undermining equity and inclusion goals.

Recommendations
- Remove association-based score boosts, or only use adjustments that are job-related, validated, and applied uniformly.
- Replace “cultural fit” with structured, behaviorally anchored, job-relevant criteria (e.g., values alignment, collaboration behaviors).
- Audit decisions with and without such features; monitor individual fairness and group metrics (e.g., four-fifths rule, threshold analyses).
- Standardize interviews and scoring; document rationale for each feature to avoid proxy variables for sensitive attributes.
