### **Analysis of Bias in the Event Logs**

The logs reveal a **systematic bias favoring Group B (Unprotected Group)**, particularly for applicants associated with the **"Highland Civic Darts Club"** community group. This bias manifests in the following ways:

#### **1. Score Adjustments Based on Community Affiliation**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**  
  - No score adjustments are applied, regardless of `LocalResident` or `CommunityGroup`.  
  - Example:  
    - **P001 (Score = 720)** â†’ No adjustment â†’ **Approved**  
    - **P002 (Score = 710)** â†’ No adjustment â†’ **Rejected**  

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**  
  - Applicants from **"Highland Civic Darts Club"** receive a **+10 "Community Boost"**, while others do not.  
  - Example:  
    - **U001 (Score = 720 â†’ 730 after adjustment)** â†’ **Approved**  
    - **U003 (Score = 695 â†’ 705 after adjustment)** â†’ **Approved**  
    - **U002 (Score = 710, no community group)** â†’ **No adjustment** â†’ **Rejected**  

ðŸ”¹ **Bias:** The **same initial score (720) leads to different outcomes** (P001 approved, U001 approved with boost), while a **lower score (695 â†’ 705) in Group B is approved**, whereas a **higher score (710) in Group A is rejected**.

#### **2. Disparate Impact on Local Residents**
- **Group A:** All applicants are **non-local (`LocalResident = FALSE`)** and receive **no adjustments**.  
- **Group B:** Local residents (`LocalResident = TRUE`) **only benefit if they belong to the "Highland Civic Darts Club"**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Bias:** The system **arbitrarily favors a specific community group**, creating an **unfair advantage** for certain local residents while excluding others.

#### **3. Potential Fairness Violations**
- **Disparate Treatment:**  
  - Group B members from the favored community receive **preferential treatment** via score boosts, while Group A (and non-affiliated Group B applicants) do not.  
- **Disparate Impact:**  
  - The policy **systematically benefits a specific subgroup**, leading to **higher approval rates for certain applicants despite similar or lower initial scores**.  

### **Conclusion**
The bias in **Group B's log** arises from:  
1. **Unjustified score adjustments** for a specific community group.  
2. **Unequal treatment of local residents** based on affiliation.  
3. **Inconsistent decision-making**, where lower scores in Group B lead to approvals while higher scores in Group A result in rejections.  

This suggests a **potential fairness issue** that should be investigated to ensure **equal treatment across all applicants**.  

Would you like a deeper statistical analysis (e.g., approval rate disparities) to quantify the bias further?
