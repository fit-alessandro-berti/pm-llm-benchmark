#### 1. Activities Identified as Recurrent:
The following activities appear multiple times within the same case with different contextual meanings:

- **Call Customer**: Same activity label—used for both requesting missing info, clarification, or follow-up.

###  Justification of Naming Changes

####  **Verify Documents  Multiple Contextual Variants**
- **Initial Document Verification / Identity Verification**: Used early in the process to establish identity (C001, C002), reflecting that it's the **first touchpoint** for document assessment.
- **Follow-up Document Verification**: Triggered in C001 after customer provides missing ID. The same activity is repeated, but the purpose is **rechecking newly submitted** materials.
- **Physical Document Verification**: In C003, the setting is a physical branch, so noted for clarity.
- **Post-Correction Document Re-Verification**: Occurs in C003 after internal changes—suggests this verification is dependent on a preceding data update.

####  **Call Customer  Differentiated Purpose-Based Labels**
- **Call to Request Missing Documents**: C001—motivated by incomplete data.
- **Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy**: C002—aimed at clarifying mismatched data.
- **Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments**: C002—serves as final validation check after internal adjustment.
- **Call to Recall Absent Customer**: C003—contextually unique: the caller is prompting a temporarily absent walk-in customer to come back.

#### Other Renames:
- **Submit Additional  Upload Additional Documents**: Made the customer action name more explicit and process-specific.
- **Approve Request  Final Approval by Supervisor**: Clarifies that this is the conclusive approval node, aligns with the organizational role.

###  Summary

- Ambiguity in recurring activity names like **"Verify Documents"** and **"Call Customer"** is addressed by appending **contextual modifiers** based on sequence, purpose, and resource notes.
- Resulting activity names improve traceability and process models, allowing for clear action mapping in future automation or analytics.
