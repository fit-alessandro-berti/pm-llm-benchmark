**Violations of Normative Rules:**

1. **Case 2:**
   - The activity "Risk Assessment" occurred before "Credit Check," violating the strict ordering rule that requires the Credit Check to happen before Risk Assessment.
   - Additionally, "Finalize Documentation" happened after a "Loan Decision (Rejected)," which is not allowed according to the normative constraints.

**Failures to Meet Desiderata:**

1. **Case 2:**
   - The Credit Check did not occur promptly after receiving the application.
   - There was no Follow-up Call made to the applicant before closing the case.

2. **Case 3:**
   - The Credit Check was completed after the recommended time window following the application.
   - The applicant was informed later than the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision.
   - There was no Follow-up Call made to the applicant before closing the case.

**Interpretations/Justifications:**

1. **Case 2:**
   - The reversal of the Credit Check and Risk Assessment activities could be due to an oversight or a system error that allowed the Risk Assessment to be performed prematurely.
   - The Finalize Documentation after rejection might be a human error in executing the process without considering the loan outcome.

2. **Case 3:**
   - The delay in the Credit Check might be attributed to a high volume of applications or temporary system issues causing delays.
   - The delay in informing the applicant could be due to manual processes taking more time than anticipated.
   - The lack of a Follow-up Call might be seen as a missed opportunity to enhance customer engagement but not critical to the process outcome.
