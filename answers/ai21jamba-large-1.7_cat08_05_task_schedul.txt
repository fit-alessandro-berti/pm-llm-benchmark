## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### Using Process Mining to Reconstruct Job Flows

1. **Trace Reconstruction**:
	- Using the MES event logs, we reconstruct job lifecycles by linking events using **Case ID (Job ID)** and **Activity/Task** fields. This creates process models illustrating the sequence and timing of tasks for each job.
	- Variant analysis identifies frequent routing patterns and deviations.
2. **Metrics for Quantifying Performance**:
	- **Flow Times and Lead Times**:
		- Measure total job completion times by aggregating **task durations and queue times**.
		- **Lead Time = Job Release Timestamp  Job Completion Timestamp**.
	- **Task Waiting Times**:
		- Compute **queueing delay = Queue Entry Timestamp  Setup Start Timestamp** for each task. Analyze per machine.
	- **Setup Time Analysis**:
		- Use sequence-dependent setup information (`Setup Required` and `Previous Job`) to quantify setup durations.
		- Group similar jobs (e.g., material type, geometry) to analyze setup time variability.
	- **Resource Utilization**:
		- Attribute **productive time** (task execution), **idle time**, and **setup time** for each machine/operator.
		- Identify machines with **high idle-to-productive time ratios**.
	- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**:
		- Calculate adherence: $$\text{Adherence} = 1 - \frac{| \text{Actual Completion Time} - \text{Planned Due Date} |}{\text{Planned Lead Time}}$$
		- Measure **tardiness** and prioritize analysis of delays exceeding 20% of the planned lead time.
	- **Impact of Disruptions**:
		- Flag events such as **Resource Breakdown** or **Priority Change**.
		- Compare scheduled KPIs pre/post-disruption to quantify adverse effects.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

- **Bottleneck Identification**:
	- Process mining highlights machines with the longest queue times and highest tardiness impact (bottlenecks).
	- Combine **queue length** and **resource utilization** metrics for comprehensive bottleneck identification.
- **Task Prioritization**:
	- Variant analysis reveals late jobs with **high waiting times despite high priority**, indicating failed prioritization.
- **Suboptimal Sequencing**:
	- High **setup time variability** at bottleneck machines points to inefficient sequencing.
- **Resource Starvation**:
	- Downstream underutilization following bottlenecks suggests uneven prioritization.
- **WIP Volatility**:
	- Analyze **WIP trends over time** during high-demand periods or disruptions.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

- **Static Dispatching Rules**:
	- Dispatching rules fail in dynamic environments where resource availability and priorities shift unpredictably.
- **Limited Real-Time Visibility**:
	- Lack of synchronized views into queue lengths, machine statuses, and job progress delays corrective action.
- **Inaccurate Planning Inputs**:
	- Estimates for setup and task durations deviate from actuals, leading to unreliable schedules.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Challenges**:
	- Failure to optimize job sequences at bottlenecks exacerbates setup-related delays.
- **Breakdowns and Urgent Orders**:
	- No robust prioritization framework for handling disruptors, leading to cascading delays.
- **Process Mining Insights**:
	- By correlating sequencing decisions with task outcomes (flow times, tardiness), we differentiate between issues arising from weak scheduling rules and process-inherent variability.

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules**

- **Core Logic**:
	- Dispatch jobs dynamically based on:
		- **Queue time** (FIFO) 
		- **Remaining processing time**, **job priority**, and **due date proximity**.
		- **Load on downstream machines** (sequence-dependent setup and task waiting times).
- **Data-Driven Weighting**:
	- Use mined **task duration distributions** and **sequence-dependent setup metrics** to inform decision weights.
- **Expected Impact**: Reduced tardiness and increased throughput, especially for high-priority jobs.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**

- **Core Logic**:
	- Incorporate historical **task and setup durations** into predictive schedules.
	- Use predictive maintenance insights (if available) to adjust task plans around anticipated resource availability.
- **Implementation**:
	- Generate schedules that proactively stagger bottleneck usage and buffer for variability.
- **Expected Impact**: Reduced unplanned WIP buildup and improved schedule accuracy.

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**

- **Core Logic**:
	- Optimize sequencing to group jobs with minimal setup transitions.
	- Example: Sequence similar jobs on CNC milling machines to exploit tooling similarities and avoid tool change penalties.
- **Implementation**:
	- Machine-specific setup clusters derived from historical logs.
	- Prioritize bottleneck machines for setup optimization.
- **Expected Impact**: Significant reduction in setup-related delays at critical machines.

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

### **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**

- Use DES to test proposed strategies under different scenarios:
	- High-load scenarios to stress-test bottlenecks.
	- Frequent machine breakdowns to assess disruption handling.
	- Cold-start scenarios to evaluate setup time strategies.
- Compare:
	- Tardiness (%), WIP, lead times, and resource utilization vs. baseline.

### **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**:
	- Track KPIs (queue times, setup times) using dashboards fed by the MES.
- **Drift Detection**:
	- Automate **variant analysis** to detect new inefficiencies (e.g., bottlenecks forming in previously stable areas).
- **Adaptive Strategies**:
	- Dynamically re-weight prioritization factors based on observed deviations.

## **Expected Outcomes**

1. Tangible reduction in tardiness and WIP.
2. Improved predictability in lead times.
3. Enhanced resource utilization, especially at critical machines.
4. Robust handling of disruptions and “hot jobs.”

By integrating **process mining** with **predictive and adaptive scheduling strategies**, Precision Parts Inc. can achieve significantly improved operational performance.
