# Case Grouping Analysis

## Approach
To infer case groupings, I'll analyze:
1. **Patient demographics** (age + gender as a pseudo-identifier)
2. **Department flow** (logical progression of activities)
3. **Temporal sequence** (chronological order within a case)
4. **Activity logic** (clinical workflow patterns)

## Identified Cases

### **Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER - Fracture)**
| Event # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | 08:05:13 | Register patient | ER | insurance=private |
| 4 | 08:10:50 | Initial triage | ER | triage_code=3 |
| 7 | 08:15:42 | X-ray imaging | Radiology | body_part=left_leg |
| 12 | 08:23:10 | Doctor consultation | ER | diagnosis=hairline_fracture |
| 15 | 08:30:05 | Patient discharged | ER | followup=outpatient_clinic |

**Journey:** Registration  Triage  X-ray  Diagnosis (fracture)  Discharge

### **Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER - Infection)**
| Event # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 2 | 08:07:02 | Register patient | ER | insurance=public |
| 5 | 08:12:29 | Initial triage | ER | triage_code=2 |
| 8 | 08:16:10 | Lab test requested | ER | test_type=blood_panel |
| 10 | 08:20:27 | Lab test completed | Laboratory | results=normal_levels |
| 11 | 08:22:54 | Doctor consultation | ER | diagnosis=minor_infection |
| 14 | 08:27:00 | Prescription created | ER | medication=antibiotics |
| 17 | 08:35:29 | Patient discharged | ER | followup=pharmacy_pickup |

**Journey:** Registration  Triage  Lab work  Diagnosis (infection)  Prescription  Discharge

### **Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgery - Knee)**
| Event # | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Key Info |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 3 | 08:07:15 | Register patient | Surgery | insurance=private |
| 6 | 08:13:00 | Doctor consultation | Surgery | reason=scheduled_knee_surgery |
| 9 | 08:16:45 | Surgery preparation | Surgery | prep_type=general_anesthesia |
| 13 | 08:25:19 | Surgery performed | Surgery | procedure=arthroscopy |
| 16 | 08:31:37 | Recovery room | Surgery | condition=stable |
| 18 | 08:40:13 | Patient discharged | Surgery | followup=physiotherapy_sessions |

**Journey:** Registration  Pre-op consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

## Summary Table

| Case ID | Patient | Department | Events | Duration |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Case 1** | 45M | ER | 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 | ~25 min |
| **Case 2** | 62F | ER | 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 | ~28 min |
| **Case 3** | 28M | Surgery | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 | ~33 min |

## Key Inference Logic
- **Patient_age + patient_gender** served as the primary grouping key
- **Department consistency** validated groupings (ER patients stayed in ER workflow, Surgery patient followed surgical pathway)
- **Activity sequences** followed expected clinical workflows (triagediagnosisdischarge for ER; prepsurgeryrecovery for Surgery)
