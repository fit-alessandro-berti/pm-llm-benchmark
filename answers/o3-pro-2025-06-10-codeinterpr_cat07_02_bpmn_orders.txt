The picture is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that explains how a company handles a customer order from the moment an order is received until the product is shipped and the invoice can be drafted.  
The workflow is laid out in four horizontal “swim-lanes,” each representing a department (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse) that cooperates via message flows (dashed arrows). Solid arrows show the internal sequence of work inside each lane.

1. Sales lane  
• Start event “Monday morning.”  
• Task: Check the order for completeness.  
• Exclusive gateway: Is the customer already in the database?  
    – No  Add customer to the database (task connected to a database data store).  
    – Yes  continue.  
• Task: Send order details (message-sending task).  
• Intermediate message event “Product sent” (the sales process pauses here until it is informed that the product was shipped).  
• Task: Draft invoice  End event.

2. Production lane  
• Message start event “Order details arrive” (triggered by the message from Sales).  
• Task: Plan production.  
• Exclusive gateway waiting for a message that confirms “Material not faulty.”  
• Task: Manufacture product.  
• End event “Product complete.”  
• Message is sent to Warehouse to start shipping and, in parallel, back to Sales to announce completion.

3. Procurement lane  
• Message start event “Order details arrive.”  
• Collapsed subprocess “Material Compensation Sub-process” (inside it we see tasks such as “Order materials” and an optional “Return material” path).  
• Intermediate message throw: when materials are OK a message “Material not faulty” is sent to Production’s waiting gateway.  
• If material problems force cancellation, the flow reaches an end event “Order cancellation.”

4. Warehouse lane  
• Message start event “Product complete.”  
• Task: Send product.  
• End event “Product sent,” which triggers the intermediate message event in Sales, allowing the invoice to be drafted.

Key BPMN elements that appear  
– Start and end events (circles).  
– Intermediate message events (double-ring envelope icons).  
– Tasks, including a collapsed subprocess (rectangle with a plus sign).  
– Exclusive gateways (diamonds) for decision making.  
– A data store (“database”) linked to the “Add customer” task.  
– Solid sequence flows (internal steps) versus dashed message flows (cross-department communication).

Overall, the diagram depicts an order-fulfilment process in which Sales initiates and later bills the order, Production schedules and builds the product, Procurement makes sure the necessary materials are available and acceptable, and the Warehouse ships the finished goods, closing the loop back to Sales.
