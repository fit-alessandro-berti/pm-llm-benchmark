Step-by-Step Analysis and Identification of Violations
Normative Process Description Recap
Starts with "Receive order."
Next is "Check inventory." This must happen before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment.
If inventory is sufficient:
Authorize payment
Package items
Ship order
Close order
If inventory is insufficient:
Cancel order
Close order
Key Constraints
"Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items."
"Package items" should only occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order."
"Ship order" should only occur after "Package items" and before "Close order."
"Cancel order" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before "Close order."
"Close order" should be the final activity in all scenarios.
Analysis of Each Case
Case 1
Sequence:
Receive order
Check inventory
Authorize payment
Package items
Ship order
Close order
Conclusion: This case follows the normative process perfectly. No deviation.

Case 2
Sequence:
Receive order
Check inventory
Package items
Authorize payment
Ship order
Close order
Violation:

"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."
Explanation: According to the normative process, payment should be authorized before packaging the items to ensure that the payment is valid and approved before proceeding with fulfillment.
Conclusion: Deviation present.

Case 3
Sequence:
Receive order
Check inventory
Authorize payment
Cancel order
Ship order
Close order
Violations:

"Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order."
Explanation: If the inventory check indicates insufficient stock, the process should proceed directly to "Cancel order" without authorizing payment.
"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
Explanation: Once an order is canceled, it should not be shipped. Shipping after cancellation is illogical and against the normative process.
Conclusion: Multiple deviations present.

Case 4
Sequence:
Receive order
Check inventory
Cancel order
Close order
Conclusion: This case follows the normative process perfectly. No deviation.

Case 5
Sequence:
Receive order
Check inventory
Authorize payment
Ship order
Close order
Violation:

"Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
Explanation: Packaging items is a necessary step before shipping to ensure that the items are properly prepared for shipment. Skipping this step violates the standard process.
Conclusion: Deviation present.

Summary of Findings
Case 1: No deviation.
Case 2: Deviation - "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
Case 3: Multiple deviations - "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" in an apparent insufficient inventory scenario, and "Ship order" after "Cancel order."
Case 4: No deviation.
Case 5: Deviation - Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order."
Final Answer
Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process.
Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process.
