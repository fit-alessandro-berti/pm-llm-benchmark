Bias manifests in this process primarily in the PreliminaryScoring and ManualReview stages, where adjustments based on CommunityGroup affiliation seem to favor certain groups over others. This bias can influence the fairness and equity of the final decisions by potentially impacting individuals who lack certain community affiliations or geographic characteristics, even when their underlying creditworthiness is similar.

In the event log, we see that in Case C001 and C004, applicants affiliated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a +10 score adjustment in both the PreliminaryScoring and ManualReview stages. This adjustment implies that being part of this community group provides a benefit in the scoring process, potentially leading to a higher overall score and a higher likelihood of approval.

On the other hand, in Case C003 and C005, where the applicants do not have any community affiliations, no such score adjustments are made. This lack of adjustment may put these applicants at a disadvantage compared to those with community affiliations, even if they have similar creditworthiness.

This favoritism towards certain community groups can lead to systemic bias in the decision-making process, as individuals from less privileged communities may face barriers to approval despite their creditworthiness. It highlights the importance of ensuring that decisions are based on objective, relevant criteria that are fair and impartial to all applicants, regardless of their community affiliations or background.
