**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **1. Activities/Tasks**  
- **Receive Invoice** (AP Clerk)  
- **Check for Valid PO** (AP Clerk)  
- **Log Invoice into System** (AP Clerk)  
- **Confirm Goods/Services Received** (Purchasing Officer)  
- **Compare Invoice Details to PO** (Purchasing Officer)  
- **Match Invoice to PO** (AP Clerk)  
- **Escalate Discrepancy** (AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer or AP Supervisor)  
- **Resolve Discrepancy** (Purchasing Officer, Supplier Relationship Manager, or AP Supervisor)  
- **Approve Invoice** (Department Manager)  
- **Schedule Payment** (AP Clerk)  
- **Handle Exceptions** (AP Supervisor): Retrospective PO creation, supplier coordination.  

---

### **2. Sequence Flow**  
1. **Start**: Invoice received via email.  
2. **Check for Valid PO**:  
   - **If NO PO**:  
     - *Send back to supplier* (End flow for this invoice).  
   - **If PO exists**:  
     - Log invoice into system.  
     - Forward to Purchasing Officer.  
3. **Purchasing Officer confirms goods/services received** and compares invoice details to PO.  
   - **If details match**: Send confirmation to AP Clerk.  
   - **If discrepancy**:  
     - Purchasing Officer contacts supplier or requests correction.  
     - *If unresolved*: Escalate to AP Supervisor.  
4. **AP Clerk matches invoice to PO** after confirmation.  
   - **If match confirmed**: Send to Department Manager for approval.  
   - **If mismatch**: Loop back to Purchasing Officer for clarification.  
5. **Department Manager reviews invoice**:  
   - **If approved**: Schedule payment.  
   - **If rejected**: Investigate (may involve AP Supervisor)  Loop back to earlier steps.  
6. **End**: Payment scheduled.

### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**  
- **Gateway 1 (Exclusive)**: PO exists?  
  - Yes  Log invoice.  
  - No  Return to supplier.  
- **Gateway 2 (Exclusive)**: Purchasing confirms details?  
  - Yes  Proceed to matching.  
  - No  Resolve discrepancy (with Supplier Relationship Manager or AP Supervisor).  
- **Gateway 3 (Exclusive)**: Invoice matches PO?  
  - Yes  Manager approval.  
  - No  Loop back to Purchasing.  
- **Gateway 4 (Exclusive)**: Manager approval granted?  
  - Yes  Schedule payment.  
  - No  Investigate  Loop back.  

---

### **4. Roles/Participants**  
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk**: Logs invoices, matches PO, escalates issues.  
- **Purchasing Officer**: Confirms receipt, validates invoice details.  
- **Department Manager**: Approves/rejects invoices.  
- **AP Supervisor**: Handles exceptions (missing POs, unresolved discrepancies).  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager**: Resolves supplier-side issues.  

---

### **5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Inputs**: Invoice (email), Purchase Order (PO).  
- **Outputs**: Approved invoice, Payment schedule, Corrected invoice, Retrospective PO.  
- **Data Objects**:  
  - PO reference number.  
  - Confirmation email (Purchasing  AP).  
  - Approval/rejection notification (Manager  AP).  

---

### **6. Exceptions/Variations**  
- **Missing PO**:  
  - Supplier is contacted for correction (AP Clerk or Supplier Relationship Manager).  
  - *Alternate path*: For informal services, AP Supervisor creates retrospective PO with department heads.  
- **Discrepancies in Invoice**:  
  - Purchasing Officer/Supplier Relationship Manager contacts supplier.  
  - If unresolved, AP Supervisor coordinates resolution.  
- **Manager Rejection**:  
  - Invoice is held for investigation (AP Clerk or Supervisor).  
  - May loop back to Purchasing or require retrospective adjustments.  

---

### **7. Ambiguities/Notes**  
- **Uncertainty in Escalation Path**:  
  - Some discrepancies are resolved directly by Purchasing, others require Supplier Relationship Manager or AP Supervisor. The trigger depends on severity (implied but not explicitly defined).  
- **Retrospective PO Handling**:  
  - Process for creating retrospective POs is described but lacks detail (e.g., approval steps for informal services).  
- **Post-Rejection Flow**:  
  - After Manager rejection, the investigation may involve AP Supervisor or loop back to Purchasing; exact path is context-dependent.

**Final Process Summary**  
```  
Start  Receive Invoice  [Gateway 1: PO?]  
   No  Return to Supplier (End)  
   Yes  Log Invoice  Forward to Purchasing  
     Confirm Receipt  [Gateway 2: Details Match?]  
       No  Resolve Discrepancy (Purchasing/Supplier/AP Supervisor)  Loop  
       Yes  Match Invoice  [Gateway 3: Match Confirmed?]  
         No  Loop to Purchasing  
         Yes  Manager Approval  [Gateway 4: Approved?]  
           No  Investigate  Loop  
           Yes  Schedule Payment  End  
```
