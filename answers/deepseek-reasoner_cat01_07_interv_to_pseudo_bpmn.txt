**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Roles/Participants**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)**  
- **Purchasing Officer**  
- **Department Manager**  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor**  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager**  
- **Supplier**  
- **System** (Accounting System, Email Notifications)  

---

### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Invoice** (received via email)  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  
- **Corrected Invoice** (from supplier)  
- **Retrospective PO** (created for exceptions)  
- **Confirmation Email** (from Purchasing)  
- **Approval Notification** (system-generated)  

---

### **Process Flow**  

1. **Start Event**: Invoice received via email.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **Artifact**: Invoice  

2. **Task 1**: Check for valid PO number.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive)**:  
     - **If PO is missing**:  
       - **Task 1a**: Send invoice back to supplier with a request for PO.  
         - **Role**: AP Clerk  
         - **Artifact**: Supplier notification.  
       - **End Event** (for this path): Supplier provides revised invoice with PO.  
     - **If PO exists**: Proceed to Task 2.  

3. **Task 2**: Log invoice into accounting system.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **Artifact**: Invoice logged in system.  

4. **Task 3**: Forward invoice to Purchasing Officer for goods/service receipt confirmation.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **System**: Email sent to Purchasing.  

5. **Task 4**: Purchasing Officer verifies invoice against PO (quantities, pricing, delivery).  
   - **Role**: Purchasing Officer  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive)**:  
     - **If discrepancy found**:  
       - **Task 4a**: Contact supplier directly *or* request AP Clerk to hold invoice.  
         - **Role**: Purchasing Officer/Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
         - **Artifact**: Corrected invoice (if supplier revises).  
       - **Loop**: Invoice returns to Task 4 for re-verification after correction.  
     - **If confirmed**: Proceed to Task 5.  

6. **Task 5**: AP Clerk matches invoice line items to PO in system.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive)**:  
     - **If mismatch persists**:  
       - **Task 5a**: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita).  
         - **Role**: AP Clerk  
         - **Exception Path**: AP Supervisor investigates (e.g., contacts supplier, coordinates retrospective PO).  
           - **Role**: AP Supervisor/Supplier Relationship Manager  
           - **Artifact**: Retrospective PO (if created).  
         - **Rejoin**: After resolution, return to Task 3 (Purchasing confirmation).  
     - **If matched**: Proceed to Task 6.  

7. **Task 6**: System sends approval request to Department Manager.  
   - **Role**: System  
   - **Artifact**: Approval notification.  

8. **Task 7**: Department Manager reviews invoice details (PO, budget alignment).  
   - **Role**: Department Manager  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive)**:  
     - **If rejected**:  
       - **Task 7a**: Request investigation (e.g., AP Clerk/Purchasing re-checks).  
         - **Loop**: Invoice returns to Task 5 (matching).  
     - **If approved**: Proceed to Task 8.  

9. **Task 8**: Schedule payment in accounting system.  
   - **Role**: AP Clerk  
   - **Artifact**: Payment scheduled.  

10. **End Event**: Invoice paid in next payment cycle.

### **Key Exceptions/Variations**  
1. **Missing PO Resolution**:  
   - Supplier may provide PO later, leading to a restart of the process (Task 1).  
   - For informal services, AP Supervisor creates retrospective PO (noted in Interview 4).  

2. **Discrepancy Resolution Paths**:  
   - Purchasing may contact the supplier directly *or* involve the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) for urgent cases (Interviews 2 and 5).  

3. **Escalation to AP Supervisor**:  
   - Occurs when discrepancies cannot be resolved by AP Clerk/Purchasing (Interviews 1 and 4).  

4. **Retrospective PO Creation**:  
   - Handled by AP Supervisor for non-PO invoices (Interview 4).  

---

### **Ambiguities/Uncertainties**  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager’s Involvement**: Karen’s role is optional and depends on the severity of the discrepancy (explicitly mentioned in Interview 5 but not consistently referenced by others).  
- **Timing of Retrospective PO Creation**: Unclear if this occurs before or after Purchasing confirmation (Interview 4 implies it happens during escalation).  
- **Post-Manager Rejection Path**: The exact steps for “investigation” (Interview 3) are vague; assumed to loop back to Task 5.  

---

### **Visualization Notes**  
- Use **exclusive gateways** for all decision points.  
- Highlight **exception paths** (e.g., escalation to AP Supervisor) with distinct colors or annotations.  
- Include **swimlanes** for roles: AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor.  
- **Artifacts** (invoices, POs) should flow between tasks as data objects.  

This model balances clarity with the interview data, flagging ambiguities for further validation.
