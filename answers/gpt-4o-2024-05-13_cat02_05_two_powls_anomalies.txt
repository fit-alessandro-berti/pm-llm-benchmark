### Analysis of POWL Models against the Standard "Hire-to-Retire" Process

The standard Hire-to-Retire process typically follows these steps:

1. **Post Job Advertisement**: Initiate the hiring process by posting a job ad.
2. **Screen Candidates**: Review applications to shortlist candidates.
3. **Conduct Interviews**: Interview the shortlisted candidates.
4. **Make Hiring Decision**: Decide which candidate to hire.
5. **Onboard Employee**: Introduce the new employee to the company.
6. **Add to Payroll**: Ensure the new employee is added to the payroll system.
7. **Close Case**: Finalize the hire and complete all administrative tasks.

### POWL Model 1 Analysis

#### Model Structure and Order:
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

#### Identified Anomalies:
1. **Concurrently Screening and Interviewing (Screen  Interview)**: In a standard process, candidates are typically screened before interviews occur. Having these two actions concurrently could lead to scenarios where either screening is ineffective (since interviews are conducted prematurely) or resources are unnecessarily allocated to interviews of unfit candidates.
2. **Missing Decision Node after Interview**: In this model, there is no defined edge indicating that a hiring decision follows directly after interviews. This step is crucial for ensuring the right candidate is hired based on the interviews.

### POWL Model 2 Analysis

#### Model Structure and Order:
```python
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

#### Identified Anomalies:
1. **Concurrent Screening and Interviewing (Post  Screen and Post  Interview)**: Similar to Model 1, this allows interviews to take place without initial screening.
2. **Loop in Onboarding (Onboard  Skip)**: This may introduce delays or repetitions in onboarding, complicating resource allocation and possibly delaying the employee's integration into the company.
3. **Skipping Payroll Addition (XOR: Payroll, Skip)**: The option to skip payroll addition can lead to critical operational issues, like the employee not receiving the payroll, which is a fundamental anomaly.

### Comparisons and Conclusion

#### Model 1 Pros:
1. **Onboarding Sequence Defined**: Clearly indicates that onboarding follows a hiring decision.
2. **No Skipping**: Ensures all main activities are processed (no skipping onboarding or payroll).

#### Model 1 Cons:
1. **Parallel Path for Screen and Interview**: This affects process efficiency and may create resource conflicts.

#### Model 2 Pros:
1. **Loop and Choice Operators**: Introduce flexibility in handling exceptional cases.
  
#### Model 2 Cons:
1. **Concurrently Screening and Interviewing**: Same issue as Model 1.
2. **Loop in Onboarding**: Potentially delays onboarding.
3. **Skipping Payroll**: This is a critical anomaly, as it can lead to financial and legal issues.

#### Conclusion
**Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process.** This choice is justified as Model 1 ensures a structured flow from posting the job to closing the case, without the critical anomaly of skipping payroll addition. Despite allowing parallel screening and interviewing, this deviation is less severe compared to Model 2, where fundamental onboarding and payroll actions can be bypassed, threatening the integrity of the hiring process.
