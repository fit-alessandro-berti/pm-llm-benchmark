### **1. Identification of Issues with the Current Model**

| **Issue #** | **Affected Activities** | **Problem Description** | **Desired Behavior** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `create_po` before `receive_goods`, `receive_invoice`, `match_invoice`, `pay_invoice` | Allowed in parallel, potentially leading to `create_po` not being a precursor | `create_po` **must** precede all |
| 2 | `receive_goods` and `receive_invoice` | Can occur in any order, potentially allowing invoice receipt before goods | `receive_goods` **should** precede `receive_invoice` |
| 3 | `match_invoice` and `pay_invoice` | Can occur out of order with other steps and with each other | `match_invoice` **must** precede `pay_invoice` |
| 4 | All steps within the parallel block | Lack of enforcement of logical sequence | Enforce a specific, logical sequence for the entire "Procure-to-Pay" process |

### **2. Corrected Process Tree Model**

To address the issues, we will replace the parallel block with a sequence, ensuring activities occur in the intended order. We'll also maintain the initial sequence for requisition creation and approval.

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities (Remain the same)
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure:
#Initial sequence remains the same, followed by a new, ordered sequence for the rest
corrected_sequence = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_po,  # 1. Create PO after requisition approval
    receive_goods,  # 2. Receive goods before invoice
    receive_invoice,  # 3. Then receive invoice
    match_invoice,  # 4. Match invoice to PO before payment
    pay_invoice  # 5. Finally, pay the invoice
])

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[create_req, approve_req, corrected_sequence, close_case])
```

### **3. Explanation of the Updated Process Tree**

#### **Conformance to Domain Logic:**

1. **Sequential Enforcement**: The model now strictly enforces the domain-appropriate sequence:
   - `Create_Purchase_Requisition`  `Approve_Purchase_Requisition`
   - Followed by `Create_Purchase_Order`, which must precede all subsequent steps.
   - `Receive_Goods` before `Receive_Invoice`, ensuring logical flow.
   - `Match_Invoice_to_PO` precedes `Pay_Invoice`, preventing payment without verification.

2. **Prevention of Unwanted Behavior**:

   - **No Parallel Execution of Dependent Steps**: By using a sequence, steps like `Pay_Invoice` cannot occur before `Receive_Goods` or `Match_Invoice_to_PO`.
   - **Ordered Execution**: Ensures that each step completes before the next, appropriate one begins, adhering to the "Procure-to-Pay" process logic.
   - **Reduced Risk of Errors**: The structured sequence minimizes the chance of human or systemic errors by following a well-defined, industry-standard workflow.

#### **Key Improvements:**

| **Aspect** | **Before** | **After** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Order of Operations** | Partially Enforced | Fully Enforced Sequence |
| **Dependency Respect** | Not Always | Always Respected |
| **Conformity to Domain Logic** | Underfitting | Fully Compliant |
