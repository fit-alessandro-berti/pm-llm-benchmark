Of course. As a Process Mining Consultant, here is a comprehensive approach to analyze Speedy Parcels' operations and propose data-driven improvements.

***

### **Executive Summary for Speedy Parcels**

This proposal outlines a process mining initiative designed to address Speedy Parcels' core challenges of late deliveries and rising operational costs. By leveraging the rich event data from your GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance systems, we can move from suspicion to certainty regarding operational inefficiencies. This project will discover your *actual* delivery processes, pinpoint the exact location and financial impact of bottlenecks, perform a root cause analysis, and deliver a set of actionable, data-driven strategies for optimization. The goal is to enhance punctuality, reduce costs, and build a foundation for continuous operational improvement.

### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

The first step is to create a single, unified view of your end-to-end delivery process.

#### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**

Before any analysis, we must transform the raw data from your four disparate systems into a cohesive event log. This involves:

*   **Correlation:** We will integrate the data sources by establishing common identifiers. The primary `Case ID` will be **Vehicle-Day** (e.g., `V12-20241205`), which represents a single vehicle's shift. This allows us to link a driver's shift start, the assigned route, all GPS movements, every delivery scan, and any maintenance events for that vehicle on that day. Package-level events (`P9876`) will be treated as attributes within the main case.
*   **Activity Abstraction:** We need to define a consistent set of activities. Raw GPS data (e.g., "location update every 15 seconds") is too granular. We will abstract this into meaningful business activities:
    *   **Travel:** A sequence of "moving" GPS events between two significant stops (e.g., from `Depart Customer` to `Arrive Customer`).
    *   **Service Time:** The duration between `Arrive Customer` and `Depart Customer`.
    *   **Depot Handling:** The time between `Arrive Depot` and `Depart Depot`.
    *   **Traffic Delay:** Inferred when a vehicle's speed drops below a threshold (e.g., < 10 km/h) for a significant duration on a major roadway, outside of a customer location.
    *   **Unscheduled Stop:** A period of being idle at a non-customer, non-depot location.
*   **Data Enrichment:** We will enrich the log by using location data to add context. For example, reverse geocoding can determine if an `Unscheduled Stop` occurred at a gas station, a coffee shop, or a known traffic congestion zone.

**Potential Challenges:**
*   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Clocks across different systems (GPS vs. Scanner) may have slight drifts. We will need to apply logic to order events correctly and account for minor discrepancies.
*   **Data Gaps:** GPS signals can be lost in urban canyons or tunnels. We will use interpolation logic to create a more complete picture of a vehicle's journey.
*   **Defining "Stops":** We need clear rules to differentiate a stop for delivery from a stop in traffic. This will be done by correlating GPS idle time with scanner events.

#### **Process Discovery**

Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner), we will generate a visual process map from the event log. This map will not show how you *think* the process works, but how it **actually** works in reality. It will clearly visualize:
*   The main "happy path" of a successful delivery day.
*   All variations, including failed delivery loops (where a driver must return later or the next day).
*   The frequency of unexpected deviations like `Unscheduled Stop` or `Vehicle Breakdown`.
*   Parallel activities, such as a driver organizing packages in the van while traveling.

#### **Conformance Checking**

We will formally compare the discovered *actual* process against the *planned* process. The **planned route from the dispatch system** will serve as our "to-be" model (e.g., Depot -> Stop 1 -> Stop 2 -> ... -> Stop 35 -> Depot).

Conformance checking will highlight key deviations, including:
*   **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers visiting stops in a different order than planned. We will quantify how often this happens and correlate it with on-time performance.
*   **Unplanned Activities:** Identifying all stops and activities that were not in the dispatch plan (e.g., personal stops, unscheduled maintenance, returning to the depot mid-shift).
*   **Skipped Activities:** Planned stops that were never visited.
*   **Timing Deviations:** This is critical. We will compare the *planned* travel and service time for each leg of the journey against the *actual* time taken. A consistent, significant negative deviation here is a primary cause of late deliveries.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

With a reliable process model, we can overlay performance data to identify where time and money are being lost.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

We will calculate the following KPIs directly from the event log:
*   **On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate:** `(Number of deliveries where 'Arrive Customer' timestamp is within the customer-requested time window) / (Total deliveries)`.
*   **Average Time per Stop (Service Time):** The average duration from `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer`. We will analyze this by location type (residential vs. business, house vs. apartment).
*   **Travel vs. Service Time Ratio:** The percentage of a driver's shift spent actively driving versus servicing customers. A high travel ratio suggests routing or traffic issues.
*   **Cost per Delivery:** Estimated by combining driver time (based on shift duration), fuel consumption (estimated from travel distance, speed, and idle time), and a portion of vehicle maintenance costs.
*   **Failed Delivery Rate:** `(Number of 'Delivery Failed' events) / (Total delivery attempts)`. We will also calculate the cost of each failure (time spent on the attempt + cost of re-delivery).
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** `(Time vehicle is on a route) / (Total shift time)`. Low utilization points to excessive time at the depot.
*   **Traffic Delay Impact:** Total time per day/route spent in "Traffic Delay" status, allowing us to quantify the cost of congestion.

#### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**

We will use the following techniques to pinpoint bottlenecks:
*   **Duration Analysis on Process Map:** The process map will be animated to show where time is spent. Activities and transitions with the longest average durations (e.g., travel between specific zones, service time in dense apartment complexes) will be highlighted in red, immediately drawing attention to the primary bottlenecks.
*   **Geospatial Analysis (Heatmaps):** By plotting events like `Low Speed Detected`, `Unscheduled Stop`, and long `Service Time` on a map, we can identify geographical traffic hotspots, problematic delivery areas, and common locations for unplanned driver stops.
*   **Time-of-Day Analysis:** We will filter the process analysis by hour of the day to see how bottlenecks shift. For example, "Travel Time" might be the main bottleneck during morning rush hour (7-9 AM), while "Finding Parking/Service Time" could be the bottleneck in commercial districts during lunch hour (12-2 PM).
*   **Resource-Based Filtering:** We can compare performance across different drivers, vehicle types, or routes to see if bottlenecks are specific to a particular resource. For instance, is one driver consistently slower, or does one vehicle model break down more often?

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

Identifying a bottleneck is the first step; understanding *why* it exists is key to solving it.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
    *   **Symptom:** High conformance deviations in route sequence and timing. High Travel vs. Service Time ratio.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** We will perform variant analysis, comparing the process models of the most punctual routes against the least punctual. If top performers consistently deviate from the plan in a *specific, repeatable way*, it suggests their "on-the-ground" knowledge is superior to the static plan. This indicates the routing algorithm's assumptions (e.g., travel times) are incorrect.

*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion:**
    *   **Symptom:** Long travel durations and `Low Speed Detected` events concentrated in specific areas and times.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** By correlating our identified traffic hotspots with the planned routes, we can see if the dispatch system is repeatedly sending drivers through known congested areas during peak times. The root cause is a lack of dynamic, real-time traffic data in the planning phase.

*   **High Service Time Variability:**
    *   **Symptom:** "Service Time" is a major bottleneck, but with high variance.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** We will analyze the attributes of stops with long service times. Are they apartment buildings requiring elevator use? Businesses with complex receiving docks? Locations with known parking difficulties? This analysis will segment "service time" into its constituent parts (e.g., park, walk to door, customer interaction, walk back) to find the true source of delay.

*   **Vehicle Breakdowns:**
    *   **Symptom:** Frequent `Unscheduled Stop` events followed by `Maintenance Log` entries.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** We will correlate maintenance events with vehicle attributes (model, age) and usage patterns (kilometers driven, engine hours, number of stops/starts from the event log). This can reveal if certain vehicle models are unreliable or if the current mileage-based maintenance schedule is inadequate for the high-intensity use of city driving.

*   **Failed Delivery Attempts:**
    *   **Symptom:** A high frequency of the `Delivery Failed` -> `Re-attempt` loop in the process model.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** We'll analyze the notes and timing for failed deliveries. Are they concentrated in residential areas during standard working hours? This points to a misalignment between delivery schedules and customer availability. The root cause is a lack of proactive customer communication and flexible delivery options.

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

Based on the analysis, we propose the following three data-driven strategies:

#### **Strategy 1: Implement Predictive & Dynamic Routing**

*   **Target:** Inefficient routes, traffic delays, and high fuel consumption.
*   **Root Cause:** Static route plans that do not account for historical performance and real-time conditions.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Predictive Model:** Use the six months of historical process data to build a predictive travel time model. This model will know that a specific street is slow on weekday mornings but clear on Saturdays, providing far more accurate ETA predictions than standard mapping software.
    2.  **Dynamic Re-routing:** Integrate the dispatch system with a real-time traffic data feed. When an unexpected delay (accident, new congestion) is detected, the system should be able to automatically re-sequence upcoming stops for the affected driver to optimize the remainder of the route.
*   **Data Support:** Conformance checking shows planned times are inaccurate. Heatmaps identify predictable traffic hotspots that static plans ignore.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Improved OTD Rate, reduced Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, lower fuel consumption per delivery.

#### **Strategy 2: Develop a Predictive Maintenance Program**

*   **Target:** Unscheduled vehicle downtime, mid-shift breakdowns, and associated repair costs.
*   **Root Cause:** A reactive or one-size-fits-all maintenance schedule that doesn't match the actual operational stress on vehicles.
*   **Proposal:** Transition from a purely mileage-based schedule to a predictive one. By analyzing the event log data on `engine-on hours`, `number of stops/starts` (which causes wear on brakes and starters), and `idle time`, we can create a "vehicle stress score." We will then correlate this score with historical breakdown data to predict which vehicles are at highest risk and schedule maintenance *proactively* before a failure occurs.
*   **Data Support:** The correlation analysis between vehicle usage patterns and maintenance log entries will identify the key leading indicators of failure.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Increased Vehicle Utilization Rate, reduced frequency of `Unscheduled Stops`, lower emergency repair costs, and improved route reliability.

#### **Strategy 3: Optimize Service Time and Reduce Failed Deliveries**

*   **Target:** Long, variable service times and the costly loop of failed delivery attempts.
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of standardized best practices and poor alignment of delivery times with customer presence.
*   **Proposal:**
    1.  **Targeted Driver Coaching:** Use variant analysis to identify the exact behaviors of top-performing drivers (e.g., they spend less time at the stop, their GPS track shows they park more efficiently). Turn these data-driven insights into a "Best Practices" training module for all drivers.
    2.  **Proactive Customer Communication:** Analyze the failed delivery data to identify patterns (e.g., "high failure rate in ZIP code X between 1-3 PM"). Use this to enhance customer notifications, providing tighter, more accurate delivery windows ("Your delivery is 3 stops away, arriving in 15-25 mins"). This drastically increases the likelihood the customer is available.
*   **Data Support:** Process mining will quantify the time and cost of failed deliveries. Variant analysis will provide the data for what "good" performance looks like.
*   **Expected KPI Impact:** Reduced Average Time per Stop, significantly lower Failed Delivery Rate, and improved customer satisfaction scores.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Accounting for Constraints**

All proposed strategies will be implemented with your operational realities in mind:
*   **Driver Working Hours:** Dynamic re-routing algorithms will treat driver hours-of-service regulations as a hard constraint, never creating a route that would cause a violation.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route optimization will always respect the physical and weight capacity of each vehicle.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** These will remain a primary constraint. The goal of our optimizations is not to ignore these windows, but to create routes that meet them more reliably and efficiently.

#### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**

Implementation is not the end. We will establish a continuous monitoring framework using process mining dashboards to ensure improvements are sustained.

*   **Executive KPI Dashboard:** A high-level view tracking the core KPIs (OTD Rate, Cost per Delivery, etc.) over time with pre- and post-implementation trend lines.
*   **Operational Conformance Dashboard:** Monitored by dispatchers, this will show near real-time route conformance. It can flag a driver who is deviating significantly from the optimized route or falling behind schedule, allowing for proactive intervention.
*   **Performance Deep-Dive Dashboard:** For analysts to continuously explore performance by region, driver, time of day, and other dimensions to identify new, emerging bottlenecks before they become critical problems.

This ongoing monitoring transforms process mining from a one-time project into a continuous, data-driven management capability for Speedy Parcels.
