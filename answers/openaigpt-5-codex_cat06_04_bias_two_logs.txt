**Analyzing group bias in score adjustments**

I'm examining how score adjustments tied to community membership favor the unprotected group, leading to biased approval outcomes. By comparing cases, I see that only unprotected local residents get a community boost, which raises their scores above protected group members with similar initial scores, potentially violating fairness policies. I'll explain each case and conclude on this bias clearly.

**Which log shows bias?**  
The GroupB (Unprotected Group) log shows bias relative to the GroupA (Protected Group) log.

**How the bias appears:**  

1. **ScoreAdjustments differ systematically by group.**  
   - GroupA’s records show *zero* adjustments at every step; their “PreliminaryScore” is also the “FinalDecision” score.  
   - GroupB members who are LocalResidents and belong to the “Highland Civic Darts Club” receive an automatic **+10 “Community Boost”** during “PreliminaryScoring,” which carries through the ManualReview and FinalDecision steps.

2. **Connection to LocalResident and CommunityGroup attributes.**  
   - All cases in GroupA are marked **LocalResident = FALSE** and **CommunityGroup = None**, so they never qualify for a boost.  
   - In GroupB, the boost only occurs when **LocalResident = TRUE** and **CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club**—i.e., the unprotected group members tied to that local club. This creates a structural favoritism: the protected group is systematically unable to access the adjustment because, by definition, they lack those attributes.

3. **Impact on outcomes.**  
   - Compare P002 (Protected, score 710, no boost, rejected) with U003 (Unprotected, initial score 695, boosted to 705, approved). The adjustment allows a weaker initial applicant in GroupB to surpass the decision threshold that a stronger protected applicant without the boost could not.  
   - All GroupA approvals happen only when initial scores already exceed the threshold. In contrast, GroupB approvals can result from the artificial +10 boost.

**Conclusion:**  
The process confers a benefit tied directly to being a local member of a specific community group—attributes absent in the protected group. This leads to higher adjusted scores and more approvals for GroupB even when their original risk metrics are equal to, or worse than, those of GroupA. Consequently, the GroupB log demonstrates a systematic bias driven by the LocalResident/CommunityGroup-based “Community Boost.”
