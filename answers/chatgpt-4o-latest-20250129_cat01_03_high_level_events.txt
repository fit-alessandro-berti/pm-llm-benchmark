### **High-Level Process Steps and Groupings**

#### **1. Material Preparation**
   **Includes:**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet  
   - Scan barcode  
   - Place metal sheet on table  
   - Align metal sheet  
   - Preheat metal sheet  

   **Rationale:**  
   These steps are focused on preparing the raw material before any transformation occurs. The activities involve identifying the correct part, positioning it properly, and ensuring it is in optimal condition for the next stage.

---

#### **2. Assembly & Welding**
   **Includes:**
   - Pick up welding tool  
   - Weld corner A  
   - Weld corner B  

   **Rationale:**  
   These steps constitute the actual assembly process where components are joined together. The sequence starts with tool selection and continues through the welding process, forming a cohesive unit of actions.

---

#### **3. Quality Inspection**
   **Includes:**
   - Measure weld integrity  

   **Rationale:**  
   This step ensures that the welding process was performed correctly. A quality sensor assesses the integrity of the weld, which is a crucial step before proceeding to final treatments.

---

#### **4. Surface Treatment**
   **Includes:**
   - Apply protective coating  
   - Dry coating  

   **Rationale:**  
   These activities involve finishing treatments applied to the assembled part to enhance durability and resistance. The coating process and drying are closely related and occur sequentially.

---

#### **5. Final Inspection**
   **Includes:**
   - Visual check  

   **Rationale:**  
   This step represents the final assessment of the completed part. A human operator performs a visual inspection to ensure that all prior processes were completed correctly and that the part meets quality standards.
