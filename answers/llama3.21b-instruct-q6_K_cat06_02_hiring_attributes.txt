Upon analyzing the given event log and attributes, I've identified a few sensitive attributes that may impact fairness in certain contexts:

1. **Case (Citizen)**: This attribute indicates whether the process is for citizens (true) or non-citizens (false). Citizens might receive more favorable treatment due to potential biases against their background.
2. **Resource**: The resource attribute identifies specific resources being utilized, such as an HR dummy (`HR-dummy`), a Senior Partner (`Senior Partner`), or an Online System (`Online System`). These attributes may provide context about the interactions and could influence fairness scores.

**Suggestions for improving fairness:**

1.  Provide attribute-wise fairness metrics to track changes over time.
2.  Use techniques like debiasing or fairness-aware feature selection to minimize bias in models relying on sensitive attributes.

Implement these suggestions, alongside thorough evaluation of their effectiveness, to develop a more transparent and equitable data analysis approach.
