### **Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process**

We will evaluate each case against the normative process description, focusing on:

- The correct sequence of activities.
- Conditional branching based on inventory sufficiency.
- Forbidden sequences (e.g., shipping after cancellation).
- Required ordering (e.g., payment authorization before packaging).

---

## **Case 1: Valid**

**Sequence:**  
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

 **Compliant with normative process.**  
All steps are in the correct order:
- Inventory checked before payment.
- Payment authorized before packaging.
- Packaging done before shipping.
- Closed last.

No violations.

## **Case 2: Violation**

**Sequence:**  
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

 **Violation:** *Packaging occurs before payment authorization.*

According to the normative description:
> "...the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment..."

This implies that **payment must be authorized before packaging**. In Case 2, "Package items" occurs at 10:00 while "Authorize payment" happens at 10:30, which violates this rule.

---

## **Case 3: Violation**

**Sequence:**  
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

 **Two Violations:**

1. **Payment authorization after decision to cancel:**  
   Although payment is authorized before cancellation, this itself may not be a direct violation, depending on interpretation. However, it's unusual and potentially inefficient — payment should ideally not be authorized if the system already knows the order will be canceled.

2. **Shipping after cancellation:**  
   > "It would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping) [after cancellation]."

   Clearly violated here: "Cancel order" is followed by "Ship order", which is explicitly forbidden.

Thus, **Case 3 violates the rule that no fulfillment steps (including shipping) should occur after an order has been canceled.**

---

## **Case 4: Valid**

**Sequence:**  
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

 **Compliant with normative process.**  
Matches the expected flow when inventory is insufficient:
- Inventory checked.
- Canceled due to lack of stock.
- Order closed without fulfillment steps.

No violations.

---

## **Case 5: Violation**

**Sequence:**  
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

 **Violation:** *Items shipped without being packaged.*

The normative process states:
> "...the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'"

In Case 5, there is **no "Package items" activity**, yet "Ship order" occurs. This is a clear violation of the required sequence.

##  Summary of Findings

| Case ID | Compliant? | Violations Identified |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| 1      | Yes        | None                   |
| 2      | No         | Packaging before payment authorization |
| 3      | No         | Shipping after cancellation |
| 4      | Yes        | None                   |
| 5      | No         | Shipping without packaging |

##  Final Answer

### **Cases That Deviate from the Normative Process:**

#### **Case 2**
- **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment".
- **Rule Broken:** Payment must be authorized before packaging.

#### **Case 3**
- **Violation(s):**
  - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
  - Potentially questionable timing of payment authorization after knowing cancellation is imminent.
- **Rule Broken:** No fulfillment actions (like shipping) should happen after cancellation.

#### **Case 5**
- **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items".
- **Rule Broken:** Items must be packaged before shipment.

### **Conclusion**
Only **Cases 1 and 4** fully comply with the normative process model. The remaining cases show deviations in the logical sequence of fulfillment steps, particularly around payment, packaging, cancellation, and shipping.
