Below is a concise, actionable breakdown.

1) What is anomalous in the POWL model

- Loop between E and P with the order LOOP(E, P):
  - Approve (P) acts like a redo, so P can happen repeatedly.
  - The loop can exit only after an E, so the last step in the loop is E, not P.
  - It is possible to have no P at all (exit right after an E), hence Notify/Close can happen without any approval.
- XOR(N, skip):
  - Customer notification is optional and can be skipped entirely.
- Partial order choices:
  - Edges are RA, Aloop, loopxor, and AC. There is no xorC edge.
  - Because C only depends on A, closing can occur before loop/xor complete (e.g., before evaluation, approval, or notification).
  - It is therefore possible to see E or P occur after C in the event log (post-closure activity), or N happen after C, or N never happen at all.

2) Plausible hypotheses for why these anomalies exist

- Business rule changes only partially implemented:
  - Example: fast-track or low-value claims allowed to skip approval and/or notification, but the model wasn’t cleanly split to handle this variant.
- Process rework and reversals:
  - Multiple rounds of evaluation and approval intended for rework, but modeled as EP loop in a way that makes final P optional.
- Miscommunication during modeling:
  - Modeler assumed “redo” after evaluation should be labeled “approve,” producing multiple P’s and preventing P from being the final step.
- Tooling limitations or technical errors:
  - Partial order used to allow “flexibility,” inadvertently enabling closure after assignment without ensuring upstream steps are done.
  - XOR with silent transition used as a shortcut to model “optional notification,” but no compensating control to guard misuse.
- System integration quirks:
  - Automated systems may emit repeated P events on status updates; notification might be emitted in external channels not captured as N events.

3) How to verify using the database (PostgreSQL queries)

Notes:
- Use ce."timestamp" to avoid ambiguity (column name matches a type).
- If multiple events share the same timestamp, add event_id to ORDER BY as a tie-breaker where relevant.

Core anomaly checks

A. Claims closed before evaluation and/or approval
Identify claims where C occurred before any E and/or any P.

SQL:
with ctime as (
  select claim_id, min("timestamp") as c_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
  group by claim_id
)
select c.claim_id, c.c_time,
       exists (select 1 from claim_events e
               where e.claim_id = c.claim_id and e.activity = 'E' and e."timestamp" <= c.c_time) as has_e_before_close,
       exists (select 1 from claim_events p
               where p.claim_id = c.claim_id and p.activity = 'P' and p."timestamp" <= c.c_time) as has_p_before_close
from ctime c
where not exists (select 1 from claim_events e
                  where e.claim_id = c.claim_id and e.activity = 'E' and e."timestamp" <= c.c_time)
   or not exists (select 1 from claim_events p
                  where p.claim_id = c.claim_id and p.activity = 'P' and p."timestamp" <= c.c_time)
order by c.c_time;

B. Approvals occurring multiple times
SQL:
select claim_id, count(*) as approvals
from claim_events
where activity = 'P'
group by claim_id
having count(*) > 1
order by approvals desc, claim_id;

C. Evaluate repeated with no approval at all (loop exit without P)
SQL:
select claim_id,
       count(*) filter (where activity = 'E') as e_cnt,
       count(*) filter (where activity = 'P') as p_cnt
from claim_events
group by claim_id
having count(*) filter (where activity = 'P') = 0
   and count(*) filter (where activity = 'E') > 0
order by e_cnt desc;

D. Last of {E,P} is E (evidence that P is not the final decision step)
SQL:
with last_ep as (
  select claim_id,
         max("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'E') as last_e,
         max("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'P') as last_p
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, last_e, last_p
from last_ep
where last_e is not null and (last_p is null or last_e > last_p)
order by claim_id;

E. Notification skipped before closing (N missing or occurs after C)
SQL:
with ctime as (
  select claim_id, min("timestamp") as c_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
  group by claim_id
)
select c.claim_id, c.c_time
from ctime c
left join claim_events n
  on n.claim_id = c.claim_id
 and n.activity = 'N'
 and n."timestamp" <= c.c_time
where n.event_id is null
order by c.c_time;

F. Activities after closure (E/P/N after C)
SQL:
with ctime as (
  select claim_id, min("timestamp") as c_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
  group by claim_id
)
select distinct e.claim_id, c.c_time, e.activity, e."timestamp" as activity_time
from ctime c
join claim_events e
  on e.claim_id = c.claim_id
 and e.activity in ('E', 'P', 'N')
 and e."timestamp" > c.c_time
order by e.claim_id, e."timestamp";

G. Claims closed without notification at all (overall rate)
SQL:
with closed as (
  select distinct claim_id
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
)
select
  count(*) as total_closed,
  sum(case when exists (select 1 from claim_events n where n.claim_id = cl.claim_id and n.activity = 'N') then 1 else 0 end) as with_any_notification,
  sum(case when not exists (select 1 from claim_events n where n.claim_id = cl.claim_id and n.activity = 'N') then 1 else 0 end) as without_any_notification
from closed cl;

Ordering and prerequisite sanity checks

H. Evaluate before Assign (should never happen per model; checks data quality)
SQL:
with times as (
  select claim_id,
         min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'A') as a_time,
         min("timestamp") filter (where activity = 'E') as e_first_time
  from claim_events
  group by claim_id
)
select claim_id, a_time, e_first_time
from times
where e_first_time is not null and (a_time is null or e_first_time < a_time)
order by e_first_time;

I. Close before Assign (should not happen even in this model)
SQL:
with atime as (
  select claim_id, min("timestamp") as a_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'A'
  group by claim_id
),
ctime as (
  select claim_id, min("timestamp") as c_time
  from claim_events
  where activity = 'C'
  group by claim_id
)
select c.claim_id, a.a_time, c.c_time
from ctime c
left join atime a on a.claim_id = c.claim_id
where a.a_time is null or c.c_time < a.a_time
order by c.c_time;

Adjuster-related checks (uses adjusters table)

J. Multiple adjuster assignments for the same claim
SQL:
select claim_id, count(*) as assign_count
from claim_events
where activity = 'A'
group by claim_id
having count(*) > 1
order by assign_count desc;

K. Assignment to unknown adjuster names (resource not in adjusters)
SQL:
select ce.claim_id, ce."timestamp" as a_time, ce.resource as adjuster_name
from claim_events ce
left join adjusters ad on ad.name = ce.resource
where ce.activity = 'A' and ad.adjuster_id is null
order by ce."timestamp";

L. Specialization mismatch: adjuster specialization vs claim_type
Assumes mapping: claim_type like '%home%'  'home'; '%auto%'  'auto'.

SQL:
with assignments as (
  select ce.claim_id, ce."timestamp" as a_time, ce.resource as adjuster_name
  from claim_events ce
  where ce.activity = 'A'
),
expected as (
  select claim_id,
         case
           when claim_type ilike '%home%' then 'home'
           when claim_type ilike '%auto%' then 'auto'
           else null
         end as expected_spec
  from claims
)
select a.claim_id, a.adjuster_name, ad.specialization, e.expected_spec
from assignments a
join expected e on e.claim_id = a.claim_id
left join adjusters ad on ad.name = a.adjuster_name
where ad.specialization is distinct from e.expected_spec
   or ad.specialization is null
order by a.claim_id, a.a_time;

Optional: quick variant extraction for manual inspection

M. Reconstruct the activity sequence per claim to spot out-of-order patterns
SQL:
select claim_id,
       string_agg(activity, '->' order by "timestamp", event_id) as trace
from claim_events
group by claim_id;

What the results will tell you

- A/E/P vs C timing: If many claims appear in A/F/I with C before E/P or activities after C, the partial-order anomaly is happening in practice and not just in the model.
- P multiplicity and last EP step: If B and D flag many cases, it supports the “P used as redo” loop semantics in the model or repeated auto-approvals in the system.
- Notification behavior: E/G show whether N is routinely skipped or happens late, consistent with XOR(N, skip).
- Adjuster checks: J/K/L can surface operational data issues that often co-occur with partial-order flexibilities (e.g., reassignments, unknown resources, or wrong specialization).

If you confirm these patterns in the data, consider tightening the model:
- Model “Evaluate” in a loop by itself (repeat E) followed by a single P, then N, then C.
- Add an explicit xorC order, or better, loopxorC edges only.
- Remove AC or guard it with a “withdrawal/cancel” path that is clearly modeled and monitored.
