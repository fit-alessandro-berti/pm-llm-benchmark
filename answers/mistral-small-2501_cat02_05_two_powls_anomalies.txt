### Analysis of POWL Models

#### Standard Hire-to-Retire Process:
1. **Post_Job_Ad**
2. **Screen_Candidates**
3. **Conduct_Interviews**
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision**
5. **Onboard_Employee**
6. **Add_to_Payroll**
7. **Close_Case**

### POWL Model 1

**POWL Model 1:**
```python
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Decide, Interview, Onboard, Payroll, Close])
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies in Model 1:**
1. **Interviewing Before Decision:** The model allows `Interview` to occur before `Decide`. This is non-standard because typically, the decision to hire is made only after interviews are conducted. However, in some processes, this might be acceptable if the decision is made in stages.
2. **Potential Parallel Execution:** The partial order allows `Interview` and `Decide` to be executed in parallel or in any order after `Screen`. This might not align with a sequential decision-making process where interviews lead to a decision.

### POWL Model 2

**POWL Model 2:**
```python
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close])
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies in Model 2:**
1. **Concurrent Screening and Interviewing:** The model starts both `Screen` and `Interview` after `Post`, which is not typical. Usually, screening happens first to filter out candidates before conducting interviews.
2. **Onboarding Loop:** The `loop_onboarding` operator allows the `Onboard` activity to loop, which is not typical in a hiring process. Onboarding should be a one-time activity.
3. **XOR for Payroll:** The `xor_payroll` operator introduces the possibility of skipping the `Payroll` activity, which is a critical step and should not be skipped.

### Decision and Justification

**Which Model is More Normative?**

**Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process. Despite the anomaly of potentially conducting interviews before making a hiring decision, this model maintains a more logical and sequential flow compared to Model 2. The anomalies in Model 1 are less severe and more likely to be acceptable in a real-world scenario, as they involve potential parallelism and staging of the interview and decision-making process.

**Model 2**, on the other hand, introduces significant anomalies, such as the possibility of concurrent screening and interviewing, the looping of onboarding, and the possibility of skipping the payroll step. These anomalies fundamentally violate the essence of a typical hiring process, making the model less reliable and more prone to errors.

**Conclusion:**

Model 1 is more normative and aligns better with the expected sequence and logic of a Hire-to-Retire process. Despite some deviations, the sequence and structure are more logical and less prone to critical errors compared to Model 2.
