Based on the hiring process description, I'll create two POWL models that capture the workflow with and without the potential for unfairness.

## POWL Model 1: With Potential Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Create XOR branch for cultural evaluation (source of potential bias)
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# Create the main workflow with partial order
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_xor, 
                                        manager_review, final_decision])

# Define the order
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, manager_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## POWL Model 2: Without Unfairness

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assess = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_check, request_info])

# Create the main workflow with partial order (no XOR branch)
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_app, data_loop, skill_assess, cultural_fit, 
                                      manager_review, final_decision])

# Define the order
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assess)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assess, cultural_fit)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

## Key Differences:

1. **Model 1 (With Unfairness)**: Contains an XOR choice operator after the skill assessment that allows applicants to go through either:
   - A standard `CulturalFitCheck` path, or
   - A `CommunityAffiliationCheck` path that provides implicit advantages to certain applicants

2. **Model 2 (Without Unfairness)**: Removes the XOR branching entirely. All applicants follow the same sequential path through a uniform `CulturalFitCheck`, ensuring no one receives preferential treatment based on community affiliations.

Both models maintain the loop structure for data completeness checking (where incomplete applications trigger a `RequestMoreInfo` activity before proceeding) and the sequential flow through the hiring stages. The critical difference is the presence or absence of the discriminatory XOR branch that enables bias in the evaluation process.
