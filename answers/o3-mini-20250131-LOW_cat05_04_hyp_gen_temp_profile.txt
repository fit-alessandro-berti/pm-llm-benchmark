Anomalies in the temporal profile model include:

• R  P (Receive to Approve): An average duration of about 25 hours with an extremely tight standard deviation suggests that approvals are occurring on a highly fixed schedule. This might mean that:
– Approvals are automated or synchronized with an external system independent of the actual claim complexity.
– Claims are purposely batched for approval at preset times, causing artificially uniform intervals.

• P  N (Approve to Notify): An average delay of 7 days coupled with a large variability (STDEV of 2 days) indicates inconsistency. Possible explanations include:
– Bottlenecks in customer notification processes, perhaps due to weekends or holidays.
– Fluctuating workload or resource availability causing a backlog in notifications.
– Manual intervention needed for notification that leads to delays during peak periods.

• A  C (Assign to Close): A 2hour turnaround from assign to close might be too short to allow for thorough evaluation, suggesting that:
– Claims are sometimes closed without undergoing evaluation or approval.
– There might be cases where errors in logging or process shortcuts result in premature closure of claims.

• E  N (Evaluate to Notify): A transition in 5 minutes seems unusually fast. This could mean:
– The evaluation process might be entirely automated, not allowing for necessary quality checkpoints.
– There might be instances where evaluations are logged without conducting a detailed review, perhaps due to system errors or omissions.

Possible hypotheses explaining these anomalies include:

1. Rigid automated decision-making systems that enforce strict time intervals regardless of claim complexity.
2. Manual interventions and scheduled batch processes that create artificial gaps between activities.
3. Data entry issues or logging errors where certain steps may be skipped or timestamped inaccurately.
4. Process deviations for certain claim types or adjuster workflows, potentially driven by regional policies or fluctuating resource availability.
5. Systemic delays introduced by external factors (e.g., weekends, holidays) that are not accounted for in the temporal model.

Verification approaches using SQL queries:

1. To identify claims with an extremely short R  P duration (potential fixed-schedule approvals), you might run:
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) AS diff_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) NOT BETWEEN 80000 AND 100000;

2. To find claims with a long P  N delay (e.g., beyond the expected range):
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) AS diff_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) > 700000 
   OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) < 300000;

3. To check for premature closures (claims closed very soon after assignment):
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) AS diff_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) < 7200;

4. To verify the extremely short E  N interval:
SELECT claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))) AS diff_seconds
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END))) < 300;

Further, consider joining these results with claim or adjuster details to determine if anomalies correlate with specific claim types, regions, or adjusters. For example, joining with the claims table can reveal if high-value claims display different timing patterns, while joining with adjusters might indicate if certain teams adhere to different internal processes.
