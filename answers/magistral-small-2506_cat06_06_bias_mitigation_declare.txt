Here’s the updated `declare_model` with added constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application process, along with a rationale for each new constraint:

### Updated DECLARE Model:
```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # New: Ensure manual review exists for sensitive cases
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # New: Ensure bias check is performed
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {
        "Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Ensure only one decision is made
        "Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Race check must be followed by bias review
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Rejecting minorities must have manual review
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Approving minorities must have manual review
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Race check must trigger bias review
    },
    "precedence": {
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Bias check must precede final decision
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Bias check must lead to manual review
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {
        "Reject": {"CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Reject cannot coexist with race checks without review
    },
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Race check cannot directly lead to Reject
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Gender check cannot directly lead to Reject
    }
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`**: Ensures that sensitive applicant checks (race, gender) always trigger these review steps, reducing bias.
2. **Coexistence for Sensitive Decisions**: If a decision (`Reject_Minority` or `Approve_Minority`) is made, it must coexist with `ManualReview` to ensure fairness.
3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`**: Ensures that race checks are always followed by a bias review.
4. **Precedence of `BiasMitigationCheck` before `FinalDecision`**: Ensures bias checks happen before final decisions.
5. **Succession from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `ManualReview`**: Ensures bias checks lead to manual reviews for sensitive cases.
6. **Non-succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`**: Prevents direct bias (race check cannot immediately lead to rejection).
7. **Nonchainsuccession from `CheckApplicantGender` to `Reject`**: Prevents gender-based bias in rejection sequences.

These constraints enforce fairness by ensuring sensitive attributes trigger additional scrutiny and prevent direct biased outcomes.
