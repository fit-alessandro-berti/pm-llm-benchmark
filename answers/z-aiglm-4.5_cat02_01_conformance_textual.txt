### Analysis of Cases Against Normative Process Description

Based on the normative process description, the following violations have been identified in the event log:

---

#### **Case 1: No Violation**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order  
- **Explanation**: This case perfectly follows the **sufficient inventory** path described:  
  - Starts with "Receive order".  
  - "Check inventory" occurs before any fulfillment activities.  
  - "Authorize payment" follows inventory check and precedes packaging.  
  - "Package items" occurs after authorization and before shipping.  
  - "Ship order" follows packaging.  
  - "Close order" is the final activity.  
  **No deviations detected.**

---

#### **Case 2: Violation**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Explanation**: Violates the **order of fulfillment activities** for sufficient inventory:  
  - "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment".  
    - *Normative Rule*: "Authorize payment" must precede "Package items" (payment authorization is required before packaging).  
  - This implies items were packaged without confirming payment validity, bypassing a critical control point.  
  **Violation**: Authorization missing before packaging.

#### **Case 3: Violation**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order  
- **Explanation**: Multiple severe violations:  
  1. **Inconsistent Branching Logic**:  
     - "Authorize payment" (intended for sufficient inventory) is followed by "Cancel order" (intended for insufficient inventory).  
     - *Normative Rule*: If inventory is insufficient, the process must immediately cancel after "Check inventory" (no payment authorization).  
  2. **Shipping After Cancellation**:  
     - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".  
     - *Normative Rule*: Shipping must never follow cancellation (cancellation halts fulfillment).  
  3. **Unnecessary Activities**:  
     - Payment authorization and shipping are illogical after cancellation.  
  **Violations**: Contradictory branching, shipping post-cancellation.  

---

#### **Case 4: No Violation**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order  
- **Explanation**: Perfectly follows the **insufficient inventory** path:  
  - Starts with "Receive order".  
  - "Check inventory" precedes cancellation.  
  - "Cancel order" immediately follows inventory check.  
  - "Close order" is the final activity.  
  - No fulfillment activities (e.g., packaging/shipping) occur.  
  **No deviations detected.**

---

#### **Case 5: Violation**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order  
- **Explanation**: Violates the **fulfillment sequence** for sufficient inventory:  
  - Missing "Package items" between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".  
    - *Normative Rule*: "Package items" must occur after payment authorization and before shipping.  
  - Shipping occurs without packaging, implying items were shipped unprepared.  
  **Violation**: Packaging step skipped.

| Case ID | Violation? | Key Violations Explained                                                                 |
|---------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | No         | Follows sufficient inventory path exactly.                                               |
| 2       | **Yes**    | "Package items" before "Authorize payment" (missing authorization before packaging).     |
| 3       | **Yes**    | 1. Payment authorization before cancellation (contradictory branching).<br>2. Shipping after cancellation. |
| 4       | No         | Follows insufficient inventory path exactly.                                             |
| 5       | **Yes**    | Missing "Package items" between authorization and shipping.                              |

### Key Ambiguities Resolved
1. **Branching Conditions**:  
   - The normative description implies mutually exclusive branches:  
     - **Sufficient inventory**: Proceed to payment authorization  packaging  shipping.  
     - **Insufficient inventory**: Proceed directly to cancellation.  
   - *Case 3* violates this by mixing branches (authorization + cancellation).  

2. **Activity Dependencies**:  
   - "Package items" is explicitly required between authorization and shipping (no exceptions).  
   - *Case 5* violates this by omitting packaging.  

3. **Prohibition on Post-Cancellation Activities**:  
   - Fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) are forbidden after cancellation.  
   - *Case 3* ignores this by shipping post-cancellation.  

**Conclusion**: Cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process due to incorrect sequencing, contradictory branching, or skipped mandatory steps.
