After analyzing the process variants for both the protected and unprotected groups, I've identified some differences that suggest potential unfair treatment. Please note that these findings are based on my domain knowledge of loan application processing and may require further investigation to confirm.

**Differences in Loan Application Outcomes**

1. **Loan Approval Rates**: The protected group has significantly lower loan approval rates compared to the unprotected group. For example:
	* The protected group has a single process variant that leads to a loan approval (Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement), with a frequency of 39.
	* In contrast, the unprotected group has multiple process variants that lead to loan approvals (e.g., Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement, with a frequency of 1656).
2. **Frequency of Loan Rejections**: The protected group has a higher frequency of loan rejections compared to the unprotected group. For example:
	* The protected group has 12 process variants that lead to loan rejections, with a total frequency of 2,222.
	* The unprotected group has 4 process variants that lead to loan rejections, with a total frequency of 2,311 is incorrect, the correct total is 3,155.
3. **Pathways to Loan Rejections**: The protected group has more complex and longer pathways to loan rejections, which may indicate bias or unfair treatment. For example:
	* The protected group has process variants with multiple steps, such as Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied.
	* In contrast, the unprotected group has relatively simpler pathways to loan rejections, such as Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied.

**Differences in Process Variants**

1. **Additional Steps**: The protected group has more process variants with additional steps, such as:
	* Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 104)
	* Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 26)
2. **Skip Steps**: The protected group has fewer process variants that skip steps compared to the unprotected group. For example:
	* The protected group has 2 process variants that skip steps (Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement, and Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied).
	* The unprotected group has more process variants that skip steps (e.g., Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement, with a frequency of 332).

These differences suggest potential unfair treatment of the protected group, particularly in terms of loan approval rates and pathways to loan rejections. However, it is essential to investigate these findings further to determine their causes and implications.
