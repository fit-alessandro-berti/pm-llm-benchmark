After analyzing the process variants, I've identified some main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups. Here are my observations based on domain knowledge:

**1. Institutional Barrier: Appointment Denial**

The protected group has a higher frequency of Appointment Denied (599) compared to the unprotected group (363). This suggests that the protected group faces more institutional barriers, where appointments are denied, potentially due to biases or discriminatory practices.

**2. Credit Application Processing**

The protected group has a longer average processing time (219,999.156) compared to the unprotected group (340,004.889). This indicates that the protected group may face more delays or manual interventions in the credit application process, potentially due to biases or inconsistencies in processing.

**3. Inspection Intensification**

The protected group has more instances of inspections (Make Visit to Assess Collateral) than the unprotected group. This could be a result of intensified scrutiny or higher risk perception for the protected group. However, the average performance time for these additional inspections does not significantly deviate from the overall average for the protected group.

**4. Additional Steps: Co-Signer Requests**

The protected group has more instances of Co-Signer On Loan requests than the unprotected group. This might indicate that lenders are more likely to require a co-signer for the protected group, potentially due to perceived higher risk.

**5. Loan Approval: Protection Penalty**

The protected group has a higher proportion of Loan Denied compared to the unprotected group (63.7% vs 46.4%). Specifically, the process variants ending in Loan Denied are more frequent for the protected group. This suggests that the protected group may face a "protection penalty," where they are more likely to be denied a loan compared to the unprotected group.

**6. Significantly Longer Processing for Rejected Applications**

When the application is rejected (Application Rejected or Application not processed further), the protected group has significantly longer processing times compared to the unprotected group. This indicates potential issues in the rejection process, potentially related to discriminatory biases or lack of transparency.

**7. Diversion into Dead Ends**

The protected group has more instances of dead-end paths (process variants that do not lead to a decision or are abandoned) than the unprotected group. This might be due to inefficient or overcomplicated processes, or potential biases in decision-making.

Keep in mind that these observations are based on the dataset provided, and without further context, it is difficult to confirm the exact causes behind these differences. These results should be considered hypotheses and verified through
