**1. Identified Violations in Cases:**

- **Case 2**: Violates the sequence of activities after inventory check.
- **Case 3**: Violates the cancellation and fulfillment logic.
- **Case 5**: Violates the required sequence between payment authorization and shipping.

**2. Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 2**  
- **Violation**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."  
- **Explanation**: According to the normative process, payment authorization must occur *before* packaging. The description explicitly states that "Authorize payment" should occur after checking inventory and before packaging. Packaging items without prior payment authorization violates this rule. This error could lead to situations where items are prepared for shipment without ensuring payment validity.  

**Case 3**  
- **Violation 1**: "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment," which is contradictory.  
  - **Explanation**: If the inventory check was sufficient (implied by proceeding to "Authorize payment"), cancellation is not part of the normative flow. Canceling after payment authorization creates a logical inconsistency because cancellation is reserved for insufficient inventory scenarios.  
- **Violation 2**: "Ship order" occurs after cancellation.  
  - **Explanation**: The normative process states that shipping should *never* occur after cancellation. Once an order is canceled, fulfillment activities like shipping are explicitly forbidden.  

**Case 5**  
- **Violation**: "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it.  
  - **Explanation**: The process mandates that items must be packaged before shipping. Skipping "Package items" violates the requirement that "Ship order" should only follow packaging. This error suggests the order was shipped without proper preparation, which contradicts the process logic.  

---

**Ambiguities Addressed:**  
- The normative description does not explicitly address whether payment authorization can occur *after* cancellation (as in Case 3). However, the logic implies that cancellation should terminate the process for insufficient inventory, making subsequent payment authorization nonsensical.  
- Case 5’s omission of "Package items" is unambiguously incorrect, as the process explicitly requires packaging before shipping.  

**Correct Cases:**  
- **Case 1** and **Case 4** adhere to the normative process. Case 1 follows the sufficient inventory path, while Case 4 correctly handles insufficient inventory.
