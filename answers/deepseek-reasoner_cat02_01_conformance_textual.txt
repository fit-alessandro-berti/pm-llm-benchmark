### Identified Violations and Explanations:

**1. Case 2**  
**Violation:**  
- **Activity Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`.  
- **Explanation:**  
  - The normative process requires "Authorize payment" to occur **before** "Package items." Payment authorization must confirm validity before preparing items for shipment. Packaging before authorization violates the rule that payment authorization is a prerequisite for fulfillment activities.  
  - The textual description explicitly states: *"Authorize payment [...] should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging."*  

**2. Case 3**  
**Violations:**  
- **Activity Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order`.  
  - **Violation 1:** Authorizing payment followed by cancellation.  
    - If the inventory check revealed insufficient stock, cancellation should occur **immediately after checking inventory**, bypassing payment authorization. Authorizing payment implies inventory sufficiency, making cancellation afterward contradictory.  
    - The textual description states cancellation should follow *only* when inventory is insufficient, and fulfillment steps (e.g., payment authorization) are excluded in this branch.  
  - **Violation 2:** Shipping after cancellation.  
    - After cancellation, fulfillment activities like "Ship order" are prohibited. The normative process specifies that cancellation leads directly to closure without further fulfillment.  

**3. Case 5**  
**Violation:**  
- **Activity Sequence:** `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order`.  
- **Explanation:**  
  - The "Package items" step is **missing** between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." The textual description mandates that items must be packaged before shipping (*"Package items [...] must be prepared before they can be shipped"*). Skipping packaging invalidates the sequence.

### Summary of Valid vs. Invalid Cases:
- **Valid Cases:**  
  - **Case 1:** Follows the sufficient inventory path correctly (`Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close`).  
  - **Case 4:** Follows the insufficient inventory path correctly (`Receive  Check  Cancel  Close`).  

- **Invalid Cases:**  
  - **Case 2:** Packaging before payment authorization.  
  - **Case 3:** Contradictory authorization/cancellation and shipping after cancellation.  
  - **Case 5:** Missing "Package items" before shipping.

### Ambiguities Resolved:  
- The normative description implies strict ordering: payment authorization is conditional on inventory sufficiency, and cancellation excludes fulfillment steps. Cases violating these dependencies (e.g., authorization before cancellation, shipping without packaging) are deemed non-compliant.  
- The process does not allow "Ship order" after cancellation or skipping mandatory steps (e.g., packaging), even if timestamps are sequential.
