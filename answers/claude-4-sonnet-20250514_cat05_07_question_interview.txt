Here are my targeted questions to clarify and deepen understanding of the property onboarding process:

## Process Flow & Sequencing

1. You mentioned that documentation review happens first - what triggers the decision to move forward if some documents are acceptable but others need updates? Is there a minimum threshold of documentation required to proceed?

2. When the inspector finds issues that need addressing, does the entire process pause, or do other activities like photography and marketing preparation continue in parallel?

3. What happens if a suitable tenant is found but then falls through during final screening - does the property stay "activated" or do you restart parts of the process?

## Decision Criteria & Logic

4. Can you walk me through the specific criteria used for property manager assignment? How do you handle conflicts when multiple factors point to different managers?

5. When multiple tenants are interested in the same property, what's the exact prioritization framework you use? How do you balance factors like lease length, rental price, and tenant quality?

6. What specific metrics or thresholds determine if a rental price "matches the company's pricing strategy and profitability targets"?

## Roles & Responsibilities

7. Who has the final authority to approve or reject a property if there are disagreements between the compliance officer, financial analyst, and property manager?

8. When contractors need to be hired for repairs, who manages that relationship - the property coordinator, property manager, or someone else?

9. How does the digital marketing team prioritize their work when multiple properties are being onboarded simultaneously?

## Exception Handling

10. You mentioned properties requiring special insurance - what triggers this requirement and how does it change the standard process timeline?

11. When landlords insist on custom lease clauses, who evaluates whether these are acceptable, and what's the escalation process if they conflict with company policies?

12. What happens if a property fails inspection multiple times? Is there a point where you decline to onboard the property?

## Communication & Coordination

13. How do you ensure all stakeholders stay informed when there are changes or delays? Is there a central communication protocol?

14. When issues arise that require input from multiple departments, how do you coordinate decision-making and avoid bottlenecks?

## Timing & Performance

15. What's the typical end-to-end timeline for this process when everything goes smoothly versus when complications arise?

16. Are there any seasonal factors or market conditions that significantly impact how long each step takes?

17. How do you handle situations where landlords have urgent timelines that don't align with your standard process duration?

## Quality Control

18. Beyond the compliance and financial reviews you mentioned, are there other quality checkpoints throughout the process?

19. How do you measure success of the onboarding process, and what are the most common failure points?

20. When properties are "activated" in the system, is there a trial period or probationary status before they're considered fully onboarded?
