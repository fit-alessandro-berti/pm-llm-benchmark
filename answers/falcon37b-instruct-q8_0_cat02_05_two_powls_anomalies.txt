**Analysis of POWL Model 1:**

Model 1 represents a straightforward sequence of activities: posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding an employee, adding them to the payroll system, and finally closing the case. The order of events is as follows:

- **Post_Job_Ad**  **Screen_Candidates**  **Decide**  **Onboard_Employee**  **Add_to_Payroll**  **Close_Case**

The model adheres to the expected sequence closely, with only a few elements worth noting:

- **No explicit loop for Onboarding:** This is not necessarily an anomaly in itself, as some companies might handle onboarding separately or as a continuous process. However, the absence of a loop suggests that onboarding is a single event rather than potentially iterative.
- **No parallel execution:** Activities are executed sequentially without any parallelism, which aligns with many standard processes but could be improved to reflect concurrent activities like posting ads and screening candidates simultaneously.

Overall, Model 1 closely follows the normative sequence of a Hire-to-Retire process.

**Analysis of POWL Model 2:**

Model 2 introduces more complexity with the addition of loops and choices, deviating from the standard sequence:

1. **Multiple paths to Onboarding:** After posting the job advertisement and screening candidates, there are two paths (via `Interview` or directly via `Decide`). This deviation implies that decisions can be made without interviews, which is less common in a typical hiring process.

2. **Onboarding Loop:** The onboarding process is modeled as a loop (`loop_onboarding`), which suggests iterative onboarding steps. While potentially realistic, it implies that onboarding could happen multiple times, which might be an anomaly unless the model is specifically designed to allow for this scenario.

3. **Choice before Payroll:** After deciding on an employee, there's a choice between adding them to payroll (`Payroll`) or skipping this step (`skip`). This introduces a potential path where employees might not be added to the payroll system, which is highly unusual and indicates a significant anomaly in process integrity.

4. **Parallelism:** The structure implies some level of parallelism but lacks explicit parallel edges between `Post_Job_Ad` and `Screen_Candidates`, which could be optimized for concurrent activities.

**Comparison and Conclusion:**

Model 1 is more closely aligned with the normative Hire-to-Retire process, as it maintains a sequential flow with minimal deviations. The absence of loops and complex decision points simplifies the model while still capturing the essential steps.

Model 2 introduces significant anomalies, including illogical hiring decisions without interviews, potential non-payment of employees, and a more complex onboarding loop structure, which deviate substantially from typical hiring practices.

Therefore, **Model 1** is the one that more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process due to its straightforward and sequential execution of activities without introducing anomalies that would alter the integrity and correctness of the hiring process.
