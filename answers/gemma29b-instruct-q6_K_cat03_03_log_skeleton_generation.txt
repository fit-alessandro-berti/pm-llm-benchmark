**Explanation:**

This Log Skeleton model captures key constraints in a typical Purchase-to-Pay process:

* **Equivalence:**  Sending a Purchase Order must be followed by receiving a confirmation.
* **Always Before:** Certain activities must occur before others (e.g., creating a PO before sending it, receiving an invoice before processing payment).
* **Always After:** Some activities must follow others (e.g., receiving goods before approving receipt).
* **Never Together:**  Rejecting and approving a PO cannot happen simultaneously.
* **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity has a specified allowed number of occurrences within a case (e.g., a case might have one or zero occurrences of "Reject_Purchase_Order").
* **Directly Follows:** Receiving goods approval directly precedes the receipt of the invoice.

**Note:**

This is a simplified example.  A real-world Purchase-to-Pay process may have many more activities and complex relationships between them.
