### Identifying Anomalies in the POWL Model

1. **Loop between Evaluation and Approval**:
   - The loop structure `* (E, P)` allows for repeated evaluation and approval cycles. This could indicate that claims are being re-evaluated and approved multiple times, possibly due to incomplete or changing business rules.

2. **XOR that may skip Customer Notification**:
   - The XOR structure `N xor skip` allows for the possibility of skipping the customer notification step. This could indicate that the process sometimes omits notifying customers, which might be due to miscommunication or incomplete process design.

3. **Partial Ordering that might enable closing the claim prematurely**:
   - The partial ordering allows for the closing of a claim before proper evaluation or approval. This could indicate that claims are being closed prematurely, possibly due to technical errors or inadequate constraints in the workflow system.

### Hypotheses on the Causes of Anomalies

1. **Loop between Evaluation and Approval**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Changes in business rules that were partially implemented. For example, a new rule might require multiple evaluations and approvals before a claim can be finalized.
   - **Verification**: Look for claims that have multiple evaluation and approval events.

2. **XOR that may skip Customer Notification**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Miscommunication between departments leading to incomplete process design. For example, the process design might not have fully considered all scenarios where customer notification is necessary.
   - **Verification**: Identify claims that do not have a customer notification event.

3. **Partial Ordering that might enable closing the claim prematurely**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Technical errors in the workflow system that allowed non-standard execution paths. For example, a bug in the system might allow claims to be closed before they are fully evaluated or approved.
   - **Verification**: Look for claims that were closed without proper evaluation or approval events.

### Verifying Hypotheses Using Database Queries

1. **Identify claims that were closed without a proper evaluation or approval event**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity IS NULL
   OR (ce.activity NOT IN ('E', 'P') AND ce.activity = 'C');
   ```

2. **Locate claims that were approved multiple times**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, COUNT(ce.event_id) AS approval_count
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
   GROUP BY c.claim_id
   HAVING COUNT(ce.event_id) > 1;
   ```

3. **Check if customer notification steps are frequently skipped in practice**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id
   FROM claims c
   LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'N'
   WHERE ce.event_id IS NULL;
   ```

### Additional Considerations

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the `claim_events` table has complete and accurate data. Missing or incorrect entries could skew the results of these queries.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Consider the temporal aspect of the events to understand if the anomalies are consistent over time or if they are sporadic.
- **Cross-Referencing with Adjuster Data**: If necessary, cross-reference the `claim_events` with the `adjusters` table to understand if certain adjusters are more likely to cause anomalies.

By running these queries, you can gather empirical data to support or refute the hypotheses about the causes of the anomalies in the POWL model. This data-driven approach can help in refining the process model and ensuring that the claim handling process adheres to the intended flow.
