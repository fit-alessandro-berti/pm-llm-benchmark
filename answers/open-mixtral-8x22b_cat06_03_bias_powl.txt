The XOR operator in the POWL model introduces a subtle bias by giving certain applicants a slight advantage through a score uplift. This branching allows for some applicants to have their local affiliation checked (D), while others skip this step. Those who undergo this check will benefit from a subtle score uplift, which may not be available to the applicants who skip this step.

The implications of this bias can be significant, particularly in terms of fairness and equity in the final loan decisions. If the group of applicants who are more likely to undergo the local affiliation check (D) corresponds to a non-legally protected group, this could lead to indirect discrimination. This is because members of this group would have a higher chance of receiving a loan due to their increased credit score, while other applicants would not have the same opportunity.

This bias could also perpetuate existing inequalities and prevent disadvantaged groups from accessing credit, which is essential for social and economic mobility. Applicants who are not part of the favored group might face higher rejection rates or less favorable loan terms, further exacerbating existing disparities.

To address these concerns, it is crucial to ensure that the selection criteria for the local affiliation check (D) are transparent, non-discriminatory, and consistently applied. Additionally, decision-makers should consider implementing measures to mitigate the impact of this bias, such as adjusting credit scores or providing equal opportunities for all applicants to demonstrate their qualifications for a loan. Regular monitoring and evaluation of the loan application process can help identify and address any disparities, ensuring that the process is fair and equitable for all applicants.
