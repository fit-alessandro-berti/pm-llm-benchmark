# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Integration and Preprocessing

The first critical step involves creating a unified event log that combines data from four disparate sources into a coherent structure. Each event must be timestamped, uniquely identified, and linked to the appropriate case (vehicle-day) and activities.

**Integration Approach:**
- **Case ID Construction**: Each operational day for a vehicle (e.g., "V12-20241205") serves as the case identifier, enabling tracking of the complete journey from depot departure to return.
- **Activity Mapping**: Events from different sources map to unified activity labels:
  - GPS events  "Depart Depot", "Low Speed Detected", "Unscheduled Stop", "Arrive Depot"
  - Scanner events  "Arrive Customer", "Delivery Success", "Delivery Failed", "Depart Customer"
  - Dispatch events  "Route Assigned"
  - Maintenance logs  "Vehicle Maintenance"
- **Data Synchronization**: Align timestamps across systems, resolving minor discrepancies (typically within 30 seconds) through temporal clustering.
- **Enrichment**: Calculate derived attributes like travel time between stops, idle time, speed variations, and route deviations using GPS coordinates.

**Integration Challenges:**
- **Event Granularity Mismatch**: GPS trackers generate frequent location updates (every 30-60 seconds), while scanner events occur only at specific milestones. This requires careful aggregation to avoid misrepresenting process flow.
- **Missing Events**: Not all planned stops may generate scanner events (e.g., if a delivery was skipped). These gaps must be handled through probabilistic inference or marked as deviations.
- **Temporal Resolution**: Maintenance logs may lack precise timestamps for the start of issues, requiring inference from GPS patterns (e.g., sudden stops with low speed).
- **Data Quality**: GPS signal loss in urban canyons, scanner battery failures, or manual entry errors can create data gaps requiring imputation strategies.

### Process Discovery

Using the integrated event log, process discovery algorithms like the Inductive Miner or Fuzzy Miner will reveal the actual delivery process structure. The discovered model will likely show:

- **Core Process Flow**: Depot  Travel  Customer Stop (Arrive/Delivery/Depart)  Travel  ...  Depot
- **Deviation Patterns**: Unscheduled stops, failed deliveries requiring revisits, route deviations from planned paths
- **Loop Structures**: Multiple delivery attempts for the same package, return trips for missed deliveries

The process map will expose the true complexity beyond the planned linear route, including:
- Frequency of failed deliveries and their impact on route completion
- Common locations of unscheduled stops (potential hotspots for breakdowns or traffic issues)
- Variability in service time across different customer types or locations

### Conformance Checking

Comparing discovered process models against planned dispatch routes reveals critical deviations:

**Sequence Deviations:**
- Stops visited in different order than planned
- Additional stops not in the original plan
- Skipped planned stops

**Timing Deviations:**
- Significant delays between planned and actual arrival times (>15 minutes)
- Extended dwell times at customer locations
- Early departures from planned schedule

**Behavioral Deviations:**
- Route choices that bypass planned paths
- Patterns of returning to previously visited areas
- Clustering of failed deliveries in specific zones

These deviations highlight where operational reality diverges from planning assumptions, revealing inefficiencies in route optimization or external factors like traffic patterns not accounted for in planning.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators

The event log enables calculation of comprehensive KPIs:

**Delivery Performance:**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate**: Percentage of deliveries completed within customer time windows
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop**: Service time (Arrive to Depart Customer) averaged across stops
- **Failed Delivery Rate**: Percentage of attempted deliveries marked as failed
- **Re-delivery Rate**: Percentage of packages requiring multiple delivery attempts

**Operational Efficiency:**
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio**: Proportion of shift spent driving versus serving customers
- **Fuel Consumption per km**: Derived from vehicle telemetry and distance traveled
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate**: Percentage of operational time vehicles are actively delivering
- **Average Speed by Route Segment**: Identifies slow-moving zones

**Process Health:**
- **Frequency of Traffic Delays**: Instances where vehicle speed drops below threshold for extended periods
- **Maintenance Interruption Rate**: Number of shifts affected by vehicle issues
- **Overtime Hours**: Time beyond scheduled shift duration

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**Variant Analysis:**
By grouping delivery runs into process variants (distinct sequences of activities), we can identify high-performing versus low-performing patterns. For example:
- **Route Variants**: Compare delivery sequences with similar numbers of stops but different completion times
- **Time-of-Day Variants**: Analyze performance differences between morning and afternoon delivery windows
- **Geographic Variants**: Identify specific zones with consistently poor performance

**Performance Profiling:**
- **Dotted Chart Analysis**: Visualizes event distribution over time, revealing congestion periods
- **Performance Metrics Overlay**: Maps KPIs onto process models to highlight slow activities
- **Time Frequency Analysis**: Identifies peak delay periods and their correlation with external factors

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Link traffic delay patterns with specific road segments or intersections
- Correlate failed deliveries with customer location characteristics (gated communities, business districts)
- Analyze relationship between vehicle age/maintenance history and breakdown frequency

**Bottleneck Quantification:**
Calculate the impact of each bottleneck by measuring:
- Additional time added to delivery routes
- Increased fuel consumption from detours or idling
- Customer satisfaction impact from missed time windows
- Operational cost per instance of the bottleneck
