**Analysis of POWL Model 1:**

POWL Model 1 represents a straightforward sequence of activities in the Hire-to-Retire process:

1. Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case

With an additional parallel path:

- Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews

This suggests that interviewing candidates happens in parallel with making the hiring decision, which might not be the case in a standard process where interviews inform the hiring decision.

**Anomalies in Model 1:**

- **Parallel Execution of Interview and Decision:** The model allows Conduct_Interviews to be executed in parallel with Make_Hiring_Decision, which is anomalous because typically, interviews should precede the decision to hire.

- **Missing Dependencies:** There is no direct link between Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision, implying that the decision can be made without conducting interviews, which is not logical.

**Analysis of POWL Model 2:**

POWL Model 2 introduces more complexity with loops and choices:

1. Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates

2. Post_Job_Ad  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Loop(Onboard_Employee, skip)  XOR(Payroll, skip)  Close_Case

This model suggests that after posting the job ad, screening candidates and conducting interviews can happen independently, but the hiring decision is based on interviews. There is also a loop for onboarding, which is unusual, and a choice to either add to payroll or skip.

**Anomalies in Model 2:**

- **Independent Screening and Interviewing:** Screening candidates and conducting interviews are not ordered with respect to each other, which could lead to interviews being conducted before candidates are screened.

- **Loop in Onboarding:** The loop allowing repeated onboarding of the same employee without any condition is anomalous and could lead to incorrect process behavior.

- **Optional Payroll Addition:** The choice to either add the employee to payroll or skip this step can lead to employees being onboarded without being added to payroll, which is a critical error in the hiring process.

**Comparison and Decision:**

Between the two models, Model 1 is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process despite its anomalies. Here's why:

- **Model 1 Anomalies are Less Severe:** The main issue in Model 1 is the parallel execution of interviews and decision-making, which, while incorrect, does not lead to critical process failures like employees being onboarded without payroll entries.

- **Model 2 Introduces Critical Errors:** The loop in onboarding and the optional payroll addition in Model 2 can lead to severe process inconsistencies and errors, such as multiple onboarding instances and employees not being added to payroll.

- **Simplicity and Correctness:** Model 1, despite its flaws, maintains a simpler structure that is easier to correct compared to the more complex and error-prone structure of Model 2.

**Conclusion:**

Model 1 is preferable as it deviates less from the normative process, with anomalies that are easier to address and less impactful on the overall process integrity compared to Model 2.
