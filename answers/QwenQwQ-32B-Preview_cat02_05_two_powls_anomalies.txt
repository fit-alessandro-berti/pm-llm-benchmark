Alright, I've got this task here to analyze two POWL models of a "Hire-to-Retire" process and identify anomalies in them. The standard process includes activities like posting a job ad, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding, adding to payroll, and closing the case. Both models have some deviations from this norm, and I need to figure out which one is closer to the standard process.

First, I need to understand what a POWL model is. From the prompt, it's a partially ordered graph representing a process, with control-flow operators for choice and loops. There are four types: activities (transitions), exclusive choices (X), loops (*), and partial orders (PO). So, activities are the actual steps like posting a job ad, and the other types handle the flow between these steps.

Let's look at Model 1.

Model 1 seems straightforward. It has activities for each step: Post_Job_Ad, Screen_Candidates, Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision, Onboard_Employee, Add_to_Payroll, and Close_Case. The partial order defines the sequence: posting leads to screening, screening leads to both deciding and conducting interviews, deciding leads to onboarding, onboarding to payroll, and finally, closing the case.

Hmm, wait a minute. Screening leads to both deciding and conducting interviews. Is that correct? In a standard process, shouldn't interviews be conducted after screening, and then based on interviews, a decision is made?

Let me think. Screening candidates probably happens after posting the job ad, and then based on the screening, interviews are scheduled. After conducting interviews, a decision is made whether to hire or not. So, the flow should be: post ad -> screen candidates -> conduct interviews -> make hiring decision -> onboard (if hired) -> add to payroll -> close case.

In Model 1, screening leads to both deciding and interviewing. That might imply that deciding and interviewing can happen in parallel, which doesn't seem right. Typically, interviews are conducted before a decision is made. So, this could be an anomaly.

Another thing is that in Model 1, there are no loops or choices, just a straightforward sequence with some parallelism. In reality, there might be loops, like if the decision is to reject a candidate, you might go back to screening more candidates. But perhaps that's not included here.

Now, let's look at Model 2.

Model 2 is more complex. It introduces a loop on onboarding and an exclusive choice between adding to payroll and a silent transition.

Wait, in Model 2, there's a loop on onboarding, which is Onboard followed by a silent transition. What does that mean? A silent transition is like a hidden step that doesn't correspond to an actual activity. So, the loop is either onboarding followed by nothing, or just nothing.

Then, there's an exclusive choice between adding to payroll or nothing (skip). After that, the case is closed.

Also, in Model 2, there's a different flow: posting leads to screening and directly to conducting interviews. Interviews lead to deciding, which leads to the onboarding loop, then the XOR choice, and finally closing the case.

This seems problematic. Posting leads directly to screening and interviews in parallel? That might not make sense. Typically, you post the ad, then screen candidates, then conduct interviews based on the screening.

So, in Model 2, it appears that screening and interviews are happening in parallel after posting the ad, which might not be the intended sequence.

Also, the loop on onboarding is unclear. Does it mean that you can onboard an employee multiple times? That doesn't seem right in a hire-to-retire process.

Moreover, the exclusive choice between adding to payroll or skipping it is odd. In a standard process, if an employee is hired, they should be added to payroll. Making it optional doesn't align with the norm.

Comparing the two models, Model 1 at least has a logical sequence from posting to screening to deciding to onboarding, etc., even if there is an issue with screening leading to both deciding and interviewing.

Model 2 has more structural issues: parallel screening and interviewing, a loop on onboarding, and an optional payroll addition.

Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process, despite its anomalies, because its sequence more closely matches the expected flow, whereas Model 2 introduces more significant deviations that undermine the process's integrity.

In summary, Model 1 is better because:

- It maintains a logical sequence from posting to screening to decision making.

- The only anomaly is the parallel execution of deciding and interviewing from screening, which is a lesser deviation compared to the issues in Model 2.

Model 2 is worse because:

- It allows screening and interviewing to happen in parallel after posting the ad.

- It includes a loop on onboarding, which doesn't make sense in this context.

- It has an exclusive choice that allows skipping payroll addition, which is a critical step in hiring.

Hence, Model 1 is closer to the normative process.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Model 1 is closer to the normative Hire-to-Retire process.}}
