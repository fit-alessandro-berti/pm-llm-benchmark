The discovered process tree model capturing the variations in the log is structured as follows:

```
RA ->  
    VF ->  
        X ( 
            -> ( AE -> * ( RMI -> X ( RMI, SEQUENCE(VF, AD) ) ) ),  
            -> ( AE -> tau ) 
        ) ->  
            SC ->  
                AC
```

**Final Process Tree Structure:**
1. **Root Sequence**: `->` (Sequence)
   - **Step 1**: Activity `RA`
   - **Step 2**: Activity `VF`
   - **Step 3**: **XOR (X)** between:
       - **Option A**: 
         - Sequence: `->` (Activity `AE`  **Loop (RMI)**)
         - **Loop Definition**: `* (RMI, X)` where:
             - After `RMI`, choose between:
               - `RMI` (repeat loop) or
               - Sequence: `SEQUENCE(VF, AD)` (loop exit  `VF`  `AD`).
       - **Option B**: Skip to `AD` directly after `AE` (using `tau` as a silent step).

2. **Post-Loop Sequence**:
   - After the XOR decision:
     - **Step 4**: Activity `AD`
     - **Step 5**: Activity `SC`
     - **Step 6**: Activity `AC`

**Explanation**:
- The main flow starts with `RA`, `VF`, and `AE`.
- After `AE`, there is an XOR choice:
  - **Option A**: Enter a **loop** where `RMI` can repeat any number of times. Each `RMI` allows a new XOR choice: either repeat the loop (another `RMI`) or exit the loop after a `VF` and proceed to `AD`.
  - **Option B**: Skip the loop entirely (via `tau`) and proceed directly to `AD`.
- Post-loop, all executions follow the fixed sequence: `AD`  `SC`  `AC`.

This model balances fitness, precision, and simplicity by capturing the optional repetition of `RMI`/`VF` steps while maintaining the core process flow.
