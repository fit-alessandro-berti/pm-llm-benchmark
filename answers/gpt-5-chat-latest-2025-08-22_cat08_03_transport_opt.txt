Perfect, thank you for setting up such a detailed scenario!  
Below I’ll outline a **structured, process mining–based consulting approach** for Speedy Parcels:

# **Process Mining Analysis & Optimization Plan for Speedy Parcels**

---

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### a. Data Integration & Preprocessing
- **Objective:** Create a unified event log that seamlessly connects GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance systems.  
- **Steps:**
  1. **Define Case IDs:**  
     - At the highest level, “Vehicle-Day” can be the main process instance (e.g., `V12-20241205`).  
     - Nested sub-cases may exist for **packages** (to trace delivery attempts) and **vehicles across multiple days** (for maintenance analysis).
  2. **Timestamp Alignment:** Standardize all timestamps to UTC/local time and ensure chronological integrity.
  3. **Activity Harmonization:** Map heterogeneous events into consistent **activity categories**, e.g.: *Shift Start, Route Assignment, Depart Depot, In Transit, Traffic Jam, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success/Failed, Unscheduled Stop, Return Depot, Shift End*.
  4. **Event Merging/De-duplication:** GPS data is high-frequency – aggregate into meaningful states (e.g., "traffic jam" instead of hundreds of 5 km/h readings).
  5. **Contextual Enrichment:** Join customer info (e.g., promised time windows), vehicle capacity, and maintenance data for richer process attributes.

- **Challenges:**
  - **Granularity mismatch:** GPS records every few seconds; scanner only records major events. Must set intelligent aggregation rules.
  - **Event alignment:** Linking deliveries (scanner/dispatch) with GPS coordinates and vehicle movements.
  - **Noise filtering:** E.g., idling at red lights may be mistaken for "unscheduled stop."

---

### b. Process Discovery
- Use **inductive process mining algorithms** (Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner) to generate interpretable models.
- The **discovered process** should highlight:
  - Overall trip: Depot  Deliveries  Depot.
  - Branches for **success/failure deliveries.**
  - Common deviations: unscheduled breakdown stop, loopbacks (re-deliveries), extended idling.
  - Performance overlays (durations, bottlenecks).

---

### c. Conformance Checking
- Compare discovered model with **dispatch-planned routes/activities.**
- Look for deviations:
  - **Sequence deviations:** Planned Stop order vs. actual (route detours).  
  - **Timing deviations:** Planned vs. actual delivery time windows.  
  - **Unplanned events:** Breakdowns, extended delays, traffic jams.  
  - **Skipped events:** Delivery not attempted.  
  - **Extra loops:** Failed deliveries needing retry.

*Outcome:* A quantified deviation matrix: % stops delivered on-time, frequency of route sequence deviations, average extra kilometers.

---

## **2. Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Identification**

### a. Relevant KPIs
- **On-Time Delivery Rate (%):** (# deliveries within promised window ÷ total deliveries).  
- **Avg. Time per Stop:** (Delivery service duration across all stops ÷ total stops).  
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** (Total driving time ÷ delivery handling time).  
- **Fuel Consumption per km/package (est.):** Proxy via GPS kilometers ÷ packages delivered.  
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** (Active driving/servicing time ÷ total shift time).  
- **Frequency & Duration of Traffic Delays:** Derived from GPS “low speed” clusters.  
- **Failed Delivery Rate (%):** (# failed attempts ÷ total deliveries).  
- **Unscheduled Breakdown Frequency.**

Each KPI is calculable directly or via aggregations in the log.

---

### b. Bottleneck Detection Using Process Mining
- **Performance Annotations:** Overlay durations/frequencies on discovered models to flag long transitions (e.g., depot  first stop).  
- **Variants Analysis:** Compare high-efficiency (fast, on-time) vs. low-efficiency process paths.  
- **Heatmaps on Map Visualization:** Identify traffic-prone areas where vehicles repeatedly slow down.  
- **Resource-Centric Analysis:** Identify which drivers/vehicles deviate most, and where they consume excess time.  
- **Frequency Clustering:** Are breakdowns concentrated on specific models/older vehicles?

*Quantification Example:*  
- Route X at 8–10 AM has *2x longer average travel times* than same route off-peak  major traffic bottleneck.

---

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

From identified patterns, look beyond *where delays occur* to *why they happen*:

- **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Dispatch uses static assignment, ignoring live congestion  variance in travel durations.  
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Assumptions:** Planned routes underestimate urban traffic  recurring lateness.  
- **Congestion Patterns:** GPS logs show consistent slowdown windows (rush hour, city center).  
- **High Customer Service Variability:** Some stops take disproportionately longer (parking difficulty, customer not home).  
- **Vehicle Reliability Issues:** Unscheduled stops correlate with higher mileage fleets  maintenance lag.  
- **Driver Variance:** Delivery pace differs across drivers of same route  training/experience.  
- **Failed Deliveries:** Repeat attempts inflate time/cost and reduce efficiency.

**Process Mining Validation Techniques:**
- **Variant Comparison:** Compare frequent process variants between top-performing vs. lagging routes/drivers.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Time delays correlated with GPS-tracked congestion hotspots.  
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Long "Arrive  Depart" durations cluster in specific districts/customers.  
- **Breakdown Root Cause:** Align maintenance logs with route schedules to measure average delay cost.

---

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Traffic-Aware Routing**
- **Targets:** On-time delivery, fuel costs.  
- **Root Cause:** Static route planning ignoring live congestion.  
- **Process Mining Insight:** Identified consistent traffic jams on morning/afternoon routes.  
- **Solution:** Implement real-time re-routing algorithms (integrated with GPS + traffic feeds).  
- **Impact:** +15–20% on-time delivery, reduced excess idling/kms, lower fuel cost.

---

### **Strategy 2: Customer-Centric Delivery Window Optimization**
- **Targets:** Failed delivery rate, re-delivery costs.  
- **Root Cause:** Poor alignment of planned vs. actual customer availability  failed deliveries.  
- **Process Insight:** Clusters of repeated failure events per customer/address segments.  
- **Solution:** Use historical success rates to **propose smarter time windows** (or offer narrower slots to customers where feasible). Add proactive notifications (“your delivery expected between 2–3 PM”).  
- **Impact:** Reduce failed deliveries/re-delivery mileage by 10–15%. Increase customer satisfaction.

---

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance & Vehicle Assignment**
- **Targets:** Unscheduled stop reduction, fleet utilization.  
- **Root Cause:** Breakdowns during active routes.  
- **Process Insight:** Logs show unscheduled stops align with older fleet vehicles beyond mileage thresholds.  
- **Solution:** Use predictive analytics to flag vehicles for pre-shift maintenance; assign healthier vehicles to longer/higher-priority routes.  
- **Impact:** Significantly fewer in-route breakdowns, less overtime, higher reliability.

---

### **Strategy 4 (Optional Add-On): Targeted Driver Coaching**
- **Targets:** Reduce time variability & overtime.  
- **Root Cause:** Driver behavior differences (speeding, extended dwell times).  
- **Process Insight:** Variants show same route can vary 20–30% in duration by driver.  
- **Solution:** Benchmark top-performer drivers, design training/guidelines for parking strategies, navigation tools.  
- **Impact:** More consistent service times, reduced overtime.

---

## **5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring**

### a. Respecting Constraints
- **Driver working hours:** Overtime flagged in event logs  ensure optimized routes fall within legal hours.  
- **Vehicle capacities:** Route optimizations must incorporate load details (dispatch data).  
- **Customer time windows:** Must remain priority factor in re-routing (any dynamic changes should not violate agreed slots).

### b. Continuous Monitoring Plan
- Establish **process mining dashboards**:  
  - **Operational KPIs:** On-time rate, delivery failures, fuel/km per package, vehicle utilization, overtime hours.  
  - **Deviation Tracking:** Planned vs. actual travel routes/times.  
  - **Bottleneck Heatmaps:** Traffic-dense urban zones over time of day.  
  - **Fleet Maintenance Alerts:** Frequency of breakdown-related unscheduled stops.  
  - **Driver Impact Dashboard:** Efficiency variance across workforce.

- **Adaptive Feedback Loop:**  
  Monitor changes post-implementation  adjust routing/time-window strategies every 4–6 weeks based on fresh event data.
