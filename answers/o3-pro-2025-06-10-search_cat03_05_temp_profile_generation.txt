This dictionary covers a representative mix of  
• directly consecutive activities (e.g., `('RC','QI')`),  
• pairs separated by one or more intermediate steps (e.g., `('OP','PT')`, `('CA','DT')`), and  
• long-range pairs spanning nearly the entire process (e.g., `('SS','AS')`).  

Average times and standard deviations were estimated to reflect typical lead-time patterns in a high-tech electronics supply-chain: multi-day procurement lags, short intra-plant touch-times, buffering in storage, and extended after-sales horizons. You can adjust the sensitivity of deviation detection by selecting an appropriate `ZETA` threshold when applying this temporal profile to real event logs.
