The process underlying the provided Log Skeleton process model appears to be a complex approval workflow, likely related to financial declarations or similar business processes involving multiple stages of approval, rejection, and payment handling. Here's a high-level description of the process based on the constraints provided:

### 1. **Initiation and Submission:**
   - The process likely starts with a declaration being submitted by an employee (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`). This submission can occur multiple times (up to 7 times per case), indicating that multiple declarations can be submitted within a single case.
   - Alternatively, the process might start with a declaration being saved by an employee (`Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`), but it cannot co-exist with other actions like rejection or submission by the same employee in the same case.

### 2. **Approval Workflow:**
   - After submission, the declaration undergoes a series of approvals:
     - **Pre-Approver Approval:** The declaration is sent for approval by a pre-approver (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER`). This approval can only occur once per case.
     - **Supervisor Approval:** The declaration is also sent for approval by a supervisor (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR`), which can only occur once per case.
     - **Administration Approval:** The declaration is further sent for approval by the administration (`Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`), which can only occur once per case.
   - The approvals are interconnected:
     - If the declaration is approved by the administration, it must also be approved by the supervisor and the budget owner, and it must be equivalent to the final approval by the supervisor.
     - If the declaration is approved by the pre-approver, it must also be approved by the budget owner, and it must be equivalent to the final approval by the supervisor.

### 3. **Rejection Pathways:**
   - There are multiple pathways for rejecting declarations:
     - **Rejection by Pre-Approver:** If the pre-approver rejects the declaration, it must be rejected by the supervisor or marked as missing (`Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`).
     - **Rejection by Supervisor:** If the supervisor rejects the declaration, it must be rejected by the budget owner or marked as missing.
     - **Rejection by Administration:** If the administration rejects the declaration, it must be rejected by the budget owner, the supervisor, or marked as missing.
     - **Rejection by Employee:** The employee can reject the declaration themselves, but this must occur after payment handling.
   - Rejections by different roles are mutually exclusive in certain cases (e.g., a declaration cannot be rejected by both the pre-approver and the budget owner in the same case).

### 4. **Payment Handling:**
   - Once the declaration is approved by the administration, it can lead to a payment request (`Request Payment`), which can only occur once per case.
   - After the payment request is made, the payment is handled (`Payment Handled`), which can also only occur once per case.
   - Payment handling cannot occur if the declaration is rejected by the employee or if certain other rejections occur.

### 5. **Finalization:**
   - The process can be finalized in one of two ways:
     - **Approved Pathway:** If all approvals are granted, the declaration is final-approved by the supervisor (`Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`), and payment is handled.
     - **Rejected Pathway:** If any rejection occurs, the process is terminated without payment handling.

### 6. **Constraints and Dependencies:**
   - The process includes several constraints that ensure logical consistency:
     - **Equivalence:** Certain approvals must occur together (e.g., administration approval must be equivalent to supervisor final approval).
     - **Always Before/After:** Certain actions must occur in a specific order (e.g., supervisor approval must always occur before employee submission).
     - **Never Together:** Certain actions cannot occur in the same case (e.g., supervisor approval cannot co-exist with administration rejection).

### 7. **Activity Occurrences:**
   - The number of times each activity can occur is bounded, indicating that the process has a defined structure with limited flexibility in terms of repeated actions.

### Summary:
The process is a multi-stage approval workflow where declarations are submitted, approved by multiple stakeholders (pre-approver, supervisor, administration), and can be rejected by any of these stakeholders or marked as missing. If approved, the process leads to a payment request and payment handling. The workflow includes numerous checks and balances to ensure that approvals and rejections occur in a logical sequence, preventing inconsistencies and ensuring that the process adheres to predefined rules.
