### Task 1: Identify Cases Violating Normative Rules

**Case 2** is the only one violating normative rules. Here is the detailed explanation:

- **Step Violations:**
  - **Activity Order Violation:** The `Risk Assessment` was performed **before** the `Credit Check` (Case ID: 2). According to the normative rules, `Credit Check` should always precede `Risk Assessment`.

- **Other Activity Concerns:**
  - `Finalize Documentation` was conducted after a rejection (Case ID: 2). This goes directly against the rule that finalization should not occur if the loan is rejected.

**Case 1** follows all normative rules and is therefore compliant.

### Task 2: Identify Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Cases 3 and 2 (partial)** do not meet some desiderata conditions, though these are not considered severe violations. Specifically:

- **Case 3:**
  - **Timing Violations:**
    - The `Credit Check` occurred more than 24 hours after the `Application Received`. The recommended window is within 24 hours.
    - The `Inform Applicant` step took place more than 48 hours after the `Loan Decision`. The recommended timeframe is within 48 hours.
  - **Follow-up Call:** No follow-up call is recorded for this case, which is recommended.
  
- **Case 2:**
  - The follow-up call is missing as well, a recommended activity but not a violation.

### Task 3: Justifications and Interpretations

**Normative Violations (Case 2):**
- The error in the ordering of activities could possibly indicate a procedural mistake. It is important to have protocols that ensure each step is properly executed in the correct sequence. Missteps such as these should prompt a review of training procedures, quality controls, and system checks to prevent future occurrences.

**Desiderata Violations (Case 3):**
- **Timing Concerns:** 
  - The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be due to unexpected backlogs or systemic issues with data processing. These delays can be mitigated by ensuring proper workflow management and possibly reducing manual steps in favor of automated processes where feasible.
  - If multiple applications were received at once and staff are overwhelmed, additional resources might be necessary, or a priority system could be established to ensure critical steps are not excessively delayed.

- **Follow-up Call:**
  - The lack of a follow-up call might be due to oversight. It is a simple step but requires meticulous tracking. Internal checklists or software notifications could ensure such steps are not missed.

### Summary
- **Case 1:** Fully compliant with all rules and desiderata.
- **Case 2:** Significant normative issues (order of activities, immediate action following decision) and recommended follow-up not performed.
- **Case 3:** Desiderata issues with timing of steps and absence of follow-up.

Corrective actions for Case 2 would require addressing violations of the normative rules, whereas Case 3 may benefit from streamlining processes and improving adherence to recommended best practices.
