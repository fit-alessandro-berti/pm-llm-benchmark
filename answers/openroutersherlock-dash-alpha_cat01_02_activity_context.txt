### Analysis of Recurrent Activities

After analyzing the event log, the following activities appear multiple times within the same case and carry distinct contextual meanings:

- **Verify Documents**: Appears twice in C001 and C003.
  - First occurrence: Initial verification of provided/available documents.
  - Second occurrence: Re-verification after additional documents are submitted (C001) or after account adjustments (C003).
  
- **Call Customer**: Appears twice in C002.
  - First occurrence: Outbound call to gather missing information or clarify issues (e.g., request docs in C001, clarify discrepancy in C002, customer return in C003).
  - Second occurrence: Follow-up/confirmation call after resolution steps (e.g., confirm adjustments in C002).

Other activities like **Initiate Request**, **Adjust Account**, and **Approve Request** are unique per case or unambiguous in context, so they remain unchanged.

### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Verify Documents  Initial Verify Documents / Re-Verify Documents**:
  - **Clues**: Position (always first vs. after intervening events like document submission or account adjustment); context explicitly mentions "checks identity documents" (initial), "re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided" (C001 re-verify), and "re-verify docs after account adjustment" (C003 re-verify). Prefixes distinguish the routine first-pass check from follow-up validation.

- **Call Customer  Call for Missing Docs / Call to Clarify Issue / Call for Customer Return / Call to Confirm Changes**:
  - **Clues**: Specific purposes in context ("request missing docs," "clarify account discrepancy," "have them return," "confirm adjustments made"); position (early issue-resolution calls vs. late confirmation calls). Descriptive phrases capture the exact intent, making process flows traceable (e.g., clarification  adjustment  confirmation in C002).

These names are concise, process-oriented, and derived directly from timestamps, resources, and context columns, eliminating ambiguity while preserving all original data.
