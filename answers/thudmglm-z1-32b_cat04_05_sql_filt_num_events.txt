To solve this problem, we need to filter out process instances (cases) that have more than six events and return all events from the remaining cases. This can be efficiently achieved using a window function in DuckDB, which allows us to count the number of events per case and filter them in a single query.

### Approach
1. **Window Function**: Use the `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` window function to compute the total number of events for each case. This function will assign a `case_event_count` value to each event, representing the total number of events in that case.
2. **Filter**: Apply a `WHERE` clause to exclude cases where `case_event_count` exceeds six. This ensures that only cases with six or fewer events are included in the result.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS case_event_count
    FROM event_log
) AS subquery
WHERE case_event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation
- **Window Function**: The `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)` function calculates the number of events for each `case_id` partition. This count is added as a new column `case_event_count` to each row in the subquery result.
- **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters out all rows where `case_event_count` is greater than six, effectively retaining only those process instances that meet the criteria (six or fewer events).

This approach efficiently groups and filters the data in a single pass through the table, leveraging DuckDB's optimized window function implementation for performance.
