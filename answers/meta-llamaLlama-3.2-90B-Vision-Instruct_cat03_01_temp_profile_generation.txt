Here is a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process:
```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): (86400, 3600),  # 1 day, 1 hour std dev
    ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Invoice'): (604800, 86400),  # 7 days, 1 day std dev
    ('Receive Invoice', 'Verify Invoice'): (28800, 7200),  # 8 hours, 2 hours std dev
    ('Verify Invoice', 'Approve Invoice'): (14400, 3600),  # 4 hours, 1 hour std dev
    ('Approve Invoice', 'Make Payment'): (86400, 43200),  # 1 day, 12 hours std dev
    ('Make Payment', 'Confirm Payment'): (3600, 1800),  # 1 hour, 30 minutes std dev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Verify Invoice'): (1209600, 288000),  # 14 days, 3.2 days std dev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Approve Invoice'): (1814400, 432000),  # 21 days, 5 days std dev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Make Payment'): (2592000, 604800),  # 30 days, 7 days std dev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Confirm Payment'): (3024000, 864000),  # 35 days, 10 days std dev
}
```
Note that this is just one possible example, and the actual values will depend on the specific organization and process being modeled.

Here's a brief explanation of each pair of activities and the reasoning behind the chosen values:

* `Create Purchase Order` to `Send Purchase Order`: This typically happens quickly, within a day.
* `Send Purchase Order` to `Receive Invoice`: This can take around 7 days, depending on the supplier and shipping times.
* `Receive Invoice` to `Verify Invoice`: Verifying an invoice usually takes a few hours to a day.
* `Verify Invoice` to `Approve Invoice`: Approving an invoice usually takes a few hours.
* `Approve Invoice` to `Make Payment`: Making payment usually takes around a day, but can be faster or slower depending on the payment method.
* `Make Payment` to `Confirm Payment`: Confirming payment usually happens quickly, within an hour.
* The longer-term relationships (e.g. `Create Purchase Order` to `Approve Invoice`) are included to capture the variability in the overall process duration.

The standard deviations are chosen to reflect the uncertainty and variability in each step of the process. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability, while a lower standard deviation indicates more predictability.
