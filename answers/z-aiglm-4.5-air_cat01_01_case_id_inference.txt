Based on the event attributes and logical flow, the events can be grouped into **three distinct cases** corresponding to separate patient journeys. The grouping is inferred using patient demographics (age, gender), department flow, activity sequence, and timing consistency. Each case represents a unique patient path through the hospital.

### **Case 1: 45-Year-Old Male (ER Patient)**  
- **Patient Profile**: Age 45, Gender Male  
- **Department Flow**: ER  Radiology  ER  Discharge  
- **Key Activities**: Registration  Triage  Imaging  Consultation  Discharge  
- **Events**:  
  1. `Register patient` (ER, 08:05:13)  
  4. `Initial triage` (ER, 08:10:50)  
  7. `X-ray imaging` (Radiology, 08:15:42)  
  12. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 08:23:10)  Diagnosis: hairline fracture  
  15. `Patient discharged` (ER, 08:30:05)  Follow-up: outpatient clinic

### **Case 2: 62-Year-Old Female (ER Patient)**  
- **Patient Profile**: Age 62, Gender Female  
- **Department Flow**: ER  Laboratory  ER  Discharge  
- **Key Activities**: Registration  Triage  Lab Tests  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge  
- **Events**:  
  2. `Register patient` (ER, 08:07:02)  
  5. `Initial triage` (ER, 08:12:29)  
  8. `Lab test requested` (ER, 08:16:10)  Blood panel  
  10. `Lab test completed` (Laboratory, 08:20:27)  Normal results  
  11. `Doctor consultation` (ER, 08:22:54)  Diagnosis: minor infection  
  14. `Prescription created` (ER, 08:27:00)  Antibiotics  
  17. `Patient discharged` (ER, 08:35:29)  Follow-up: pharmacy pickup

### **Case 3: 28-Year-Old Male (Surgery Patient)**  
- **Patient Profile**: Age 28, Gender Male  
- **Department Flow**: Surgery  Surgery  Discharge  
- **Key Activities**: Registration  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge  
- **Events**:  
  3. `Register patient` (Surgery, 08:07:15)  
  6. `Doctor consultation` (Surgery, 08:13:00)  Reason: scheduled knee surgery  
  9. `Surgery preparation` (Surgery, 08:16:45)  General anesthesia  
  13. `Surgery performed` (Surgery, 08:25:19)  Arthroscopy  
  16. `Recovery room` (Surgery, 08:31:37)  Stable condition  
  18. `Patient discharged` (Surgery, 08:40:13)  Follow-up: physiotherapy sessions

### **Key Inferences**  
1. **Patient Demographics**:  
   - Unique `(age, gender)` pairs (45M, 62F, 28M) ensure no overlap.  
   - No duplicate demographics across cases.  

2. **Department Workflow**:  
   - **Case 1**: ER-centric (triage, imaging, discharge).  
   - **Case 2**: ER  Laboratory  ER (consistent with diagnostics).  
   - **Case 3**: Entirely Surgery-focused (prep, surgery, recovery).  

3. **Activity Sequencing**:  
   - Each case follows a logical flow (e.g., registration  triage  discharge for ER cases; registration  surgery  recovery for the surgery case).  
   - Timing gaps align with real-world processes (e.g., lab results taking 4 minutes, discharge post-surgery after 9 minutes).  

4. **Resource Consistency**:  
   - Resources (e.g., Dr. Smith for ER cases, Dr. Lee for surgery) are specific to cases.  
   - Departments (ER, Surgery, Radiology, Lab) are case-specific.  

5. **Additional Info**:  
   - Diagnoses (fracture, infection), procedures (arthroscopy), and follow-ups are internally consistent within each case.

### **Summary Table**  
| Case | Patient Age/Gender | Key Departments | Activities | Discharge Time |  
|------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|  
| 1    | 45M                 | ER, Radiology    | Registration  Triage  X-ray  Consultation  Discharge | 08:30:05 |  
| 2    | 62F                 | ER, Laboratory   | Registration  Triage  Lab Test  Consultation  Prescription  Discharge | 08:35:29 |  
| 3    | 28M                 | Surgery          | Registration  Consultation  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge | 08:40:13 |  

This grouping ensures all events are attributed to distinct patient journeys with no cross-case interference.
