The process described by the DECLARE model can be summarized as follows:

### Process Overview:
The process revolves around the submission, approval, and payment handling of a declaration. It involves four key activities, each occurring exactly once, and follows a strict sequence.

### Key Activities:
1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
2. **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
3. **Request Payment**
4. **Payment Handled**

### Process Flow:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The process begins with the **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**.

2. **Sequence of Activities**:
   - After the declaration is submitted, it must be **FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**.
   - Once approved, the employee can **Request Payment**.
   - Finally, the **Payment is Handled**.

### Constraints:
- **Exactly 1**: Each activity (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`) occurs exactly once.
  
- **Precedence**:
  - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` must come before both `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` and `Payment Handled`.
  - `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` must come before `Request Payment` and `Payment Handled`.
  - `Request Payment` must come before `Payment Handled`.

- **Chain Precedence/Succession/Response**:
  - The process follows a direct sequence:
    - `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE` → `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR` → `Request Payment` → `Payment Handled`.

- **Co-Existence**:
  - If one of the core activities (`Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE`, `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR`, `Request Payment`, `Payment Handled`) occurs, the others must also occur.

- **Absence**:
  - Several activities such as `Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER`, `Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION`, and others are explicitly excluded from this process.

### Summary:
The process models a straightforward workflow where an employee submits a declaration, which is then approved by a supervisor. Following approval, the employee requests payment, and finally, the payment is handled. The process is linear, with no alternative paths or additional steps beyond these core activities.
