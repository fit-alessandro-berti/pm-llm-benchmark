1. Normativerule violations

Case 1  
- No violations. All required steps occur in the mandated order (Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case).

Case 2  
- Risk Assessment precedes Credit Check (ordering violation).  
- “Inform Applicant” is missing entirely (must follow Loan Decision).  
- Finalize Documentation after a rejection (forbidden).  
 Case 2 breaches multiple strict rules.

Case 3  
- No violations. The sequence matches the prescribed flow for an approved loan.

2. Desiderata (timing & follow-up) deviations

Case 1  
- Follow-up Call was not performed. (Desideratum: encouraged but not mandatory.)

Case 2  
- Follow-up Call missing.  
- (Other timing desiderata moot because “Inform Applicant” never happened.)

Case 3  
- Credit Check took place ~49 hours after Application Received (ideal <24 h).  
- Inform Applicant occurred ~51 hours after Loan Decision (ideal <48 h).  
- Follow-up Call missing.

None of these timing or follow-up deviations are strict violations—just suboptimal practice.

3. Possible interpretations / justifications

• Case 2  
  - Risk Assessment may have been started on the basis of preliminary data, with the formal Credit Check logged afterward.  
  - A system or workflow error could have auto-triggered documentation finalization even though the outcome was rejection.  
  - The missing Inform Applicant step might reflect an e-mail delivery failure or misconfiguration.

• Case 3  
  - The 24-hour window for Credit Check may have been delayed by a bank holiday or system maintenance.  
  - The 48-hour target for informing the applicant could have slipped due to the applicant’s unavailability or staffing constraints.  
  - Omission of the Follow-up Call likely reflects its recommended (not mandatory) status; teams may prioritize closing the case.

• Case 1  
  - The absence of a Follow-up Call simply reflects that it is a best practice rather than a requirement; teams may skip it when schedules are tight.

Summary  
- Only Case 2 violates the strict normative rules.  
- All three cases skip the recommended Follow-up Call, and Case 3 also breaches both timing recommendations. These are “desiderata” issues—worthy of improvement but not process failures.
