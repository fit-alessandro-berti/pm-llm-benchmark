1. NormativeRule Violations  
   • Case 1: No violations. The activities occur in the required order, and because the loan was approved, documentation was finalized before closing.  
   • Case 2: Violates multiple hard rules:  
     – Risk Assessment (08:20) occurs before Credit Check (09:00).  
     – Inform Applicant is missing entirely (you must inform the applicant after the decision and before any finalization or closing).  
     – Finalize Documentation (10:00) is performed despite a rejection.  
   • Case 3: No normative violations. All required steps occur in the correct order for an approved loan.  

2. Desiderata (Recommended) Deviations  
   • Case 1:  
     – No Followup Call before closing. (Recommended but not mandatory.)  
   • Case 2:  
     – No Followup Call.  
   • Case 3:  
     – Credit Check delayed: ~49 hours after receipt (desired 24 hrs).  
     – Inform Applicant delayed: ~51 hours after decision (desired 48 hrs).  
     – No Followup Call.  
   Note: These are suboptimal but do not breach the strict process rules.  

3. Possible Interpretations / Justifications  
   • Case 2:  
     – The risk assessment was initiated urgently (e.g. flagged highvalue request) before formal credit data arrived, then corrected sequence.  
     – Documentation may have autotriggered from a template engine despite the rejection.  
     – Inform Applicant may have been communicated verbally or via another channel not logged, though it should be recorded.  
   • Case 3:  
     – The loan team may have been shortstaffed or handling a backlog over a weekend/holiday, causing the creditcheck and notification delays.  
     – The followup call was skipped because all documentation was complete and no issues were pending.  

Recommendations to improve adherence:  
 - Enforce automated sequencing checks (prevent RA before CC, block finalize after rejection).  
 - Add required “Inform Applicant” recording immediately post-decision.  
 - Introduce alerts for timing thresholds (e.g. CC >24 hrs, Inform >48 hrs).  
 - Encourage or automate the Followup Call step to capture this best practice.
