The diagram presents a detailed view of a healthcare process involving lab visits and lab tests, depicted through two main components: a process diagram and a class diagram. The process diagram (a) illustrates the workflow of a lab visit, starting with a doctor ordering a test, a lab assistant taking a blood sample, performing the test, and then judging the results. Depending on the results, the process may loop back for retesting or proceed to send the final report. The class diagram (b) shows the relationship between the 'Lab visit' and 'Lab test' classes, indicating that a lab visit requires one or more lab tests. The table (c) provides an example of a performative message, detailing the time, channel, sender, receivers, action, content, scope, and direction of a specific communication within the process. The overall concept highlights the interaction between different roles (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst) and systems (order system, HIS) in managing lab tests, emphasizing the structured flow of tasks and information to ensure accurate and efficient lab testing processes.
