First, the prompt requires identifying cases with the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed immediately by 'Create Order', followed immediately by 'Confirm Order'. No other events from the same case should be between these three.

Then, among those cases, I need to find where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days.

Finally, exclude those cases from the final result. So, I should return all events from cases that do NOT have this sequence with the timing condition.

The output should be all events from the cases that are not filtered out.

To structure this in SQL with DuckDB:

1. I need to find the cases that have the exact sequence.

Since it's in direct succession, I have to look for rows where for a given case_id, there are three consecutive events in that order.

Events are ordered by timestamp, so I need to consider the order of events per case.

One way is to use window functions to identify consecutive activities.

I can use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a sequence number per case, ordered by timestamp.

Then, for each case, check if there are three consecutive rows where the activities are exactly those three.

Something like:

First, select from event_log, add a row number per case ordered by timestamp.

Then, join or self-reference to find where row N has 'Approve Purchase Requisition', row N+1 has 'Create Order', and row N+2 has 'Confirm Order'.

More precisely, for each potential starting point, check the next two.

But then, for those cases where such a sequence exists, check the timestamp difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence.

This might be tricky in SQL.

I could use LEAD() function to look ahead.

For each event, get the next event's activity and timestamp, and the one after that.

Since it's per case, I need to partition by case_id.

So, perhaps:

SELECT

    case_id,

    activity,

    timestamp,

    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

    LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,

    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp

FROM event_log;

For each row, if activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Create Order' AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order', then for that case, check if (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > 5 days.

next_timestamp would be for 'Create Order', and next_next_timestamp for 'Confirm Order'.

So, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp.

If that's more than 5 days, then mark that case.

Since the sequence might appear multiple times in a case, but the condition is for the case to have at least one such sequence with the timing, I think we just need to identify if the case has any such sequence that meets the criteria.

The prompt says: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine to only those where the time elapsed... is more than 5 days."

It might be interpreted as for that sequence in the case.

If a case has multiple such sequences, we check each, but I think we exclude the case if it has at least one such sequence with the timing >5 days.

The prompt: "Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine the selection to only those where the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' event and the 'Confirm Order' event of that sequence is more than 5 days."

It says "of that sequence", implying for the sequences that exist, if for a sequence the time >5 days, then include that case in the exclusion.

To exclude cases that have at least one such sequence where time >5 days.

Yes.

In the subquery, I need to find distinct case_id where there exists at least one instance of the sequence with time difference >5 days.

Then, from the main query, select events where case_id is not in that list.

Plan:

First, create a CTE or subquery to find the bad cases.

In that subquery:

From the windowed select above, filter where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next_activity = 'Create Order' AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

Then, from those rows, select distinct case_id.

Those are the cases to exclude.

Finally, select from event_log where case_id NOT IN (that subquery).

Yes!

One thing: timestamps are datetime, so subtracting them gives an interval, and I can compare to INTERVAL '5' DAY.

In DuckDB, that should work.

Also, ensure that the events are from the same case, which they are since we're partitioning by case_id.

In the window function, LEAD will only look within the partition, so yes.

What if a case has fewer than 3 events? Then for the last events, LEAD might be NULL, so the condition will be false, which is fine.

If the sequence isn't exact, it won't match.

Great.

So, let's sketch the query.

WITH ranked AS (

    SELECT

        case_id,

        activity,

        timestamp,

        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,

        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,  -- for 'Create Order'

        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp  -- for 'Confirm Order'

    FROM event_log

)

SELECT DISTINCT case_id

FROM ranked

WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

AND next_activity = 'Create Order'

AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

Let’s call this subquery bad_cases.

In the main query:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (

    SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases  -- or whatever I name it

)

To make it a single query:

SELECT *

FROM event_log

WHERE case_id NOT IN (

    WITH ranked AS (

        -- as above

    )

    SELECT case_id

    FROM ranked

    WHERE ...  -- conditions

)

In DuckDB, I think you can nest CTEs, but to keep it clean, I can use a subquery.

I can do:

SELECT *

FROM event_log e

WHERE e.case_id NOT IN (

    SELECT r.case_id

    FROM (

        SELECT

            case_id,

            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,

            -- etc.

        FROM event_log

    ) r

    WHERE r.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'

    AND r.next_activity = 'Create Order'

    AND r.next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'

    AND (r.next_next_timestamp - r.next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY

)

Yes, that works.

One potential issue: if there are multiple sequences in a case, this will still pick the case_id as long as at least one matches.

Which is what we want.

If a case has the sequence but the time is not >5 days, it won't be in the subquery, so it won't be excluded.

Perfect.

The final result should return all events from the cases that are not in that list, so yes.

I think that's it.

The prompt says: "Please ensure proper grouping, ordering, and filtering so that the result set consists solely of events from the cases that are not filtered out."

I don't need to order the final result; it just says to return the events, probably in the order they are or whatever, but since it's a select *, it will return all columns.

If they want it ordered, the prompt doesn't specify, so I'll leave it as is.

Alright, let's write the final query.
</think>

```sql
-- First, identify the cases that have the specified sequence with the time condition
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,  -- Timestamp for 'Create Order'
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp  -- Timestamp for 'Confirm Order'
    FROM event_log
),
bad_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM ranked
    WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
      AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL '5' DAY  -- Time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days
)

-- Now, select all events from cases that are NOT in bad_cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM bad_cases);
```

This query first uses a CTE to add lead columns for checking the sequence and timing per case. It then identifies the cases to exclude in `bad_cases`. Finally, it selects all events from the cases that do not meet the exclusion criteria.
