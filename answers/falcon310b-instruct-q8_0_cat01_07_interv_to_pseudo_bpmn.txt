**BPMN-like Process Model Text Description:**

1. **Start:** Invoice received via email.

2. **Activity:** *Mary* checks for a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - **Gateway:** 
     - If no PO, send back to supplier and wait for PO details.
     - If PO exists, proceed to next step.

3. **Activity:** *Mary* logs invoice into the accounting system.

4. **Activity:** Mary forwards to *Dan* for goods receipt confirmation.
   - **Artifact:** Invoice document and associated PO details.

5. **Activity:** *Dan* confirms goods receipt against PO.
   - **Gateway:**
     - If discrepancies (e.g., missing items, incorrect pricing), contact supplier or ask *Mary* to hold invoice.
     - If confirmed, send confirmation email to *Mary*.

6. **Activity:** *Mary* matches invoice line items with PO in the system.
   - **Gateway:**
     - If everything matches, proceed.
     - If discrepancies (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items), escalate to *Rita* for resolution.

7. **Activity:** *Mary* sends invoice for *Carlos* approval.
   - **Artifact:** Invoice document, PO details, and Dan's confirmation.

8. **Activity:** *Carlos* reviews invoice and PO.
   - **Gateway:**
     - If suspicious (e.g., large discrepancies, unexpected items), reject or ask *Mary* to hold and investigate further.
     - If approved, proceed.

9. **Activity:** Invoice is scheduled for payment by *Mary*.
   - **Artifact:** Finalized invoice ready for payment processing.

10. **End:** Payment scheduled and processed.

**Key Roles/Participants:**  
- *Mary* (Accounts Payable Clerk): Responsible for initial checks, logging invoices, and managing discrepancies.
- *Dan* (Purchasing Officer): Confirms goods receipt against PO, resolves discrepancies with suppliers if needed.
- *Carlos* (Department Manager): Final approval based on system notifications, responsible for rejecting invoices if necessary.
- *Rita* (Accounts Payable Supervisor): Handles exceptions and issues that require escalation.
- *Karen* (Supplier Relationship Manager): Indirectly involved in resolving discrepancies by liaising with suppliers.

**Exceptions/Variations:**  
- If no PO, invoice is sent back to the supplier.
- If discrepancies are found that can't be easily resolved, the invoice is escalated to *Rita*.
- If an invoice doesn't match any PO due to informal contracts, *Rita* works with department heads to create a retrospective PO or decide on rejection.

This textual model should provide a clear, structured overview of the invoice approval process, capturing the sequence, decision points, and involved roles, while also highlighting potential exceptions that might arise during the process.
