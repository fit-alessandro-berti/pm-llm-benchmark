### **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

#### **Preprocessing and Data Integration**
To create a cohesive event log, the data from GPS, scanners, dispatch, and maintenance systems need to be integrated based on shared identifiers (e.g., Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Package ID, Timestamps). Key steps include:
- **Event Alignment:** Align events from different systems into a single timeline using timestamps.
- **Case ID Definition:** Define a "Case ID" as a unique vehicle-day combination (e.g., V12-20241205) to group events for end-to-end delivery processes.
- **Attribute Enrichment:** Enrich events with additional context, such as planned routes, customer time windows, and traffic conditions, using dispatch and external data.
- **Data Cleansing:** Handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data (e.g., GPS outages, scanner malfunctions).

**Challenges:**
- **Data Heterogeneity:** Different data formats, granularities, and frequencies across sources.
- **Temporal Synchronization:** Ensuring precise alignment of timestamps across systems.
- **Event Correlation:** Linking events like a delivery failure to a specific package and its planned route.

#### **Process Discovery**
Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner), the *actual* end-to-end delivery process can be visualized as a process model. This model will include:
- Key activities (e.g., Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success).
- Deviations (e.g., unplanned stops, unscheduled maintenance, failed deliveries).
- Decision points (e.g., rerouting due to traffic).

#### **Conformance Checking**
Compare the discovered process model with the *planned* routes using conformance checking techniques. Identify:
- **Sequence Deviations:** Unplanned activities like unscheduled stops or re-routes.
- **Timing Deviations:** Significant delays compared to planned travel times.
- **Outcome Deviations:** Failed deliveries or incomplete routes.

### **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Relevant KPIs include:
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of deliveries within the customer’s requested time window.
- **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total service time (at customer locations) divided by the number of stops.
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Time spent driving vs. time spent at customer locations.
- **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Total fuel used divided by distance traveled or packages delivered.
- **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time vehicles are actively used vs. idle/stationary.
- **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Percentage of delivery attempts that fail.
- **Traffic Delay Duration/Impact:** Time spent in traffic delays and their effect on delivery schedules.

**Calculation Example:**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Number of deliveries within time window / Total attempted deliveries.
- **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** Total travel time (from GPS) / Total service time (from scanner events).

#### **Bottleneck Identification**
Use process mining techniques like **performance analysis** and **bottleneck analysis** to identify:
- **Location-Based Bottlenecks:** Traffic hotspots or areas with frequent delays.
- **Time-Based Bottlenecks:** Specific times of day with high congestion or delivery failures.
- **Activity-Based Bottlenecks:** Extended dwell times at customer locations or depot.
- **Driver/Vehicle-Specific Bottlenecks:** Inefficiencies linked to specific drivers or vehicles.

**Quantification:**
- Measure bottlenecks using metrics like **cycle time** and **waiting time** for specific activities or segments.

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

#### **Potential Root Causes**
- **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes that don’t account for real-time traffic or dynamic customer demands.
- **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Misalignment between planned and actual travel times.
- **Traffic Congestion:** Recurring delays in specific areas or times.
- **Service Time Variability:** Inconsistent time spent at customer locations due to parking issues or customer availability.
- **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Unscheduled maintenance disrupting delivery schedules.
- **Driver Behavior:** Inefficient practices like excessive idling or deviation from assigned routes.
- **Failed Deliveries:** High rates of failed attempts requiring re-delivery.

#### **Process Mining Analyses**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes or drivers to identify differences in practices.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Link traffic data with delays to quantify the impact of congestion.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Identify prolonged service times and correlate with external factors (e.g., parking availability).

### **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing Adjustments**
- **Target:** Suboptimal route planning and traffic delays.
- **Root Cause:** Static routes not accounting for real-time conditions.
- **Insights:** Use process mining to identify recurring traffic bottlenecks and high-delay areas.
- **Implementation:** Implement real-time route optimization using GPS and traffic data.
- **Impact:** Reduced travel time, improved On-Time Delivery Rate, lower fuel consumption.

#### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories**
- **Target:** Inefficient route sequences and high travel times.
- **Root Cause:** Overlapping or unbalanced delivery territories.
- **Insights:** Analyze historical performance data to identify optimal territories.
- **Implementation:** Redesign delivery territories based on package density and travel time.
- **Impact:** Reduced Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, higher Vehicle Utilization Rate.

#### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Target:** Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of proactive maintenance.
- **Insights:** Use maintenance logs to identify patterns in vehicle usage and failure.
- **Implementation:** Develop predictive maintenance schedules based on vehicle usage data.
- **Impact:** Reduced unscheduled stops, improved Vehicle Utilization Rate.

### **5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring**

#### **Operational Constraints**
- **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure proposed strategies comply with legal working hour limits.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Optimize routes to avoid exceeding vehicle load limits.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Prioritize deliveries within requested windows to maintain service quality.

#### **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Dashboards:** Create process mining dashboards to track KPIs like On-Time Delivery Rate, Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio, and Failed Delivery Rate.
- **Key Views:** Monitor process models for new bottlenecks or deviations post-implementation.
- **Alerts:** Set up alerts for emerging issues like increased traffic delays or vehicle breakdowns.
