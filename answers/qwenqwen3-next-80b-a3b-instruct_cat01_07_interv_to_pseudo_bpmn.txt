Here is a **structured, BPMN-like textual process model** derived from the interview transcripts. This model captures activities, sequence flows, gateways, roles, artifacts, and exceptions in a logically coherent format suitable for conversion into a BPMN diagram.

---

### **BPMN-Like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

#### **1. Start Event**
- **Event:** `Invoice Received`  
  - Trigger: Invoice arrives via email or electronic system.  
  - Artifact: *Invoice Document* (contains invoice number, date, line items, amounts, supplier, and optionally PO number)

#### **2. Activities & Sequence Flow**

**Activity 1: Initial Validation (Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk – Mary)**  
- Check if invoice contains a valid **Purchase Order (PO) number**.  
- **Artifact Used:** *Invoice Document*, *PO Database*  
- **Output:** Validated invoice (with PO) or flagged invoice (without PO)

**Gateway 1: PO Existence Check (Exclusive Gateway)**  
- **Condition 1 (Yes):** PO number present  Proceed to **Activity 2**  
- **Condition 2 (No):** PO number missing  **Activity 1.1: Request PO from Supplier**  
  - Mary emails supplier to provide PO number or corrected invoice.  
  - **Exception Path:** Invoice is placed in “Awaiting PO” queue.  
  - *Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)* may be contacted if supplier is unresponsive.  
  - After supplier responds  Loop back to **Activity 1**

**Activity 2: Log Invoice in System (Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk – Mary)**  
- Enter invoice details into accounting system.  
- System auto-generates tracking ID and notifies Purchasing Department.  
- **Artifact Created:** *System Invoice Record*

**Activity 3: Confirm Goods/Services Received (Performed by: Purchasing Officer – Dan)**  
- Dan reviews invoice against original PO:  
  - Compare quantities, pricing, delivery charges, and item descriptions.  
- **Artifact Used:** *System Invoice Record*, *Original PO Document*  
- **Gateway 2: Match Check (Exclusive Gateway)**  
  - **Condition 1 (Yes):** All line items match  Proceed to **Activity 4**  
  - **Condition 2 (No):** Discrepancy detected  **Activity 3.1: Resolve Discrepancy**  
    - Dan emails Mary to flag issue OR contacts supplier directly (via Karen if needed).  
    - Supplier may send corrected invoice  Loop back to **Activity 1** (re-validation)  
    - If unresolved after 2 attempts  **Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)**  
    - *Note:* Dan never approves without confirmed PO — PO is mandatory.

**Activity 4: Notify Manager for Approval (Performed by: System)**  
- System automatically sends approval request to Department Manager (Carlos).  
- **Artifact Sent:** *Invoice + PO + Purchasing Confirmation* (displayed in approval interface)

**Activity 5: Manager Approval (Performed by: Department Manager – Carlos)**  
- Carlos reviews:  
  - Invoice amount vs. budget  
  - Nature of goods/services  
  - Confirmation from Purchasing  
- **Gateway 3: Approval Decision (Exclusive Gateway)**  
  - **Condition 1 (Approve):** All checks passed  Proceed to **Activity 6**  
  - **Condition 2 (Reject/Query):** Suspicious amount or item  **Activity 5.1: Hold & Investigate**  
    - Carlos rejects or requests clarification from Mary.  
    - Mary investigates (may involve Rita or Karen)  Loop back to **Activity 3** or **Activity 1**  
    - *Rare event (~1–2/month)*

**Activity 6: Schedule for Payment (Performed by: Accounts Payable Clerk – Mary)**  
- Invoice is queued for next payment run in accounting system.  
- Payment date scheduled based on payment terms.  
- **Artifact Updated:** *System Invoice Record*  Status: “Approved for Payment”  
- **Output:** *Payment File* (exported to treasury system)

#### **3. Exception Paths & Escalation Routes**

**Exception Path A: Unlinked Invoice (No PO, Non-PO Expense)**  
- **Trigger:** Invoice received without PO and cannot be linked to any order.  
- **Performed by:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
- Rita consults with department head to:  
  - Create a **retrospective PO** (if expense is legitimate)  then re-enter into normal flow  
  - OR **Reject invoice** (if unauthorized)  
- **Outcome:** Either re-enters at **Activity 1** (with new PO) or is archived as “Rejected”

**Exception Path B: Unresolved Discrepancy Escalation**  
- **Trigger:** Discrepancy persists after 2 rounds of clarification between Mary and Dan.  
- **Performed by:** Rita (Supervisor)  
- Rita:  
  - Contacts supplier (Karen for support)  
  - Coordinates between AP, Purchasing, and department head  
  - Decides: Accept (with note), reject, or create exception log  
- **Outcome:** If resolved  re-enters flow at **Activity 3**  
- If rejected  archived as “Rejected – Unresolvable Discrepancy”

**Exception Path C: Supplier Coordination (Karen’s Role)**  
- Karen is not in the core flow but is activated via:  
  - Mary or Dan requesting contract/price verification  
  - Rita requesting supplier negotiation for non-PO invoices  
- **Trigger:** “PO missing” or “pricing discrepancy”  
- **Action:** Karen contacts supplier, confirms contract terms, provides corrected info  
- **Output:** Updated invoice or clarification note  fed back into **Activity 1** or **Activity 3**

#### **4. Roles & Responsibilities Summary**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** | Receive invoice, validate PO, log in system, forward to Purchasing, handle matching, schedule payment, escalate unresolved issues to Rita |
| **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** | Confirm receipt and match invoice to PO, flag discrepancies, communicate with supplier or Mary |
| **Department Manager (Carlos)** | Final approval based on budget, reasonableness, and prior confirmations; may reject for anomalies |
| **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** | Handle exceptions: non-PO invoices, unresolved discrepancies, supplier coordination, prevent bottlenecks |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** | Resolve supplier-side issues (missing PO, pricing errors) via contract verification; supports AP/Purchasing but does not approve |

#### **5. Artifacts (Documents/Data Objects)**

| Artifact | Description | Used By |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Invoice Document** | Original invoice (email or PDF) | Mary, Dan, Karen |
| **Purchase Order (PO)** | Original order document | Mary, Dan, Rita |
| **System Invoice Record** | Digital record in accounting system | Mary, Carlos, System |
| **Payment File** | Batch file sent to treasury for payment run | Mary |
| **Discrepancy Log** | Internal note on mismatch (optional) | Mary, Dan, Rita |
| **Retrospective PO** | Created for non-PO expenses | Rita, Department Head |

#### **6. Key Variations & Ambiguities Noted**

- **Ambiguity 1:** *Who triggers the manager’s approval?*  
  - Mary says system auto-sends; Dan and Carlos assume it happens automatically.  
  -  **Consensus:** System-triggered (no manual initiation by Mary/Dan).

- **Ambiguity 2:** *Can Dan approve without Mary’s confirmation?*  
  - Mary states Dan’s confirmation is required before manager approval.  
  - Dan says he only confirms receipt — doesn’t initiate approval.  
  -  **Consensus:** Dan’s confirmation is a prerequisite, but manager approval is system-triggered post-confirmation.

- **Ambiguity 3:** *Is Rita ever involved in final approval?*  
  - Rita says she does *not* approve — only resolves exceptions.  
  - Carlos confirms he is the sole approver.  
  -  **Consensus:** Rita is an exception handler, not an approver.

- **Exception Handling Variability:**  
  - Some invoices with missing POs are resolved by Karen within 24 hours; others take weeks.  
  -  **Model Note:** “Supplier response time is variable; process may stall indefinitely without supervisor intervention.”

#### **7. End Event**
- **Event:** `Invoice Paid`  
  - Triggered when payment file is processed by treasury system.  
  - Artifact Updated: *System Invoice Record*  Status: “Paid”  
  - Process concludes.

### **Summary Flow (Linear View for Diagramming)**

```
[Start]  Invoice Received
       
[Activity 1: Validate PO]  (No PO?)  [Activity 1.1: Request PO from Supplier]  Loop to Activity 1
        (Yes)
[Activity 2: Log Invoice in System]
       
[Activity 3: Confirm Receipt (Dan)]  (Discrepancy?)  [Activity 3.1: Resolve Discrepancy]  Loop to Activity 1 or Escalate to Rita
        (Match)
[Activity 4: System Notify Manager]
       
[Activity 5: Manager Approval]  (Reject?)  [Activity 5.1: Hold & Investigate]  Loop to Activity 3 or 1
        (Approve)
[Activity 6: Schedule for Payment]
       
[End: Invoice Paid]
```

**Exception Branches (Parallel):**  
- `[Activity 1.1]`  Can trigger `Karen (Supplier)`  Back to Activity 1  
- `[Activity 3.1]`  Escalates to `Rita`  May lead to Retrospective PO  Back to Activity 1  
- `[Activity 5.1]`  May involve `Rita` + Department Head  Back to Activity 3 or Reject

### **Notes for BPMN Diagram Conversion**

- Use **Exclusive Gateways** for all decision points (PO check, match check, approval).  
- Use **Intermediate Message Events** to represent email notifications (e.g., “Notify Manager”, “Request PO”).  
- Use **Call Activities** or **Subprocesses** for “Resolve Discrepancy” and “Handle Non-PO Invoice” to keep main flow clean.  
- Represent roles via **Swimlanes**: Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Manager, Supervisor, Supplier (Karen as external participant).  
- Artifacts can be shown as **Data Objects** connected to relevant activities.  
- Exception paths should be modeled as **Alternative Flows** branching from gateways, not as separate processes.
