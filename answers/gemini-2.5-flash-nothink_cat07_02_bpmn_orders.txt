This image displays a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating a product order fulfillment process, divided into four distinct pools (swimlanes): **Sales**, **Production**, **Procurement**, and **Warehouse**.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

**1. Sales Pool:**
*   The process begins with a "Monday morning" timer event.
*   The first task is "Check order for completeness".
*   Next, there's a task to "Check if customer is already in the database".
*   This leads to an exclusive gateway:
    *   If "Customer not in the database", a task "Add customer to the database" is executed, which interacts with a "database" data store.
    *   Regardless, if "Customer in the database" (or after adding), the flow merges.
*   The next task is "Send order details". This sends a message (represented by a dashed line with a message icon) "Order details" to both the Production and Procurement pools.
*   After sending order details, a "Product sent" intermediate message event is awaited.
*   Finally, the "Draft invoice" task is performed, leading to the end of the Sales process.

**2. Production Pool:**
*   The Production process starts when "Order details arrive" (triggered by a message from Sales).
*   There's an inclusive gateway, indicating that "Plan production" and potentially other parallel activities can occur.
*   "Plan production" is executed.
*   Following this, another inclusive gateway is present.
*   The "Manufacture product" task is performed.
*   If "Material not faulty" (indicated by a conditional flow returning to the inclusive gateway before "Manufacture product"), the manufacturing continues.
*   Upon completion, a "Product complete" intermediate message event occurs, sending a message to the Warehouse pool. This also marks the end of the production process.

**3. Procurement Pool:**
*   The Procurement process also starts when "Order details arrive" (triggered by a message from Sales).
*   It immediately enters a "Material Compensation Subprocess" (indicated by a collapsed subprocess box).
    *   Inside this subprocess, "Order materials" is the first task.
    *   There's a loop indicated by a gateway and a dashed line: if "Return material" occurs (possibly due to faulty material), it loops back to "Order materials".
    *   After ordering, the flow proceeds to "Check materials".
    *   An error event "Order cancellation" can occur during "Check materials", leading to the termination of the subprocess and the entire Procurement process.
    *   If materials are checked successfully, the subprocess ends, and the Procurement process also ends.

**4. Warehouse Pool:**
*   The Warehouse process starts when "Product complete" (triggered by a message from Production).
*   The task "Send product" is performed.
*   Finally, a "Product sent" intermediate message event occurs, sending a message back to the Sales pool. This concludes the Warehouse process.

**Overall Flow and Interactions:**
*   The process is initiated by Sales.
*   Order details are sent to both Production (for manufacturing) and Procurement (for material acquisition).
*   Production and Procurement can run in parallel to some extent. Production needs materials, which implies a dependency on Procurement, though not explicitly modeled as a direct message flow from Procurement to Production in this diagram for material delivery.
*   If materials are faulty, Procurement handles compensation.
*   Once Production completes the product, the Warehouse is notified to send the product.
*   Finally, the Sales department is notified that the product has been sent, allowing them to draft the invoice.

The diagram effectively illustrates a multi-departmental workflow, highlighting task dependencies, parallel activities, decision points, and message exchanges between different business units.
