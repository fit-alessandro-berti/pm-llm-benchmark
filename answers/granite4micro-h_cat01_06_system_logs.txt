### Explanation of Process Mining Logic

1. **Case Identification:** 
   - Cases were identified based on logical work sessions where the user was engaged with a specific document or application for an extended period. The separation between editing a document and switching to email communication suggests distinct cases (e.g., working on `Document1.docx` versus handling emails). Thus, two main cases were created: one focused on `Document1.docx` and another combining interactions with the email client and Adobe Acrobat.

2. **Activity Naming:** 
   - The raw system log events were translated into higher-level activity names that reflect meaningful actions within a process instance (e.g., "Typing" activities became specific to what was typed). This transformation aimed at creating standardized, analyst-friendly activity names such as "Focus," "Save," and "Type."

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - Each event in the final log includes the required attributes: Case ID for grouping events into cases; Activity Name for clarity on what the user did; Timestamp to maintain chronological order. Additional details like application name, window title, or specific keys pressed were included when they provided context that could be useful for analysis.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The transformed log tells a clear story of the user's work session. It begins with focused editing in Microsoft Word (`Document1.docx`), transitions to handling emails and PDFs using Google Chrome and Adobe Acrobat, respectively, then switches back to document editing with Microsoft Excel before finally closing all applications.

This structured event log is now ready for analysis by standard process mining tools, offering insights into the user's workflow and potential areas of improvement or optimization.
