Let’s analyze each case step-by-step according to the normative process.

---

## **Normative Process Rules (interpreted)**

1. **Start** with `Receive order`.
2. Then **must** do `Check inventory`.
3. **If inventory sufficient**:
   - `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`
   - `Authorize payment` must occur *before* `Package items`.
   - `Package items` must occur *before* `Ship order`.
4. **If inventory insufficient**:
   - `Cancel order`  `Close order`
   - No `Authorize payment`, `Package items`, or `Ship order` after `Cancel order`.
5. `Close order` must be the final activity in all cases.

## **Case-by-Case Check**

### **Case 1**
Sequence:  
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Package items`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

- Follows the **sufficient inventory** path correctly.  
-  **No violation**.

---

### **Case 2**
Sequence:  
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Package items`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

- Violation: `Package items` occurs **before** `Authorize payment`.  
- According to the description:  
  > "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."

  This clearly states that `Authorize payment` must come **before** `Package items`.  
-  **Violation** — wrong order between `Authorize payment` and `Package items`.

---

### **Case 3**
Sequence:  
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Cancel order`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

- This is problematic:
  1. `Authorize payment` happened, which implies inventory was sufficient (since payment is not authorized if inventory insufficient).
  2. But then `Cancel order` occurred — unusual, but maybe possible if payment failed later? However, the normative process doesn’t explicitly allow cancellation after authorization in the sufficient-inventory path.
  3. **Major violation**: `Ship order` after `Cancel order`.  
     The text says: "Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)."  
     So `Ship order` after cancellation is not allowed.
-  **Violation** — shipping after cancellation.

---

### **Case 4**
Sequence:  
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Cancel order`  `Close order`

- Follows the **insufficient inventory** path.  
-  **No violation**.

---

### **Case 5**
Sequence:  
`Receive order`  `Check inventory`  `Authorize payment`  `Ship order`  `Close order`

- Missing `Package items` between `Authorize payment` and `Ship order`.  
- The description says: `Package items` should occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.  
- So skipping `Package items` is a violation.  
-  **Violation** — missing `Package items` before `Ship order`.

---

## **Summary of Violations**

- **Case 2**: `Package items` before `Authorize payment`.  
- **Case 3**: `Ship order` after `Cancel order`.  
- **Case 5**: Missing `Package items` between `Authorize payment` and `Ship order`.

**Cases 1 and 4** are compliant.
