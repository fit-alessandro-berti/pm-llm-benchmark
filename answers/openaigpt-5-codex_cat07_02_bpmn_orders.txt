The visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram that maps the cross-functional order-fulfillment process across four departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Each department is represented by a horizontal swim lane, with activity flow from left to right. 

In the Sales lane, activities begin on Monday morning with a start event leading to “Check order for completeness.” The process then checks whether the customer is already in the database, using an exclusive gateway. If not, the customer is added to the database; otherwise, the flow continues. Sales then sends order details and drafts the invoice.

Production receives the order details and plans production. After a gateway, the product is manufactured and, once complete, the product is passed forward. A dashed line connects to Procurement to verify material availability.

Procurement includes a “Material Compensation Subprocess” where materials are ordered and may be returned if faulty. Materials are checked; an interruption event can cancel the order if there’s an issue.

Finally, in the Warehouse lane, once the product is complete, it is sent to the customer, concluding with an end event after confirmation that the product has been sent.

Throughout the diagram, data objects (e.g., database), message events, gateways, and dashed message flows illustrate the interactions and decision points that guide the process from order receipt through fulfillment.
