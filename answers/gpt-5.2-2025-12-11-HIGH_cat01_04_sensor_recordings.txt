### Inferred phases (activities) from the numeric event log (Machine M1)

I segmented the trace by **change-points** in the sensor regimes (sudden shifts in temperature/vibration/flow/tool position/energy). Each stable regime corresponds to a likely “activity” on the line.

| Phase | Events | Inferred activity label | Key sensor signature (why it looks like this activity) |
|---|---:|---|---|
| A | 1–3 | **Idle / Standby (ready state)** | Temperature ~20–21°C, pressure = 1 bar, vibration = 0, flow = 0, tool position = 0, low energy (~0.4–0.5 kWh). This is consistent with the machine powered but not processing material. |
| B | 4–6 | **Cutting / Machining (material removal)** | Sharp jump in temperature (5058°C), **high vibration** (3038 Hz), **high material flow** (5 units/s), tool position advancing (510 mm), energy rising (2.03.0 kWh). This combination strongly suggests an engaged tool cutting while material is being fed. |
| C | 7–8 | **Assembling / Press-fit / Clamping & positioning** | Temperature drops to ~40°C, **pressure increases** to 2 bar, vibration drops to ~10 Hz, flow reduced (2 units/s), tool position holds at 15 mm, energy steady (~2.0 kWh). Higher pressure + lower vibration + fixed tool position often matches clamping/pressing/positioning rather than cutting. |
| D | 9 | **Welding / Joining (high-heat operation)** | Temperature spikes to **80°C**, vibration spikes to **50 Hz**, **material flow = 0**, tool position stays fixed (15 mm), **energy peaks** at 5.0 kWh. High heat + high energy with no feed is characteristic of a joining step (e.g., spot/arc welding) rather than machining. |
| E | 10 | **Cool-down / Transition (post-weld settle)** | Temperature falls (to 30°C), vibration nearly zero (1 Hz), flow = 0, energy drops to 1.0 kWh while tool position still at 15 mm. Looks like a short stabilization/cool-down before the next station/task. |
| F | 11–12 | **Quality Inspection / Measurement** | Temperature ~25°C, low vibration (~5 Hz), small but nonzero flow (1 unit/s), tool position shifts and holds at 20 mm, moderate energy (1.5–1.6 kWh). This resembles controlled movement/handling with low mechanical stress—typical of probing, scanning, or inspection while parts move slowly. |
| G | 13–15 | **Cycle complete / Reset to idle** | Returns to the initial baseline: temp ~20–21°C, vibration = 0, flow = 0, tool position reset to 0, low energy (~0.4–0.5 kWh). Indicates unloading/reset and waiting for the next unit. |

### Resulting high-level discovered process (sequence)
**Idle/Standby  Cutting/Machining  Assembly/Clamping  Welding/Joining  Cool-down/Transition  Quality Inspection  Reset/Idle**

This is the most plausible mapping because the log shows clear regime changes: **(1) engaged cutting with feed and high vibration**, **(2) higher-pressure lower-vibration holding/pressing**, **(3) a single high-energy high-temperature no-flow joining spike**, then **(4) low-stress controlled motion consistent with inspection**, and finally return to idle.
