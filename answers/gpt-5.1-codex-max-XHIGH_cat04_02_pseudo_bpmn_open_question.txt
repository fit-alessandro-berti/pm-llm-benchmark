One way to think about improving the flow you sketched is to look at where humans are currently making binary decisions or performing repetitive checks, and either move those upstream, run them in parallel, or replace them with systems that can make a first cut.

Concretely:

- At the very start, you could insert an “Autoclassify Request” subprocess before the XOR on request type. A lightweight rules engine or a trained model can look at the request content, past history and customer profile to predict with reasonable confidence whether it’s likely to be standard or custom. Highconfidence standard items can go straight to validation, while ambiguous or likely custom items can be flagged for a fasttrack feasibility triage.

- In Task B1/B2, look for opportunities to automate. Standard validation is a prime candidate for RPA or API calls into your CRM/ERP to pull credit, contract terms, etc. For custom feasibility, you could break it into an “Automated Fit Check” subprocess that checks known constraints and a narrower “Human Design Review” task only for edge cases.

- The AND “Run Parallel Checks” can be expanded to include other automated checks (fraud, compliance) and kicked off as soon as the request is ingested, rather than after the type check, to shave time off the critical path. An orchestration layer can manage completion and retries without human intervention.

- Introduce a new XOR gateway after the feasibility or validation steps such as “Autoapprove?” with thresholds based on risk scores. Lowrisk, standard orders under a limit could bypass manager approval entirely. For custom work, an “Escalate to specialist?” gateway can route complex cases to a specialized team while simpler customizations go through a templated quotation process.

- Add a “Resource Allocation” subprocess tied to Tasks D/E1: as soon as a delivery date or quotation is being prepared, a workforce management system can reserve capacity or suggest optimal schedules based on current load, reducing downstream bottlenecks.

- You can also add a “Proactive Notification” task: if predictive analytics indicate a high likelihood of delay or rejection, notify the customer early and propose alternatives. This tends to improve satisfaction even if the answer isn’t immediately positive.

These changes tend to have a few effects:

- Turnaround times drop because fewer items wait in queues for manual checks, and more activities run in parallel. Autorouting and autoapproval reduce handoffs.

- Flexibility increases because the process adapts based on prediction and rules rather than a fixed path. Complex requests are identified earlier and get the right expertise sooner.

- Customer satisfaction benefits from faster responses and clearer expectations. Selfservice portals tied into the automation can let customers track status and provide needed information asynchronously.

There is, however, an operational tradeoff: adding automation, dynamic routing and predictive models increases system complexity and requires good data governance. You need monitoring and exception handling subprocesses to catch model errors or automation failures. Starting with wellbounded pilots and building feedback loops into the process will help ensure performance gains outweigh the additional overhead.
