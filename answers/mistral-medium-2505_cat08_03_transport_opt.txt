# **Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Operations**

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

### **Data Preprocessing and Integration**
To create a cohesive event log for process mining, we must integrate data from multiple sources:
- **GPS Trackers:** Provide timestamps, locations, speed, and vehicle status (e.g., idle, moving).
- **Driver Scanners:** Record delivery milestones (e.g., arrival, departure, success/failure).
- **Dispatch System:** Contains planned routes, assigned packages, and time windows.
- **Maintenance Logs:** Track vehicle downtime and repairs.

**Challenges:**
- **Data Alignment:** Events from different systems may have mismatched timestamps or missing links (e.g., GPS data not aligned with scanner events).
- **Event Correlation:** Linking vehicle movements (GPS) with delivery events (scanner) requires a unique identifier (e.g., `Case ID = Vehicle-Day`).
- **Noise Handling:** GPS data may have inaccuracies (e.g., signal loss in urban areas), requiring filtering or interpolation.

**Solution:**
- Use **event correlation techniques** (e.g., matching timestamps and location proximity) to align GPS, scanner, and dispatch data.
- Apply **data cleaning** (e.g., removing duplicate events, handling missing values).
- Enrich the log with derived attributes (e.g., travel time between stops, dwell time at customer locations).

### **Process Discovery**
Using **process discovery algorithms** (e.g., Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner, or Heuristics Miner), we can visualize the **actual delivery process**:
- **Key Activities:**
  - Depart depot  Travel to customer  Arrive customer  Delivery attempt (success/failure)  Depart customer  Return to depot.
  - Deviations: Unplanned stops (e.g., traffic delays, maintenance), failed deliveries (requiring re-routing).
- **Visualization:** A **process flow diagram** showing the most frequent paths, bottlenecks, and deviations.

### **Conformance Checking**
Compare the **discovered process** against the **planned routes** from the dispatch system:
- **Deviation Types to Identify:**
  - **Sequence Deviations:** Drivers not following the planned stop order.
  - **Unplanned Stops:** Unexpected delays (e.g., traffic, vehicle issues).
  - **Timing Deviations:** Longer-than-expected travel or service times.
- **Tools:** Use **alignment-based conformance checking** (e.g., ProM or Celonis) to quantify deviations and identify root causes.

## **2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification**

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
| KPI | Calculation | Relevance |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate** | (Successful deliveries within time window) / (Total deliveries) | Measures punctuality. |
| **Average Time per Delivery Stop** | (Total service time) / (Number of stops) | Identifies slow customer interactions. |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio** | (Total travel time) / (Total service time) | High ratio suggests inefficient routing. |
| **Fuel Consumption per km/Package** | (Total fuel used) / (Distance traveled or packages delivered) | Cost efficiency metric. |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate** | (Active delivery time) / (Total shift time) | Measures fleet efficiency. |
| **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays** | Count of low-speed events (GPS) | Identifies congestion hotspots. |
| **Failed Delivery Rate** | (Failed attempts) / (Total attempts) | High rate increases re-delivery costs. |

### **Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Identify stops with unusually long service times (e.g., parking issues, customer delays).
- **Traffic Impact Analysis:** Correlate GPS speed data with delivery delays.
- **Maintenance Impact Analysis:** Check if unscheduled stops (e.g., engine warnings) cause delays.

**Quantifying Impact:**
- Use **performance spectrum analysis** to rank bottlenecks by their impact on KPIs (e.g., "Traffic delays in Zone X increase delivery time by 20%").

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes**
1. **Suboptimal Route Planning:**
   - Static routes may not account for real-time traffic.
   - **Analysis:** Compare planned vs. actual travel times.
2. **High Variability in Service Time:**
   - Some customers take longer (e.g., finding parking, interactions).
   - **Analysis:** Identify outliers in dwell time per stop.
3. **Vehicle Breakdowns & Maintenance:**
   - Unscheduled stops increase downtime.
   - **Analysis:** Correlate maintenance logs with delivery delays.
4. **Driver Behavior Differences:**
   - Some drivers may take inefficient paths or spend excess time.
   - **Analysis:** Compare driver performance variants.
5. **Failed Deliveries:**
   - Require re-routing, increasing costs.
   - **Analysis:** Check if certain time windows or locations have higher failure rates.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Validation**
- **Variant Analysis:** Compare routes with high vs. low delays.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Link traffic data with delivery times.
- **Dwell Time Analysis:** Identify stops with excessive service time.

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Traffic Adjustments**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Static routes leading to traffic delays.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of real-time adjustments.
- **Process Mining Insight:** GPS data shows recurring congestion hotspots.
- **Implementation:** Use **predictive routing algorithms** (e.g., Google Maps API) to adjust routes dynamically.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduces travel time, improving **On-Time Delivery Rate** and **Fuel Efficiency**.

### **Strategy 2: Optimized Delivery Territories & Time Windows**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** High failed delivery rates.
- **Root Cause:** Poorly managed customer time windows.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Failed deliveries cluster in certain zones/times.
- **Implementation:** Use **historical success rates** to adjust time windows and prioritize high-success zones.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduces re-delivery costs, improving **Failed Delivery Rate**.

### **Strategy 3: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
- **Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled vehicle breakdowns.
- **Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance.
- **Process Mining Insight:** Maintenance logs show patterns (e.g., certain vehicles fail after X km).
- **Implementation:** Schedule maintenance based on **usage patterns** (e.g., after 5,000 km).
- **Expected Impact:** Reduces downtime, improving **Vehicle Utilization Rate**.

## **5. Operational Constraints and Continuous Monitoring**

### **Handling Constraints**
- **Driver Working Hours:** Ensure routes comply with labor laws.
- **Vehicle Capacities:** Optimize load distribution.
- **Customer Time Windows:** Use historical data to set realistic windows.

### **Continuous Monitoring Plan**
- **Dashboard Metrics:**
