**Justification of Naming Choices:**

1. **"Verify Documents" Activities:**

   - **Initial Document Verification:**
     
     - **Cases Affected:** C001 (first occurrence), C002, C003 (with "Physical" specified).
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Initial Document Verification"** to clarify that this is the first time documents are being verified in the process. In Case C003, added **"Physical"** to reflect the in-person verification at a branch, distinguishing it from the online submissions in other cases.
     - **Contextual Clues:** Occurs immediately after "Initiate Request" and involves checking identity documents for the first time.

   - **Verify Additional Documents:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C001 (second occurrence).
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Verify Additional Documents"** to indicate that the agent is verifying documents that were provided after a request for missing items.
     - **Contextual Clues:** Follows the activity "Submit Additional Documents," where the customer provides the requested ID scan.

   - **Re-Verify Documents After Adjustment:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C003 (second occurrence).
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Re-Verify Documents After Adjustment"** to show that the documents are being re-verified due to changes made to the account.
     - **Contextual Clues:** Occurs after "Adjust Account Due to Missing Information," indicating the need to confirm the documents align with updated account details.

2. **"Call Customer" Activities:**

   - **Call Customer for Missing Documents:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C001.
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Call Customer for Missing Documents"** to specify the purpose of the call, which is to request additional documentation needed for verification.
     - **Contextual Clues:** The previous activity indicates incomplete verification, and the context mentions requesting missing documents.

   - **Call Customer to Clarify Account:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C002 (first occurrence).
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Call Customer to Clarify Account"** to indicate that the call is made to address discrepancies in the customer's account details.
     - **Contextual Clues:** The context specifies an "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy."

   - **Call Customer to Confirm Adjustments:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C002 (second occurrence).
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Call Customer to Confirm Adjustments"** to show that the agent is following up to ensure the customer is aware of changes made to their account.
     - **Contextual Clues:** Follows "Adjust Account After Clarification," and the context mentions confirming the adjustments made.

   - **Call Customer to Return to Branch:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C003.
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Call Customer to Return to Branch"** to reflect that the customer had left the branch and needed to be contacted to continue the process.
     - **Contextual Clues:** The context notes that the customer "stepped out" and the officer calls to have them return.

3. **"Adjust Account" Activities:**

   - **Adjust Account After Clarification:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C002.
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Adjust Account After Clarification"** to specify that account adjustments were made following clarification obtained from the customer.
     - **Contextual Clues:** This activity occurs after "Call Customer to Clarify Account."

   - **Adjust Account Due to Missing Information:**
     
     - **Case Affected:** C003.
     - **Reasoning:** Renamed to **"Adjust Account Due to Missing Information"** to indicate that the account was adjusted internally because of missing details that were uncovered.
     - **Contextual Clues:** The context mentions "Internal correction due to missing info."

4. **Consistency in Activity Naming:**

   - Consistently used **"Initial Document Verification"** for the first verification step across all cases for clarity.
   - Specified the nature or purpose of calls to the customer by including phrases like **"for Missing Documents," "to Clarify Account,"** and **"to Confirm Adjustments."**
   - Ensured that any repeated activities within the same case were renamed to reflect their unique role in that specific context, aiding in distinguishing them during process analysis.
