**Short Answer:**  
The main differences are that the protected group is rejected more frequently and at earlier stages, while the unprotected group more often proceeds further along the process—signing contracts, moving in, and paying rent multiple times before eventually leaving. In other words, the protected group tends to experience shorter, more rejection-heavy trajectories, whereas the unprotected group more commonly achieves a full tenancy life cycle.

**Detailed Analysis:**  
When comparing process variants for the protected and unprotected groups, several key patterns emerge:

1. **Higher Early-Stage Rejection for the Protected Group:**  
   - Protected tenants frequently encounter rejection soon after viewing the property. For instance, the protected group’s top process variants by frequency often end in "Reject Prospective Tenant." Consider the largest frequencies for the protected group:
     - "…View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (1036 occurrences)  
     - "…View The Property -> … -> Extensive Screening -> Reject Prospective Tenant" (793 occurrences)  
   - A substantial portion of the protected group’s recorded cases never progress beyond the early stages (applying, viewing, initial screening) before being rejected.

2. **More Extended Tenancy Trajectories for the Unprotected Group:**  
   - In contrast, the unprotected group has large numbers of cases that not only pass initial screening and rejection points but also proceed to sign contracts, move in, and pay rent multiple times before eventually ending the tenancy by canceling the apartment.  
   - For example, the unprotected group has high-frequency trajectories like:
     - "…Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" (268 occurrences)  
     - Other sequences with multiple rent payments (e.g., paying rent 2, 3, 4, 5 times) before "Tenant Cancels Apartment" show strong representation, often in the triple-digit frequencies.  
   - This pattern indicates the unprotected group more commonly enters into and sustains an actual landlord-tenant relationship, rather than being screened out early.

3. **Differences in the Complexity and Duration of Processes:**  
   - Both groups undergo screening and sometimes "Extensive Screening," but the protected group’s paths that lead to successful tenancy and multiple rent payments are relatively rare and have low frequency (often in single or low double digits).  
   - Performance times (execution times) also differ. For example, rejection after viewing for the protected group (270,000.477) is somewhat longer than a comparable step for the unprotected group (240,000.654). While these differences might not be massive, they do suggest variations in how quickly final decisions are reached.
   - The protected group’s most complex and lengthy sequences (those that lead to tenancy, multiple rent payments, and eventual cancellation) are not only less common but also often associated with longer total performance times (e.g., over 1,000,000 time units in some cases).

4. **Unequal Chances of Being Granted Tenancy:**  
   - The biggest and clearest disparity is in the probability of moving from "prospective tenant" to "signed contract" and then actually living in and paying rent for a period. For the protected group, this is a relatively rare outcome, while for the unprotected group it is a significant portion of their recorded process variants.  
   - This discrepancy suggests that the protected group faces more stringent gatekeeping and less opportunity to become long-term tenants.

**Conclusion:**  
From a fairness or discrimination perspective, the main takeaway is that the protected group does not enjoy the same likelihood of progressing through the entire rental pipeline. They are more commonly stopped early, while the unprotected group often successfully reaches the latter stages of tenancy. This imbalance in progression rates and eventual outcomes suggests that the protected group might be subject to differential treatment—fewer successful tenancy outcomes and more frequent, earlier rejections.
