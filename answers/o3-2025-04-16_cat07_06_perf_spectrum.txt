The graphic is a time-scale “event-flow” chart that places three successive activities on separate horizontal bands and then connects the timestamps for each individual case with straight line segments.

Layout
1. Horizontal bands (top to bottom)
   • Send Fine  
   • Insert Fine Notification  
   • Send for Credit Collection  

2. X-axis
   • Calendar time, ranging from late January 2000 on the left to late April 2013 on the right.

3. Connecting lines
   • Grey, almost vertical lines join Send Fine  Insert Fine Notification.  
     These lines are nearly vertical because those two activities typically occur at virtually the same moment.  
   • Pink/red, diagonally slanted lines join Insert Fine Notification  Send for Credit Collection.  
     The varying slopes show how long it takes, for each individual fine, before the case is escalated to credit collection:  
       – Steep diagonal = short delay.  
       – Shallow diagonal = long delay.

Visual impression
• The upper half of the plot is densely filled with grey vertical strokes, indicating a very large number of fines that move instantly from “Send Fine” to “Insert Fine Notification.”  
• Only a subset of those fines continue to the credit-collection step, visible as the red diagonals that drop to the bottom band.  
• The red diagonals form a repeating triangular pattern, highlighting batches of cases that are sent for collection at discrete points in time.  
• Because the plot spans more than a decade, you can also see whether escalation delays or volumes change over the years.

In short, the visualization shows, for thousands of fines issued between 2000 and 2013, how quickly they progress first to notification (almost immediate) and, for a subset, how long they later take to reach credit collection.
