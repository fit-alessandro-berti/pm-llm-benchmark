The graphic is a timeordered eventlog or “dottedchart” style view of three activities that occur in the same business process.

1. Axes and layout  
   • Horizontal axis = calendar time, running from January 2000 (left) to about April 2013 (right).  
   • The three horizontal bands correspond to three different activities in the process.  
        – Top line: “Send Fine”  
        – Middle line: “Insert Fine Notification”  
        – Bottom line: “Send for Credit Collection”  
   • A very thin black line marks the position of each activity in the vertical dimension; the labels are written at the right end of the figure.

2. What the lines mean  
   • Each case (i.e., each individual fine) is drawn as a polyline that touches the activity band whenever that activity occurs for that case.  
   • Grey vertical strokes in the upper band represent the moment each “Send Fine” event happened. The fact that they are almost continuous indicates this step is executed very frequently and nearly instantaneously after the previous step.  
   • Red / pink diagonal lines that start in the middle band and end in the lower band represent cases that go from “Insert Fine Notification” to “Send for Credit Collection”.  
   • The steeper the diagonal, the shorter the elapsed time between the two steps; shallow diagonals indicate a longer waiting time.

3. Visual pattern  
   • The top band is extremely dense: thousands of fines are sent over the 13year period, with no large time gaps.  
   • Only a subset of those fines (shown in red) reach the “Send for Credit Collection” stage. They form triangular fans because many InsertNotification events occur on the same day, but the moment they are handed over to credit collection is spread out over days, weeks, or months.  
   • There are visible “waves” or clusters—periods when many cases are escalated (dense red fans) followed by quieter periods.

4. Interpretation  
   • “Send Fine” is the most common and almost immediate activity.  
   • “Insert Fine Notification” happens almost as often but is followed by one of two outcomes: either the case ends there (no red line), or it is escalated to credit collection after a variable delay (red diagonal).  
   • The process volume grows toward the right side of the timeline, suggesting an increase in throughput over the years.  
   • The consistent wedge shapes imply that, once a batch of fines is inserted, most of the escalations are resolved in a similar time frame.

In short, the visualization shows the timing and frequency of three key steps in a finemanagement process, revealing a high volume of immediate “Send Fine” events and a subset of fines that eventually proceed to credit collection after varying delays.
