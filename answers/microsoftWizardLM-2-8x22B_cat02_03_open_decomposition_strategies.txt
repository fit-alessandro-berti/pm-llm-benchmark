 Decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects involve breaking down complex processes into smaller, more manageable parts to facilitate analysis and understanding. These strategies can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of process mining activities. Here are the main benefits and challenges of applying decomposition strategies in such projects:

### Benefits:

1. **Improved Performance**: By focusing on smaller subprocesses, the computation time and resource consumption required for process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis can be drastically reduced.

2. **Increased Accuracy**: Decomposing a process allows for more accurate and detailed analysis of the individual components, which can lead to more precise models and insights.

3. **Handling Complexity**: Large processes can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. Decomposition helps in managing this complexity by dividing the process into simpler parts that are easier to analyze and interpret.

4. **Focused Improvement**: Decomposition enables targeted process improvement initiatives by isolating specific areas that require attention without overhauling the entire process.

5. **Scalability**: Decomposition strategies make it possible to scale process mining efforts to very large datasets and complex processes that would otherwise be infeasible to handle.

6. **Parallel Processing**: Smaller, independent parts of a process can be analyzed in parallel, leading to faster overall processing times, especially when leveraging distributed computing resources.

7. **Modularity**: Decomposed processes can be treated as modules that can be updated or replaced without impacting the rest of the process, facilitating continuous process improvement.

8. **Easier Collaboration**: Different teams can work on different parts of the process simultaneously, which can improve collaboration and efficiency in large organizations.

### Challenges:

1. **Boundary Identification**: Identifying the correct boundaries for decomposition is critical. Poorly defined boundaries can lead to suboptimal models and overlooked interdependencies between subprocesses.

2. **Data Preparation**: Decomposition often requires careful preprocessing of event logs to ensure that the resulting subprocesses are self-contained and meaningful.

3. **Integration of Results**: After analyzing the decomposed parts, integrating the findings into a coherent overall view of the process can be challenging.

4. **Dependency Management**: Subprocesses may have dependencies that are not immediately
