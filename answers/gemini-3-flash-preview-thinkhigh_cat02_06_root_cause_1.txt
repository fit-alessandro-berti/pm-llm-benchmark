Based on the analysis of the provided event log, here is the performance evaluation of the "Customer Support Ticket Resolution" process.

### 1. Case Duration Analysis
To identify significantly longer resolution times, we first calculate the total cycle time (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket") for each case:

*   **Case 103:** 1 hour 20 minutes (08:10 – 09:30) — **Fastest**
*   **Case 101:** 2 hours 15 minutes (08:00 – 10:15) — **Efficient**
*   **Case 104:** 24 hours 10 minutes (Mar 1, 08:20 – Mar 2, 08:30) — **Long**
*   **Case 102:** 25 hours 10 minutes (Mar 1, 08:05 – Mar 2, 09:15) — **Long**
*   **Case 105:** 49 hours 5 minutes (Mar 1, 08:25 – Mar 3, 09:30) — **Extremely Long**

**Identified Outliers:** Cases **102, 104, and 105** are the primary performance outliers, taking more than 10 times longer than the standard cases (101 and 103).

### 2. Root Cause Analysis of Delays

By examining the intervals between activities, we can pinpoint three specific bottlenecks:

#### A. The "Escalation Gap" (Cases 102 and 105)
The most significant delays occur after a ticket is escalated to a Level-2 Agent.
*   **Case 105:** After the escalation at 10:00 on March 1st, the next activity (Investigate Issue) did not begin until 14:00 on March 2nd—a **28-hour idle period**.
*   **Case 102:** There was a **2.5-hour gap** between assigning to L1 and escalating to L2, followed by another **2.5-hour gap** before the L2 agent began the investigation.

#### B. The "Investigation Stall" (Case 104)
Case 104 is unique because it was **not escalated**, yet it took over 24 hours.
*   **Queue Delay:** It sat for 3.5 hours between "Assign to Level-1" and "Investigate."
*   **Resolution Delay:** The investigation started at 13:00 on March 1st, but resolution wasn't reached until 08:00 the next day. This indicates either a very complex L1 issue or, more likely, the ticket was "forgotten" at the end of the business day.

#### C. The "Overnight/Shift Change" Factor
Cases 102, 104, and 105 all span across multiple days. In every instance, the "Resolve Ticket" activity occurs early in the morning (08:00 or 09:00). This suggests that tickets not resolved by the afternoon of the first day are being pushed to the next business day, leading to a significant inflation of total cycle time due to non-working hours.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations

The data suggests that the process is efficient for "First-Contact Resolution" (Level-1) but breaks down during handovers and specialized tasks.

#### Recommendations:

1.  **Optimize the L2 Handover (Address the 28-hour gap):**
    *   **Insight:** The L2 team appears understaffed or lacks a "triage" system for escalated tickets.
    *   **Action:** Implement an Internal Service Level Agreement (SLA) specifically for escalations, requiring L2 agents to acknowledge and begin investigation within 2–4 hours of the handover.

2.  **End-of-Day "Cleanup" Protocol:**
    *   **Insight:** Case 104 and 102 show that tickets "stalling" in the afternoon result in 15+ hour delays because they wait for the next morning.
    *   **Action:** Introduce a "Shift Handover" meeting or a digital dashboard that highlights tickets currently "In Investigation" at 16:00. This ensures tickets are either finished before EOD or handed off to a late-shift/global team.

3.  **Triage Refinement:**
    *   **Insight:** In Case 102, it took nearly 3.5 hours for L1 to realize they couldn't solve the problem.
    *   **Action:** Improve the "Triage Ticket" step. Provide L1 agents with a clearer checklist to identify "L2-only" problems earlier, reducing the wasted time spent by L1 before escalating.

4.  **Automated Alerts for Idle Tickets:**
    *   **Insight:** The system allows tickets (like 105) to sit in an "Escalated" state for over a day without activity.
    *   **Action:** Set up automated notifications in the ticketing system. If a ticket has been in "Escalated" or "Assigned" status with no activity for more than 4 hours, an alert should be sent to the Team Lead.
