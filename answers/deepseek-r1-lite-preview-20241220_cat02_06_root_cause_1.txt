### Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case

- **Case 101:** 2 hours and 15 minutes
- **Case 102:** 25 hours and 10 minutes
- **Case 103:** 1 hour and 20 minutes
- **Case 104:** 24 hours and 10 minutes
- **Case 105:** 49 hours and 5 minutes

**Significantly Longer Cases:**
- **Case 102**
- **Case 104**
- **Case 105**

### Step 2: Analyze Potential Root Causes

#### Case 102:
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** 2.5-hour delay after assignment to Level-1.
- **Investigation to Resolution:** 13.5-hour delay.
  
#### Case 104:
- **Assignment to Investigation:** 3.5-hour delay.
- **Investigation to Resolution:** 13-hour delay.
  
#### Case 105:
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** 1-day and 1-hour delay before re-investigation.
- **Investigation to Resolution:** 1-day and 2-hour delay.

**Common Issues:**
1. **Long Delays Post-Escalation:** Significant time lapses after escalating to Level-2 Agents.
2. **Extended Investigation and Resolution Phases:** Delays in progressing from investigation to resolution.
3. **Potential Resource Constraints:** Insufficient Level-2 Agents or capacity issues.
4. **Communication Gaps:** Possible miscommunication or handover delays between Level-1 and Level-2 teams.

### Step 3: Insights and Recommendations

- **Reduce Escalation Delays:** Ensure Level-2 Agents are promptly available and minimize handover time.
- **Monitor Investigation Phase:** Identify and resolve bottlenecks in the investigation process.
- **Resource Allocation:** Consider increasing the number of Level-2 Agents if demand is consistently high.
- **Implement SLAs:** Set clear Service Level Agreements for each phase of the process to maintain accountability.
- **Improve Communication Protocols:** Establish clearer communication channels between different levels of support agents.

By addressing these issues, the organization can streamline the support ticket resolution process and reduce overall cycle times, leading to improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
