Certainly! The provided visualization is a flowchart that outlines a business process, likely for order fulfillment in a manufacturing or production setting. It is divided into four main swimlanes or sections: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Here's a detailed explanation of each section:
Sales
Start: The process begins on Monday morning.
Check order for completeness: The first step is to ensure the order is complete.
Check customer's order in the database: If the order is complete, the next step is to check if the customer exists in the database.
If customer is already in the database: The process moves to adding the customer to the database.
If the customer is not in the database: The process ends here, implying the order cannot be processed.
Add customer to the database: If the customer is not already in the database, they are added.
Send order details: Once the customer is added to the database, the order details are sent.
Draft invoice: After sending the order details, an invoice is drafted.
End: The sales process ends here with the invoice being sent.
Production
Order details arrive: The production process starts when order details arrive from the sales section.
Plan production: The production planning is done based on the order details.
Manufacture product: The product is manufactured according to the plan.
Product complete: Once the product is manufactured, it is marked as complete.
If material is not faulty: The process moves forward to send the product to the warehouse.
Material Compensation Subprocess: If there's a material fault, it triggers a subprocess:
Order materials: Materials are ordered.
Return material: Faulty materials are returned.
Check materials: New materials are checked for quality.
Order cancellation: If materials cannot be sourced or are repeatedly faulty, the order might be canceled.
Procurement
Order details arrive: The procurement process starts when order details arrive.
Order materials: Materials required for production are ordered.
Check materials: Once materials arrive, they are checked for quality.
If materials are okay: The process moves forward.
Return material: If materials are faulty, they are returned.
Warehouse
Product complete: The warehouse process starts when the product is marked as complete from the production section.
Send product: The completed product is sent from the warehouse.
Product sent: The process ends with the product being sent out.
Key Points:
The flowchart uses decision points (diamonds) to determine the path based on conditions like customer existence in the database or material quality.
It shows interdependencies between departments (Sales, Production, Procurement, Warehouse) with dotted lines indicating the flow of information or materials.
The process includes error handling through the Material Compensation Subprocess, ensuring quality control and handling of faulty materials.
This flowchart provides a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process, highlighting how each department interacts and the steps involved from order receipt to product dispatch.
