Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata separately.

Starting with the normative rules:
1. The sequence must be: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.
2. Specific ordering rules:
   - Credit Check before Risk Assessment.
   - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision.
   - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.
   - If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case.
   - If rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing.
3. What's not allowed:
   - Skipping activities in the required sequence.
   - Changing the order (e.g., Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
   - Finalize Documentation after a rejection.
   - Closing the case without following the decision logic.

Now, looking at the event log for each case:

**Case 1:**
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
This looks perfect. It follows the sequence exactly as required. No violations here.

**Case 2:**
- Application Received  Risk Assessment (No prior Credit Check)  Credit Check  Loan Decision (Rejected)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
Here, Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. That violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Also, after a rejection, they did Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. So two normative violations here.

**Case 3:**
- Application Received  Credit Check (more than 24 hours later)  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant (later than 48 hours)  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
The sequence is correct, but the timing is off for Credit Check and Inform Applicant. However, these are desiderata violations, not normative ones. Also, there's no Follow-up Call, which is another desideratum.

Now, for the desiderata:
- Credit Check within 24 hours of application.
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of loan decision.
- Follow-up Call before closing (encouraged but not required).

In Case 3:
- Credit Check happened more than 24 hours after application (from 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 is about 48 hours, but the rule says "within 24 hours", so this is a violation of the desideratum).
- Inform Applicant happened on 2024-01-16 15:00, and the loan decision was on 2024-01-14 12:00. That's more than 48 hours later (from 12:00 on the 14th to 15:00 on the 16th is about 48 hours, but let's calculate: from 12:00 14th to 12:00 16th is 48 hours, so 15:00 is 48+3=51 hours, so yes, more than 48 hours).
- No Follow-up Call.

But remember, desiderata violations are not severe.

Now, to answer the questions:

1. Identify normative violations:
   - Case 2: 
     - Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
     - Finalize Documentation after rejection.

2. Identify desiderata violations:
   - Case 3:
     - Credit Check not within 24 hours.
     - Inform Applicant not within 48 hours.
     - No Follow-up Call.

But let's check Case 1 and Case 2 for desiderata too:
- Case 1: 
  - Credit Check: 9:00 to 9:30 (30 minutes, within 24 hours) - OK.
  - Inform Applicant: 11:00 to 13:00 (2 hours, within 48 hours) - OK.
  - Follow-up Call? Not mentioned, but it's not required, just encouraged. So no violation if missing, but it's not present here either. Wait, looking back at Case 1 log, there's no Follow-up Call either. But the problem says "No Follow-up Call" is noted for Case 3, but not for Case 1. Hmm, in the log for Case 1, there's no Follow-up Call listed. But the problem says for Case 3: "No Follow-up Call", implying that for others it might be present or not. But in Case 1's log, there's no Follow-up Call either. But the problem only mentions "No Follow-up Call" for Case 3. Maybe Case 1 and 2 don't have it either, but it's only noted for Case 3. But to be safe, let's assume that if it's not in the log, it didn't happen. So Case 1 and 2 also don't have Follow-up Calls, but it's only explicitly noted for Case 3. But since it's not a normative rule, it's okay.

But the desiderata is to have a Follow-up Call before closing. So if it's not there, it's a desideratum violation. But the problem says for Case 3: "No Follow-up Call", implying that for others it might be present or not noted. But in the logs for Case 1 and 2, there's no Follow-up Call either. So perhaps all cases except maybe some have it, but it's not listed. But since it's not in the log, we can assume it didn't happen. But the problem only explicitly notes "No Follow-up Call" for Case 3. Maybe in Case 1 and 2, it's not mentioned but could have happened. But to be precise, the log only shows the activities listed. So if Follow-up Call isn't listed, it didn't happen. So Case 1 and 2 also don't have Follow-up Calls, but since it's not a normative rule, it's okay.

But the problem says for Case 3: "No Follow-up Call", suggesting that for other cases, it might be present or not noted. But since the logs for Case 1 and 2 don't have it, perhaps it's not there. But to be safe, we should assume that if it's not listed, it didn't happen. So all three cases don't have Follow-up Calls, but only Case 3 is noted for it. Maybe because in Case 1 and 2, it's not relevant or not recorded. But given that, let's assume that the absence of Follow-up Call is a desideratum violation for all cases where it's not present. But since it's not strictly required, it's just a desideratum violation.

But looking back at the problem statement for desiderata: "it is encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case". So if it's not done, it's a desideratum violation. So in all cases where it's not done, it's a desideratum violation. But in the log, only Case 3 says "No Follow-up Call", implying that for Case 1 and 2, it might have happened or not. But since it's not listed in their logs, perhaps it didn't happen. But the problem only explicitly mentions no Follow-up Call for Case 3. Maybe in Case 1 and 2, it's not mentioned but could have happened. But to be safe, perhaps only Case 3 is noted for not having it, so maybe Case 1 and 2 did have it, but it's not in the log. But that seems unlikely because the log is supposed to list all activities. So probably, if it's not in the log, it didn't happen.

But the problem says for Case 3: "No Follow-up Call", which might imply that in other cases, it's not specified whether it happened or not. But given that the logs are supposed to be complete, and Follow-up Call is an activity, if it happened, it would be in the log. So likely, in Case 1 and 2, there was no Follow-up Call either, but it's only explicitly noted for Case 3. But to be precise, since it's not in the logs for Case 1 and 2, we can assume it didn't happen there either. But the problem might be implying that only Case 3 is missing it. This is a bit ambiguous.

Given that, perhaps it's safer to assume that only Case 3 is noted for not having the Follow-up Call, and the others might have had it (but it's not in the log, which is odd). Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is optional and not always recorded. To avoid overcomplicating, perhaps we should only consider Case 3 as having the "No Follow-up Call" noted, and assume that for Case 1 and 2, we don't know, so we shouldn't assume a violation.

But looking at the logs, the activities listed are the ones that happened. So if Follow-up Call isn't listed, it didn't happen. So all three cases are missing Follow-up Calls. But the problem only explicitly notes it for Case 3. Maybe because in Case 1 and 2, there were other issues (normative violations in Case 2), so the Follow-up Call wasn't noted. But to be thorough, if Follow-up Call is supposed to be before closing, and it's not in the log, then it's missing in all cases. But since it's not strictly required, it's just a desideratum violation.

But given that the problem only mentions "No Follow-up Call" for Case 3, perhaps in Case 1 and 2, it's not mentioned but could be assumed to have happened or not. But since the log is supposed to be complete, and Follow-up Call is an activity, if it happened, it would be listed. So likely, it didn't happen in any case, but it's only explicitly noted for Case 3. For consistency, perhaps we should assume that if it's not listed, it didn't happen, so all three cases are missing Follow-up Calls, but since it's not strictly required, it's just a desideratum violation for all.

But to align with the problem statement which only notes "No Follow-up Call" for Case 3, perhaps we should only consider Case 3 as having that desideratum violation.

Given that, let's proceed:

Normative violations:
- Case 2: 
  1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
  2. Finalize Documentation after rejection.

Desiderata violations:
- Case 3:
  1. Credit Check not within 24 hours.
  2. Inform Applicant not within 48 hours.
  3. No Follow-up Call.

Case 1 seems perfect, no violations of any kind.

Case 2 has normative violations, but we can check desiderata too:
- Credit Check: Application at 8:00, Credit Check at 9:00 (so within 1 hour, which is within 24 hours) - OK for desideratum.
- Inform Applicant: Loan Decision at 9:30, Inform Applicant isn't listed! Wait, in Case 2, the sequence is:
  Application Received, Risk Assessment, Credit Check, Loan Decision (Rejected), Finalize Documentation, Close Case.
  There's no "Inform Applicant" activity! That's a problem. The normative sequence requires Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. So in Case 2, they went from Loan Decision (Rejected) to Finalize Documentation (which is already wrong) to Close Case, without informing the applicant. That's another normative violation: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.

Wait, let's look at Case 2 again:
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            |

Missing "Inform Applicant" after Loan Decision. So that's another normative violation: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.

So Case 2 has three normative violations:
1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
2. Finalize Documentation after rejection.
3. Missing Inform Applicant step.

Now, Case 3:
Desiderata violations as above.

Case 1: no violations.

Now, to answer the questions:

1. Normative violations:
   - Case 2: 
     - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check.
     - Finalize Documentation performed after loan rejection.
     - Inform Applicant step was skipped.

2. Desiderata violations:
   - Case 3:
     - Credit Check was not completed within 24 hours of application receipt.
     - Applicant was not informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
     - Follow-up Call was not performed before closing the case.

But wait, in Case 2, is there a desideratum violation? The Credit Check was done within 1 hour of application (from 8:00 to 9:00), so that's within 24 hours - OK for desideratum. Inform Applicant is missing, but that's a normative violation, not a desideratum one. Finalize Documentation after rejection is normative. So Case 2's desiderata: 
- Credit Check timing: OK (within 24 hours).
- Inform Applicant timing: not applicable since Inform Applicant is missing (but that's normative).
- Follow-up Call: not present (but not noted explicitly like in Case 3). If we assume it's missing, then it's a desideratum violation, but since the problem only notes it for Case 3, perhaps we shouldn't assume for Case 2.

Similarly, Case 1:
- Credit Check: within 30 minutes - OK.
- Inform Applicant: within 2 hours of decision - OK.
- Follow-up Call: not present (but not noted), so perhaps missing, but not flagged.

Given that, perhaps only Case 3 has desiderata violations.

But to be thorough, if Follow-up Call is missing in all cases (since it's not in any log), then all have that desideratum violation. But since the problem only notes it for Case 3, perhaps it's only relevant for Case 3.

Alternatively, maybe the Follow-up Call is only relevant if the loan is approved (since for rejected loans, maybe there's no need). But the problem says "before closing the case", which happens in both approved and rejected cases. In Case 2, the case is closed after rejection, so Follow-up Call could have been before closing. But it's not there. But again, the problem only notes it for Case 3.

Given that, perhaps it's best to assume that the desiderata violations are only noted for Case 3, and not assume for others unless clear.

So final answer:

1. Normative violations:
   - Case 2: 
     - Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check.
     - Finalize Documentation was performed after loan rejection.
     - The Inform Applicant step was skipped.

2. Desiderata violations:
   - Case 3:
     - Credit Check was not completed within 24 hours of application receipt.
     - Applicant was not informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
     - Follow-up Call was not performed before closing the case.

For Case 1, everything is in order with both normative rules and desiderata.

For Case 2, in addition to the normative violations, if we consider the desiderata:
- Credit Check was done within 1 hour (ok).
- Inform Applicant is missing (but that's normative).
- Follow-up Call is missing (but not noted, so perhaps not considered).

For Case 3, all three desiderata are violated.

Now, to suggest interpretations or justifications:

For Case 2:
- Maybe the Risk Assessment was done by mistake before the Credit Check, and then they realized and did the Credit Check afterward. But this is a clear normative violation.
- Finalizing documentation after rejection is clearly wrong - perhaps a clerical error.
- Skipping Inform Applicant is also a clear violation.

For Case 3:
- The delays in Credit Check and Informing Applicant could be due to high workload or system delays, but these are not excusable under normative rules, but since these are desiderata, they're suboptimal but not severe.
- The missing Follow-up Call could be due to oversight or lack of resources.

Now, let's draft the response.
</think>

To address the problem, we need to identify the violations of normative rules and desiderata for each case based on the provided event logs.

1. **Normative Violations:**
   - **Case 2:**
     - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** The sequence of activities indicates that the Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check, which violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
     - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** After the loan was rejected, the documentation was finalized, which is not allowed according to the normative rules.
     - **Skipping Inform Applicant:** The Inform Applicant step was skipped after the loan decision, which is a required step in the normative sequence.

2. **Desiderata Violations:**
   - **Case 3:**
     - **Credit Check Timing:** The Credit Check was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received, which violates the desideratum that the Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours.
     - **Inform Applicant Timing:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the loan decision, which violates the desideratum that the applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
     - **No Follow-up Call:** There was no Follow-up Call before closing the case, which is encouraged but not strictly required.

For Case 1, there are no normative or desiderata violations. The sequence of activities follows the required normative rules and adheres to the desiderata.

For Case 2, the normative violations are clear and severe, as they directly contravene the strict rules of the loan application process. The desiderata violations are not applicable in this case due to the severe normative violations.

For Case 3, while the normative sequence is followed correctly, the delays in the Credit Check and Inform Applicant steps, as well as the missing Follow-up Call, represent suboptimal behavior according to the desiderata.

```markdown
1. **Normative Violations:**
   - **Case 2:**
     - Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check.
     - Finalize Documentation was performed after loan rejection.
     - The Inform Applicant step was skipped.

2. **Desiderata Violations:**
   - **Case 3:**
     - Credit Check was not completed within 24 hours of application receipt.
     - Applicant was not informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
     - Follow-up Call was not performed before closing the case.

3. **Interpretations/Justifications:**
   - **Case 2:** The out-of-order Risk Assessment and unauthorized Finalize Documentation suggest procedural errors or oversight. The missing Inform Applicant step is a clear violation of communication protocols.
   - **Case 3:** Delays in Credit Check and applicant notification may be due to operational bottlenecks (e.g., high volume), but these do not excuse normative violations (there are none here). The missing Follow-up Call could reflect resource constraints but is suboptimal for customer service.

This response identifies the violations and provides interpretations for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations.
