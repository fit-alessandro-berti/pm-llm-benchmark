### Justification for Naming Choices

1. **Verify Documents (C001, C002, C003):**
   - **Verify Initial Documents:** This activity occurs at the beginning of the process, where the agent first checks the documents provided by the customer. In Case C001, it follows the initial request and precedes the need for additional documents. In Case C002, it is the first verification step in the identity check. In Case C003, it is the initial physical verification at the branch.
   - **Verify Updated Documents (C001):** This activity occurs after the customer provides additional documentation, indicating a re-check of the documents. It highlights the additional step taken after the initial verification was incomplete.
   - **Verify Adjusted Documents (C003):** This activity occurs after an account adjustment, indicating a re-verification of the documents in the context of the updated account details.

2. **Call Customer (C001, C002, C003):**
   - **Call Customer for Missing Docs (C001):** This call is specifically made to request missing documents, as indicated in the context.
   - **Call Customer for Clarification (C002):** This call is made to resolve an account discrepancy, as mentioned in the context.
   - **Call Customer to Return (C003):** This call is made to ensure the customer returns to the branch to complete the process, as indicated in the context.
   - **Call Customer to Confirm Adjustments (C002):** This call is made to confirm that the customer is satisfied with the adjustments made to their account.

3. **Approve Request (C001, C002, C003):**
   - **Approve Final Request:** This activity appears at the end of each case, indicating the final approval after all necessary steps have been completed. The term "Final" clarifies that this is the concluding step in the process.

These renamings ensure that each activity clearly reflects its purpose and context within the process, making the event log more understandable and actionable for process analysts and stakeholders.
