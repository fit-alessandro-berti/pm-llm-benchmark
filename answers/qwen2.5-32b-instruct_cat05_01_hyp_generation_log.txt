Given the data and schema provided, let's identify some anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the event logs, hypothesize about their causes, and propose SQL queries to investigate these further.

### Anomalies and Hypotheses

1. **Incorrect Order of Activities:**
   - **Case:** In `case_id` 1002, the activities "Confirm Shipment" and "Ship Goods" appear before the "Perform Credit Check." This violates the assumed normal process flow.
   - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to a system or human error, a temporary bypassing of the credit check due to a policy exception, or potentially an issue with data entry.
   - **Investigation Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource
     FROM order_event_log
     WHERE case_id = 1002
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```

2. **Activities Performed by Incorrect Roles:**
   - **Case:** In `case_id` 1004, "Receive Payment" is recorded before "Issue Invoice." This is inconsistent with the normal process flow.
   - **Hypothesis:** This might indicate a mistake in the process or an attempt to expedite the payment process.
   - **Investigation Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource
     FROM order_event_log
     WHERE case_id = 1004
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```

3. **Missing Activities:**
   - **Case:** In `case_id` 1003, the "Validate Stock" activity is missing.
   - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to a skip in the process, possibly due to an override or an error in recording the activity.
   - **Investigation Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource
     FROM order_event_log
     WHERE case_id = 1003
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```

4. **Reversed or Misplaced Activities:**
   - **Case:** In `case_id` 1003, "Ship Goods" is recorded before "Confirm Shipment."
   - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to miscommunication between departments or a mistake in the process recording.
   - **Investigation Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, resource
     FROM order_event_log
     WHERE case_id = 1003
     ORDER BY timestamp;
     ```

### Proposed SQL Queries

1. **Query to Check for Out-of-Order Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource
   FROM order_event_log oel
   INNER JOIN (
       SELECT case_id, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity
       FROM order_event_log
   ) subq ON oel.case_id = subq.case_id AND oel.timestamp = (
       SELECT MIN(timestamp)
       FROM order_event_log
       WHERE case_id = subq.case_id AND activity = oel.activity
   )
   WHERE (subq.previous_activity = 'Register Order' AND oel.activity != 'Perform Credit Check')
      OR (subq.previous_activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND oel.activity != 'Validate Stock')
      OR (subq.previous_activity = 'Validate Stock' AND oel.activity != 'Confirm Shipment')
      OR (subq.previous_activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel.activity != 'Ship Goods')
      OR (subq.previous_activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oel.activity != 'Issue Invoice')
      OR (subq.previous_activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND oel.activity != 'Receive Payment');
   ```

2. **Query to Identify Missing Activities:**
   ```sql
   SELECT o.case_id
   FROM orders o
   LEFT JOIN (
       SELECT case_id, activity
       FROM order_event_log
   ) oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
   WHERE oel.activity NOT IN ('Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
   GROUP BY o.case_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT oel.activity) < 7;
   ```

3. **Query to Identify Activities Performed by Incorrect Roles:**
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, r.role, r.department
   FROM order_event_log oel
   INNER JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
   WHERE (oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department != 'Logistics')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND r.department != 'Finance')
      OR (oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.department != 'Finance');
   ```

These queries should help in identifying and further investigating anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the event logs.
