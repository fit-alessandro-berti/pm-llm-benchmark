ANOMALIES IN THE DECLARE MODEL  

1. Non-coexistence {E,C} vs. Existence {C}  
   • Rule “C must occur” collides with “E and C may never co-occur”.  
   • Consequence: the moment an evaluation (E) happens, the case becomes impossible to finish (because C is still mandatory).  
   • Logical effect: either all evaluations must be forbidden or all cases remain permanently open – both contradict business intent.

2. Responded-existence {E  A} rendered unreachable  
   • Because E is effectively banned by anomaly 1, the obligation “if E occurs then A must occur” can never be activated.  
   • This turns the constraint into dead code and masks potential “evaluate-without-assign” problems.

3. Hidden deadlock / vacuous satisfaction  
   • The model allows a trace consisting only of R … C (Receive then Close) because nothing obliges A, E, P or N to appear, yet it blocks the normal R-A-E-P-N-C flow.  
   • Business risk: essential assessments, approvals and customer notifications can be skipped but the case still complies with the model.

4. Incomplete ordering  
   • Only the precedence “R before C” is enforced. There is no guarantee that A precedes E, that P follows E, or that N precedes C, opening many unwanted permutations.

POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES  

a. Requirement misunderstanding: “E and C must not overlap in time” mis-translated into a strict non-coexistence constraint.  

b. Incremental policy change: an older rule forbidding closure after evaluation remained after a new rule mandating evaluation was added.  

c. Data-driven mining noise: automated discovery on noisy logs produced spurious non-coexistence because a few corrupt traces lacked C after E.  

d. Performance pressure: someone temporarily relaxed the flow (let R jump straight to C) to cut backlog and the temporary rule was never removed.  

e. Implementation gap: different teams edited different parts of the model, leading to inconsistencies that were never jointly reviewed.

SQL-BASED VERIFICATION STRATEGIES  

1. Claims closed without evaluation  
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims        c
JOIN claim_events  eC ON eC.claim_id = c.claim_id AND eC.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events eE 
       ON eE.claim_id = c.claim_id AND eE.activity = 'E'
WHERE eE.event_id IS NULL;
```

2. Traces that violate the non-coexistence (both E and C present)  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT claim_id
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('E','C')
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) = 2;
```

3. Evaluations that lack a preceding assignment  
```sql
SELECT eE.claim_id, MIN(eE.timestamp)  AS eval_time
FROM   claim_events eE
WHERE  eE.activity = 'E'
AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM claim_events eA
        WHERE eA.claim_id = eE.claim_id
          AND eA.activity = 'A'
          AND eA.timestamp < eE.timestamp )
GROUP BY eE.claim_id;
```

4. Order check: any activity executed before R (init violation)  
```sql
SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp
FROM   (
        SELECT claim_id,
               activity,
               timestamp,
               MIN(CASE WHEN activity='R' THEN timestamp END)
                 OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) AS first_R_time
        FROM claim_events) t
WHERE  timestamp < first_R_time;
```

5. Full path coverage: cases missing any of the intended six steps  
```sql
SELECT claim_id,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT activity, ',' ORDER BY activity) AS present_steps
FROM   claim_events
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 6;      -- 6 = R,A,E,P,N,C
```

6. Time-to-close comparison when E is present vs absent  
```sql
WITH times AS (
   SELECT claim_id,
          MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='R') AS received,
          MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity='C') AS closed,
          BOOL_OR(activity='E')                      AS has_evaluation
   FROM claim_events
   GROUP BY claim_id )
SELECT has_evaluation,
       AVG(closed - received) AS avg_duration
FROM   times
WHERE  closed IS NOT NULL
GROUP  BY has_evaluation;
```

Running the above queries will reveal whether the contradictory rules are being followed in practice, quantify their frequency, and highlight the operational impact of the anomalies.
