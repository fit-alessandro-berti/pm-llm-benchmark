**1. NormativeRule Violations**

| Case | Violation(s)                                                                                              | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 2    | a) “Risk Assessment” occurs before “Credit Check”<br/>b) “Inform Applicant” is missing<br/>c) “Finalize Documentation” after a rejection | a) The mandatory order is Credit Check  Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment at 08:20 precedes the Credit Check at 09:00, reversing the required ordering.<br/>b) After the Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), the applicant must be informed before any closure steps; there is no “Inform Applicant” entry.<br/>c) Finalizing documentation is only allowed if the loan is approved. In Case 2, Documentation is finalized at 10:00 despite a rejection at 09:30. |

> Note: Deviating from these timing or follow-up recommendations does not breach the strict process, but may impact customer experience or risk management.

**3. Possible Interpretations and Justifications**

- **Case 2**  
  - *Preliminary Risk Screening:* An initial “quicklook” risk assessment might have been triggered by a highvalue or highrisk application before the credit system completed its check, explaining the outoforder risk assessment.  
  - *Clerical Error or System Lag:* The documentation step after rejection could stem from an automated workflow misconfiguration that doesn’t check the decision outcome before generating closingpack materials.  
  - *Inform Applicant Omission:* If notification failed (e.g., email bounce or phone­system error), the system may have moved straight to closure without retrying, indicating a gap in exception handling.

- **Case 3**  
  - *Resource Constraints:* The creditcheck queue may have been backlogged over a weekend or holiday, leading to the 49 hour delay—still within acceptable risk boundaries but outside the ideal 24 hour window.  
  - *Applicant Unreachability:* A delayed inform step (51 hours) might reflect repeated unsuccessful contact attempts before finally reaching the applicant; best practice would be to log attempts.  
  - *Follow-Up Call Omission:* While recommended, the lack of a follow-up call may indicate that no substantive questions arose from documentation, or that the case size didn’t warrant the extra touch within existing staffing constraints.

**Summary**

- Only **Case 2** breaches the hard “normative” rules (wrong ordering, missing inform, forbidden documentation).  
- **Cases 1, 2, and 3** all show at least one noncritical “desideratum” deviation (timing or follow-up call), with Case 3 having the most timing lapses.  
- Addressing these recommendations—especially timely checks and applicant follow-ups—can enhance both compliance robustness and customer satisfaction.
