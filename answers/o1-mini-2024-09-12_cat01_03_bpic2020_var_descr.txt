The data provided outlines a comprehensive workflow for handling **Declarations** within an organization, encompassing submission, approval processes, potential rejections, resubmissions, and final payment handling. This workflow is characterized by multiple variants, each representing different paths a declaration can take from initiation to completion. Below is a detailed description of the underlying process:

### **1. Process Overview**

- **Initiation:** The process begins with a declaration being **SUBMITTED** by an **EMPLOYEE**.
- **Approval Stages:** The declaration undergoes a series of approval steps involving various roles:
  - **ADMINISTRATION**
  - **PRE_APPROVER**
  - **BUDGET OWNER**
  - **SUPERVISOR**
- **Finalization:** Once all necessary approvals are obtained, a **Request Payment** is initiated, culminating in the declaration being **Payment Handled**.

### **2. Detailed Process Flow and Variants**

#### **A. Standard Approval Pathways**

1. **Direct Approval by Administration and Supervisor**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → 
     Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → 
     Request Payment → 
     Payment Handled
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 4,618 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 810,187.903 (units could represent time in seconds, cost in currency, etc.)

2. **Approval via Budget Owner**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → 
     Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER → 
     Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → 
     Request Payment → 
     Payment Handled
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 2,473 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 1,084,338.407

3. **Direct Supervisor Approval without Intermediate Approvals**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → 
     Request Payment → 
     Payment Handled
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 1,392 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 854,633.975

4. **Approval via Pre-Approver**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER → 
     Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → 
     Request Payment → 
     Payment Handled
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 575 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 861,058.409

#### **B. Rejection and Resubmission Loops**

1. **Rejection by Administration Leading to Resubmission**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION → 
     Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     [Further approvals leading to Payment Handled]
     ```
   - **Frequency:** Ranges from 31 to 345 occurrences depending on the specific approval steps following resubmission.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Vary significantly, e.g., 727,139.517 to 2,542,497.917

2. **Rejection by Supervisor or Budget Owner**
   - **Paths involve:**
     - **Rejection by SUPERVISOR:** Leading to employee resubmission.
     - **Rejection by BUDGET OWNER:** Also prompting resubmission.
   - **Frequency:** Varies between 18 to 77 occurrences.
   - **Performance Metrics:** From 653,277.889 up to 2,750,847.800

3. **Multiple Rejection Cycles:**
   - **Paths where declarations are rejected multiple times by ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER before eventual approval.**
   - **Frequency:** Lower frequencies (e.g., 4 to 36 occurrences).
   - **Performance Metrics:** Higher performance values indicating longer or costlier processes, e.g., up to 3,542,980.041

#### **C. Special Cases**

1. **Declarations Saved Without Submission**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 134 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 0.000 (indicating no further processing)

2. **Rejections Due to Missing Information**
   - **Path Variants:**
     - Rejection by a role marked as **MISSING**, prompting resubmission.
   - **Frequency:** 21 to 40 occurrences
   - **Performance Metrics:** Ranging from 872,310.667 to 1,947,246.400

3. **Direct Payment Handling Without Final Approval**
   - **Path:**
     ```
     Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE → 
     Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION → 
     Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR → 
     Payment Handled
     ```
   - **Frequency:** 4 occurrences
   - **Performance Metric:** 9,110,508.000

### **3. Key Insights**

- **Most Frequent Path:** The pathway involving submission by the employee, approval by administration, and final approval by the supervisor is the most common, occurring 4,618 times.
  
- **Resubmission Complexity:** Processes involving rejections and multiple resubmissions tend to have higher performance metrics, indicating increased time, cost, or resource utilization.
  
- **Efficiency Bottlenecks:** High performance metrics in rejection loops suggest areas where process improvements could be targeted to reduce delays and enhance efficiency.
  
- **Low-Frequency Paths:** Several variants occur very infrequently (e.g., 4 to 575 times) but may represent edge cases or exceptional circumstances that could be analyzed separately for unique improvement opportunities.

### **4. Potential Recommendations**

- **Streamline Approval Processes:** Reducing the number of approval layers or clarifying approval criteria could decrease the likelihood of rejections and the need for resubmissions.
  
- **Enhance Initial Submission Quality:** Providing better guidelines or tools for employees to ensure declarations meet all requirements before submission may reduce rejection rates.
  
- **Automate Repetitive Steps:** Implementing automation for common resubmission scenarios could lower performance metrics associated with manual processing.
  
- **Monitor and Address High-Cost Variants:** Focusing on variants with exceptionally high performance metrics to identify and mitigate underlying issues.

### **5. Conclusion**

The process data reveals a multifaceted declaration handling workflow with multiple approval stages and potential for rejections and resubmissions. While the standard approval pathways dominate in frequency, the presence of numerous rejection loops highlights areas for potential process optimization to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve overall workflow effectiveness.
