Let's break down the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process and represent it using POWL models.

First, we need to import the necessary components from `pm4py`.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator
```

Now, let's define the common activities that appear in both models.

```python
# Common Activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
```

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model will represent the XOR branching for the cultural fit and community affiliation check, where the community affiliation path provides a subtle advantage.

**Description of the structure:**

*   The process starts with `ReceiveApplication`.
*   After receiving the application, there's a `DataCompletenessCheck`. This check might involve a loop if information is missing.
*   Following the completeness check, `SkillAssessment` takes place.
*   After the skill assessment, there's an XOR split.
    *   One branch performs a standard `CulturalFitCheck`.
    *   The other branch involves a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` which implicitly provides a score uplift.
*   The results of both branches of the XOR eventually converge.
*   `ManagerialReview` is performed, particularly for borderline candidates. This is where the bias from the `CommunityAffiliationCheck` might be amplified.
*   Finally, `FinalDecision` is made.

```python
# Activities specific to the unfair model
cultural_fit_check_standard = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check_biased = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck") # This activity implicitly introduces bias

# Constructing the loop for data completeness
# The loop: RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck
# This implies a pattern: (RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck) is the loop body,
# and it repeats until DataCompletenessCheck is successful.
# For simplicity in POWL, we can represent a data check that might require more info.
# If DataCompletenessCheck fails, it implies requesting more info and re-checking.
# A more explicit POWL for a loop would be:
# request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
# loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info, data_completeness_check])
# However, based on the description "missing information triggers a loop process",
# we can simplify it to a single activity that represents the *outcome* of the check,
# assuming the loop mechanism is internal to how the system handles data.
# If we want to strictly model the loop, we'd need to represent the "RequestMoreInfo"
# and the condition for repeating.
# Let's represent the DataCompletenessCheck as a point that might trigger retries.
# For POWL, a loop operator is needed. We'll assume DataCompletenessCheck is the point
# where the loop condition is evaluated.

# Let's represent the loop as:
# Start --> RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck --> (LOOP back to RequestMoreInfo if incomplete) OR (Proceed if complete)

# A simplified representation for the loop where a check might require more info and then be rechecked.
# Let's assume DataCompletenessCheck is the activity that, if it "fails" (data incomplete),
# leads back to requesting more info.

# A common way to model a loop that checks a condition and might re-execute a part:
# PO=(nodes={A, B}, order={A-->B}) represents A followed by B.
# If B can cause A to re-execute, we need a LOOP operator.
# PO=(nodes={LOOP(A, B)}, order={}) where LOOP(A, B) represents A, then B, then potentially A again.

# In our case:
# Initial Check -> Request More Info -> Re-check
# This can be modeled as:
# DataCompletenessCheck (initial state) --> RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck (again)
# The prompt says "missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding."
# Let's represent this as:
# DataCompletenessCheck --> RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck (successful completion)

# A simpler interpretation of a "loop process" in POWL might be a single activity that implicitly handles retries.
# However, to explicitly show the loop as described:
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
# The loop structure implies: DataCompletenessCheck is the initial state/check.
# If data is incomplete, then RequestMoreInfo happens, and then DataCompletenessCheck is performed again.
# This is a loop over the DataCompletenessCheck itself, conditional on needing more info.

# Let's re-interpret: DataCompletenessCheck is the point of evaluation.
# If incomplete, then RequestMoreInfo happens, and then the process continues from DataCompletenessCheck's logic.
# A more direct POWL representation of the described loop could be:
# initial_check -> (LOOP over data_completeness_check and request_more_info)
# Let's assume DataCompletenessCheck *is* the activity that, if data is missing, triggers RequestMoreInfo and then repeats the check logic.
# A common POWL pattern for a loop where a condition is checked:
# (Activity A, LOOP(Activity B, Activity C)) where Activity B is the loop body and Activity C is the condition check.
# Or more simply, if 'Activity' performs a check and might loop back to itself after 'RetryActivity':
# LOOP(RetryActivity, Activity)
# Here, the "loop process" is about ensuring data completeness.
# Let's assume the DataCompletenessCheck is the entry point to this, and if it fails,
# it effectively means: proceed to RequestMoreInfo, and then the system internally
# re-evaluates DataCompletenessCheck.

# Let's model the loop more explicitly:
# DataCompletenessCheck acts as the *initial* check. If it "fails" (data incomplete),
# the flow goes to RequestMoreInfo, and then back to the *state* of DataCompletenessCheck.
# This is tricky without explicit conditional operators beyond XOR/LOOP.
# A common POWL representation for this is:
# Loop (RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck)
# This implies: Do RequestMoreInfo, then do DataCompletenessCheck. If DataCompletenessCheck implies needing more info, then loop back to RequestMoreInfo.
# However, the prompt implies DataCompletenessCheck *itself* might be looped.
# "missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding."
# Let's model it as:
# DataCompletenessCheck (initial) --> RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck (repeated)
# This would be LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck_Successful) -- but DataCompletenessCheck_Successful is not an explicit activity.

# Simpler approach: Assume DataCompletenessCheck is an activity that handles the loop internally.
# Or, if we must use the loop operator:
# Loop(Activity A, Activity B) means A, then B, then B can loop back to A.
# So, for data completeness:
# RequestMoreInfo --> DataCompletenessCheck --> ... (loops back if incomplete)
# This means DataCompletenessCheck is the point that might cause the loop.
# Let's assume:
# ReceiveApplication --> LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck) --> SkillAssessment
# This means: RequestMoreInfo, then DataCompletenessCheck. If DataCompletenessCheck indicates more info is needed, loop back to RequestMoreInfo.

# Let's model the loop as:
# A loop where the DataCompletenessCheck is the condition/activity that might cause a retry.
# The prompt implies a structure where:
# If data incomplete: RequestMoreInfo -> then re-check data completeness.
# This is best modeled as: LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck)
# This means: Execute RequestMoreInfo. Then execute DataCompletenessCheck. If DataCompletenessCheck requires another iteration, loop back to RequestMoreInfo.

# For clarity, let's assume:
# DataCompletenessCheck is the activity that *initiates* the potential loop.
# If it returns "incomplete", then RequestMoreInfo is executed, and then the process *resumes* with DataCompletenessCheck logic.
# This structure is best represented by:
# PO=(nodes={LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck)}, order={})
# This LOOP operator means: Execute RequestMoreInfo, then DataCompletenessCheck. If DataCompletenessCheck requires another iteration, loop back to RequestMoreInfo.

# Let's refine the loop:
request_more_info_activity = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info_activity, data_completeness_check])

# The sequence: ReceiveApplication --> loop_data_completeness --> SkillAssessment
seq_receive_skill = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop_data_completeness, skill_assessment])
seq_receive_skill.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop_data_completeness)
seq_receive_skill.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, skill_assessment)

# The XOR split after SkillAssessment
xor_branching = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check_standard, community_affiliation_check_biased])

# Connecting SkillAssessment to the XOR
# This means SkillAssessment must complete before the XOR can be evaluated.
# We need to group the skill assessment and the XOR.
node_skill_xor = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[skill_assessment, xor_branching])
node_skill_xor.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_branching)

# Now we need to join the XOR branches. Both branches lead to ManagerialReview.
# For this, we need to define the sub-trees for the XOR.
# Branch 1: Standard Cultural Fit
branch_standard = cultural_fit_check_standard

# Branch 2: Biased Community Affiliation Check
branch_biased = community_affiliation_check_biased

# The XOR operator itself represents the choice.
# The results of both branches conceptually lead to ManagerialReview.
# This is modeled by having ManagerialReview dependent on the completion of the XOR.
# We can use a silent transition to represent the convergence point if needed,
# or simply make ManagerialReview dependent on the XOR completion.

# The ManagerialReview is performed on "borderline candidates". This implies it's not a strict sequential step for *everyone*.
# However, the POWL structure needs to represent the *flow*.
# Let's assume that after the XOR, the output of the chosen branch is used for ManagerialReview.
# If we need to explicitly show the joining of the XOR paths:
# A silent transition is often used to mark the end of concurrent/parallel branches before joining.
# Here, it's an XOR, so only one path is taken.

# The output of the XOR feeds into ManagerialReview.
# Let's define the full tree structure:
# Start --> ReceiveApplication --> LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck) --> SkillAssessment --> XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

# Let's represent the overall flow as a StrictPartialOrder.
# The children are: ReceiveApplication and the combined structure of the rest.
# This is getting complex. Let's build from the bottom up.

# Activities:
# receive_application
# request_more_info_activity
# data_completeness_check
# skill_assessment
# cultural_fit_check_standard
# community_affiliation_check_biased
# managerial_review
# final_decision

# Loop for data completeness:
loop_dc = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info_activity, data_completeness_check])

# Sequence: Receive -> Loop -> Skill
seq1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive_application, loop_dc, skill_assessment])
seq1.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop_dc)
seq1.order.add_edge(loop_dc, skill_assessment)

# XOR split: Skill -> XOR(Standard, Biased)
xor_split = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check_standard, community_affiliation_check_biased])
node_skill_xor_combined = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[skill_assessment, xor_split])
node_skill_xor_combined.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_split)

# Joining the XOR: The result of the XOR feeds into ManagerialReview.
# We can think of the XOR as producing an intermediate result.
# The next sequential steps are ManagerialReview then FinalDecision.
# So, the output of the XOR is implicitly fed to ManagerialReview.
# This means ManagerialReview depends on the XOR completing.

# Let's combine the parts:
# We have the sequence up to SkillAssessment.
# Then we have the XOR which branches out from SkillAssessment's completion.
# Then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision follow.

# Structure:
# ReceiveApplication --> LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck) --> SkillAssessment --> XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

# Let's re-organize the nodes and edges.
nodes_unfair = [
    receive_application,
    request_more_info_activity,
    data_completeness_check,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check_standard,
    community_affiliation_check_biased,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]

# Create the LOOP operator
loop_dc_unfair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info_activity, data_completeness_check])

# Create the XOR operator
xor_unfair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit_check_standard, community_affiliation_check_biased])

# Create the overall POWL structure using StrictPartialOrder
# We need to define the dependencies.
# The root will contain all the main components.

# Let's think of the main flow components:
# 1. Receive Application
# 2. Data Completeness Loop
# 3. Skill Assessment
# 4. XOR (Cultural Fit vs Community Affiliation)
# 5. Managerial Review
# 6. Final Decision

# We can represent the dependencies as:
# ReceiveApplication --> DataCompletenessLoop
# DataCompletenessLoop --> SkillAssessment
# SkillAssessment --> XOR
# XOR --> ManagerialReview
# ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

# Let's define a container for the loop structure
container_loop_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_dc_unfair]) # Contains only the loop operator

# Now, connect the main sequential steps:
# 1. Receive Application
# 2. Container for Loop
# 3. Skill Assessment
# 4. XOR operator
# 5. Managerial Review
# 6. Final Decision

# Let's build the main sequence of operations.
# The loop itself is an operator.
# So we have: ReceiveApplication -> loop_dc_unfair -> SkillAssessment -> xor_unfair -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision

# This implies a linear sequence where the loop and XOR are treated as single points in the sequence.
# But POWL allows us to model the internal structure.

# Let's create a POWL model for the whole unfair process.
# The top-level structure will define the order of these components.

# Component 1: ReceiveApplication
# Component 2: The loop structure (loop_dc_unfair)
# Component 3: SkillAssessment
# Component 4: The XOR structure (xor_unfair)
# Component 5: ManagerialReview
# Component 6: FinalDecision

# Let's consider the order:
# ReceiveApplication must happen before the loop starts.
# The loop must complete before SkillAssessment.
# SkillAssessment must complete before the XOR branching can occur.
# The XOR result (after one branch is taken) must be considered for ManagerialReview.
# ManagerialReview must happen before FinalDecision.

# So, we need nodes for:
# receive_application
# loop_dc_unfair (this is an OperatorPOWL)
# skill_assessment
# xor_unfair (this is an OperatorPOWL)
# managerial_review
# final_decision

root_nodes_unfair = [
    receive_application,
    loop_dc_unfair,
    skill_assessment,
    xor_unfair,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]

root_powl_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes_unfair)

# Add the ordering edges
root_powl_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop_dc_unfair)
root_powl_unfair.order.add_edge(loop_dc_unfair, skill_assessment)
root_powl_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, xor_unfair)
root_powl_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_unfair, managerial_review)
root_powl_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# Importantly, the XOR operator needs its children defined correctly.
# The children of xor_unfair are cultural_fit_check_standard and community_affiliation_check_biased.
# The order doesn't matter for children of XOR, as it's a choice.

# The loop operator also has its children: request_more_info_activity and data_completeness_check.
# The order for LOOP is generally [Body, Condition] or [First Step, Next Step].
# Here, it's [RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck] where DataCompletenessCheck can trigger looping back to RequestMoreInfo.

# The unfairness is represented by the existence of community_affiliation_check_biased as a distinct branch in the XOR.
# This branch is where the "subtle advantage" is given, potentially leading to preferential treatment.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model will remove the XOR branching for cultural fit and affiliation. Instead, all applicants will undergo a standardized cultural fit evaluation.

**Description of the structure:**

*   The process starts with `ReceiveApplication`.
*   After receiving the application, there's a `DataCompletenessCheck` (potentially with a loop for missing information).
*   Following the completeness check, `SkillAssessment` takes place.
*   **Crucially, instead of an XOR split, all applicants proceed to a single, standardized `CulturalFitCheck`.** This check is the same for everyone, and there's no separate "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that offers an advantage.
*   `ManagerialReview` is performed (as before, potentially on borderline candidates, but the input to this stage is now standardized).
*   Finally, `FinalDecision` is made.

```python
# Activities common to both models (already defined above)
# receive_application
# data_completeness_check
# skill_assessment
# managerial_review
# final_decision

# Activity for the fair cultural fit check
cultural_fit_check_standard_fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

# Constructing the loop for data completeness (same as before)
request_more_info_activity_fair = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
loop_data_completeness_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info_activity_fair, data_completeness_check])

# The sequence of operations without unfairness:
# ReceiveApplication --> LOOP(RequestMoreInfo, DataCompletenessCheck) --> SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision

# We need nodes for:
# receive_application
# loop_data_completeness_fair (OperatorPOWL)
# skill_assessment
# cultural_fit_check_standard_fair (Transition)
# managerial_review
# final_decision

root_nodes_fair = [
    receive_application,
    loop_data_completeness_fair,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check_standard_fair,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
]

root_powl_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes_fair)

# Add the ordering edges for the linear, fair process:
root_powl_fair.order.add_edge(receive_application, loop_data_completeness_fair)
root_powl_fair.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness_fair, skill_assessment)
root_powl_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check_standard_fair)
root_powl_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check_standard_fair, managerial_review)
root_powl_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)

# The loop operator has its children defined:
# loop_data_completeness_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[request_more_info_activity_fair, data_completeness_check])
# This structure is the same as in the unfair model, as the loop for data is not the source of bias.

print("POWL Model Without Unfairness Created.")
# You can visualize or inspect root_powl_fair here.
```

**Summary of Differences:**

1.  **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:** Features an `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR` after `SkillAssessment`. This XOR has two children: `CulturalFitCheck` (standard) and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` (biased). This explicitly models the bifurcation where one path can offer an advantage.
2.  **POWL Model Without Unfairness:** Removes the `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`. Instead, after `SkillAssessment`, there is a single, direct `Transition` labeled `CulturalFitCheck` that all applicants must pass. This eliminates the biased branch, ensuring a more uniform evaluation of cultural fit.

Both models correctly represent the sequential nature of initial steps, the loop for data completeness, and the final stages of managerial review and decision. The key distinction lies solely in the handling of the cultural fit and affiliation evaluation.
