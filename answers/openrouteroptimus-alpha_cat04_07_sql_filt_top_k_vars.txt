Certainly! Below is a single DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes all 4 steps described.

**Assume you want the top K variants (let’s call it `K`, e.g., 3).**  
Replace `3` with any number you wish.

```sql
WITH ordered_activities AS (
    -- Step 1: For each case_id, generate the ordered sequence of activities as a comma-separated string
    SELECT
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Group by activity sequence to define variants and count cases
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM
        ordered_activities
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Select top K variants by case count
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        case_count DESC
    LIMIT 3  -- <-- Set K here
),
cases_in_top_k AS (
    -- Find case_ids that belong to the top K variants
    SELECT
        o.case_id
    FROM
        ordered_activities o
        JOIN top_k_variants v ON o.activity_sequence = v.activity_sequence
)
-- Step 4: Return all events for cases in top K variants
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
    JOIN cases_in_top_k c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
;
```

**How this works:**

- For each `case_id`, produces a _canonical ordered_ sequence of activities (as a string) by timestamp.
- Finds all unique variants and counts them.
- Grabs the top K activity sequences (variants) by the number of cases.
- Selects all original events whose `case_id` is part of those top K variants.

**You can adjust** the `LIMIT 3` in the `top_k_variants` CTE to set any desired value of K.
