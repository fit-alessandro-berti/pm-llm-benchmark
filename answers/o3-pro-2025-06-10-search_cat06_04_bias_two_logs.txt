Summary  
The logs reveal a systematic, built-in preference for applicants who are both “LocalResident = TRUE” and members of a named “CommunityGroup.”  That preference is expressed through the ScoreAdjustment column, which is applied only to cases in Group B.  Because Group A applicants never qualify for the adjustment, they are held to a higher effective approval threshold than similarly situated Group B applicants.  The result is a classic case of disparate (unequal) treatment that can easily evolve into disparate impact on the protected class.

Step-by-step comparison

1. Baseline scoring and apparent cut-off  
• For applicants who receive no adjustment (P001, P002, P003, U002), the data suggest that a final score of 720 or higher is needed for approval.  
  – P001 (720)  Approved  
  – P002 (710)  Rejected  
  – P003 (740)  Approved  
  – U002 (710)  Rejected  

2. How the ScoreAdjustment changes outcomes in Group B  
• U001: Preliminary 720 +10 = 730  Approved (same outcome as P001 but with a higher displayed score).  
• U003: Preliminary 695 +10 = 705  Approved even though 705 is below the apparent 720 cut-off applied to everyone else.  
  – An equivalent Protected-group applicant with 705 would have been rejected, yet U003 is approved solely because of the boost tied to LocalResident = TRUE and CommunityGroup membership.

3. Attributes that trigger (or block) the boost  
• All Group B cases are marked LocalResident = TRUE.  
• Two of them (U001, U003) list a specific CommunityGroup (“Highland Civic Darts Club”) and receive the +10 “Community Boost.”  
• No Group A case is a local resident or linked to a community group, so none can receive the adjustment.

4. Consequences for the protected group  
• Group A has an identical overall approval rate (2 / 3) only because their raw scores are higher on average (mean  723) than Group B’s (mean  708).  
• Had Group A included any borderline applicants (e.g., preliminary scores in the 690–715 range), they would have been rejected, whereas equivalent Group B applicants could be pushed over the line by the +10 boost.  
• Over time, that rule will systematically deny credit (or whatever benefit the process confers) to non-local, non-club applicants—i.e., the protected class—at a higher rate even when they have equal or better preliminary scores.

Why it is biased  
• The decision logic does not merely consider credit-worthiness (the PreliminaryScore) but also a factor (CommunityGroup) that is available only to local residents.  
• Because LocalResident correlates strongly with group membership, and the protected class contains no local residents, the “Community Boost” advantages only the unprotected class.  
• This is a form of direct differential treatment: two applicants with identical preliminary risk profiles receive different outcomes purely because one belongs to a favored local group.

Risk of downstream disparate impact  
• If the scoring model or underwriters interpret the adjusted score as the actual risk figure, historical data will show fewer defaults among approved local-club members (because lower-quality local cases were never rejected).  
• That distorted feedback loop can further entrench the bias when the model is retrained, creating a self-reinforcing disadvantage for the protected group.

Key takeaway  
The bias resides in the policy that adds +10 points only when LocalResident = TRUE and a specific CommunityGroup is present.  Removing or justifying that adjustment (e.g., showing that it is a valid, nondiscriminatory predictor of risk) is critical; otherwise, the system violates fairness principles by systematically favoring one group at the expense of another.
