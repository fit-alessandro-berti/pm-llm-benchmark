Based on the provided directly follows graph, the process appears to be related to a logistics or supply chain management context. Here's a description of the process:

1. A customer order is registered, leading to the creation of a transport document.
2. The transport document triggers the booking of vehicles and the ordering of empty containers.
3. The empty containers are then picked up and loaded onto a truck.
4. The truck drives to the terminal to collect goods, which are then loaded onto the truck.
5. The truck drives back to the terminal, where the containers are weighed and stored.
6. The containers are then brought to the loading bay, where they are loaded onto a vehicle.
7. The vehicle departs with the loaded containers.
8. In some cases, there are rescheduling events for containers and vehicles, indicating potential delays or changes in the plan.
9. Forklifts are used to move containers between the weighing station, storage, and loading bay.
10. The process repeats for multiple customer orders, trucks, containers, vehicles, and forklifts.
