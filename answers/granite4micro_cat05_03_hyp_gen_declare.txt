### Anomalies Identified

1. **Anomaly 1:**  
   - **Rule Conflict:** The rule `precedence: C: {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0, "activities": ["R"]}` suggests that a claim can be closed (`C`) without it having been received first (`R`). This contradicts the intended process where claims must first be received before they can be closed.

2. **Anomaly 2:**  
   - **Rule Conflict:** The rule `noncoexistence: E: {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0, "activities": ["C"]}` implies that evaluation (`E`) cannot occur simultaneously with closing (`C`). However, the intended process allows for both evaluation and closure after assignment, which is not explicitly enforced by this rule.

3. **Anomaly 3:**  
   - **Rule Conflict:** The `responded_existence` constraint specifies `activities: ["A"]`, suggesting that an adjuster can be assigned only once (existence) without any other activities preceding it. This might be problematic if the intention is to allow for assignment after receiving a claim and evaluating it.

### Hypotheses

1. **Misinterpretation of Business Requirements:**  
   - The DECLARE model may have been constructed based on an outdated understanding or documentation of the insurance claim process, leading to rules that do not align with current business practices.

2. **Incremental Changes Without Consistency:**  
   - Over time, different teams or stakeholders might have implemented changes in their respective workflows without fully updating the DECLARE constraints, resulting in a mix of old and new processes being allowed simultaneously.

3. **Technical Issues or Incomplete Data:**  
   - There could be technical limitations or incomplete data capturing capabilities that inadvertently allow for steps to be bypassed or incorrectly recorded, leading to anomalies in the DECLARE model.

4. **Pressure to Handle Claims Quickly:**  
   - The need to expedite claim processing might have led to shortcuts being documented as allowed transitions in the DECLARE model, which do not reflect a complete execution of all necessary processes.

### Verification Approaches

1. **Claims Closed Without Evaluation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1
         FROM claim_events ce2
         WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'R')
     );
   ```
   - This query checks for any claims that were closed without preceding evaluation or receipt activities.

2. **Claims with Evaluation and Closing Coexistence:**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('E', 'C')
     AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1
         FROM claim_events ce3
         WHERE ce3.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
           AND (ce3.activity = 'R' OR ce3.activity = 'A')
     );
   ```
   - This query identifies any events where evaluation and closure occur without the intervening receipt or assignment activities.

3. **Evaluate Steps Without Assigned Adjuster:**
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount
   FROM claims c
   JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
   WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
     AND NOT EXISTS (
         SELECT 1
         FROM claim_events ce2
         WHERE ce2.claim_id = c.claim_id
           AND ce2.activity = 'A'
     );
   ```
   - This query checks for any evaluation activities that do not have a preceding assignment of an adjuster, indicating potential misalignment with the intended process.

These SQL queries will help verify whether the anomalies observed in the DECLARE model manifest in the actual data stored across the `claims`, `adjusters`, and `claim_events` tables.
