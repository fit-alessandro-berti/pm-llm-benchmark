To group the events into distinct **patient cases**, we need to identify which events belong together in a single patient journey. Since there is no explicit case ID, we rely on **temporal order**, **patient-specific attributes** (age, gender), **departmental coherence**, and **logical flow of care**.

---

### Step 1: Identify key patient identifiers
Each patient is uniquely defined by:
- `patient_age`
- `patient_gender`
- `department` (where the activity occurs)
- `activity` (what happens)

We will group events that:
1. Share the same patient (same age, gender, and consistent department and activity sequence).
2. Follow a logical, sequential path (e.g., register  triage  consult  test  surgery  discharge).
3. Occur in a temporally coherent order.

---

### Step 2: Look for patient journeys

Let’s go through the events and group them based on patient identity.

---

#### Patient 1: Age 45, Male, ER  Surgery (linked via triage and fracture diagnosis)

- Event 1: Register patient (ER, M, 45, private)
- Event 4: Initial triage (ER, M, 45, triage_code=3)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER, M, 45, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (ER, M, 45, followup=outpatient_clinic)

 All these events are in **ER**, same age/gender, and follow a logical path:
- Register  Triage  Consult  Discharge

Note: There is a later surgery-related event (event 13) for age 28, so this one is not involved in surgery.

 **Case 1**: Patient 45M in ER

---

#### Patient 2: Age 62, Female, ER  Lab  Consult  Discharge

- Event 2: Register patient (ER, F, 62, public)
- Event 5: Lab test requested (ER, F, 62, blood_panel)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (ER, F, 62, results=normal_levels)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation (ER, F, 62, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- Event 14: Prescription created (ER, F, 62, antibiotics)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (ER, F, 62, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

All events are in ER, same patient attributes, and follow a clean path:
- Register  Lab  Consult  Prescription  Discharge

 **Case 2**: Patient 62F in ER

---

#### Patient 3: Age 28, Male, Surgery  Surgery preparation  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

- Event 3: Register patient (Surgery, M, 28, private)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation (Surgery, M, 28, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (Surgery, M, 28, general_anesthesia)
- Event 13: Surgery performed (Surgery, M, 28, procedure=arthroscopy)
- Event 16: Recovery room (Surgery, M, 28, condition=stable)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (Surgery, M, 28, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

This is a full surgical case:
- Register  Consult  Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge

All events match age, gender, and department (Surgery), and follow a logical surgical pathway.

 **Case 3**: Patient 28M in Surgery

---

### Step 3: Verify no overlaps or mismatches

Check for duplicated patient attributes across events:

| Age | Gender | Department | Events |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
| 45 | M | ER | 1, 4, 12, 15 |
| 62 | F | ER | 2, 5, 10, 11, 14, 17 |
| 28 | M | Surgery | 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 |

No overlaps in patient identity (age + gender), and each case has a unique sequence of events.

Also, note:
- Events 5 and 10 are in ER, 62F  part of Case 2
- Events 6 and 9 are in Surgery, 28M  part of Case 3
- Events 13 and 16 are in Surgery  part of Case 3

All events are accounted for.

---

### Final Case Grouping

We infer **3 distinct patient cases**.

---

###  Grouped Cases:

---

**Case 1: Patient (45M, ER)**
- Register patient (ER)  Initial triage  Doctor consultation (diagnosis=hairline_fracture)  Discharged (followup=outpatient_clinic)

Events:
- 1. Register patient (ER, 45M)
- 4. Initial triage (ER, 45M)
- 12. Doctor consultation (ER, 45M, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
- 15. Patient discharged (ER, 45M)

---

**Case 2: Patient (62F, ER)**
- Register patient (ER)  Lab test requested  Lab test completed  Doctor consultation (diagnosis=minor_infection)  Prescription created  Discharged (followup=pharmacy_pickup)

Events:
- 2. Register patient (ER, 62F)
- 5. Lab test requested (ER, 62F)
- 10. Lab test completed (ER, 62F)
- 11. Doctor consultation (ER, 62F, diagnosis=minor_infection)
- 14. Prescription created (ER, 62F)
- 17. Patient discharged (ER, 62F)

---

**Case 3: Patient (28M, Surgery)**
- Register patient (Surgery)  Doctor consultation (scheduled knee surgery)  Surgery preparation  Surgery performed  Recovery  Discharged (followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

Events:
- 3. Register patient (Surgery, 28M)
- 6. Doctor consultation (Surgery, 28M, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
- 9. Surgery preparation (Surgery, 28M)
- 13. Surgery performed (Surgery, 28M)
- 16. Recovery room (Surgery, 28M)
- 18. Patient discharged (Surgery, 28M)

---

###  Summary: Case Inference

| Case ID | Patient Age | Patient Gender | Department | Key Events |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 45 | M | ER | Register, Triage, Consult (fracture), Discharge |
| 2 | 62 | F | ER | Register, Lab test, Consult (infection), Prescription, Discharge |
| 3 | 28 | M | Surgery | Register, Consult (surgery), Prep, Surgery, Recovery, Discharge |

---

### Final Answer:

**The events can be grouped into 3 distinct patient cases as follows:**

- **Case 1**: Patient aged 45, male, ER  
  Events: 1, 4, 12, 15  

- **Case 2**: Patient aged 62, female, ER  
  Events: 2, 5, 10, 11, 14, 17  

- **Case 3**: Patient aged 28, male, Surgery  
  Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18  

These groupings are inferred from consistent patient attributes (age, gender), sequential logical flow of care, and departmental context. Each case represents a distinct patient journey.
