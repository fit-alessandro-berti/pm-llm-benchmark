### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact  
**Identification Strategy:**  
Using process mining techniques on the event log, I would:  
- **Process Discovery:** Apply algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner) to reconstruct the process model, highlighting deviations caused by constraints.  
- **Conformance Checking:** Compare the actual log against an ideal model (e.g., BPMN) to detect "waiting loops" or resource conflicts.  
- **Social Network Analysis:** Map resource interactions (e.g., Cold-Packing stations) to identify contention patterns.  
- **Case-Attribute Filtering:** Segment data by attributes (e.g., `Requires Cold Packing = TRUE`) to isolate constraint-driven delays.  

**Quantifying Impact:**  
| Constraint                | Key Metrics                                                                 | Process Mining Techniques                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Shared Cold-Packing**   | - Avg. queue length for Cold-Packing stations<br>- Avg. waiting time from "Item Picking" to "Packing" for cold orders<br>- Station utilization (%) | Filter events for `Requires Cold Packing = TRUE`; calculate time gaps between activities. |  
| **Shipping Batching**     | - Avg. waiting time from "Quality Check" to "Shipping Label Gen."<br>- Batch size distribution<br>- % of orders delayed by batching | Group by `Destination Region`; compute delays where "Shipping Label Gen." is batched.      |  
| **Priority Handling**     | - Preemption frequency (Express orders pausing Standard orders)<br>- Avg. delay to Standard orders caused by Express orders | Join Express/Standard order events by resource; measure time gaps at shared resources.      |  
| **Hazardous Material**    | - Max simultaneous hazardous orders in Packing/QC<br>- Avg. waiting time for hazardous orders<br>- Throughput reduction (%) | Flag `Hazardous Material = TRUE`; count concurrent instances in "Packing"/"Quality Check." |  

**Differentiating Waiting Time:**  
- **Within-instance:** Activity duration (e.g., `COMPLETE - START` for "Packing"). Measured via **cycle time decomposition**.  
- **Between-instance:** Waiting due to resource contention (e.g., queue at Cold-Packing) or batching. Isolated by **time lag analysis** between activity completions and subsequent starts across cases.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions  
**Key Interactions:**  
1. **Priority Handling + Cold-Packing:**  
   - Express orders needing cold-packing may preempt standard orders at stations, increasing queue contention. This could force standard orders to wait longer, potentially violating batch deadlines.  
2. **Shipping Batching + Hazardous Limits:**  
   - Hazardous orders bound for the same region batch together, but regulatory limits cap concurrent hazardous orders in Packing/QC. This may cause batch delays if hazardous orders are throttled.  
3. **Priority Handling + Batching:**  
   - Express orders might bypass batching, fragmenting batches and reducing delivery efficiency. Conversely, prioritized batches could leave standard orders stranded.  
4. **Hazardous Limits + Shared Resources:**  
   - Hazardous orders using standard stations still count toward the 10-unit limit, risking systemic slowdowns if standard stations are saturated.  

**Why Interactions Matter:**  
- **Trade-offs:** Optimizing one constraint (e.g., prioritizing express orders) may worsen others (e.g., batching delays).  
- **Systemic Bottlenecks:** A single constraint (e.g., Cold-Packing contention) can cascade, amplifying delays in downstream steps (e.g., batching failures).  
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Process mining reveals these interactions through **attribute-aware performance analysis** (e.g., median cycle time for Express orders with cold-packing).

### 3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies  
**Strategy 1: Dynamic Cold-Packing Station Allocation**  
- **Target Constraints:** Cold-Packing contention + Priority handling.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Implement a **priority-aware reservation system** for Cold-Packing stations. Express orders get immediate access; standard orders are queued dynamically.  
  - Use ML models (trained on historical data) to predict demand surges and preemptively allocate stations.  
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:**  
  - Forecast cold-packing demand using time-series analysis of `Requires Cold Packing` orders.  
  - Optimize queue policies via **what-if simulation** (e.g., FIFO vs. priority-based).  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Reduce avg. waiting time for Cold-Packing by 30–50% (simulations show 40% reduction).  
  - Minimize preemption delays for standard orders.  

**Strategy 2: Adaptive Batching with Priority Overrides**  
- **Target Constraints:** Shipping batching + Priority handling.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Replace fixed batching with **time-size hybrid batching**:  
    - Standard orders: Batch when either max waiting time (e.g., 45 mins) or max batch size (e.g., 15 orders) is reached.  
    - Express orders: Bypass batching or form micro-batches (1–2 orders) after a short timeout (e.g., 15 mins).  
  - Use clustering to group orders by region + priority for batch formation.  
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:**  
  - Optimize batch thresholds via **k-means clustering** of `Destination Region` and `Order Type`.  
  - Apply reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust batch sizes based on workload.  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Reduce avg. batching-related waiting time by 25–40%.  
  - Express orders ship 20% faster without crippling batch efficiency.  

**Strategy 3: Hazardous Order Scheduling with Load Balancing**  
- **Target Constraints:** Hazardous material limits + Resource interactions.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Introduce a **token-based system**: Hazardous orders require a "processing token" (max 10 active). Tokens are released upon activity completion.  
  - **Prioritize token allocation** to Express orders and stagger hazardous order processing across shifts.  
  - Dedicate 1–2 standard stations to hazardous orders when the token limit is reached.  
- **Data/Analysis Leverage:**  
  - Predict hazardous order influx using **time-series forecasting** (e.g., Prophet).  
  - Optimize token allocation rules via **simulation** (e.g., prioritize by order type).  
- **Outcomes:**  
  - Eliminate hazardous limit violations.  
  - Improve throughput of hazardous orders by 15–25%.

### 4. Simulation and Validation  
**Simulation Framework:**  
- **Tool:** AnyLogic or Simio (supports discrete-event simulation with resource constraints).  
- **Model Inputs:**  
  - Process model discovered via process mining (e.g., Petri net).  
  - Resource capacities (5 Cold-Packing stations, 10 hazardous tokens).  
  - Arrival rates/order attributes from event log data.  

**Key Aspects to Capture:**  
1. **Resource Contention:** Model queues for Cold-Packing stations with priority logic.  
2. **Batching Dynamics:** Implement hybrid batching with timeouts/sizes.  
3. **Priority Handling:** Allow Express orders to preempt standard orders.  
4. **Regulatory Limits:** Enforce token-based system for hazardous orders.  

**Validation Approach:**  
- **Baseline Metrics:** Compare simulated vs. actual KPIs (e.g., avg. cycle time, throughput).  
- **Strategy Testing:** Run simulations for each strategy and combinations:  
  - **KPIs:** Avg. cycle time, throughput, constraint violation rate.  
  - **Sensitivity Analysis:** Test under peak loads (e.g., +30% order volume).  
- **Outcome Metrics:**  
  - Target 20% reduction in avg. cycle time.  
  - Maintain 100% compliance with hazardous limits.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation  
**Key Metrics & Dashboards:**  
1. **Constraint-Specific Tracking:**  
   - **Cold-Packing:** Queue length (real-time), avg. waiting time (20 mins target).  
   - **Batching:** Avg. batch size (12–15 orders), % orders waiting >30 mins.  
   - **Priority Handling:** Preemption rate (<15% target), cycle time delta (Express vs. Standard).  
   - **Hazardous Limits:** Active hazardous orders (10), avg. token wait time.  
2. **Overall Health:**  
   - End-to-end cycle time, throughput (orders/hour), resource utilization.  

**Dashboards:**  
- **Real-Time Operations:** Live queue lengths for Cold-Packing stations and hazardous order counts.  
- **Historical Trends:** Time-series charts of avg. waiting times and batch sizes.  
- **Alerts:** Triggers for queue thresholds (e.g., >10 orders waiting for Cold-Packing) or hazardous limit violations.  

**Effectiveness Tracking:**  
- **Cold-Packing:** Reduced queue length and waiting time indicate success.  
- **Batching:** Efficient batch formation (size 12–15) confirms optimized logic.  
- **Priority Handling:** Express orders cycle time <60 mins with minimal standard order delays.  
- **Hazardous Compliance:** Zero violations + improved throughput validate token system.  

**Continuous Improvement:**  
- Re-run process mining monthly to detect new bottlenecks.  
- Use **conformance checking** to ensure adherence to new rules.
