This data describes a workflow for approving and handling financial declarations within an organization. The process involves several stages and different roles with the ability to approve, reject, or handle declarations at each stage.

1. Declaration Submission: An employee submits a financial declaration (DECLARATION SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE).
2. Pre-Approval (Optional): If enabled, a pre-approver reviews the declaration (DECLARATION APPROVED by PRE-APPROVER), and then it moves on to the next stage. If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision.
3. Administrative Approval: The declaration is reviewed and approved by administration (DECLARATION APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION). If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision.
4. Budget Owner Approval (Optional): If enabled, the declaration is reviewed and approved by the budget owner (DECLARATION APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER), and then it moves on to the next stage. If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision.
5. Supervisor Approval: The declaration is reviewed and approved by the supervisor (DECLARATION APPROVED by SUPERVISOR). If rejected, it goes back to the employee for revision.
6. Final Approval: After supervisor approval, the declaration is marked as FINAL_APPROVED by the supervisor.
7. Payment Request: A request for payment is generated based on the approved declaration (REQUEST PAYMENT).
8. Payment Handling: The payment is handled based on the request (PAYMENT HANDLED).

The data also includes various rejection scenarios where a declaration can be rejected at any stage and sent back to the employee for revision. The performance values in the data might represent the time or effort required to process each step, but without further context, it is impossible to determine the exact meaning of these values.
