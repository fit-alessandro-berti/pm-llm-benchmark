**Main differences between the treatment of the protected and unprotected groups, based on the provided process variants, can be summarized along several dimensions:**

1. **Process Complexity and Length:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     Many process variants involve multiple iterations of the same activity (notably "Make Visit to Assess Collateral") and sometimes repeated requests for co-signers. For example, sequences such as "Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral" appear frequently, sometimes nested multiple times before a final decision is reached.
     - There are several long and complex sequences that involve repetitive steps:  
       *"…Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral…"*
     - The repeated visits and requests indicate a more burdensome, time-consuming, and possibly more scrutinized evaluation process.

   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     While they also have variants that include "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" and "Request Co-Signer On Loan," these are less frequently repeated and often appear in more streamlined sequences. The complexity of repeated collateral visits or co-signer requests is generally lower. The process paths tend to be shorter and more direct.

2. **Frequency of Straightforward Denials or Approvals:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     The protected group’s variants often lead to "Loan Denied" outcomes after lengthy and complex paths. Although there are some approvals ("Sign Loan Agreement"), these appear less frequently and typically come after multiple additional steps.
     - A large portion of the protected group’s cases have extended due diligence activities before denial (or, less commonly, agreement signing).
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     The unprotected group has a substantial number of relatively more direct paths to either "Loan Denied" or "Sign Loan Agreement." They have simpler variants, like:
     - "Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied"
     - or similarly streamlined paths to approval. This indicates that the unprotected group’s outcomes—positive or negative—tend to be reached faster and with fewer repetitive, additional requirements.

3. **Inclusion of Special Shortcuts:**
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     There is a variant that mentions "skipped_examination" (e.g., "…Verify Borrowers Information -> skipped_examination -> Sign Loan Agreement"). This suggests the unprotected group can sometimes bypass or streamline certain checks, leading to faster approvals.
   - **Protected Group:**  
     No equivalent shortcut or bypass step is mentioned. The protected group’s process never includes a "skipped_examination" path.

4. **Performance (Throughput) Time Differences:**
   - Both groups show high-performance times for complex paths, but the protected group’s performance times are often extremely long, especially for variants with multiple repeated steps (e.g., around 350,000 - 390,000 units). While the unprotected group also reaches similar high-performance times in the most complex scenarios, there is a noticeable presence of shorter performance paths as well (like "Appointment Denied" in roughly 80,000 units for the unprotected group).
   - The protected group’s shortest variant with a negative outcome ("Appointment Denied") is around 90,000 units, while the unprotected group has a similar variant at about 80,000 units. Thus, even the simplest denial for the protected group takes longer than the simplest denial in the unprotected group.

5. **Nature of Additional Requirements:**
   - **Protected Group:**  
     More instances requiring co-signers and repeated collateral assessments suggest additional hurdles placed before reaching a decision, implying a more stringent screening process.
   
   - **Unprotected Group:**  
     Additional steps (co-signers, collateral visits) occur, but they do not seem to be as frequently repeated. The complexity is somewhat more balanced and not as consistently prolonged.

**In essence**, the protected group faces a more involved, longer, and more complicated process with frequent repetition of due diligence activities before reaching a loan decision. The unprotected group more often experiences more straightforward paths—some even skipping certain examination steps—and faster resolution, either by quick denial or more direct approval. This complexity and the lack of shortcuts for the protected group suggest that the protected group is subjected to more stringent, time-consuming scrutiny, highlighting an unfair difference in treatment.
