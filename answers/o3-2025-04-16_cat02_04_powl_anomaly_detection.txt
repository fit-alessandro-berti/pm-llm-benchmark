Below is a stepbystep reading of the POWL model followed by the anomalies that can be observed and the reasons why they would be considered harmful in a real OrdertoCash (O2C) environment.

----------------------------------------------------
1. What the code builds
----------------------------------------------------
• R  = Receive Order  
• C  = Check Credit  
• A  = Approve Order  
• I  = Issue Invoice  
• P  = Receive Payment  
• O  = Close Order  

Controlflow operators

1. xor_credit   =  XOR(C , )  
   – Either the credit check is executed (C) or a silent move 
     allows the process to continue without it.

2. loop_approve_invoice = LOOP(A , I)              (2child loop)  
   – Body  (1st child)  : A  
   – Redo (2nd child)  : I  
   – After executing the body once, the engine may
     • leave the loop, or
     • execute the redo branch (I) and return to A, and so on.

The partial order of the blocks is

R    xor_credit    loop_approve_invoice    P    O

----------------------------------------------------
2. Detected structural anomalies
----------------------------------------------------
A. Skippable credit check  
   • Because of xor_credit = XOR(C , ), the silent transition 
     lets the model bypass C completely.

B. “Elastic” approval / invoicing loop  
   • LOOP(A , I) allows any of the following:
     – A  (approve once) and immediately exit  
        Invoice can be totally skipped.  
     – A    I    exit  
        Normal sequence (once each).  
     – A    I    A    I    …  (any number of alternations)  
        Multiple approvals and/or multiple invoices.  
   • The first iteration always starts with A, so the first invoice,
     if any, is guaranteed to be preceded by an approval, but later
     iterations can create the pattern
       …  I  A …
     which means a second invoice could be issued *before*
     the order is (re)approved.

C. One payment for many invoices  
   • Regardless of how many invoices are produced in the loop,
     only a single Receive Payment (P) is required before closing
     the order.  The model never enforces a onetoone match
     between issued invoices and received payments.

D. Implicit exit from the loop  
   • With a 2child LOOP the exit is an internal silent move.
     This means analysts reading only the visible activities
     may not realise that “A” can directly fall through to
     “P” without any invoice.

----------------------------------------------------
3. Why these anomalies matter
----------------------------------------------------
1. Business risk  
   – Skipping the credit check can lead to deliveries to insolvent
     or fraudulent customers, directly affecting cashflow and
     baddebt exposure.

2. Financial compliance  
   – Invoices are fiscal documents; issuing more than one for the
     same approval or issuing one *without* approval violates most
     companies’ internalcontrol frameworks (SOX, ISO9001, etc.).
   – A missing invoice followed by a recorded payment breaks the
     audit trail between revenue recognition and cash receipt.

3. Process efficiency and data quality  
   – Reentering the approval / invoicing steps repeatedly is a
     strong symptom of rework, data errors, or system workarounds.
     It inflates throughput time and process cost.

4. Conformance monitoring  
   – When the reference model itself allows these shortcuts, an
     event log containing such cases will still be classified as
     conformant, masking problems that should be raised as
     deviations during conformance checking.

----------------------------------------------------
4. Summary of the “red flags”
----------------------------------------------------
• XOR(C , )   credit check can be skipped.  
• LOOP(A , I)   
  – invoice can be skipped,  
  – invoice can occur multiple times,  
  – multiple A/I alternations possible,  
  – no 1to1 link between invoice and payment.  

Each of these patterns breaks common O2C rules and should be
refined (e.g., make credit check mandatory, replace the loop by
a strict sequence A  I, or introduce a counter that pairs every
invoice with a payment) before using the model as a normative
reference for analysis or automation.
