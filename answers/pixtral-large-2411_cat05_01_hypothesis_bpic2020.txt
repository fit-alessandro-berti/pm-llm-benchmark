Sure, here are 20 relevant questions about the process, along with a confidence score for each question. The confidence score is a subjective measure of how well the question addresses a significant aspect of the process based on the provided data.

1. **What is the most frequent process variant?**
   - Confidence Score: 95%

2. **Which process variant has the highest performance metric?**
   - Confidence Score: 95%

3. **What is the average performance for process variants that include approval by the BUDGET OWNER?**
   - Confidence Score: 90%

4. **How many process variants involve a rejection by the ADMINISTRATION?**
   - Confidence Score: 90%

5. **What is the frequency of process variants that are rejected by the EMPLOYEE after being rejected by the ADMINISTRATION?**
   - Confidence Score: 85%

6. **What is the average performance for process variants that do not involve any rejections?**
   - Confidence Score: 85%

7. **How many process variants involve a final approval by the SUPERVISOR without any prior rejections?**
   - Confidence Score: 85%

8. **What is the frequency of process variants that are saved by the EMPLOYEE?**
   - Confidence Score: 80%

9. **What is the performance metric for the process variant with the highest frequency?**
   - Confidence Score: 80%

10. **How many process variants involve a rejection by the PRE_APPROVER?**
    - Confidence Score: 80%

11. **What is the average performance for process variants that include a rejection by the SUPERVISOR?**
    - Confidence Score: 75%

12. **How many process variants involve multiple rejections?**
    - Confidence Score: 75%

13. **What is the frequency of process variants that are rejected by the EMPLOYEE after being rejected by the SUPERVISOR?**
    - Confidence Score: 75%

14. **What is the performance metric for the process variant with the lowest frequency?**
    - Confidence Score: 70%

15. **How many process variants involve a rejection by the BUDGET OWNER?**
    - Confidence Score: 70%

16. **What is the average performance for process variants that include approval by the PRE_APPROVER?**
    - Confidence Score: 70%

17. **How many process variants involve a rejection by MISSING?**
    - Confidence Score: 65%

18. **What is the frequency of process variants that are rejected by the EMPLOYEE after being rejected by the PRE_APPROVER?**
    - Confidence Score: 65%

19. **What is the performance metric for the process variant with the highest number of steps?**
    - Confidence Score: 65%

20. **How many process variants involve a rejection by the EMPLOYEE after being rejected by the BUDGET OWNER?**
