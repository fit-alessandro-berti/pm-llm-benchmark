If you read the tree literally, after `Receive_Order` and `Check_Inventory` you either go into an ANDblock containing

```
Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order
```

or into the cancellation block. An AND/`Operator.PARALLEL` block has no internal ordering: all three children must fire exactly once, but they may interleave in any order.

That means the tree will happily generate a trace such as

```
Receive_Order,
Check_Inventory,
Ship_Order,
Authorize_Payment,
Package_Items,
Close_Order
```

This fits the tree – it starts with the two fixed steps, executes all three branches of the parallel node in some order, then performs the final `Close_Order` – but it is nonsensical from an ordertocash perspective. You should not be able to ship goods before they have been paid for and packed; in the intended process `Authorize_Payment` should precede `Package_Items`, which should precede `Ship_Order`. The model underfits because it does not encode that ordering constraint.

A similar issue exists on the cancellation side: the tree also accepts

```
Receive_Order,
Check_Inventory,
Cancel_Order,
Close_Order,
Close_Order
```

because `Close_Order` appears both inside the cancellation branch and at the root. In reality you would close the order once, not twice.
