To represent the given complex event log using a POWL model, we need to identify the activities, their dependencies, and the control-flow operators for choice and loops. Below is the POWL structure that captures the relationships described in the event log:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define loops and choices
IQC_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC, AS])
RT_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[RT, TST])

# Define choices
LB_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# Define the partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, AS, IQC_loop, TST, RT_loop, PK, LB_choice, DP, D])

# Add edges to define the partial order
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
root.order.add_edge(AS, IQC_loop)
root.order.add_edge(IQC_loop, TST)
root.order.add_edge(TST, RT_loop)
root.order.add_edge(RT_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, LB_choice)
root.order.add_edge(LB_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# Add edges to define the loop and choice dependencies
IQC_loop.order.add_edge(IQC, AS)
IQC_loop.order.add_edge(AS, IQC)

RT_loop.order.add_edge(RT, TST)
RT_loop.order.add_edge(TST, RT)

LB_choice.order.add_edge(LB, skip)
LB_choice.order.add_edge(skip, LB)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Activities**: Each activity is represented as a `Transition` object with its label.
2. **Loops**:
   - `IQC_loop`: Represents the loop between IQC and AS, where IQC can be repeated followed by AS.
   - `RT_loop`: Represents the loop between RT and TST, where RT can be repeated followed by TST.
3. **Choices**:
   - `LB_choice`: Represents the choice between labeling (LB) and skipping it (using a silent transition `skip`).
4. **Partial Order**:
   - The root `StrictPartialOrder` object defines the overall process flow.
   - Edges are added to specify the dependencies between activities.
   - The loops and choices are integrated into the partial order to capture the control flow.

This POWL model captures the essential structure and dependencies of the manufacturing and distribution process as described in the event log.
