Below is one plausible highlevel process mined from the numeric patterns. I grouped events that share similar sensor “signatures” and assigned intuitive activity names. The exact labels are interpretive, but the patterns support them.

##  Inferred Activity Phases

| Phase | Events | Activity Label | Why this fits the sensor pattern |
|------|--------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **A** | 1–3 & 13–15 | **Idle / Standby (Setup or Shutdown)** | All sensors are at baseline: ~20°C, 1bar, zero vibration, zero flow, tool at 0mm, very low energy. This indicates the machine is powered but not processing. |
| **B** | 4–6 | **Cutting / Machining** | Sharp rise in temperature (50–58°C), high vibration (30–38Hz), strong material flow (5 units/s), tool moving inward (510mm), and energy increases to 2–3kWh. Classic signature of active cutting or material removal. |
| **C** | 7–8 | **Assembly / Pressing** | Temperature drops to 40°C, vibration drops to 10Hz, but pressure rises to 2bar and flow reduces to 2 units/s. Tool position is fixed at 15mm. This looks like a pressing or assembly step rather than cutting. |
| **D** | 9 | **Welding / HeatJoining** | Temperature spikes to 80°C and vibration to 50Hz with the highest energy use (5kWh) and **zero material flow**. This is typical of a heatintensive joining action like welding. |
| **E** | 10–12 | **Inspection / Finishing / Packaging** | System cools (3025°C), very low vibration, low energy, small material flow (0–1), and tool shifts to 20mm. This looks like a lowintensity finishing step: inspection, minor handling, or packaging. |

If you want, I can also visualize the phases on a timeline, cluster them automatically, or suggest alternative labels based on a specific manufacturing context.
