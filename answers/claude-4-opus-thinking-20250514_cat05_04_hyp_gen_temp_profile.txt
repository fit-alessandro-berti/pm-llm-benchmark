## Temporal Profile Analysis

### Identified Anomalies

1. **Receive to Approve (RP)**: Average time of ~25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation (1 hour). This rigid timing pattern suggests potential batch processing or artificial scheduling constraints.

2. **Approve to Notify (PN)**: Exceptionally long average delay of 7 days with high variability (2-day STDEV). This indicates severe bottlenecks or inconsistent notification processes.

3. **Assign to Close (AC)**: Direct transition averaging only 2 hours suggests claims being closed without proper evaluation or approval steps.

4. **Evaluate to Notify (EN)**: Extremely rapid transition (5 minutes average) indicates potential automation issues or process shortcuts.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

**1. Batch Processing Systems**
- The RP rigid timing might indicate scheduled batch approvals running at fixed intervals
- PN delays could be due to weekly notification batches

**2. Process Circumvention**
- AC direct transitions suggest emergency closures or automatic rejections
- EN rapid transitions might indicate automated notifications without proper review

**3. Resource Constraints**
- PN delays could reflect understaffed notification departments
- Certain adjusters might be bypassing standard procedures due to workload

**4. System Integration Issues**
- Automated systems might be creating artificial timing patterns
- Manual interventions could be causing unexpected delays

### SQL Verification Queries

**1. Investigate RP Timing Rigidity**
```sql
WITH receive_approve AS (
    SELECT 
        r.claim_id,
        r.timestamp as receive_time,
        p.timestamp as approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as time_diff_seconds,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount
    FROM claim_events r
    JOIN claim_events p ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
    JOIN claims c ON r.claim_id = c.claim_id
    WHERE r.activity = 'R' AND p.activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    claim_type,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    AVG(time_diff_seconds) as avg_time,
    STDDEV(time_diff_seconds) as std_dev,
    MIN(time_diff_seconds) as min_time,
    MAX(time_diff_seconds) as max_time
FROM receive_approve
GROUP BY claim_type
ORDER BY std_dev ASC;
```

**2. Analyze PN Delays by Resource and Time Period**
```sql
WITH approve_notify AS (
    SELECT 
        p.claim_id,
        p.timestamp as approve_time,
        n.timestamp as notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))/86400 as days_to_notify,
        p.resource as approver,
        n.resource as notifier,
        DATE_TRUNC('week', p.timestamp) as approval_week
    FROM claim_events p
    JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
    WHERE p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
)
SELECT 
    approval_week,
    approver,
    COUNT(*) as claims_approved,
    AVG(days_to_notify) as avg_days_to_notify,
    MAX(days_to_notify) as max_days_to_notify
FROM approve_notify
WHERE days_to_notify > 3
GROUP BY approval_week, approver
ORDER BY avg_days_to_notify DESC;
```

**3. Identify Direct AC Transitions (Skipped Steps)**
```sql
WITH claim_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
        resource
    FROM claim_events
)
SELECT 
    cs.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    cs.resource as adjuster,
    cs.timestamp as assign_time,
    ce.timestamp as close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - cs.timestamp))/3600 as hours_to_close
FROM claim_sequences cs
JOIN claim_events ce ON cs.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
JOIN claims c ON cs.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE cs.activity = 'A' 
    AND cs.next_activity = 'C'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
        WHERE claim_id = cs.claim_id 
        AND activity IN ('E', 'P') 
        AND timestamp BETWEEN cs.timestamp AND ce.timestamp
    );
```

**4. Examine Rapid EN Transitions**
```sql
WITH eval_notify AS (
    SELECT 
        e.claim_id,
        e.timestamp as eval_time,
        n.timestamp as notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) as seconds_to_notify,
        e.resource as evaluator,
        e.additional_info
    FROM claim_events e
    JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
    WHERE e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
        AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    evaluator,
    COUNT(*) as rapid_notifications,
    AVG(seconds_to_notify) as avg_seconds,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN seconds_to_notify < 180 THEN 1 END) as under_3_minutes
FROM eval_notify
WHERE seconds_to_notify < 600  -- Under 10 minutes
GROUP BY evaluator
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_seconds ASC;
```

**5. Comprehensive Anomaly Detection Query**
```sql
WITH activity_pairs AS (
    SELECT 
        e1.claim_id,
        e1.activity as from_activity,
        e2.activity as to_activity,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) as time_diff_seconds,
        c.claim_type,
        c.claim_amount,
        adj.region
    FROM claim_events e1
    JOIN claim_events e2 ON e1.claim_id = e2.claim_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
    JOIN claims c ON e1.claim_id = c.claim_id
    LEFT JOIN claim_events ae ON ae.claim_id = e1.claim_id AND ae.activity = 'A'
    LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON ae.resource = adj.name
),
expected_times AS (
    SELECT 'R' as from_act, 'P' as to_act, 90000 as avg_time, 3600 as std_dev
    UNION ALL SELECT 'P', 'N', 604800, 172800
    UNION ALL SELECT 'A', 'C', 7200, 3600
    UNION ALL SELECT 'E', 'N', 300, 60
)
SELECT 
    ap.claim_id,
    ap.from_activity || '' || ap.to_activity as transition,
    ap.time_diff_seconds,
    et.avg_time as expected_avg,
    ABS(ap.time_diff_seconds - et.avg_time) / et.std_dev as z_score,
    ap.claim_type,
    ap.region
FROM activity_pairs ap
JOIN expected_times et ON ap.from_activity = et.from_act AND ap.to_activity = et.to_act
WHERE ABS(ap.time_diff_seconds - et.avg_time) > 3 * et.std_dev
ORDER BY z_score DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

These queries will help identify specific instances of timing anomalies, reveal patterns by claim type or adjuster, and highlight systemic issues in the claim handling process.
