Based on the given event log and the observed behavior, we can construct a process tree that captures the main sequence of activities, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and re-validation, and the final approval, confirmation, and archival steps.

Here is the final process tree model:

```
* (
    -> (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
        'Archive Case (AC)'
    ),
    -> (
        'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
        'Validate Form (VF)'
    )
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Sequence**:
    - The main sequence of activities is modeled as a sequence (`->`) of the following activities:
        - `Receive Application (RA)`
        - `Validate Form (VF)`
        - `Assess Eligibility (AE)`
        - `Approval Decision (AD)`
        - `Send Confirmation (SC)`
        - `Archive Case (AC)`

2. **Optional Repeating Loop**:
    - The optional loop for requesting missing information and re-validation is modeled as a loop (`*`) that includes the sequence (`->`) of:
        - `Request Missing Info (RMI)`
        - `Validate Form (VF)`
    - This loop can occur multiple times or not at all, which aligns with the observed behavior where the missing information request and re-validation can happen zero or more times.

### Final Process Tree Structure:
```
* (
    -> (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
        'Approval Decision (AD)',
        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
        'Archive Case (AC)'
    ),
    -> (
        'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
        'Validate Form (VF)'
    )
)
```

This structure ensures that the main sequence of activities is followed, with an optional repeating loop for handling missing information and re-validation, capturing the observed behavior in the event log.
