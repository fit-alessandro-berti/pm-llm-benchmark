Based on the event log, the process tree should capture the following key aspects:
1. The main sequence of activities: RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC
2. The optional loop where RMI can be requested (possibly multiple times), followed by VF (re-validation)
3. The parallelism is not observed in this log, so we don't need to include it

Here's the process tree structure that captures this behavior:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> (
        'Validate Form (VF)',
        -> (
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
            X (
                -> (
                    'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
                    'Validate Form (VF)'
                ),
                -> (
                    'Approval Decision (AD)',
                    -> (
                        'Send Confirmation (SC)',
                        'Archive Case (AC)'
                    )
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

Explanation:
1. The process starts with 'Receive Application (RA)'
2. Then 'Validate Form (VF)' must occur
3. After validation, 'Assess Eligibility (AE)' must occur
4. At this point, there's an exclusive choice (XOR):
   - Either:
     - Request missing info (RMI) and then re-validate (VF)
     - (This can loop multiple times as seen in case 3)
   - Or:
     - Proceed to 'Approval Decision (AD)' followed by 'Send Confirmation (SC)' and 'Archive Case (AC)'

This structure captures:
- The mandatory sequence of activities
- The optional loop for missing information
- The final approval and archival steps
- The fact that the loop can repeat (as seen in case 3 where RMI occurs twice)
- The fact that the loop must eventually exit to complete the process
