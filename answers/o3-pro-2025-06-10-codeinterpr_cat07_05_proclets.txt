The illustration is made up of three closely-related sub-figures that together explain how two “proclets” (little process objects) cooperate in a clinical laboratory scenario:

1. Sub-figure (a) – “Two proclet classes connected through two channels”  
   • The lefthand proclet is called Lab visit and represents what happens to the patient inside the doctor’s office or the sampling room.  
   • The right-hand proclet is called Lab test and represents everything that is done in the laboratory.  
   • Inside each proclet, the normal control-flow is depicted with solid arrows that run from a small black start circle, through rectangular activity boxes, towards a small black end circle.  
     – Lab visit activities: Order entry  Take blood sample  Receive result  Judge results  (either) “Everything is fine” or “Do tests again”  Receive updated result  Send report.  
     – Lab test activities: Perform test  Make report  (possibly) Perform test again  Provide updated report  Finish lab test.  
   • Small stick figures are drawn beside the activities to show which role performs each step (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst).  
   • The two proclets exchange messages through two dashed, double-headed channels:  
     – “Order system” (top dashed box) conveys the initial test order (labelled 1.1  1.3).  
     – “HIS” (Hospital Information System, middle dashed box) conveys the result and any updated result (labels 1.4  1.7).  
   • Diamond-shaped gateways on the Lab visit side show that the doctor may judge everything as “fine” or may request the test to be performed again.

2. Sub-figure (b) – “Class diagram containing the two proclet classes”  
   A very small UML class diagram states that a Lab visit “requires” one-or-more Lab tests (multiplicity 1..1 to 1..*).

3. Sub-figure (c) – “Example of a performative”  
   A single table row gives a concrete example of a message that travels through the Order system channel:  
   • At 11:00 the Lab visit proclet for patient John sends a “Create” action to the Lab test proclet (test type HGB).  
   • The content of the message is “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”  
   • The scope is Private and the direction is OUT (from Lab visit to Lab test).

Overall, the visualization shows how a patient’s visit to the doctor (Lab visit proclet) is linked to one or more laboratory test processes (Lab test proclet) by sending and receiving specific performative messages across two IT channels.
