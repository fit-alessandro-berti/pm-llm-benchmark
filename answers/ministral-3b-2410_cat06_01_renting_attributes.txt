In the context of process mining and fairness in machine learning, sensitive attributes are those that should not be used to make decisions that could indirectly (through proxies) or directly discriminate against certain groups. These attributes can be understood as protected characteristics that should not influence the process outcomes in a manner that adversely affects certain groups.

From the provided attributes, the following are considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **Citizen**:
   - **Description**: A binary attribute indicating whether the case involves a citizen.
   - **Fairness Impact**: Could influence the outcome if there is any bias in how citizen cases are treated differently from non-citizen cases.

2. **Gender**:
   - **Description**: A binary attribute indicating the gender of the case.
   - **Fairness Impact**: Could potentially lead to biased outcomes if certain genders are treated differently.

3. **German Speaking**:
   - **Description**: A binary attribute indicating whether the case involves someone who speaks German.
   - **Fairness Impact**: Could influence the process outcome if there is a bias against non-German speakers.

4. **Married**:
   - **Description**: A binary attribute indicating whether the case involves a married individual.
   - **Fairness Impact**: Could lead to biased outcomes if marital status influences the process differently.

These attributes are sensitive from a fairness perspective because they are attributes that can potentially be used to discriminate against certain groups. In a fairness-aware process mining or machine learning context, it is crucial to ensure that these attributes do not disproportionately influence the process outcomes or predictions.

For instance, if the process outcomes (such as moving in, signing a contract, or rejecting a tenant) are influenced by these sensitive attributes, fairness constraints should be applied to mitigate any potential bias. This could involve removing these attributes from the model, adjusting the model to account for fairness, or implementing fairness-aware algorithms that directly consider these attributes.
