To solve for the temporal profile as described in the task, we need to make a reasonable estimate for the average time and standard deviation for pairs of activities that follow each other within the given global supply chain process.

Based on the process description, here is the sequence of activities in the global supply chain process for manufacturing high-tech electronics:

1. Supplier Selection (SS)
2. Order Placement (OP)
3. Receive Components (RC)
4. Quality Inspection (QI)
5. Component Assembly (CA)
6. Product Testing (PT)
7. Packaging (PK)
8. Warehouse Storage (WS)
9. Distribution (DT)
10. After-Sales Support (AS)

Given a trace such as `<A,B,C,D>`, pairs such as `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, `(C,D)` should be considered. Thus, for the given sequence of activities `SS`, `OP`, `RC`, `QI`, `CA`, `PT`, `PK`, `WS`, `DT`, `AS`, we need to make pairs such that the first activity appears before the second one in the given sequence. For example, `(SS, OP)`, `(SS, RC)`, `(SS, QI)`, `(SS, CA)`, `(SS, PT)`, `(SS, PK)`, `(SS, WS)`, `(SS, DT)`, `(SS, AS)`, `(OP, RC)`, `(OP, QI)`, `(OP, CA)`, `(OP, PT)`, `(OP, PK)`, `(OP, WS)`, `(OP, DT)`, `(OP, AS)`, and so on until `(WS, DT)`, `(WS, AS)`, and `(DT, AS)`.

The reasoning should make some realistic assumptions about the average time and standard deviation for each pair of activities. However, we need to make educated guesses for the actual "average time" and "standard deviation."

Let us make some reasonable estimates for the average time for each pair and a standard deviation based on a fraction of the average time. For instance, a standard deviation might be approximately 10-20% of the average time. 

#### Step-by-Step Pairing and Time Estimates

1. **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP)**: This might typically take a few days because once a supplier is selected, an order can usually be placed within a day or two. Let us assume an average of 2 days, which is `2 * 86400 = 172800` seconds. A standard deviation might be half a day (i.e., `12 * 3600 = 43200` seconds), which is `0.5 * 86400 = 43200` seconds.
    
2. **SS to Receive Components (RC)**: This might take a few days to a few weeks. Assume that after an order is placed, it might take on average a week (7 days) until the components are received. Thus, `7 * 86400 = 604800` seconds might be a reasonable average time. A standard deviation could be 1 day (i.e., `86400` seconds).

3. **SS to Quality Inspection (QI)**: This might be a day after receiving the components (since an inspection should be done soon after receiving the components). Thus, it could be about 8 days from the supplier selection until the quality inspection, which is `8 * 86400 = 691200` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1.5 days (i.e., `129600` seconds).

4. **SS to Component Assembly (CA)**: After quality inspection, it might take another day or so for components to be sent to the assembly line. Thus, maybe 9 days from supplier selection until assembly begins. That's `9 * 86400 = 777600` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2 days (i.e., `172800` seconds).

5. **SS to Product Testing (PT)**: After the assembly, product testing should follow. Assuming that assembly takes another day, it might be 10 days from supplier selection until product testing. That's `10 * 86400 = 864000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2.5 days (i.e., `216000` seconds).

6. **SS to Packaging (PK)**: After product testing, it could be a day until packaging, so about 11 days from supplier selection until packaging. That's `11 * 86400 = 950400` seconds. A standard deviation might be 3 days (i.e., `259200` seconds).

7. **SS to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Once packaged, products are stored in the warehouse until distribution. This could be another day, so about 12 days from supplier selection until warehouse storage. That's `12 * 86400 = 1036800` seconds. A standard deviation might be 3.5 days (i.e., `302400` seconds).

8. **SS to Distribution (DT)**: After storage, distribution could be another day away, so about 13 days from supplier selection until distribution. That's `13 * 86400 = 1123200` seconds. A standard deviation might be 4 days (i.e., `345600` seconds).

9. **SS to After-Sales Support (AS)**: After-sales support could start anytime after distribution until a few months later. However, for a more realistic and limited time frame, if a customer has issues, it could be within a month after distribution. However, after-sales support could be a much longer period (months to years), so it might be a bit hard to estimate. However, for a more "immediate" post-sales support, let us assume that the after-sales support is initiated on average 1 month (30 days) after the supplier selection. That's `30 * 86400 = 2592000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 5 days (i.e., `432000` seconds).

For other pairs such as `(OP, RC)`, `(OP, QI)`, `(OP, CA)`, `(OP, PT)`, `(OP, PK)`, `(OP, WS)`, `(OP, DT)`, and `(OP, AS)`, we need to make similar estimates:

- **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC)**: This might typically take a few days to a week. Assume an average of 5 days from order placement until components are received. Thus, `5 * 86400 = 432000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1 day (i.e., `86400` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Quality Inspection (QI)**: Another day after receiving components might make it 6 days from order placement until quality inspection. Thus, `6 * 86400 = 518400` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1 day (i.e., `86400` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Component Assembly (CA)**: Another day after quality inspection makes it 7 days from order placement until assembly. That's `7 * 86400 = 604800` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1.5 days (i.e., `129600` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Product Testing (PT)**: Another day makes it 8 days from order placement until product testing. That's `8 * 86400 = 691200` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2 days (i.e., `172800` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Packaging (PK)**: Another day makes it 9 days from order placement until packaging. That's `9 * 86400 = 777600` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2.5 days (i.e., `216000` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Another day makes it 10 days from order placement until warehouse storage. That's `10 * 86400 = 864000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 3 days (i.e., `259200` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to Distribution (DT)**: Another day makes it 11 days from order placement until distribution. That's `11 * 86400 = 950400` seconds. A standard deviation might be 3.5 days (i.e., `302400` seconds).

- **Order Placement (OP) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: After-sales support could be a month after the order placement. Thus, it might be 30 days from order placement until after-sales support, which is `30 * 86400 = 2592000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 7 days (i.e., `604800` seconds).

This reasoning should be continued until the `(WS, DT)` and `(WS, AS)`, and `(DT, AS)` pairs are also defined. However, a few more pairs should be defined explicitly here such as:

- **Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI)**: Quality inspection should be done almost immediately after receiving components. So, assume an average of `1 * 86400 = 86400` seconds (1 day) with a standard deviation of half a day (i.e., `43200` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to Component Assembly (CA)**: Quality inspection might take a day, so 2 days from receiving components until assembly. Thus, `2 * 86400 = 172800` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1 day (i.e., `86400` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to Product Testing (PT)**: Another day makes it 3 days from receiving components until product testing. That's `3 * 86400 = 259200` seconds. A standard deviation might be 1.5 days (i.e., `129600` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to Packaging (PK)**: Another day makes it 4 days from receiving components until packaging. That's `4 * 86400 = 345600` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2 days (i.e., `172800` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Another day makes it 5 days from receiving components until warehouse storage. That's `5 * 86400 = 432000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 2.5 days (i.e., `216000` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to Distribution (DT)**: Another day makes it 6 days from receiving components until distribution. That's `6 * 86400 = 518400` seconds. A standard deviation might be 3 days (i.e., `259200` seconds).

- **Receive Components (RC) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: After-sales support should be based on when the product reaches the customer, which could be 30 days after receiving components (including all the previous steps until distribution and some time until the customer might need after-sales support). Thus, `30 * 86400 = 2592000` seconds. A standard deviation might be 7 days (i.e., `604800` seconds).

This reasoning should be done for all pairs where the first activity occurs before the second activity in the given process order. Based on the reasoning above, a temporal profile could be constructed as follows:

    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('CA', 'PK'): (172800, 86400),
    ('CA', 'WS'): (259200, 129600),
    ('CA', 'DT'): (345600, 172800),
    ('CA', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),

    ('PT', 'WS'): (172800, 86400),
    ('PT', 'DT'): (259200, 129600),
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),
    
    ('PK', 'WS'): (86400, 43200),
    ('PK', 'DT'): (172800, 86400),
    ('PK', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),
    
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 43200),
    ('WS', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),
    
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2505600, 604800)  # 29 days (29 * 86400 = 2505600) from distribution to after-sales support might make sense if the total time from SS to AS is around 30 days.
}
```

However, a more "realistic" temporal profile should be defined based on actual data and real-world process execution logs. However, the reasoning here makes educated guesses based on a logical flow from one activity to another within a global supply chain process.
However, it's important to make sure that the pairs make sense and that the "average time" and "standard deviation" are realistic given a real-world global supply chain process. This is merely a logical and educated guess for a temporal profile.
