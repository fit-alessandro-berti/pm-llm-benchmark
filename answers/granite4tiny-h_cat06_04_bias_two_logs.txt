**Comparative Analysis of Event Logs**

Below is a structured comparison of the two logs (GroupA vs. GroupB) focusing on the key columns that can reveal bias:

| Column | GroupA (Protected) | GroupB (Unprotected) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **LocalResident** | FALSE for all cases (none are local residents). | TRUE for U001, U002, and U003 (all have a “LocalResident = TRUE”). |
| **CommunityGroup** | Always *None* (no community involvement recorded). | For U001: *Highland Civic Darts Club*; for U003: *Highland Civic Darts Club*. No other community groups appear. |
| **PreliminaryScore** | Ranges 710740, showing a narrow spread among protected cases. | Lower baseline (695720) but then receives a boost (+10) when “LocalResident = TRUE”. |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always *0* (no adjustments). | For U001 and U003: +10 points when “LocalResident = TRUE”. No other communityrelated boosts are present. |
| **FinalDecision** | 100% Approved (P001, P003) vs. N/A for decisions in the provided rows. | Mixed outcomes: two approved (U001, U003), one rejected (U002). |

### How Bias Manifests

1. **LocalResident Attribute**
   - **GroupA:** All entries are `FALSE`. This signals that no “local resident” factor is considered—consistent with the idea of a protected group where residency status should not be a decision criterion.
   - **GroupB:** Every entry is `TRUE`, indicating that every case involves a local resident. The absence of any nonresident cases removes an important counterfactual baseline.

2. **CommunityGroup Attribute**
   - **GroupA:** Always “None”. No community involvement is recorded, which aligns with the notion that protected groups should not be unduly influenced by community ties unless those ties are neutral or supportive.
   - **GroupB:** Consistently records a specific community (Highland Civic Darts Club). This could introduce an extrinsic bias if that community exerts informal influence over reviewers—i.e., the community group becomes a proxy for favoritism.

3. **ScoreAdjustment Column**
   - **GroupA:** No adjustments (`0` or `N/A`). Every case starts at its base preliminary score, preserving equality.
   - **GroupB:** When “LocalResident = TRUE”, an adjustment of **+10** is applied uniformly across all communityboosted cases. This systematic +10 boost can inflate the scores of local residents relative to a baseline that does not receive such boosts.

4. **Impact on Final Decisions**
   - In GroupA, because no adjustments are made and only “Approved” outcomes appear (all cases end up approved), there is no apparent discrimination—provided the underlying scores truly reflect merit.
   - In GroupB, a consistent +10 boost for local residents means that *even if* all other factors were identical, being local automatically raises the chance of an **approved** decision. For example, U002 (a local resident but rejected) still ends up **rejected**, while U001 and U003 both become approved despite starting scores only slightly above/below 710. The pattern suggests that community ties (being a local resident) confer an advantage that is not offset by other factors.

### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions

- **GroupA:** All protected cases show **approved** outcomes, indicating either:
  - Meritbased decisions based solely on the preliminary score.
  - Or deliberate policy/algorithmic safeguards preventing any disadvantage for local residency (since none exist).

- **GroupB:** Mixed outcomes with a higher proportion of **approved** versus **rejected**, and every approved case involves a local resident. The uniform +10 adjustment further ties community membership directly to a decisionmaking boost, which is inconsistent with the intent of a protected classification.

### Conclusion

The log for **GroupB (Unprotected)** exhibits bias primarily because:

1. It contains an explicit *community group* identifier that consistently points to local residents.
2. A systematic **+10 score adjustment** is applied whenever “LocalResident = TRUE”, creating a differential advantage solely based on residency status—a factor not present in GroupA.

These factors suggest that the decisionmaking mechanism inadvertently privileges cases involving local residents, thereby violating fairness criteria for a protected group by introducing an extrinsic bias through community ties. In contrast, GroupA’s lack of any such adjustments or community identifiers supports a more equitable process where decisions appear to be driven primarily by merit (as indicated by preliminary scores).
