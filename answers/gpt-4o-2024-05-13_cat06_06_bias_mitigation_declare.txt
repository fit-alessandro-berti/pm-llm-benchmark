Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new bias-mitigating constraints and a brief explanation for each added constraint:

### Explanation of Additions:

1. **Existence constraints for `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview`:**
   - Ensures that these activities are always performed, enforcing an additional review step to identify and mitigate potential bias.

2. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - For every decision involving potentially sensitive demographics (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Female`, `Reject_Female`, `Approve_Senior`, `Reject_Senior`), a `ManualReview` must also occur in the same trace. This ensures an extra layer of fairness and consistency for sensitive groups.

3. **Response Constraints:**
   - Enforces that a `BiasMitigationCheck` must be performed after checking sensitive attributes like race, gender, or age. This constraint addresses potential immediate bias by ensuring checks are in place to prevent it.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - Ensures bias mitigation actions (`BiasMitigationCheck`) are followed by decisions to ensure that the decisions made after these checks take bias mitigation findings into account.

5. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Prevents direct transition from sensitivity checks (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`) to a `Reject` decision. This avoids immediate rejection based on initial sensitive information without an intermediate fairness check step.

These constraints collectively aim to embed fairness and thorough examination of potential biases in the loan review process, ensuring decisions are made consistently and equitably for all applicants.
