## Step 1: Analyze the given event log to understand the process and calculate the total resolution time for each case.
To identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times, we first need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The total resolution time is the time difference between the "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket" activities for each case.

## Step 2: Calculate the total resolution time for each case.
- For Case 101: $2024-03-01 10:15 - 2024-03-01 08:00 = 2$ hours $15$ minutes.
- For Case 102: $2024-03-02 09:15 - 2024-03-01 08:05 = 1$ day $1$ hour $10$ minutes.
- For Case 103: $2024-03-01 09:30 - 2024-03-01 08:10 = 1$ hour $20$ minutes.
- For Case 104: $2024-03-02 08:30 - 2024-03-01 08:20 = 24$ hours $10$ minutes.
- For Case 105: $2024-03-03 09:30 - 2024-03-01 08:25 = 2$ days $1$ hour $5$ minutes.

## Step 3: Identify cases with significantly longer total resolution times.
To find cases with significantly longer resolution times, we compare the calculated total resolution times. Cases 102, 104, and 105 have longer resolution times compared to Cases 101 and 103.

## Step 4: Determine the average total resolution time to establish a baseline for "significantly longer".
Average resolution time = $(2.25 + 25.17 + 1.33 + 24.17 + 49.08) / 5 = 20.4$ hours. Cases with resolution times significantly above this average are considered to have performance issues.

## Step 5: Analyze the event log to identify potential root causes of the performance issues for cases with longer resolution times.
- Case 102: Took $1$ day $1$ hour $10$ minutes. It was escalated to Level-2 Agent, and there was a significant delay between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket" due to the escalation and potentially waiting for the Level-2 Agent.
- Case 104: Took $24$ hours $10$ minutes. There's a noticeable delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue", and the resolution happened on the next day.
- Case 105: Took $2$ days $1$ hour $5$ minutes. It was escalated to Level-2 Agent, and there were delays between activities, including a significant wait before further investigation after escalation.

## Step 6: Examine the role of escalations, waiting times, and other potential factors in the delays.
Escalations (Cases 102 and 105) and significant waiting times between activities (e.g., between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" in Case 104) are potential factors. For Case 105, the time between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and the next activity is substantial, indicating a potential bottleneck in Level-2 support availability or efficiency.

## Step 7: Propose insights or recommendations based on the identified factors.
1. **Improve Escalation Process**: Streamline the escalation process to reduce the time taken to escalate tickets to Level-2 Agents.
2. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Ensure that Level-1 and Level-2 Agents have adequate workload distribution to prevent delays.
3. **Enhance Ticket Triage**: Improve the triage process to correctly identify complex issues early, potentially reducing the need for escalations or expediting the investigation.
4. **Investigate Issue Timeliness**: Analyze why there's a delay between assigning tickets to agents and the start of investigation. This could be due to agent availability or inefficient workflows.

The final answer is: $\boxed{105}$
