The process tree captures the main flow of the business process, including the optional repeating loop for missing information and re-validation, while maintaining simplicity and precision. Here's the final structure:

```
SEQUENCE(
  'Receive Application (RA)',
  SEQUENCE(
    'Validate Form (VF)',
    'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
    LOOP(
      'Request Missing Info (RMI)',
      'Validate Form (VF)'
    )
  ),
  'Approval Decision (AD)',
  'Send Confirmation (SC)',
  'Archive Case (AC)'
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Flow**: The root is a `SEQUENCE` ensuring the mandatory steps (`RA  VF  AE  AD  SC  AC`) are executed in order.
2. **Loop for Repeated Validation**: After `AE`, a `LOOP` allows for optional repetition of `RMI  VF`. The loop operator `*` ensures that:
   - `RMI` is executed first.
   - After `RMI`, the process can either:
     - **Exit** the loop (proceed to `AD`), or
     - **Repeat** by executing `VF` and then re-entering the loop (allowing multiple `RMI  VF` cycles).
3. **Precision and Simplicity**: The model avoids overcomplicating the structure while capturing the observed behavior (e.g., repeated `RMI` and `VF` in some cases) and maintaining the core sequence.
