**Inferred case groups**

| CaseID | Patient (age/gender) | Department(s) visited | Logical sequence of events (chronological) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **CaseA** | 45M | ER  Radiology  ER  ER  ER | 1471215 |
| **CaseB** | 62F | ER  Laboratory  ER  ER  ER | 25810111417 |
| **CaseC** | 28M | Surgery  Surgery  Surgery  Surgery  Surgery | 369131618 |

### How the grouping was derived

1. **Patient identity is the only stable anchor** – the log contains `patient_age` and `patient_gender` for every event, but no explicit caseID.  
   - Ages45M,62F and28M appear repeatedly, so we treat each unique (age,gender) pair as a distinct patient (and thus a distinct case).

2. **Temporal coherence** – for a given patient the timestamps are monotonically increasing, even though events for different patients are interleaved.  
   - Example: the 45yearold’s events occur at 08:05, 08:10, 08:15, 08:23, 08:30 – a strictly increasing series.

3. **Logical workflow per department** – the activities follow a realistic clinical pathway:
   - **ER pathway (45M & 62F)**: Register  Initial triage  (optional) imaging or lab  Doctor consultation  (optional) prescription  Patient discharge.  
   - **Surgery pathway (28M)**: Register (in Surgery)  Doctor consultation (preop)  Surgery preparation  Surgery performed  Recovery room  Patient discharge.

4. **Crosspatient activity matching** – activities that reference the same patient attributes (age/gender) are linked together, even when the department changes (e.g., the 45yearold’s Xray in Radiology is still part of the ER case).

5. **No overlapping identities** – no two events share the same (age,gender) pair at the same timestamp, so there is no ambiguity about which event belongs to which case.

### Summary

- **Three distinct cases** are present, each identifiable by the unique `(patient_age, patient_gender)` pair.
- The events for each case follow a coherent clinical pathway despite being interleaved with events from the other two patients.
- Assigning a case ID (e.g., `Case_A_45M`, `Case_B_62F`, `Case_C_28M`) and grouping the events as shown above resolves the interleaved log into separate patient journeys.
