Below is a summary of the “happy-path” ordering of activities in a standard Procure-to-Pay cycle, followed by the cases in your log that deviate from it and why each deviation is problematic.

Standard P2P sequence (best practice)  
1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods (GR)  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO & GR (“three-way match”)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case

ANOMALOUS CASES

Case 1002  
• PO Issued (08:40) before PR Approval (08:00 was PR creation; approval only at 03/03 08:00)  
  – Bypasses requisitionlevel controls.  
• Payment Released (03/03 07:15) before:  
   – Any Goods Receipt (only on 02/04 09:00)  
   – Invoice Matching (02/05 08:00)  
   – Even the PR Approval (03/03 08:00)  
  – High risk of paying for undelivered goods or duplicate/incorrect invoices, no three-way match.  
• Invoice Received after payment release  
  – Violates basic matching and audit requirements.  

Case 1003  
• Payment Released (02/08) five days before Invoice Received (02/09) and eight days before Goods Receipt (02/10)  
  – Payment without verifying delivery or invoice content.  
  – Exposes the company to overpayment, fraud, or inability to reclaim funds if goods never arrive.  

Case 1004  
• Goods Received (02/06 09:00) before PO Issuance (02/06 09:15)  
  – Suggests “maverick buying” or informal receipt processes.  
  – No negotiated price, no formal contractual terms, no inventory control.  
• The rest of the cycle then rushes through match, payment and close within 48 hours.  
  – Unusually compressed, which may hide errors or leave insufficient time for review.  

Case 1001  
• Fully compliant with the standard sequence and timing—no anomalies.

Why these anomalies matter  
• Control breakdown: Skipping approvals or matching steps defeats segregation of duties and audit trails.  
• Fraud & payment risk: Paying before receipt/matching can lead to “ghost” invoices, duplicate payments, or overpayments.  
• Contract risk: Receiving goods without a PO means you have no agreed price, delivery terms or SLA.  
• Compliance & audit findings: Regulators and internal auditors typically require full three-way matching before release of funds.  

Detecting and correcting these sequence-breaks is critical both for preventing financial leakage and for maintaining robust internal controls in the P2P process.
