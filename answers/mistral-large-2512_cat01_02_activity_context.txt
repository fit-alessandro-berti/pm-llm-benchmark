### **Justification for Renaming Choices**

1. **Initiate Request  Submit Initial Request / Submit In-Person Request**
   - **Why?** The original name was too generic. The new names distinguish between online submissions (`Submit Initial Request`) and in-person submissions (`Submit In-Person Request`).

2. **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Initial In-Person Verification / Re-Verify Documents**
   - **Why?**
     - `Initial Document Verification` (C001, C002) refers to the first check of digital documents.
     - `Initial In-Person Verification` (C003) refers to the first physical check at the branch.
     - `Re-Verify Documents` (C001, C003) refers to a second check after additional documents or corrections.

3. **Call Customer  Call to Request Missing Docs / Call to Clarify Discrepancy / Follow-Up Confirmation Call / Call to Request Return**
   - **Why?**
     - `Call to Request Missing Docs` (C001) indicates a call to ask for missing documents.
     - `Call to Clarify Discrepancy` (C002) indicates a call to resolve an account issue.
     - `Follow-Up Confirmation Call` (C002) indicates a call to confirm adjustments.
     - `Call to Request Return` (C003) indicates a call to ask the customer to return to the branch.

4. **Submit Additional  Submit Additional Documents**
   - **Why?** The original name was unclear; the new name specifies that additional documents were submitted.

5. **Adjust Account  Adjust Account (Discrepancy) / Adjust Account (Missing Info)**
   - **Why?** The original name was ambiguous. The new names specify whether the adjustment was due to a discrepancy (C002) or missing information (C003).

### **Key Observations**
- **Context matters:** The same activity name can represent different actions depending on when it occurs in the process.
- **Resource and additional context help disambiguate:** For example, `Call Customer` by a `FrontlineAgent` vs. a `BranchOfficer` has different purposes.
- **Process flow influences meaning:** A second `Verify Documents` is always a re-verification, not an initial check.

This revised log makes the process more transparent and easier to analyze for process mining or auditing purposes.
