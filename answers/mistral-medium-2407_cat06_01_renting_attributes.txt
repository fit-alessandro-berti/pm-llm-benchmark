1. case:citizen: This attribute indicates whether the individual is a citizen or not. This attribute could be used to discriminate against non-citizens.
2. case:gender: This attribute indicates the gender of the individual. This attribute could be used to discriminate against individuals based on their gender.
3. case:german speaking: This attribute indicates whether the individual speaks German or not. This attribute could be used to discriminate against non-German speakers.
4. case:married: This attribute indicates whether the individual is married or not. This attribute could be used to discriminate against individuals based on their marital status.
