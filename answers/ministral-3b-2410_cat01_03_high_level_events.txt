### High-Level Activities and Grouping Justification

#### 1. Material Preparation
**Events Grouped:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
These events are part of the initial setup and preparation of the material for the manufacturing process. They involve the retrieval and preparation of the raw material, ensuring it is correctly positioned and ready for subsequent operations.

**Name:**
- Material Preparation

#### 2. Assembly
**Events Grouped:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These events represent the actual assembly process where the metal sheet is being welded together. The welding tool is picked up, and specific corners are welded, indicating the formation of a basic structure.

**Name:**
- Assembly

#### 3. Quality Inspection
**Events Grouped:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
These events are part of the quality assurance process. They involve checking the integrity of the weld, applying protective coatings, drying them, and performing a final visual inspection to ensure the product meets quality standards.

**Name:**
- Quality Inspection
