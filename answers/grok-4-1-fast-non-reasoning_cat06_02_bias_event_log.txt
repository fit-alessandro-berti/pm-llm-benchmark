### Manifestation of Bias in the Process

The event log reveals **clear evidence of systemic bias** favoring applicants who are **local residents (LocalResident = TRUE)** and affiliated with specific **community groups** (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club"). This bias is embedded in the **scoring adjustments** applied during PreliminaryScoring and carried through ManualReview and FinalDecision stages. It disproportionately disadvantages non-local residents and those without community ties, even when baseline scores indicate comparable creditworthiness.

#### Key Patterns of Bias
Here's a breakdown of the cases, highlighting the biased attributes and their impact:

| CaseID | LocalResident | CommunityGroup              | Initial Score | Adjustment                  | Final Score | Decision   | Bias Evidence |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **C001** | TRUE         | Highland Civic Darts Club   | 710           | +10 (Community)             | 720         | **Approved** | Community boost elevates score. |
| **C002** | TRUE         | None                        | 720           | 0                           | 720         | **Approved** | Local status alone suffices (no group needed). |
| **C003** | **FALSE**    | None                        | 715           | 0                           | 715         | **Rejected** | Non-local with solid score denied. |
| **C004** | TRUE         | Highland Civic Darts Club   | 690           | +10 (Community)             | 700         | **Approved** | Low initial score rescued by community adjustment. |
| **C005** | **FALSE**    | None                        | 740           | 0                           | 740         | **Approved** | Exception: High score overrides non-local penalty. |

- **Prevalence**:
  - **LocalResident = TRUE**: 100% approval rate (3/3 cases).
  - **LocalResident = FALSE**: 50% approval rate (1/2 cases); the approved case (C005) had an exceptionally high initial score (740), suggesting a score threshold (e.g., ~720+) bypasses bias.
  - **CommunityGroup = "Highland Civic Darts Club"**: +10 adjustment in both instances (C001, C004), pushing borderline scores (690–710) over approval thresholds.
  - **No CommunityGroup**: No adjustments; outcomes hinge purely on initial score and residency.

- **Where Bias Occurs**:
  | Stage                | Bias Mechanism                          | Impact |
  |----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
  | **PreliminaryScoring** | Explicit "+10 (Community)" for Highland group; 0 otherwise. Local status implicitly protects baseline. | Introduces uneven uplift. |
  | **ManualReview**     | Reviewers (e.g., #7, #2) rubber-stamp adjustments; no overrides. | Perpetuates automation bias. |
  | **FinalDecision**    | Rules Engine approves 700–720 (inferred threshold); rejects below for non-locals. | C004 (700) approved only due to adjustment; C003 (715) rejected despite higher-than-C004 baseline. |

#### How Attributes Favor Certain Groups
- **LocalResident (TRUE)**: Acts as a "floor" advantage. All locals approve, even without groups (C002) or with low scores + group (C004). Non-locals need superior scores to compensate (C005's 740 vs. C003's 715 rejection).
- **CommunityGroup ("Highland Civic Darts Club")**: Direct +10 score inflation, applied consistently by Scoring Engine. This rewards geographic/community insiders (likely Highland locals), creating a "network effect."
- **No adjustments for others**: Zero uplift for non-affiliated applicants normalizes disadvantage.

This is **affinity bias** (favoring "in-group" locals/community members) compounded by **algorithmic bias** in the Scoring Engine, with human reviewers failing to correct it.

#### Influence on Fairness and Equity
- **Unfair Thresholds**: Inferred approval ~720. Community +10 turns 690–710 into approvable scores (C001/C004), but non-locals at 715 (C003) fail. This penalizes similar creditworthiness (e.g., C003's 715 > C004's adjusted 700).
- **Compounding Effects**:
  | Group                  | Win Rate | Avg Final Score | Example Disparity |
  |------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
  | Local + Community      | 100%    | 710             | C004: 690  700 approved. |
  | Local Only             | 100%    | 720             | C002: No boost needed. |
  | Non-Local, No Group    | 50%     | 728             | C003: 715 rejected; C005: 740 needed for approval. |

- **Implications for Disadvantaged Individuals**:
  - **Non-Locals/Non-Affiliated**: Face higher effective thresholds (e.g., need 740+ vs. 700 for locals). This excludes mobile workers, newcomers, or unaffiliated residents despite strong credit profiles, perpetuating geographic exclusion.
  - **Equity Gaps**: Mimics real-world redlining—community ties proxy for "trustworthiness," ignoring merit. Over time, this concentrates resources (e.g., loans/grants) in "Highland" networks, widening inequality.
  - **False Negatives**: C003 likely creditworthy (715 > some approved baselines) but rejected, risking economic harm.
  - **Scalability Risk**: If "Highland Civic Darts Club" is a proxy for broader networks, bias scales to exclude marginalized groups (e.g., immigrants, low-mobility poor).

#### Recommendations to Mitigate
- **Audit Scoring Engine**: Remove/justify community adjustments; use blind scoring (mask residency/group).
- **Threshold Standardization**: Fixed cutoff (e.g., 700) with no uplifts; require ManualReview justification for variances.
- **Diverse Reviewers**: Rotate to counter affinity bias; track reviewer decisions by applicant demographics.
- **Monitor Outcomes**: Track approval rates by residency/group; aim for parity in similar-score cohorts.

This process is neither fair nor equitable—it's rigged for insiders, undermining merit-based decisions.
