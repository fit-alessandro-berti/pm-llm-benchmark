Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the event log provided and check each case against the normative rules and desiderata. 

First, for the normative rules: The process must follow a strict sequence. Starting with Application Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform Applicant, and then depending on approval or rejection, either Finalize Documentation or not before closing. Any deviation in the order, skipping steps, or doing forbidden actions like finalizing after rejection is a violation.

Then, the desiderata are the recommendations—like time frames for certain activities and a follow-up call. These aren't strict, so failing here is not a major violation but suboptimal.

Let me go through each case one by one.

**Case 1:**
Looking at the activities in order:
- Application Received
- Credit Check
- Risk Assessment
- Loan Decision (Approved)
- Inform Applicant
- Finalize Documentation
- Close Case

This seems to follow the normative sequence. All steps are in the correct order. Since it's approved, Finalize Documentation is done before closing. No steps skipped, order is correct. No violations here.

**Case 2:**
Activities:
- Application Received
- Risk Assessment (without prior Credit Check)  Violation here because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they did Credit Check after, which is out of order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected). Then Finalize Documentation, which shouldn't happen after rejection. Then Close Case.

So two violations: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize after rejection. Both against normative rules.

**Case 3:**
Activities:
- Application Received
- Credit Check (two days later)  which is a desideratum violation (should be within 24 hours)
- Risk Assessment
- Loan Decision (Approved)
- Inform Applicant (two days after decision)  another desideratum (48 hours recommended)
- Finalize Documentation
- Close Case

No Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum.

But normative rules check: The order is correct. Application  Credit Check (even if late)  Risk  Decision  Inform  Finalize (approved)  Close. So no normative violations. But they missed the Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum.

Now, checking desiderata for each case:

Case 1: All steps followed, but did they do Follow-up Call? The log doesn't mention it. So in Case 1, no Follow-up Call. But Case 1 might have followed the time recommendations. Let's check the timestamps:

Case 1:
- Application Received at 9:00
- Credit Check at 9:30  within 24 hours (good)
- Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00 same day  within 48 hours (just a few hours later). So timing desiderata are met. But no Follow-up Call mentioned. So desideratum miss here.

But in the log entry for Case 3, it's explicitly stated as "No Follow-up Call". Wait, looking at the log:

For Case 3, the last entry is "Close Case" on 2024-01-17 10:00. Then a row with "*(No Follow-up Call)*". So Case 3 didn't have a Follow-up Call. Case 1 doesn't mention this. Wait, the log's last row for Case 3 shows "No Follow-up Call". But for Case 1, there's no mention. So maybe in Case 1, they did the Follow-up Call? Or the log just didn't list it. Wait, the log in Case 1 has all activities up to Close Case. The desiderata says it's encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call before closing. So if the log doesn't show it, then Case 1 and 3 (explicitly) didn't do it, but Case 3 is noted. Maybe I need to check each case.

Wait, looking at the event log table:

Case 1 has all the activities from Application Received to Close Case. No Follow-up Call activity. Similarly, Case 2 also closes without a Follow-up Call. But in the log for Case 3, it's explicitly noted with a row that says "No Follow-up Call", but that's not part of the standard log entries. Maybe that's a note. The user's table includes for Case 3 a row with "(No Follow-up Call)" in the Activity column, but the Case ID is 3 and the Timestamp is empty. So maybe in the actual log data, there's no Follow-up Call for Case 3. Case 1 and 2 also don't have it. So according to desiderata, all three cases might have missed the Follow-up Call. But only Case 3 is explicitly noted. Maybe in Cases 1 and 2, maybe they did the call but it's not recorded? But according to the log, they didn't. So for all three cases, they failed the desideratum of Follow-up Call, but only in Case 3 it's explicitly mentioned. Hmm. The problem statement says in the desiderata that follow-up call is encouraged but not required. So missing it is a desideratum violation. So Cases 1, 2, and 3 all miss the Follow-up Call? But maybe Case 1 or 2 could have it.

Wait, looking at the log as presented:

For Case 1, activities are from Application Received to Close Case. No mention of Follow-up. So according to the log, they didn't do it. Similarly, Case 2 doesn't have it. Case 3 explicitly has a note that they didn't. So all three cases miss the Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. But the main focus for desiderata is the timing. The Follow-up is a separate desideratum.

So in Part 2, the desiderata include:

- Credit Check within 24h of application.

- Inform applicant within 48h of decision.

- Perform Follow-up Call before closing.

So for each case, we need to check these.

Case 1:

Application Received: 2024-01-10 09:00

Credit Check: same day 09:30  within 24h. Good.

Loan Decision: 11:00, Inform Applicant: 13:00 same day. So within 48h (it's only 2 hours later). Good.

No Follow-up Call. So desideratum violation here.

Case 2:

Application Received: 2024-01-11 08:00

Credit Check at 09:00 (but first activity after application is Risk Assessment at 08:20. Then Credit Check at 09:00. So time between Application (08:00) and Credit Check is 1h20m. Wait, the Credit Check happened on the same day, 09:00, which is 1 hour after application. So within 24h. But since the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative violation. But since the Credit Check was done even if out of order, but the timing is considered. Wait, but the Credit Check timestamp is 09:00, Application is 08:00. So even though the order was wrong, the time between application and credit check is 1h, which is within 24h. So it's a desideratum for Credit Check timing met? But the activity order is wrong. The desiderata are separate. So even if the order is wrong (normative violation), the timing of Credit Check after Application is within 24h. But Case 2's Credit Check was done at 09:00, which is 1h after application received. So that would meet the desideratum. But since the Credit Check was performed after Risk Assessment, which is a normative violation, does that affect the desideratum? Probably not. The desideratum is just about the time between Application Received and Credit Check, regardless of the order. However, in Case 2, the Credit Check is actually performed after the Risk Assessment, which is a normative violation, but the time between Application and Credit Check is 1h20m (Application at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00?) Wait:

Case 2: Application at 08:00, then Risk Assessment at 08:20, then Credit Check at 09:00. So time between Application and Credit Check is 1h (from 08:00 to 09:00). So even if the order is wrong, the time between Application and Credit Check is 1h, which is within 24h. So that's a desideratum met? But the normative violation is separate.

Hmm, but maybe the timing desideratum isn't applicable here because the Credit Check wasn't done in the correct order. However, the problem statement says desiderata are separate from the rules. So even if the order is wrong (normative violation), the desideratum about timing could still be checked. For example, in Case 2, Credit Check is done within 24h of application, even though it's after Risk Assessment. So the timing part is met. But the order is wrong for normative. But for desiderata, it's only about the timing. So Case 2's Credit Check is done within 24h, satisfying the desideratum for timing. But this is probably a moot point since the main issue here is the normative violations. Wait, but the user asks for desiderata failures. So even if the order is wrong, if the Credit Check is done within 24h, that part is okay. But in this case, Case 2's Credit Check was done at 09:00, which is 1 hour after Application at 08:00. So within 24h. So no desideratum violation here. However, the next step: Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, and Inform Applicant at 10:00. The time between Loan Decision and Inform is 30 minutes, which is within 48h. So desideratum met. So for Case 2, the only desideratum violation is the lack of Follow-up Call.

But then, there's also the Finalize Documentation after rejection, which is a normative violation. But that's separate.

Case 3:

Application Received 2024-01-12 09:00

Credit Check on 2024-01-14 10:00  that's two days later. So more than 24h. Desideratum violation.

Loan Decision (Approved) on 2024-01-14 12:00, Inform Applicant on 2024-01-16 15:00. Time between decision and inform: 2 days and 3 hours. So over 48h  another desideratum violation.

No Follow-up Call  third desideratum violation.

So, Case 3 has three desideratum violations.

Now, for possible justifications or interpretations:

Case 2 has a Finalize Documentation after rejection. Maybe the bank made a mistake, or the system incorrectly allowed it. But per rules, that's a normative violation. No real justification here; it's a clear error.

Case 3’s late Credit Check and informing applicant could be due to high workload, delays in processing, or maybe additional checks were needed. Though it's a desideratum, the reasons could be operational constraints.

The Follow-up Call missing in all cases might be due to resource limitations, or the process not being strictly enforced as it's only a recommendation.

So to summarize:

Normative violations:

Case 2: Two violations. 1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check. 2) Finalize Documentation after rejection.

Case 3: No normative violations.

Desiderata failures:

Case 1: Missed Follow-up Call.

Case 2: Missed Follow-up Call. (Note: Credit Check timing was okay, so no desideratum violation there.)

Case 3: Three desideratum violations: Credit Check timing, Inform Applicant timing, and Follow-up Call.

So the answers would be:

1. Case 2 violates normative rules because of incorrect order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) and Finalize after rejection.

2. Cases 1, 2, and 3 have desiderata failures. Case 1 misses Follow-up; Case 2 misses Follow-up; Case 3 misses Follow-up, Credit Check timing, and Inform timing.

Suggestions for justification: Maybe Case 2's Finalize Documentation after rejection was a clerical error. Case 3's delays could be due to high volume or manual processing delays. Lack of Follow-up Calls might be due to resource constraints.
</think>

**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2** violates normative rules for two reasons:  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** The process performed "Risk Assessment" at 08:20 before "Credit Check" at 09:00, violating the strict sequence requiring Credit Check  Risk Assessment.  
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** The case finalized documentation after a "Loan Decision (Rejected)," which is explicitly forbidden.  

**2. Desiderata Failures (Suboptimal Behavior):**  

- **Case 1:**  
  - **No Follow-up Call** was performed before closing (a recommended but non-mandatory step).  

- **Case 2:**  
  - **No Follow-up Call** was performed.  

- **Case 3:**  
  - **Credit Check delayed by ~49 hours** (from 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00), exceeding the recommended 24-hour window.  
  - **Applicant informed ~51 hours after Loan Decision** (from 2024-01-14 12:00 to 2024-01-16 15:00), exceeding the recommended 48-hour window.  
  - **No Follow-up Call** was performed.  

**3. Possible Interpretations/Justifications:**  

- **Case 2’s Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This could be a clerical error (e.g., accidental triggering of the "Finalize Documentation" step) or a system misconfiguration.  
- **Case 3’s Delays:** The prolonged Credit Check and notification times might stem from high workload, manual review requirements, or exceptional circumstances (e.g., incomplete application data needing clarification).  
- **Missing Follow-up Calls:** Resource constraints (e.g., understaffing) or prioritization of closing cases quickly over follow-ups could explain this deviation.  

**Summary:**  
- **Case 2** is non-compliant with **normative rules** and should be flagged for correction.  
- **All cases** exhibit **desiderata deviations**, with Case 3 showing the most suboptimal behavior. These are not critical but indicate areas for process improvement.
