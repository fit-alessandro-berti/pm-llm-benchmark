## Overview of the Business Process

This process describes how a company handles incoming customer requests, distinguishing between “standard” and “custom” requests, executing validations and checks, possibly obtaining internal approvals, and finally issuing an invoice and confirmation. The key elements are:

- **Start Event**: The trigger when a customer request arrives.
- **Tasks** (A–I): Work activities performed by the system or staff.
- **Gateways**:
  - **XOR (Exclusive)**: Chooses exactly one outgoing path based on a condition.
  - **AND (Parallel)**: Splits into multiple paths that all must be executed (and later joined).
- **Loops**: Enable rework when an approval is denied.
- **End Event**: Marks completion (either successful confirmation or rejection).

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Start Event**  
   - The process is triggered when a new customer request is received.

2. **Task A: “Receive Customer Request”**  
   - Purpose: Capture all relevant data (customer details, items/services requested, any special notes) into the order management system.
   - Outcome: A request record containing type, quantities, and any customization details.

3. **Gateway (XOR): “Check Request Type”**  
   - Decision point: Is the request a **Standard** offering (predefined products/services with known specs) or a **Custom** offering (special configurations, tailored to client needs)?  
   - Exactly one of the two paths is taken.

### Standard-Request Path

4. **Task B1: “Perform Standard Validation”**  
   - Purpose: Verify that the request conforms to company policies for standard orders (e.g., correct SKU codes, minimum order quantities, valid shipping addresses).  
   - If any data is missing or invalid, this task may throw an exception or route back to customer for clarification (not shown in pseudo-BPMN).

5. **Gateway (AND): “Run Parallel Checks”**  
   - Splits into two simultaneous checks that can occur in parallel:
     - **Task C1: “Credit Check”**  
       - Validate the customer’s credit status/limit before accepting the order.
     - **Task C2: “Inventory Check”**  
       - Confirm sufficient stock or materials are available to fulfill the order.
   - Both tasks must finish before proceeding.

6. **Join (Parallel Convergence)**  
   - Once both the credit and inventory checks complete successfully, the parallel threads join back into a single flow.

7. **Task D: “Calculate Delivery Date”**  
   - Purpose: Determine the promised delivery date based on stock availability, production lead time, logistics schedules, and any customerpreferred delivery windows.

### Custom-Request Path

4. **Task B2: “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”**  
   - Purpose: Analyze whether the customer’s specific requirements (e.g., special dimensions, unique materials, nonstandard software features) can be built, sourced, or otherwise fulfilled.
   - Output: A feasibility decision plus any rough cost or time estimates.

5. **Gateway (XOR): “Is Customization Feasible?”**  
   - If **No**:  
     - **Task E2: “Send Rejection Notice”**  
       - Notify the customer that the custom request cannot be accommodated, and terminate the process at the End Event.  
   - If **Yes**:  
     - **Task E1: “Prepare Custom Quotation”**  
       - Generate a detailed quote including pricing, delivery timeline, payment terms, and any special conditions.

## Merging Paths and Approval Logic

After completing either the standard path (Task D) or the customquotation path (Task E1), the two branches converge into a common decision point:

8. **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Needed?”**  
   - Purpose: Determine whether the order (standard or custom) exceeds predefined thresholds requiring managerial oversight. Common criteria include:
     - Order value exceeds a certain amount.
     - New or untested custom client.
     - Special terms requested by customer.
   - Exactly one branch is followed:

   a. **If No Approval Needed**  
      - **Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**  
        - The system creates the invoice including itemization, taxes, discounts, and payment instructions.
   
   b. **If Yes – Task F: “Obtain Manager Approval”**  
      - A manager or designated approver reviews all order details, quotes, delivery dates, and terms.
      - Upon review, the process moves to a second XOR gateway:

9. **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Granted?”**  
   - **If Yes**:
     - **Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**  
       - Now that approval is granted, issue the official invoice.
   - **If No**:
     - **Task H: “Re-evaluate Conditions”**  
       - Purpose: Modify or renegotiate order details so it can become approvable. This may involve:
         - Adjusting pricing or discounts.
         - Changing delivery schedules.
         - Revising credit or payment terms.
     - **Loop-back Logic**:
       - For a **Custom** request, the flow loops back to **Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation)** so a revised quote can be issued.
       - For a **Standard** request, it loops back to **Task D (Calculate Delivery Date)** or potentially **B1** if basic order parameters need updating.  
     - After re-evaluation, the process re-enters the “Is Approval Needed?” gateway and repeats approval sub-flow.

## Finalization and End

10. **Task I: “Send Confirmation to Customer”**  
    - Once the invoice is generated (whether with or without manager approval), the system sends an order confirmation. This includes:
      - Invoice copy.
      - Delivery date or schedule.
      - Any custom specifications (if applicable).
      - Contact details for customer service.

11. **End Event**  
    - Marks successful completion of the order processing, or, in the case of an unfeasible custom request, the process ends with the rejection notice.

## Key Concepts and Gateways

- **XOR (Exclusive) Gateway**  
  Used for binary or multi-way decisions where exactly one outgoing path will be taken based on data conditions. In this process it appears at:
  - “Check Request Type” (Standard vs Custom)
  - “Is Customization Feasible?” (Yes vs No)
  - “Is Approval Needed?” (Yes vs No)
  - “Is Approval Granted?” (Yes vs No)

- **AND (Parallel) Gateway**  
  Splits the flow into multiple branches that execute concurrently, and later forces them to re-join only when *all* are complete. Here it ensures the credit check and inventory check run in parallel and both finish before moving on.

- **Loops and Rework**  
  When approval is denied, the “Re-evaluate Conditions” task sends the flow back to an earlier task specific to the request type, enabling updated quotations or delivery calculations without restarting the entire process from scratch.

## Differentiation: Standard vs Custom

- **Standard Requests**  
  - Emphasis on fast, rule-based validation and automated checks.
  - Parallel credit and inventory checks optimize throughput.
  - Delivery date is determined algorithmically.
  - Often only require approval if the order value crosses a high threshold.

- **Custom Requests**  
  - Require human judgment on feasibility.
  - Generate bespoke quotations that may vary significantly from order to order.
  - More likely to need manager approval due to unique risk or cost profiles.
  - If customization is infeasible, the customer is informed immediately and the process ends.

## Conditions Triggering Approval or Rework

- **Approval Needed**  
  - Large total order value (e.g., above $50,000).  
  - First-time customer or unusual credit terms.  
  - Special discounts or nonstandard payment schedules.

- **Approval Denied  Rework**  
  - Denial may arise from budget constraints, risk exposure, or delivery infeasibility.  
  - Rework loop allows business analysts or sales teams to renegotiate terms or adjust parameters to align with acceptable risk levels.

This BPMN structure ensures efficient handling of routine orders, careful evaluation of custom demands, and built-in flexibility for rework and managerial oversight—all while maintaining a single convergent flow toward final invoicing and customer confirmation.
