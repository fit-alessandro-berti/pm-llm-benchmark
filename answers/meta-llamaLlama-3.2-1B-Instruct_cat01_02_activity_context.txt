**Step 1: Identify recurring activities**

After carefully examining the event log, the following activities appear multiple times within the same case:

* Initiate Request (C001) with varying timestamps and contexts
* Verify Documents (C001 and C002) with different timestamps and contexts
* Call Customer (C001 and C002 and C003) with varying timestamps and contexts
* Adjust Account (C002 and C003) with different timestamps and contexts

**Step 2: Interpret changes in meaning for each activity**

For each recurring activity:

* Initiate Request: Initially, it represents the initial request by the customer. However, after "Verify Documents", it also implies that the agent checks the identity documents, indicating an oversight. Therefore, we rename "Verify Documents" to "Verify Identity" to better reflect its changing meaning.
* Verify Documents: In the initial instance, it signifies identity verification. However, in later instances, it also represents re-checking documents after an initial verification. To better convey this distinction, we rename "Verify Documents" to "Identity Verification".
* Call Customer: In initial instances, it represents a call to clarify an account discrepancy. Later instances, such as "Call Customer (C003)", imply that it's a follow-up call to confirm adjustments made. Thus, we rename "Call Customer" to "Account Reconciliation".
* Adjust Account: Initially, it signifies a lack of account information. Later instances, such as "Adjust Account (C003)", imply a necessary correction due to missing information. Therefore, we rename "Adjust Account" to "Internal Correction".
* Verify Documents (C003): This activity signifies physical verification of the ID. Later instances, such as "Verify Documents (C003 and C003)", indicate a re-verification after account adjustments. Therefore, we rename "Verify Documents" to "Physical Verification".
* Approve Request: This activity initially indicates final approval. Later instances, such as "Approve Request (C003 and C003)", imply that final approval was granted after adjustments were made. Therefore, we rename "Approve Request" to "Final Approval".

**Justification for naming changes**

* "Initiate Request" is renamed to "Initiate Request - Verifying Identity" to better convey its initial role in checking the customer's identity and subsequent changes to its meaning.
* "Verify Documents" is renamed to "Verify Identity Verification" to more accurately reflect its increasing importance in verifying the customer's identity.
* "Call Customer" is renamed to "Account Reconciliation - Call" to distinguish between two instances with varying contexts and purposes.
* "Adjust Account" is renamed to "Internal Correction - Adjustment" to reflect its increasing importance in correcting account discrepancies.
* "Verify Documents (C003)" is renamed to "Physical Verification" to better convey its significance in verifying the customer's ID.
* "Approve Request" is renamed to "Final Approval - Re-Approval" to more accurately reflect its final stage in the approval process.
