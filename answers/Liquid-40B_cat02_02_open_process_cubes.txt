Process cubes are a key concept in multi-dimensional process mining, a field that extends traditional process mining techniques to handle more complex and multi-faceted data. 

Traditional process mining is a research area that combines data mining, machine learning, and process modeling to analyze event logs and discover, monitor, and improve real processes of organizations. It is primarily used to analyze the behavior of a process based on event logs, which are records of events that occur within a process.

However, traditional process mining has limitations when it comes to handling complex, multi-dimensional data. This is where multi-dimensional process mining comes in. Multi-dimensional process mining extends the capabilities of traditional process mining by incorporating additional dimensions into the analysis.

Process cubes are a key tool in multi-dimensional process mining. They are multi-dimensional data structures that allow for the analysis of processes from multiple perspectives. Each dimension in a process cube represents a different aspect of the process, such as time, resources, or organizational units.

The role of process cubes in multi-dimensional process mining is to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of the process. By analyzing the process from multiple dimensions, it is possible to identify patterns and trends that would not be visible in a traditional, one-dimensional analysis.

For example, a process cube could be used to analyze a process from the perspective of time, resources, and organizational units. This would allow for the identification of bottlenecks in the process, the allocation of resources, and the performance of different organizational units.

In contrast, traditional process mining would only provide a one-dimensional view of the process, which could potentially miss important insights.

In summary, process cubes play a crucial role in multi-dimensional process mining by providing a multi-dimensional view of the process. This allows for a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the process, which can lead to more effective process improvement.
