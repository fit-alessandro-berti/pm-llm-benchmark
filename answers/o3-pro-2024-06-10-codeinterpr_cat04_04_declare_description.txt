Below is a narrative that “unfolds” the DECLARE specification into an everyday description of how a bank (or any lending institution) might run its loan-approval pipeline.  After the walk-through you will find (1) an explanation, constraint-by-constraint, of what the rule achieves and (2) a short discussion of what could go wrong if the rules are ignored.

-------------------------------------------------
1.  A possible run of the process, step by step
-------------------------------------------------

Step 0 – Process readiness  
•  The one thing that is absolutely disallowed is “Proceed Without Compliance.”  
  By modelling it with an “absence” constraint, the institution makes it impossible—even in theory—for a case to bypass regulatory controls.

Step 1 – Receive Application  (init + existence)  
•  The customer hands in the application.  
•  “init” guarantees this is the very first recorded event every time a new case starts.

Step 2 – Preliminary Credit Check  (response + exactly_one)  
•  A credit analyst, or an automated scoring engine, performs a single initial credit check.  
•  The “response” rule says: as soon as the application is received, a credit check must eventually follow.  
•  “exactly_one” says it must happen once and only once—avoiding re-runs that could skew risk metrics or create duplicate pulls on the customer’s credit file.

Step 3 – Gather Additional Documents  (succession)  
•  Only after the credit check has been logged may the loan officer request pay-stubs, IDs, tax returns, etc.  
•  The “succession” constraint enforces that ordering.

Step 4 – Quality Assurance Review  (alt-succession from Step 3)  
•  Whenever documents have been gathered, the case must proceed to an internal QA review.  
•  The review team double-checks completeness, red-flags potential fraud, and confirms regulatory disclosures are present.

Step 5 – Assemble Loan Offer Package  (chain-succession from Step 4)  
•  Directly after QA signs off, the pricing/offer generation module or officer prepares the actual loan package: rate sheet, amortization table, contractual clauses, etc.

Step 6 – Transfer Funds  (chain-response from Step 5)  
•  The chain-response rule forces Transfer Funds to occur immediately after the package is assembled.  
•  Practically, this corresponds to an execution queue: once the contract package is stamped “Ready,” the core-banking system can release the money.

Step 7 – Notify Customer (alt-response / alt-precedence pair with Step 6)  
•  The model allows two legitimate patterns:  
  a) Funds are transferred first and then the customer is notified; or  
  b) The customer is pre-notified (e.g., “Funds will hit your account tomorrow”) and the transfer follows.  
•  The alternating constraints guarantee that whichever of the two events happens first, the other one must also occur.

Process end – No further action  
•  Because of the non-succession rule, Notify Customer may never be followed later by another Preliminary Credit Check.  
•  Because of non-chain-succession, Authorize Contract Terms may not be followed immediately by Notify Customer; money has to move first.  
•  “non-coexistence” between Transfer Funds and Receive Application would normally be impossible in a real process (one implies the other); it can be read here as a safety net for test logs—ensuring that a dummy “Transfer Funds only” trace is automatically invalidated.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  Why each constraint exists (business motivation)
-------------------------------------------------

1. absence(Proceed Without Compliance)  
   •  Absolute prohibition of shortcuts that would breach regulations such as KYC/AML, consumer-protection statutes, or internal policy.

2. init(Receive Application)  
   •  Makes the log begin in a customer-visible event, simplifying audit and metric calculation (all SLAs start counting from the same anchor).

3. exactly_one(Preliminary Credit Check)  
   •  Prevents “credit-shopping” or accidental double inquiries that could hurt the applicant’s score or inflate bureau fees.

4. response(Receive Application  Preliminary Credit Check)  
   •  Guarantees that every application gets at least an automated sanity check; mitigates fraud and credit risk.

5. succession(Preliminary Credit Check  Gather Additional Documents)  
   •  Forces analysts to look at the high-level risk first; if the score is obviously disqualifying, no one wastes time gathering documents.

6. coexistence(Gather Additional Documents  Authorize Contract Terms)  
   •  Both must happen or neither happens; ensures decisions are based on complete documentation and that documents are collected only for loans that will indeed reach authorization.

7. precedence(Quality Assurance Review  Authorize Contract Terms)  
   •  Authorization cannot precede QA; reduces downstream rework and regulatory exposure.

8. alt-succession(Gather Additional Documents  Quality Assurance Review)  
   •  A softer version of succession: if documents are gathered, QA must eventually follow, but other events may interleave (e.g., specialist review).

9. responded-existence(Assemble Loan Offer Package  Quality Assurance Review)  
   •  Guarantees every prepared offer has already passed QA at least once.

10. chain-succession(Quality Assurance Review  Assemble Loan Offer Package)  
    •  No delay allowed between QA approval and actual package generation, keeping data in sync.

11. chain-response(Assemble Loan Offer Package  Transfer Funds)  
    •  Prevents a scenario where a finished package sits un-funded, which could create stale rates or force re-disclosure.

12. alt-response / alt-precedence (Transfer Funds  Notify Customer)  
    •  Allows flexibility (some jurisdictions oblige pre-funding notice; others require immediate confirmation after funding) while still ensuring both activities occur.

13. nonsuccession(Notify Customer, Preliminary Credit Check)  
    •  Stops credit operations from continuing once the customer has been formally notified—avoids conflicting messages.

14. non-chain-succession(Authorize Contract Terms, Notify Customer)  
    •  Ensures at least one step (fund transfer) separates internal authorization from external communication, so that any last-second funding issues are caught.

15. non-coexistence(Transfer Funds, Receive Application)  
    •  Tests for impossible or malicious logs where money is disbursed without a recorded application.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  What can go wrong if the rules are violated
-------------------------------------------------

•  Skipping the Preliminary Credit Check:  
   – Elevated default risk, violation of credit policy, potential breach of “fair-lending” regulations.

•  Gathering documents before the credit check:  
   – Wasted customer effort and staff time if the application is later declined; negative customer experience.

•  Assembling an offer without QA:  
   – Contractual or disclosure errors, leading to costly re-signing cycles, fines, or reputational damage.

•  Funding before documents or authorization:  
   – Outright regulatory breach; bank might have to claw back funds, absorb losses, or face sanctions.

•  Not notifying the customer:  
   – Breach of consumer-protection and transparency rules; the customer could claim they never agreed to terms.

•  Occurrence of “Proceed Without Compliance”:  
   – Immediate audit finding, possible criminal liability for responsible employees, frozen lending operations.

In short, the DECLARE model formalises a set of business-sound, regulation-aware guardrails.  By interpreting each constraint as an operational policy, the bank simultaneously protects itself (risk, cost, compliance) and the customer (clarity, fairness, timely service).
