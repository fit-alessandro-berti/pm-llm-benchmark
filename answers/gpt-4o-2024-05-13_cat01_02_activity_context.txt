### Justification for Naming Choices:

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - **Initial Document Verification**: The first instance where an agent checks the documents.
   - **Final Document Verification**: In Case ID C001, this is a second verification following the submission of additional documents by the customer.
   - **Post-Adjustment Document Verification**: In Case ID C003, this occurs after an account adjustment, ensuring that documents are still valid.

2. **Call Customer**:
   - **Request Missing Docs Call**: In Case ID C001, referring to the call where the agent requests additional documents.
   - **Clarify Account Discrepancy Call**: In Case ID C002, the initial outbound call to clarify an account issue.
   - **Confirm Adjustments Call**: In Case ID C002, the follow-up call to ensure the customer is aware of the changes made.
   - **Customer Return Call**: In Case ID C003, calling the customer who stepped out of the branch.

3. **Submit Additional**:
   - **Customer Uploads Docs**: As this activity was performed by the customer in response to a request, it was renamed for clarity.
   
4. **Adjust Account**:
   - **Internal Account Adjustment**: Reflects the internal nature of the operation modifying account details.

Each new activity name clarifies the specific context and purpose within the support workflow, enhancing understanding and traceability of each step in the process.
