To filter out any cases containing more than six events and return only the events from cases that have six or fewer events, you can use the following DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    COUNT(*) AS event_count
  FROM
    event_log
  GROUP BY
    case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT
    case_id
  FROM
    event_counts
  WHERE
    event_count <= 6
)
SELECT
  e.*
FROM
  event_log e
  INNER JOIN filtered_cases f ON e.case_id = f.case_id
ORDER BY
  e.case_id,
  e.timestamp;
```

This query uses two Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `event_counts` and `filtered_cases`. The `event_counts` CTE calculates the number of events per `case_id`, while the `filtered_cases` CTE filters out any `case_id` where the event count is greater than six. The final SELECT statement joins the `event_log` table with the `filtered_cases` CTE, returning only the events that belong to cases with six or fewer events. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`.
