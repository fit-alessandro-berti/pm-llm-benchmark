To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants based on their frequency in the event log and then retrieve all events from cases that follow these variants. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Approach
1. **Extract Process Variants**: For each case, concatenate the sequence of activities ordered by their timestamps.
2. **Count Variant Frequencies**: Group the cases by their activity sequences and count how many cases follow each variant.
3. **Identify Top K Variants**: Rank the variants by their frequency and select the top K.
4. **Retrieve Relevant Events**: Filter the original event log to include only those cases that belong to the top K variants.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(*) AS case_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM case_variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM variant_counts
  WHERE rnk <= 3 -- Replace 3 with desired K value
),
top_case_ids AS (
  SELECT case_id
  FROM case_variants
  WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
WHERE e.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM top_case_ids)
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation
1. **case_variants CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) groups events by `case_id` and constructs the activity sequence using `STRING_AGG`, ensuring activities are ordered by their timestamps.
2. **variant_counts CTE**: Here, we count how many cases follow each variant and assign a rank using `DENSE_RANK` to handle ties appropriately.
3. **top_variants CTE**: Filters the variants to retain only those within the top K ranks based on their frequency.
4. **top_case_ids CTE**: Extracts the `case_id`s associated with the top K variants.
5. **Final Query**: Selects all events from the original log that belong to the identified top K cases, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`.

This approach efficiently groups and ranks process variants, ensuring we accurately retrieve the most frequent variants and their corresponding events. Adjust the `K` value in the `top_variants` CTE to modify the number of top variants considered.
