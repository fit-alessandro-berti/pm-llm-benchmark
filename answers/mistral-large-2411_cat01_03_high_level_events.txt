To achieve the goal of aggregating low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify High-Level Steps:**
   We will examine the sequence of events for each case and propose a set of high-level activities that represent logical groupings of these low-level steps.

2. **Justify Groupings:**
   For each high-level activity, we will explain why we grouped those low-level events together.

3. **Name the High-Level Activities:**
   We will assign meaningful, domain-relevant names to each group.

4. **Output Format:**
   We will return a structured representation of the proposed high-level activities.

### Step 1: Identify High-Level Steps

By examining the event log, we can identify the following high-level steps:

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Inspection**
4. **Coating and Finishing**

### Step 2: Justify Groupings

#### 1. Material Preparation
- **Events:**
  - Retrieve raw metal sheet
  - Scan barcode
  - Place metal sheet on table
  - Align metal sheet
  - Preheat metal sheet

- **Rationale:**
  These events are all related to preparing the raw material for the manufacturing process. They occur sequentially and involve activities that get the material ready for further processing.

#### 2. Assembly
- **Events:**
  - Pick up welding tool
  - Weld corner A
  - Weld corner B

- **Rationale:**
  These events are related to assembling the parts. They involve the actions of picking up a tool and performing welding, which are key steps in the assembly process.

#### 3. Quality Inspection
- **Events:**
  - Measure weld integrity
  - Visual check

- **Rationale:**
  These events are focused on ensuring the quality of the assembly. They involve checking the integrity of the welds and performing a visual inspection.

#### 4. Coating and Finishing
- **Events:**
  - Apply protective coating
  - Dry coating

- **Rationale:**
  These events are related to applying a protective coating to the assembled part and ensuring it is properly dried. They represent the final finishing steps in the process.

### Step 3: Name the High-Level Activities

1. **Material Preparation**
2. **Assembly**
3. **Quality Inspection**
4. **Coating and Finishing**

### Step 4: Output Format
