This task requires creating a unified event log by extracting and harmonizing events from the provided ERP tables. Since the `Order Lines` table contains multiple picking events per order, and the `Delivery` and `Invoice` tables can also contain multiple records per order, we must generate multiple events for these stages to accurately reflect the process flow (a multi-activity case).

**Assumptions Made:**
1. **Item Picking Events:** Each line item picked generates a separate `Items Picked` event, as different items might be picked by different people at slightly different times.
2. **Delivery Events:** Both `Dispatch` and `Arrival` from the Delivery table are recorded as separate, sequential events (`Order Dispatched` and `Order Arrived`).
3. **Invoicing/Payment:** An order can result in multiple invoices and multiple payments, leading to multiple distinct events for these stages.
4. **Resource Mapping:** The resource IDs (like `SP-001`, `WH-001`, `BL-001`) are mapped to their descriptive names/roles using the provided **Resources Table**. If an ID is not found, the ID itself is used as the Resource.

### Integrated Event Log for Process Mining

The following table combines all derived events, sorted chronologically within each `order_id`.
