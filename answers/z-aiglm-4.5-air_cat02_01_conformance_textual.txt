Based on the normative process description and the event log, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow. Below is a step-by-step analysis of each case, referencing the specific rules and constraints from the description:

---

### **Violations Identified:**
#### **Case 2 (2023-10-06)**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.  
- **Violations**:  
  1. **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**.  
     - **Rule violated**: The normative description explicitly states that *"Package items" should only occur after authorization* (i.e., after payment is authorized). Packaging items before payment authorization is illogical, as payment must be confirmed before preparing items for shipment.  
     - **Ambiguity resolution**: The description clarifies that payment authorization *"only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known"* (after "Check inventory"). Here, packaging bypasses this step, violating the logical flow.  

  2. **"Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items"**.  
     - **Rule violated**: Authorization must occur before packaging per the constraint: *"Authorize payment should only occur ... before packaging"*. This inversion disrupts the sequence for sufficient inventory (Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close).  

---

#### **Case 3 (2023-10-07)**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.  
- **Violations**:  
  1. **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**.  
     - **Rule violated**: The normative description mandates that *"Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation"*. Shipping a canceled order is explicitly forbidden, as cancellation invalidates the need for fulfillment.  
     - **Ambiguity resolution**: The description states that after cancellation, the process must proceed directly to "Close order". The inclusion of "Ship order" here is illogical and violates the cancellation workflow (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close).  

  2. **"Package items" is skipped after cancellation** (minor secondary violation):  
     - **Implicit rule**: While not explicitly stated, the description implies that fulfillment activities (e.g., packaging) should be skipped after cancellation. Here, "Ship order" appears despite the cancellation, further violating the prohibition against post-cancellation shipping.  

---

#### **Case 5 (2023-10-09)**
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.  
- **Violations**:  
  1. **"Package items" is omitted before "Ship order"**.  
     - **Rule violated**: The normative constraint requires *"Package items" to occur before shipping* (i.e., *"Package items should only occur ... before shipping"*). Skipping this step violates the workflow for sufficient inventory, as items must be prepared before shipment.  
     - **Ambiguity resolution**: The description emphasizes that packaging is a mandatory step between authorization and shipping. Its absence creates an illogical jump from payment authorization to shipping.  

---

### **Non-Violating Cases:**
#### **Case 1 (2023-10-05)**  
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.  
- **Analysis**: Fully aligns with the sufficient inventory workflow. All constraints are satisfied:  
  - "Check inventory" precedes payment authorization.  
  - "Authorize payment" occurs before "Package items".  
  - "Package items" precedes "Ship order".  
  - "Close order" is the final step.  

#### **Case 4 (2023-10-08)**  
- **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.  
- **Analysis**: Fully aligns with the insufficient inventory workflow. No deviations:  
  - "Check inventory" precedes cancellation.  
  - "Cancel order" is followed directly by "Close order".  
  - Fulfillment activities (e.g., shipping) are skipped.  

---

### **Key Rules Applied:**
1. **Inventory Check Precedence**: "Check inventory" must always follow "Receive order" and precede all other steps (Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate this indirectly by misplacing subsequent activities).  
2. **Payment Authorization Timing**: Must occur after inventory check and before packaging (Violated in Cases 2 and 5).  
3. **Packaging Necessity**: Required between authorization and shipping (Violated in Cases 2 and 5).  
4. **Cancellation Consequences**: Cancelling an order must skip fulfillment steps and proceed directly to "Close order" (Violated in Case 3).  
5. **Shipping Constraints**: Never allowed after cancellation or without prior packaging (Violated in Cases 3 and 5).  

### **Conclusion:**
Cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process due to:  
- **Case 2**: Inverting payment authorization and packaging.  
- **Case 3**: Shipping after cancellation.  
- **Case 5**: Skipping packaging before shipping.  
These deviations stem from ignoring the logical dependencies between activities as defined in the normative description. Cases 1 and 4 adhere strictly to the intended workflows for sufficient and insufficient inventory, respectively.
