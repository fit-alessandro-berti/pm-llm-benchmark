Here are my targeted questions to better understand your property onboarding process:

## **Initial Contact & Documentation Phase**
1. What typically prompts property owners to reach out to your company initially, and do you have any qualification criteria before you even begin the documentation review?

2. When documentation is missing or outdated, what's your typical approach for follow-up, and is there a point where you might decline to work with a landlord due to persistent documentation issues?

3. Who ultimately makes the decision to accept or reject a property into your portfolio, and what are the key factors that would lead to rejection?

## **Property Manager Assignment & Coordination**
4. When you mention "workload" as a factor in assigning property managers, how do you actually measure and balance that workload across your team?

5. What happens if the initial match between property manager and landlord doesn't work out well during or after the introductory meeting?

6. Are there situations where a property might require multiple managers or specialized expertise, and how do you handle those cases?

## **Inspection & Marketing Phase**
7. What's the typical timeline from scheduling the photographer and inspector to having the property "activated" in your rental portal, and what are the most common delays you encounter?

8. When inspection issues are found, who determines whether they're serious enough to halt the process, and how do you handle situations where landlords are reluctant to make required repairs?

9. How do you handle pricing decisions when your internal models suggest a different rental rate than what the landlord expects?

## **Tenant Selection & Leasing**
10. Can you walk me through what happens when you have multiple qualified applicants for the same property? What's your decision-making framework?

11. How do you handle situations where a property sits vacant longer than expected, and what authority does the property manager have to adjust terms or pricing?

## **Quality Assurance & Exception Handling**
12. You mentioned compliance officers and financial analysts reviewing deals - at what point in the process do these reviews typically occur, and what happens if they identify issues late in the game?

13. What are some examples of the "special insurance" or "custom lease clauses" exceptions you mentioned, and how do these impact your standard timeline?

14. When communication breaks down or conflicts arise between the various stakeholders (landlords, tenants, internal teams), what's your escalation process?

## **Overall Process Management**
15. From start to finish, what would you consider a "normal" timeline for onboarding a straightforward property versus a complex one?

16. How do you track progress and ensure nothing falls through the cracks, especially when multiple departments and external parties are involved?

17. What metrics do you use to evaluate the success of your onboarding process, and what are the most common failure points you've identified?

These questions should help clarify the decision points, timing, responsibilities, and exception handling that weren't fully detailed in your initial description.
