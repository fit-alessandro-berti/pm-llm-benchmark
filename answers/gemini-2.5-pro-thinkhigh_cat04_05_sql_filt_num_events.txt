This is an excellent draft for a benchmark prompt. It's clear, specifies the context, and defines the core task well.

To elevate it from a good prompt to a *great benchmark*, we can add a few key elements that make it more rigorous, reproducible, and better at differentiating the capabilities of different models.

Here is a revised and enhanced version based on your draft.

***

### **Critique of Original Draft**

*   **Strengths:** Clearly states the goal, the data structure, and the core logic. It's a solid foundation.
*   **Areas for Improvement:**
    *   **Reproducibility:** Lacks sample data, making it impossible to verify the model's output automatically.
    *   **Ambiguity:** While clear, the phrasing can be tightened. The "in other words" section is helpful for humans but can be consolidated for a more concise prompt.
    *   **Testing Depth:** It tests for one correct solution. A stronger benchmark might ask for alternative approaches to test the model's breadth of knowledge (e.g., subqueries vs. window functions).

### **Revised and Enhanced Benchmark Prompt**

**Benchmark Title:** Filtering Process Cases by Event Count in DuckDB

**Objective:** To test the model's ability to perform a two-step logical query in SQL: first aggregating to find a property of a group, and then using that property to filter the original, non-aggregated data.

---

#### **Prompt for Language Model:**

**Context:**
You are working with a process mining dataset stored in a DuckDB database. The data is in a table named `event_log`, which contains event data for various process instances (cases). The table is defined and populated as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    case_id VARCHAR,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO event_log VALUES
('A', 'Start', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
('A', 'Activity 1', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
('A', 'End', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),
('B', 'Start', '2023-01-01 11:00:00'),
('B', 'Activity 1', '2023-01-01 11:02:00'),
('B', 'Activity 2', '2023-01-01 11:04:00'),
('B', 'Activity 3', '2023-01-01 11:06:00'),
('B', 'Activity 4', '2023-01-01 11:08:00'),
('B', 'Activity 5', '2023-01-01 11:10:00'),
('B', 'End', '2023-01-01 11:12:00'),
('C', 'Start', '2023-01-02 09:00:00'),
('C', 'Activity 1', '2023-01-02 09:05:00'),
('C', 'Activity 2', '2023-01-02 09:10:00'),
('C', 'Activity 3', '2023-01-02 09:15:00'),
('C', 'Activity 4', '2023-01-02 09:20:00'),
('C', 'End', '2023-01-02 09:25:00');
```
*   `case_id`: 'A' has 3 events.
*   `case_id`: 'B' has 7 events.
*   `case_id`: 'C' has 6 events.

**Task:**
Write a single DuckDB SQL query that returns all columns from the `event_log` table, but **only for cases that have six or fewer events in total**. Cases with more than six events should be completely excluded from the result.

**Requirements & Constraints:**
1.  The solution must be a single, executable DuckDB SQL query.
2.  The query should not return any aggregated data; it must return the original event rows for the qualifying cases.
3.  The final output must include the `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` columns.
4.  The order of the resulting rows does not matter.

**Expected Output:**
Based on the sample data, the query should produce the following result (ordering of rows may vary):

| case_id | activity   | timestamp           |
|:--------|:-----------|:--------------------|
| A       | Start      | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| A       | Activity 1 | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| A       | End        | 2023-01-01 10:10:00 |
| C       | Start      | 2023-01-02 09:00:00 |
| C       | Activity 1 | 2023-01-02 09:05:00 |
| C       | Activity 2 | 2023-01-02 09:10:00 |
| C       | Activity 3 | 2023-01-02 09:15:00 |
| C       | Activity 4 | 2023-01-02 09:20:00 |
| C       | End        | 2023-01-02 09:25:00 |

**(Optional) Advanced Challenge:**
To further test your SQL capabilities, please provide two distinct solutions for this task:
1.  **Solution 1:** Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery in the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **Solution 2:** Using a Window Function (e.g., `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`).

### **Why this Revised Prompt is a Stronger Benchmark**

1.  **Reproducible & Verifiable:** The inclusion of `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements, along with a precise `Expected Output` table, allows for automated testing. You can run the model's query and compare its output directly against the ground truth.
2.  **Unambiguous:** The sample data clarifies the edge cases: what happens with a case that has *fewer than* six events (`A`), *more than* six (`B`), and *exactly* six (`C`). This removes any ambiguity about the `"<="` condition.
3.  **Structured:** The use of `Context`, `Task`, `Requirements`, and `Expected Output` sections makes the prompt easier for the LLM to parse and understand completely.
4.  **Tests Depth and Breadth:** The optional "Advanced Challenge" pushes the model beyond just finding *a* solution. It tests if the model knows multiple, idiomatic ways to solve the same problem, which is a key indicator of advanced capability. It specifically probes for knowledge of CTEs and Window Functions, which are fundamental to modern SQL.
