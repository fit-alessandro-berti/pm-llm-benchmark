Certainly! The data you've provided describes a complex process flow for handling declarations, likely in a business or organizational context. The process involves multiple steps and participants, including employees, administrators, budget owners, supervisors, pre-approvers, and the handling of payments. Let's break down the key components and variants to understand the process better.

### Key Participants:
1. **Employee**: Submits and interacts with the declaration.
2. **Administration**: Approves or rejects the declaration.
3. **Budget Owner**: Approves or rejects the declaration.
4. **Supervisor**: Final approves or rejects the declaration.
5. **Pre-Approver**: Pre-approves or rejects the declaration.
6. **Payment Handler**: Handles the payment once the declaration is final approved.

### Key Steps:
1. **Submission**: The employee submits the declaration.
2. **Approval/Rejection**: The declaration can be approved or rejected by various participants.
3. **Final Approval**: The supervisor gives the final approval.
4. **Payment Request**: Once final approved, a payment request is made.
5. **Payment Handling**: The payment is handled.

### Process Variants:
1. **Straightforward Approval**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 4618
   - **Performance**: 810187.903
   - **Description**: This is the most common and straightforward path where the declaration is approved by administration and the supervisor, followed by a payment request and handling.

2. **Additional Budget Owner Approval**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 2473
   - **Performance**: 1084338.407
   - **Description**: This variant includes an additional approval step by the budget owner before the supervisor's final approval.

3. **Direct Supervisor Final Approval**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 1392
   - **Performance**: 854633.975
   - **Description**: The simplest path where the declaration is directly final approved by the supervisor.

4. **Pre-Approver Involvement**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 575
   - **Performance**: 861058.409
   - **Description**: This variant includes a pre-approval step by a pre-approver before the supervisor's final approval.

5. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 345
   - **Performance**: 1604595.638
   - **Description**: The declaration is rejected by administration and the employee, then resubmitted and approved by administration before final approval by the supervisor.
   - **Additional Variants**: Similar paths with rejections and resubmissions, including budget owner and supervisor rejections.

6. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
   - **Frequency**: 188
   - **Performance**: 2061236.516
   - **Description**: This variant involves multiple rejections and resubmissions before approval by administration, budget owner, and final approval by the supervisor.

7. **Final Rejection**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE`
   - **Frequency**: 174
   - **Performance**: 727139.517
   - **Description**: The declaration is rejected by administration and the employee, and the process ends.

8. **Saved Declarations**:
   - **Path**: `Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE`
   - **Frequency**: 134
   - **Performance**: 0.000
   - **Description**: The declaration is saved by the employee but not submitted for approval.

### Additional Insights:
- **Performance**: The performance metric (likely time in seconds) indicates the duration of each process variant. Higher performance values suggest longer processing times, often due to rejections and resubmissions.
- **Frequency**: The frequency metric shows how often each variant occurs. The most common variants are those with straightforward approval processes.
- **Rejection and Resubmission**: Variants with multiple rejections and resubmissions are less frequent but take significantly longer to process.

### Summary:
The process involves a series of approval and rejection steps, with the most common path being a straightforward approval by administration and supervisor. Variants with additional steps (like budget owner approval) or rejections and resubmissions are less frequent but take longer to complete. The presence of pre-approvers and the handling of payments are also integral parts of the process.
