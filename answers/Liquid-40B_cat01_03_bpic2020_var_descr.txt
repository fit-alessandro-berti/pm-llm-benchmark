The data provided represents a process flowchart or workflow for a specific process, likely related to a business or organizational workflow. The process involves multiple steps and decision points, with different actors or roles involved at each step.

Here's a high-level description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration is submitted to the administration for approval.
3. The administration approves the declaration, and it may be further approved by a budget owner or pre-approver.
4. The declaration is then approved by a supervisor.
5. The employee requests payment, which is then handled.

There are several variations of this process, with different approval steps and rejection points. Some declarations may be rejected by the administration, pre-approver, or supervisor, and the employee may need to resubmit the declaration after making necessary changes. In some cases, the declaration may be rejected by the budget owner, and the employee may need to resubmit the declaration with a different budget owner's approval.

The data provided includes the frequency of each process variant and its performance, which could be used to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the process and identify areas for improvement.
