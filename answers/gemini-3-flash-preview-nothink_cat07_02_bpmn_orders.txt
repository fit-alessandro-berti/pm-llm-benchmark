This image is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** illustrating a complex business process involving four different departments or participants, represented by horizontal pools: **Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.**

The diagram tracks the lifecycle of an order from initiation to final invoicing. Here is a detailed description of the process:

### 1. Sales Pool (The Initiator)
The process begins in the Sales department.
*   **Trigger:** The process starts every "Monday morning" (Timer Start Event).
*   **Check customer's order (Subprocess):** The first major step is an expanded subprocess. It involves checking the order for completeness and then checking the database for the customer. 
    *   An **Exclusive Gateway** (X) creates two paths: If the customer is not in the database, they are added (interacting with a "database" data store). If they are already in the database, the process moves forward.
*   **Communication:** Once the order is checked, the task "Send order details" is performed. This triggers dashed **Message Flow** lines to both the Production and Procurement pools.
*   **Wait and Finalize:** The Sales process then waits at an intermediate message event until it receives notification that the "Product [is] sent." Finally, it performs the "Draft invoice" task and ends.

### 2. Production Pool
The production process runs in parallel with procurement once the order details are received.
*   **Trigger:** It begins when "Order details arrive" (Message Start Event).
*   **Parallel Coordination:** A **Parallel Gateway** (+) splits the flow. One branch goes to "Plan production," while the other waits for a message from Procurement stating "Material not faulty."
*   **Synchronization:** Once both production is planned and materials are confirmed as good, another Parallel Gateway joins the flows.
*   **Action:** The "Manufacture product" task is completed.
*   **Communication:** A "Product complete" message is sent to the Warehouse.

### 3. Procurement Pool
This pool handles the sourcing of materials needed for production.
*   **Trigger:** It begins when "Order details arrive" (Message Start Event).
*   **Material Compensation Subprocess:** This subprocess involves the "Order materials" task. It includes a **Compensation Boundary Event** (rewind icon) linked to a "Return material" task, which is only triggered if the process needs to be undone later.
*   **Quality Control:** After ordering, the "Check materials" task occurs. 
    *   **Success Path:** If materials are good, a message is sent to Production ("Material not faulty").
    *   **Error Path:** If an error occurs during checking (Error Boundary Event/lightning bolt), it triggers a **Compensation Throw Event** (double rewind icon), which activates the "Return material" task in the previous subprocess. This path ends with an "Order cancellation" message.

### 4. Warehouse Pool
The warehouse handles the physical distribution of the product.
*   **Trigger:** It begins upon receiving the "Product complete" message from Production.
*   **Action:** The "Send product" task is performed.
*   **Communication:** A "Product sent" message is thrown, which serves as a notification back to the Sales department to trigger the final invoicing step.

### Summary of Inter-Departmental Flow
The diagram effectively shows how information and triggers flow between departments:
*   **Sales** initiates the work for **Production** and **Procurement**.
*   **Procurement** must provide a quality clearance to **Production**.
*   **Production** notifies the **Warehouse** when the item is ready.
*   **Warehouse** notifies **Sales** when the item has been shipped so the customer can be billed.
