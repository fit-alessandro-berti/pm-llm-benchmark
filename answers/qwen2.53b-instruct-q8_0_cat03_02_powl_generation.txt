To construct the given complex digital service provisioning process as a POWL model using Python and the provided classes from `pm4py`, we will follow these steps:

1. Create nodes for each step in the scenario.
2. Define transitions between nodes based on the described sequence and dependencies.
3. Construct loops, exclusive choices, and partial orders as required by the scenario.

Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
import pm4py

# Step 1: Service Request (SR)
service_request = Transition(label="Service Request")
verify_service_request = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[Transition(label="Verified"), Transition(label="Not Verified")])

# Step 2: Contract Setup (CS) - prerequisite before Technical Config
contract_setup = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
verify_contract_setup = Transition(label="Contract Verified")

# Step 3: Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)
datacenter_allocation = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
access_control_init = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
da_aci_parallel = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[datacenter_allocation, access_control_init])

# Step 4: Base Network Configuration (BNC) loop and Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)
base_network_configuration = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
debug_reconfigure = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")

bnc_dre_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[base_network_configuration, debug_reconfigure])

# Step 5: Exclusive Choice Deployment Method
containerized_deployment = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
monolithic_deployment = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
exclusive_choice_deploy_method = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[containerized_deployment, monolithic_deployment])

# Step 6: Final Tasks QA & SA - Partial order and then Go-Live Approval (GLA)
quality_assurance = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
security_audit = Transition(label="Security Audit")

qa_sa_partial_order = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.PARTIAL_ORDER, children=[quality_assurance, security_audit])

go_live_approval = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Building the full POWL model
root_powl_model = pm4py.objects.powl.obj.StrictPartialOrder()

# Service Request flow:
root_powl_model.nodes.add(service_request)
verify_service_request.children = [contract_setup, verify_contract_setup]
service_request.next_transition = verify_service_request

# Contract Setup and Datacenter Allocation / Access Control Initialization flow:
root_powl_model.nodes.add(contract_setup)
root_powl_model.nodes.add(datacenter_allocation)
root_powl_model.nodes.add(access_control_init)
root_powl_model.nodes.add(da_aci_parallel)

contract_setup.next_transition = da_aci_parallel
da_aci_parallel.children[0].next_transition = bnc_dre_loop
da_aci_parallel.children[1].next_transition = bnc_dre_loop

# Base Network Configuration loop and Debug & Reconfigure flow:
root_powl_model.nodes.add(base_network_configuration)
root_powl_model.nodes.add(debug_reconfigure)
bnc_dre_loop.children[0].next_transition = exclusive_choice_deploy_method
bnc_dre_loop.children[1].next_transition = bnc_dre_loop

# Exclusive Choice Deployment Method flow:
exclusive_choice_deploy_method.children[0].next_transition = go_live_approval
exclusive_choice_deploy_method.children[1].next_transition = go_live_approval

# Final Partial Order QA & SA and then Go-Live Approval (GLA):
qa_sa_partial_order.children[0].next_transition = qa_sa_partial_order.children[1]
qa_sa_partial_order.children[1].next_transition = go_live_approval
go_live_approval.next_transition = service_request

# Add all nodes to the root model:
for node in [service_request, verify_service_request, contract_setup, verify_contract_setup, da_aci_parallel,
             base_network_configuration, debug_reconfigure, exclusive_choice_deploy_method, containerized_deployment,
             monolithic_deployment, quality_assurance, security_audit, go_live_approval]:
    if node is not None:
        root_powl_model.nodes.add(node)
```

This code builds the entire complex digital service provisioning process as a POWL model. It includes all nodes (activities), transitions between them based on the described scenario, loops for reconfiguration attempts, an exclusive choice for deployment methods, and partial orders defining the correct execution sequence of final tasks.

Note that `pm4py` provides several other features like logging, tracing, etc., which are not utilized in this particular model. The focus is on representing the process in a fully ordered graph format with operators to mimic loops, choices, and partial orders as per the scenario provided.
