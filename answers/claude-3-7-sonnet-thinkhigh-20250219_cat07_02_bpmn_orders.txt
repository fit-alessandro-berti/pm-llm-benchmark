# Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Diagram

This visualization shows a comprehensive business process flow diagram divided into four functional areas or "swim lanes":

## Sales (Top Lane)
The process begins on Monday morning with checking order completeness. It then verifies if the customer exists in the database. If not, the customer is added to the database. After customer verification, order details are sent to production, and finally, an invoice is drafted.

## Production (Second Lane)
Upon receiving order details, production planning begins, followed by product manufacturing. The process includes a decision point for material quality ("Material not faulty") and concludes with "Product complete" status.

## Procurement (Third Lane)
This lane contains a "Material Compensation Subprocess" that handles ordering materials. The subprocess includes options to return materials if necessary. After materials are ordered, they are checked, with "Order cancellation" as a possible outcome.

## Warehouse (Bottom Lane)
Once production marks the product as complete, the warehouse receives this notification and sends the product, ending with "Product sent" status.

The diagram uses standard BPMN notation including:
- Start and end events (circles)
- Activities (rounded rectangles)
- Gateways (diamonds) for decision points
- Connecting arrows for sequence flows
- Dashed lines representing message flows between departments

This visualization effectively maps the end-to-end process from order receipt through fulfillment, showing how information and work flow across different functional areas of the business.
