Here’s a compact DuckDB query that does exactly what you described:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

Explanation:

1. The subquery  
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
   ```  
   • Groups all events by `case_id`.  
   • Uses `HAVING` to keep only those case IDs whose event count is 6 or fewer.

2. The outer query  
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM event_log
   WHERE case_id IN ( … )
   ```  
   • Returns every event row belonging to the qualifying case IDs.  
   • Cases with more than six events are automatically excluded because they don’t appear in the subquery result.
