 Here are the concepts and their opposite or more general counterparts:

1. Automated Process Discovery -> Manual Process Discovery
	* Automated Process Discovery involves using algorithms and data analysis to automatically discover business processes and dependencies within an organization. In contrast, Manual Process Discovery relies on humans to identify, document, and understand the processes through interviews, workshops, and observations.
2. Predictive Monitoring -> Post-mortem Analysis
	* Predictive Monitoring uses data analytics and machine learning to forecast future process events and outcomes. On the other hand, Post-mortem Analysis involves examining the causes and effects of past incidents to understand their impact and learn from them.
3. Bottom-up Discovery -> Top-down Discovery
	* Bottom-up Discovery involves identifying and understanding the processes at the lowest organizational level and then gradually working up to higher levels. In contrast, Top-down Discovery starts with high-level processes and drills down to find lower-level activities.
4. Process Simulation -> Static Process Mapping
	* Process Simulation involves creating a virtual model of a process to experiment with various scenarios, analyze performance, and make data-driven decisions. Static Process Mapping is a more basic alternative that simply documents and illustrates the process steps and relationships without any simulation features.
5. Process Efficiency -> Process Effectiveness
	* Process Efficiency focuses on optimizing resources, time, and costs while maintaining desired quality. It involves reducing waste and redundancy. On the other hand, Process Effectiveness emphasizes the achievement of desired outcomes and impacts, regardless of resource utilization or costs.
6. Real-time Monitoring -> Historical Analysis
	* Real-time Monitoring allows one to track and monitor processes and events as they occur. This requires the ability to capture, process, and analyze data quickly. Meanwhile, Historical Analysis focuses on extracting valuable insights from past data to inform future decisions and strategies.
