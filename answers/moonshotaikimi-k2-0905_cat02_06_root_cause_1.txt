1. Which tickets are “long runners”?  
   End-to-end lead time (receive  close):

   - 101 – 2 h 15 m  
   - 102 – 25 h 10 m  1 d 1 h  
   - 103 – 1 h 20 m  
   - 104 – 24 h 10 m  1 d  
   - 105 – 48 h 5 m  2 d  

   Tickets 102, 104 and 105 all need roughly one or two full calendar days, i.e. one order of magnitude longer than the “straight-through” tickets 101 & 103. They are the outliers.

2. Why are they slow? – facts visible in the log  

   a) Escalation is always present  
      - 102, 105 (and only those) contain “Escalate to Level-2”.  
      - 104 does not formally escalate, but its only activity after assignment is “Investigate Issue” which starts 3½ h later and is performed the next morning – behaviour that very often means an informal or undocumented escalation or an agent waiting for a specialist answer.

   b) Work does not continue in the same shift  
      - 102: escalation at 11:30, next visible work (L-2 investigation) starts 14:00 – 2½ h gap.  
      - 104: investigation starts 13:00, then nothing until next day 08:00 – 15 h overnight gap although the ticket was already in progress.  
      - 105: escalation at 10:00, L-2 investigation starts only the next day 14:00 – 28 h gap.

   c) Long “queue” times before first investigation even when no escalation is involved  
      - 104: 3½ h between assignment and first investigation; all fast tickets do it within 15-30 min.

3. How these factors inflate cycle time  

   “Level-2” is not staffed 24×7. When a ticket is escalated after ~10 a.m. it sits untouched until the specialist team begins its next shift (looks like 08:00–09:00 the following morning).  
   Even when the ticket is not formally escalated, if the L-1 agent cannot solve it quickly it is apparently parked until the next day instead of being handed over to the night shift or an on-call engineer.  
   The relatively short gaps inside one calendar day (triage, assignment) tell us that the basic flow is quick; the big jumps always happen right before or right after the investigation phase, i.e. when real technical work starts.

4. Recommendations – how to regain the 1-2 h baseline

   1. Introduce an “escalation clock”: if an agent cannot close a ticket within e.g. 90 min, escalate automatically; do not let it silently age.  
   2. Staff Level-2 until at least 6 p.m. or create an on-call duty so tickets escalated in the morning can still be resolved the same evening.  
   3. Where overnight work is impossible, set customer expectation to “next business day” but still let the specialist *acknowledge* the ticket in the system; the current log shows no activity at all, so neither the customer nor the L-1 agent knows whether it is being worked on.  
   4. For tickets that are *not* escalated but stay open (104), impose a maximum “pending” time; after X hours the ticket must either be closed, escalated, or reviewed by a team lead.  
   5. Add priority/severity and customer type to the log; if the long runners are all high-complexity bugs the above SLA still holds, but if they are routine requests the benchmarks should be even tighter.

By shrinking the “dead” overnight/in-between-shifts time and enforcing an automatic escalation rule, tickets that now take 24-48 h should fall back to the same-day pattern exhibited by cases 101 and 103.
