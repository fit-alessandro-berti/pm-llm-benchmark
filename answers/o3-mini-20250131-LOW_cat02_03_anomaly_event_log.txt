Below are the main anomalies identified alongside an explanation of why they might be problematic in a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, where the standard flow usually involves the following sequence:

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Receive Goods  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case

  
Anomalies:

1. Case 1002  
•Sequence Issue:  
– The PO is issued immediately after creating the purchase requisition (08:30 on 2024-02-01), but the purchase requisition is approved only later (08:00 on 2024-02-03).  
– Payment is released (07:15 on 2024-02-03) before the requisition approval and before goods are received (09:00 on 2024-02-04).  

•Why It’s Problematic:  
– Not obtaining approval before issuing the PO can violate internal controls, increasing the risk of unauthorized spending.  
– Releasing payment prior to receiving goods or final confirmation on the order may expose the organization to payment errors or fraud if the goods eventually do not meet requirements.

  
2. Case 1003  
•Sequence Issue:  
– Payment is released (11:00 on 2024-02-08) before the vendor invoice is received (12:00 on 2024-02-09) and before goods are received (13:00 on 2024-02-10).  
– While the process eventually completes the remaining steps, releasing payment out of sequence poses a control issue.

•Why It’s Problematic:  
– Approving payment before confirming that the supplier has invoiced and the goods have been received increases the risk of overpayment or payment for goods not delivered as expected.  
– It undermines the three-way match (PO, goods receipt, invoice) process essential for safeguarding organizations against errors and fraud.

  
3. Case 1004  
•Sequence Issue:  
– Goods are received (09:00 on 2024-02-06) before the purchase order is issued (09:15 on 2024-02-06).  

•Why It’s Problematic:  
– Receiving goods prior to issuing a purchase order is out of standard order and can lead to difficulties in verifying what was ordered versus what was received.  
– This mis-sequencing may complicate reconciliation efforts (matching invoice to PO) and creates risk for inventory and financial discrepancies.

  
Summary:  
Each anomaly indicates a deviation from best practices that require proper approval, timely issuance of the purchase order, and a strict sequence of actions. Skipping or reordering these steps can weaken internal controls, increase risks of fraudulent or improper transactions, and create challenges in audit and reconciliation processes.

By adhering to the established process flow, organizations ensure that every purchase is authorized, validated, and matched against received goods and invoiced amounts, which reinforces financial control and compliance within the P2P process.
