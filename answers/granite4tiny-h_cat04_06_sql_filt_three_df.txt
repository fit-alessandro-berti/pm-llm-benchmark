Here's a comprehensive solution to achieve the specified requirements using DuckDB SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log e1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM event_log e2
    WHERE e2.case_id = e1.case_id
      AND e2.activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
      AND (
          SELECT COUNT(*)
          FROM event_log e3
          WHERE e3.case_id = e1.case_id
            AND e3.activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
            AND e3.timestamp BETWEEN MIN(e2.timestamp, (SELECT timestamp FROM event_log e4 
                                                                WHERE e4.case_id = e1.case_id 
                                                                  AND e4.activity = 'Create Order') 
                                   ) 
                               AND MAX(e2.timestamp, (SELECT timestamp FROM event_log e5 
                                                                WHERE e5.case_id = e1.case_id 
                                                              AND e5.activity = 'Confirm Order')) 
      ) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

### Explanation:

- The main query selects all events (`e1`) from the `event_log` table.
- It uses a correlated subquery to filter out events belonging to cases that match:
  - A sequence of three activities: `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `'Create Order'`, and `'Confirm Order'`.
  - A time gap greater than 5 days between the `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` activities within this sequence.
- The subquery ensures we only consider cases where these events occur in direct succession without any other events from the same case interrupting the sequence.
- By using `NOT EXISTS`, the query excludes such events, returning all events except those that belong to the specified filtered-out cases.
