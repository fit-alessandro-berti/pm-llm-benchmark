Process enhancement is a key aspect of process mining, which is a family of techniques used to enhance enterprise processes based on actual log data. The concept revolves around using insights and patterns derived from such logs to identify potential improvements in the workflows of an organization.

**Process Discovery:**
Process discovery focuses on extracting a process model from an event log, capturing the typical sequence and frequency of activities that occur during the execution of a process. The goal is to understand how a process is actually working, rather than how it is supposed to work. Process discovery tools (e.g., alpha miner, Heuristic miner) analyze a log and generate a process model (often a Petri net or BPMN diagram) that reflects the existing business process' structure and behavior. Discovering a process from an event log provides a starting point for analysis, but it does not necessarily suggest improvements or optimizations.

**Conformance Checking:**
Conformance checking is the process of comparing an event log (what happened) against a reference model (what is supposed to happen according to a business process model). It helps determine compliance between the actual and intended processes by identifying deviations in the workflows. Conformance checking tools evaluate the alignment of the real process execution with the formal model and highlight discrepancies, such as process deviations or anomalies. Conformance checking is essential for understanding where the actual process diverges from the desired process model and can guide further optimizations.

**Process Enhancement:**
Process enhancement is the stage that follows process discovery and conformance checking. It involves making targeted improvements to the discovered process to optimize efficiency, reduce costs, enhance quality, and align with the intended business goals. During this phase, the insights from process discovery and conformance checking are leveraged to identify areas for improvement, such as bottlenecks, redundant steps, or compliance issues. Process enhancement may include changes to business rules, reconfiguration of workflows, automation of tasks, or training to address issues found during conformance checking. The objective is to create a better process that aligns more closely with strategic objectives while maintaining or improving performance.

In summary, while process discovery uncovers the current state of a process based on log data and conformance checking identifies deviations from intended business processes, process enhancement focuses on making strategic modifications to this process to achieve better outcomes.
