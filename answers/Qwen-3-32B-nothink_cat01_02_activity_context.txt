# Revised Event Log with Disambiguated Activity Names

After analyzing the event log, I've identified activities that appear multiple times within the same case but serve different purposes. These activities have been renamed to reflect their context and position in the process flow.

## Naming Justifications

1. **"Verify Documents"** was renamed to:
   - **"Initial Document Verification"** when it occurs early in the process and represents the first check of customer documents.
   - **"Final Document Verification"** when it occurs after additional documentation has been submitted.
   - **"Post-Adjustment Document Verification"** when it occurs after account adjustments have been made, indicating a re-verification step.

2. **"Call Customer"** was renamed to:
   - **"Request Missing Documents"** when the call's purpose is to ask for additional documentation.
   - **"Clarification Call"** when the call is for resolving account discrepancies.
   - **"Post-Adjustment Follow-up Call"** when the call is to confirm changes have been made.
   - **"Customer Absence Notification"** when the call is to inform a customer who has stepped away from their appointment.

3. **"Adjust Account"** was renamed to **"Account Adjustment"** for consistency and clarity.

4. **"Verify Documents"** and **"Call Customer"** were the most ambiguous activities, appearing multiple times with different meanings. The new names reflect not just the action but also the stage in the process and the purpose of the activity.

These changes make the process flow more understandable and help distinguish between similar activities that serve different purposes at different points in the customer support workflow.
