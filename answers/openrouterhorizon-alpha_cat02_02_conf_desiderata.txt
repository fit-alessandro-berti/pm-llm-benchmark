Here’s an assessment of the event log against the strict normative rules and the softer desiderata.

1) Normative rule compliance (hard constraints)

Case 1: Compliant.
- Sequence followed: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- Ordering rules respected; no contradictory actions.

Case 2: Violations.
- Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (violates ordering: Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).
- Finalize Documentation occurred after a Rejection (not allowed). After a rejected decision, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.
- Sequence/decision logic thus violated.

Case 3: Compliant.
- Sequence followed: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- No prohibited actions despite timing delays.

2) Desiderata compliance (soft recommendations)

Case 1: Meets desiderata.
- Credit Check within ~30 minutes of Application (within 24 hours).
- Inform Applicant ~2 hours after Decision (within 48 hours).
- Follow-up Call: Not present, but it’s only encouraged, not required.

Case 2: Mixed but overshadowed by normative issues.
- Timings themselves are within the suggested windows (Risk Assessment at 08:20 is fast, Inform Applicant is not recorded; Finalize Documentation timing is irrelevant here because it’s a strict violation after rejection).
- Regardless, the major concern is the hard-rule violations; desiderata status is secondary.

Case 3: Desiderata deviations (suboptimal but not severe).
- Credit Check occurred ~2 days after Application (beyond recommended 24 hours).
- Inform Applicant occurred ~2 days and 3 hours after Decision (beyond recommended 48 hours).
- No Follow-up Call (encouraged but optional).

3) Possible interpretations/justifications

Case 1:
- Smooth processing; timings suggest good operational throughput.

Case 2:
- Risk Assessment before Credit Check may indicate process confusion, logging error, or a rushed preliminary assessment recorded as “Risk Assessment” before formal credit data were available.
- Finalize Documentation after rejection might reflect mislabeling (e.g., “finalize” intended as “archive rejection file”) or a training/system control gap. Ideally, the system should prevent documentation finalization paths for rejected cases or relabel post-rejection admin steps to avoid confusion.

Case 3:
- Delayed Credit Check could be due to workload spikes, external bureau delays, or missing applicant data.
- Delayed Inform Applicant could reflect difficulty reaching the applicant, pending internal approvals for communication, or staffing constraints.
- Lack of Follow-up Call may be due to prioritization of throughput or reliance on written communications; still, adding a brief call can improve customer experience.

Summary:
- Normative violations: Case 2.
- Desiderata shortfalls: Case 3 (timeliness and optional follow-up). Case 1 meets recommendations; Case 2’s timing is acceptable but overshadowed by rule breaches.
