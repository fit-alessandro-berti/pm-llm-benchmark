To evaluate which cases deviate from the normative process, we'll analyze each case according to the guidelines provided in the process description. The normative process includes constraints such as the order of activities based on inventory checks, restrictions on actions based on fulfillment scenarios, and ensuring certain activities follow logical business rules. Let's review each case:

### Case 1

1. **Order of Activities:** Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order.
2. **Analysis:**
   - All activities are in the expected order for a scenario where inventory is sufficient.
   - There are no deviations. This case is compliant with the normative process.

### Case 2

1. **Order of Activities:** Receive, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
2. **Analysis:**
   - The sequence "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," violating the rule that payment authorization should precede packaging.
   - This is a violation because items should not be prepared before confirming payment authorization.

### Case 3

1. **Order of Activities:** Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order.
2. **Analysis:**
   - "Cancel order" appropriately follows "Check inventory," but relativ to cancellation, there is a logical error where "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order."
   - This violates the rule that shipping should not occur if an order is canceled.
   - Also, it is unusual to authorize payment after a cancellation decision has been made. Thus, there are two key violations in this case.

### Case 4

1. **Order of Activities:** Receive, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order.
2. **Analysis:**
   - The sequence correctly follows the cancellation path by going from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order" and directly to "Close order."
   - There are no violations in this case. It correctly adheres to the normative process for a cancellation scenario.

### Case 5

1. **Order of Activities:** Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order.
2. **Analysis:**
   - The sequence skips the "Package items" step, violating the rule that items must be packaged before shipping.
   - This is a significant violation because shipping must only occur after items have been properly packaged.

### Summary of Violations:

- **Case 2:** Violated the rule by packaging before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** Violated the rule by attempting to ship after a cancellation, and it also inappropriately authorized payment post-cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Violated the rule by shipping without first packaging the items.

**Conclusion:** Cases 2, 3, and 5 contain deviations from the intended normative process flow as outlined in the process description. Each has specific rules or logical steps either out of order or skipped, leading to process violations.
