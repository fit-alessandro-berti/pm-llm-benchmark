**Assumptions & Notes**

* The `order_id` is used as the **Case ID**.  
* When a table contains a resource identifier (sales person, picker, carrier, billing clerk) the corresponding name from the **Resources** table is added in the **Resource** column (shown as `ID – Name`).  
* For activities that can occur multiple times for the same order (e.g., picking several lineitems, several shipments) each occurrence is kept as a separate event.  
* If a step is missing for an order (e.g., no delivery for1004, no invoice for1004) the event is simply omitted.  
* All timestamps are kept in UTC as they appear in the source tables.  
* An **Attributes** column is added to hold any additional useful information (item,, quantity, carrier, invoice amount, payment method, etc.).
