One of the main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group is the frequency and performance of loan denials. The protected group is more likely to have their loan applications denied compared to the unprotected group. This could indicate a systemic bias or discrimination against the protected group in the loan approval process.

Another difference is the presence of additional steps in the loan approval process for the protected group, such as making visits to assess collateral, requesting co-signers on loans, and submitting files to underwriters. These additional steps may contribute to longer processing times for the protected group compared to the unprotected group, potentially resulting in delays or barriers to accessing financial assistance.

Overall, the unfair differences in treatment between the protected and unprotected groups suggest that there may be underlying biases or discriminatory practices in the loan application and approval process. This highlights the importance of addressing and rectifying any disparities to ensure equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their protected status.
