### 1. **Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**  
**Process Mining Techniques:**  
- **Frequency and Temporal Analysis:** Use alignment and  identical patterns to quantify how often constraints (e.g., Cold-Packing station overflow, simultaneous hazardous material orders) occur.  
- **Resource Utilization Mapping:** Analyze resource allocation patterns (e.g., station occupation duration) to identify resource contention hotspots.  
- **Concurrent Activity Checks:** Identify overlaps in hazardous material orders in Packing/QC activities using time interval analysis.  

**Metrics for Constraint Quantification:**  
- **Shared Cold-Packing:**  
  - *Impact Metrics:* Mean waiting time per order (due to station unavailability), maximum_number of concurrent orders attempting Cold-Packing (exceeding capacity).  
- **Shipping Batches:**  
  - *Impact Metrics:* Batch formation time (time from first order start to batch closure),% of orders delayed due to batch waiting.  
- **Priority Handling:**  
  - *Impact Metrics:* Pivot delays for standard orders (percent of standard orders paused for express orders), priority order fulfillment vs. SLA compliance.  
- **Hazardous Material Limits:**  
  - *Impact Metrics:* Peak concurrent hazardous material orders in Packing/QC (times exceeding limit),% of orders violating limits.  

**Differentiating Within-Instance vs. Between-Instance Delays:**  
- **Within-Instance:** Activity duration (e.g., picking time exceeding thresholds) vs. between-instance delays.  
  - *Method:* Use average time per activity (e.g., picking) vs.  ISTime (time between activity starts/ends across instances).  
- **Between-Instance Factors:** Represented by resource contention (e.g., station utilization >80%) and regulatory caps triggered by concurrency.

### 2. **Analyzing Constraint Interactions**  
**Key Interactions:**  
- **Cold-Packing + Priority Handling:** Express orders may occupy Cold-Packing stations, delaying other orders and forcing them to wait for batches, exacerbating hazardous material limits if delayed orders contain hazardous goods.  
- **Batching + Hazardous Limits:** Batching orders from the same region may inadvertently group hazardous orders, leading to compliance violations if the batch exceeds the 10-order limit during Packing/QC.  

**Importance of Interaction Analysis:**  
- **Cascading Delays:** Prioritizing express orders can strain shared resources, leading to batch delays and compliance risks.  
- **Tunnel Vision:** Addressing one constraint (e.g., Cold-Packing efficiency) without considering interactions with batching may worsen throughput.

### 3. **Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**  
**Strategy 1: Predictive Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing**  
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing + Priority Handling.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Implement time-based predictive models usingS (ARIMA) to forecast Cold-Packing demand.  
  - Assign express orders to Cold-Packing stations during low-peak times but auto-pause standard orders if stations reach 90% utilization.  
- **Data Leverage:** Historical station logs to forecast demand; real-time dashboards to track utilization.  
- **Expected Outcomes:** 30% reduction in Cold-Packing delays, 15% faster express order processing.  

**Strategy 2: Adaptive Batch Formation with Hazardous Material Checks**  
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches + Hazardous Limits.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Use (M ) with risk-adjusted thresholds to batch orders unless:  
    - Batches contain >10 hazardous orders (pre-trade checks).  
    - Geospatial grouping minimizes given orders = risk of exceeding limits.  
  - Enable" delayed batches" for hazardous goods to bypass suboptimal batches.  
- **Data Leverage:** Process mining to identify historical batch patterns violating limits.  
- **Expected Outcomes:** 25% faster batch closure, 100% compliance with hazardous limits.  

**Strategy 3: Priority-Aware Scheduling with Regulatory Safeguards**  
- **Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling + Hazardous Limits.  
- **Changes:**  
  - Develop a hybrid ( purities + resource) scheduling algorithm:  
    - Prioritize express orders but impose a 50% max concurrency of express orders.  
    - Use parallel sub-processes to schedule hazardous orders (e.g., dedicated Packing/QC queues).  
- **Data Leverage:** Stochastic process mining to simulate priority interruptions.  
- **Expected Outcomes:** 20% improvement in SLA adherence, 40% faster hazardous order processing.

### 4. **Simulation and Validation**  
**Simulation Techniques:**  
- ** Digitization-based Modeling:** Reproduce process templates from logs usingPEGASUS.  
  - *Key Components:*  
    - Resource calendars (station capacities + maintenance).  
    - Regulatory rules (hazardous material concurrent limits).  
    - Priority triggers (express order arrival).  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Test candidate strategies’ robustness under variable order arrivals and resource failures.  

**KPI Focus Areas:**  
- **Conflict Scenarios:** Simulate Cold-Packing station overflow with 10 express orders.  
- **Batch+Hazardous:** What if 12 hazardous orders are batched to the same region?  
- **Priority Tradeoffs:** How does pausing standard orders for 5 express ones affect throughput?  

**Validation Metrics:**  
- System-wide throughput (orders/hour).  
- End-to-end delay reduction (cannot exceed regulatory batch + priority thresholds).

### 5. **Monitoring Post-Implementation**  
**Key Metrics & Dashboards:**  
1. **Shared Resources:**  
   - Real-timeoccupancy % of Cold-Packing stations (alert if >80%).  
   - Hazardous material concurrent counts (color-coded per zone).  
2. **Batching:**  
   - Average batch time vs. historic benchmarks.  
   - % hazardous batches pre Trade checks.  
3. **Priority Compliance:**  
   - Express order SLA adherence rate.  
   - Standard order pause duration (rotating cascades converge).  
4. **Regulatory Checks:**  
   - Audit trail of Pack/QC step overlaps for hazardous orders.  

**Process Mining Operations:**  
- Daily anomaly detection (e.g., # concurrent hazardous orders exceeding 10).  
- Trend analysis of resource contention hotspots (top 5 stations).  
- Root-cause analysis for batch formation delays (>2x average time).  

**Expected Outcomes Post-Implementation:**  
- Reduction in " trapped ? waiting" at Cold-Packing stations (measured via queue time analytics).  
- 50% faster batch closure and 0% batch formation violations.  
- Express order SLA adherence 95%, no hazardous material regulatory breach.
