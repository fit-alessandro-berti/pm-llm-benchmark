### Inferred Activities from the Event Log

| Activity Label            | Events Involved        | Rationale |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **A. Machine Idle / Standby** | 1–3 and 13–15 | Temperature, pressure, vibration, and material flow all at baseline values; energy draw low and steady. This pattern indicates the machine is powered but not working—either waiting for a job or winding down afterward. |
| **B. Metal Cutting Operation** | 4–6 | Sharp rise in temperature (50–58°C), vibration (30–38Hz), and energy (2.0–3.0kWh) along with coolant/material flow (5units/s) and a steadily advancing tool position (510mm). These signatures align with a cutting or milling phase where material is actively being removed. |
| **C. Part Alignment / Assembly Prep** | 7–8 | Temperature moderates (~40°C), pressure increases to 2bar, vibration drops to 10Hz, and material flow diminishes to 2units/s while the tool settles at 15mm. This suggests the machine is positioning or clamping components—preparing them for the next intensive step. |
| **D. Welding / Joining** | 9 | Temperature spikes to 80°C, vibration jumps to 50Hz, energy usage peaks (5kWh), and material flow drops to zero while the tool holds position at 15mm. These indicators point to an energy-intensive joining process such as welding. |
| **E. Quality Inspection / Finishing Check** | 10–12 | Conditions cool down (25–30°C), pressure returns to 1bar, vibration is minimal (1–5Hz), and energy usage is modest (1–1.6kWh) while the tool makes fine adjustments (1520mm). Such controlled, low-intensity movements are typical of measurement, inspection, or minor finishing tasks. |

### Process Narrative

1. **Startup & Idle (Events 1–3)**  
   The machine sits in a ready state with all readings at baseline.

2. **Metal Cutting (Events 4–6)**  
   The tool ramps up, cutting the workpiece: heat, vibration, and energy draw spike; coolant/material flow is active.

3. **Alignment (Events 7–8)**  
   Once cutting stops, the machine adjusts/clamps the part in preparation for joining—steady tool position with moderate system stress.

4. **Welding (Event 9)**  
   A single high-energy pulse typical of welding fuses the components.

5. **Inspection (Events 10–12)**  
   After joining, the machine performs low-intensity checks or finishing touches, with fine tool motions and reduced energy.

6. **Return to Idle (Events 13–15)**  
   The cycle ends with the machine reverting to standby conditions.

These labeled phases convert the raw numeric log into a high-level manufacturing process view, showing a complete run from idle through cutting, alignment, welding, inspection, and back to idle.
