Here's a representative **temporal profile** for a complex global supply chain process in high-tech electronics manufacturing. The dictionary includes activity pairs that eventually follow each other across multiple steps, with estimated average delays and standard deviations based on typical business timelines and variability in such processes.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly successive activities
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),         # 1 day avg to place order after selection; ±2 hrs variability
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 172800),      # 7 days avg lead time; ±2 days due to shipping variance
    ('RC', 'QI'): (10800, 3600),         # 3 hrs avg for quality inspection; ±1 hr
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200),         # 4 hrs avg before assembly starts; ±2 hrs buffer
    ('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 10800),        # 8 hrs avg for component assembly; ±3 hrs due to complexity
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 3600),          # 2 hrs avg for functional testing; ±1 hr
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800),          # 1 hr avg to store post-packaging; ±30 mins
    ('WS', 'DT'): (432000, 259200),      # 5 days avg in warehouse before distribution; ±3 days
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800),     # 30 days avg until after-sales support begins; ±1 week

    # Eventually following (non-consecutive) activity pairs
    ('SS', 'RC'): (691200, 216000),      # ~8 days from supplier selection to receiving components
    ('SS', 'QI'): (694800, 219600),      # SS -> QI (~8 days + 3 hrs inspection delay)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (756000, 234000),      # OP -> PT (~8.75 days + production/test delays)
    ('RC', 'PT'): (129600, 43200),       # RC -> PT (~1.5 days: inspection + assembly + test)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (115200, 39600),       # QI -> PT (~1.33 days: assembly + test)
    ('CA', 'DT'): (446400, 262800),      # CA -> DT (~5.2 days: test + packaging + storage + dist.)
    ('PT', 'AS'): (2620800, 648000),     # PT -> AS (~30 days + variability for customer usage)
    ('PK', 'AS'): (2617200, 644400),     # PK -> AS (~30 days minus 1 hr of packaging time)
    ('SS', 'DT'): (1123200, 302400),     # Full upstream to distribution (~13 days total min-to-dist.)
}
```

### Notes:
- Time values are in **seconds**.
- All activity pairs that eventually follow each other in any trace are considered.
- Variability is captured through standard deviation, modeling real-world unpredictability (e.g., customs delays, equipment downtime).
- The estimates reflect realistic durations in a global, multi-tiered supply chain involving procurement, logistics, and post-sales services.
- Not all possible pairs are included — only a **representative subset** showing different levels of separation and plausible temporal relationships.

Let me know if you'd like this profile extended to include more pairs or modeled probabilistically using synthetic data generation.
