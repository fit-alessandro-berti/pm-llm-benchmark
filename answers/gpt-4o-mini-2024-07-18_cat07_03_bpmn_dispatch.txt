The visualization appears to be a flowchart detailing the process for dispatching goods. It includes several steps and decision points organized into different roles and actions. Here’s a breakdown of the main elements:

1. **Start**: The process begins with an "Order details" box indicating the receipt of an order.

2. **Shipping Method Clarification**: The flow diverges into determining the shipment method, with a decision point on whether special handling is required.

3. **Insurance Check**: There's a decision to check if insurance is necessary. If yes, an action to "Insure parcel" is taken; otherwise, the flow proceeds.

4. **Package Labeling**: Regardless of insurance, a "Write package label" step is included.

5. **Logistics Offers**: The process includes obtaining three offers from different logistics companies, followed by selecting a company and placing an order.

6. **Packaging**: Goods are packaged, with a note indicating a timeframe of 48 hours for some action.

7. **Delay Notification**: If there is a delay, customers are notified.

8. **Final Steps**: The last steps involve filling out shipment paperwork and moving the package to the pickup area, culminating in the "Shipment prepared" endpoint.

Overall, the flowchart systematically outlines each stage of the logistics and dispatch process, highlighting roles, decision points, and steps involved.
