This visualization depicts a business process for dispatching goods, divided into three main lanes representing different functional areas: **Logistics**, **Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop / Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

The process begins with a **Start Event** labeled "Ship goods," occurring in the Secretary lane.

Following this, the Secretary performs the activity "Clarify shipment method." After this clarification, the process branches into three **parallel activities** indicated by a parallel gateway (+).

1.  **Dispatch Decision and Logistics Coordination:**
    *   This stream starts with a decision point labeled "Special handling?" in the Secretary lane.
    *   If the answer is "no," the process continues to a merge point.
    *   If the answer is "yes," the process moves into the Logistics lane. Here, it first "Check[s] if insurance is required," using "Customer information" and "Order details" as data inputs.
    *   Following the insurance check, there's a decision gateway based on whether "insurance is necessary." If not, the process proceeds to "Write package label." If it is necessary, the process involves "Insure parcel" before moving to "Write package label."
    *   Concurrently within the Logistics lane, the process also involves "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and subsequently "Select logistic company and place order."
    *   The outputs from "Write package label" and "Select logistic company and place order," along with the "no" path from "Special handling?", converge at an exclusive gateway before proceeding to the next stage.

2.  **Warehouse Operations:**
    *   In the Warehouse lane, the goods are "Package goods." This activity is associated with a 48-hour timer, possibly indicating a processing time or delay notification trigger.
    *   Following or alongside packaging, there is an activity to "Notify customer about delay."
    *   Both "Package goods" and "Notify customer about delay" feed into a parallel join gateway.

3.  **Logistics Sourcing:**
    *   This parallel stream also originates from the initial parallel split, initiating the "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" and "Select logistic company and place order" activities in the Logistics lane. As noted above, the output of this stream converges with other logistics-related activities.

After all parallel streams have completed and converged at a **parallel join gateway (+)**, two final sequential tasks are executed: "Fill out Shipment paperwork" and "Move package to pickup area." Both of these activities occur within the Warehouse lane.

The process concludes with an **End Event** labeled "Shipment prepared," also located in the Warehouse lane.
