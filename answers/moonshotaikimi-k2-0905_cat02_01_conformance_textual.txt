Case 2 – packaging before payment  
Case 3 – shipping after cancellation

Details and justification
-------------------------
Case 1  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
Fully conforming (sufficient-inventory branch).

Case 2  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Violation: “Package items” appears at 10:00, “Authorize payment” only at 10:30.  
Description: “Package items should only occur after authorization … since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.”  
Hence payment must precede packaging; the reverse order is non-conforming.

Case 3  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  
Violation: “Ship order” is executed after “Cancel order”.  
Description: “Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfilment (such as … shipping)”.  
Shipping is therefore forbidden after cancellation.

Case 4  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
Conforming insufficient-inventory branch.

Case 5  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  
Missing “Package items” between authorizing and shipping.  
The normative text enumerates “Package items” as a mandatory step: “after the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment … Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with Ship order.”  
Thus the leap from payment to shipping is a deviation (incomplete branch).
