1.  What is “wrong” (or at least risky) in the POWL model


A.  LOOP anomaly between Evaluate (E) and Approve (P)  
   • Position 1 (“body”) = E, position 2 (“redo/return”) = P.  
   • Semantics of a process-tree LOOP: run child 1 once, then zero-or-more iterations of “child 2  child 1”.  
   • Consequences  
     – A claim may leave the loop right after the first E  **no approval at all**.  
     – If the loop iterates, the pattern is “… E  P  E  P  …”, so **P can occur many times** and also **E can follow P**, which is the reverse of the intended flow (Approve should be the last decision step).

B.  XOR anomaly on Notify Customer (N)  
   • The XOR has two children: N and a silent skip .  
   • A silent branch means the model explicitly allows **skipping customer notification**.

C.  Partial-order anomalies around Close Claim (C)  
   • Edges defined: R  A, A  loop, loop  xor, and A  C.  
   • Missing edge xor  C and the extra A  C edge mean:  
     – C is only required to happen after A, not after loop or XOR.  
     – Therefore **C can occur while E/P iterations are still running or even before any evaluation/approval happens**.  
   • Because StrictPartialOrder implies concurrency for pairs of nodes without an explicit edge, C can be interleaved with, or even precede, E, P, N.

D.  Resulting execution traces valid in the model but clearly undesirable in the business context  
   • R  A  C (claim closed immediately).  
   • R  A  E  C (closed before approval).  
   • R  A  E  P  E  P  …  C (multiple approvals).  
   • … plus any of the above with/without N because of the XOR-skip.


2.  Plausible hypotheses for why these anomalies exist


H1.  Partially implemented policy changes  
     • Business decided that “simple” claims may skip customer notification or formal approval, but this was only half-implemented in the model, leaving loops/edges that now apply to all claims.

H2.  Miscommunication between modeling team and operations  
     • Process analysts thought adjusters sometimes need to re-evaluate after a conditional approval, so they placed a LOOP, but operations actually run a one-time E  P sequence.

H3.  Technical import / conversion error  
     • The POWL was auto-generated from a BPMN or audit log; edges were lost or mis-mapped (e.g., the missing xor  C edge).

H4.  Intentional flexibility without guard-rails  
     • Modeler wanted to allow “fast-track” closures (A  C) for fraud attempts or duplicates, but forgot to add a predicate or data-based guard and therefore opened the path for every claim.

H5.  Inadequate modeling tool constraints  
     • The tool allowed adding the LOOP and XOR without enforcing post-conditions such as “C must be last activity”, so unintended freedom slipped in.


3.  How to test these hypotheses with the database


Below are concrete SQL sketches (PostgreSQL dialect).  
Assumptions:  
• `claim_events.activity` uses the same one-letter codes R, A, E, P, N, C.  
• Timestamps are reliable; activity names are unique per step.  
• We only look at completed claims (`C` present).

--------------------------------------------------
3.1  Claims closed without an approval (A  C, possibly with E but no P)
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
WITH last_states AS (
  SELECT
      claim_id,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_p,
      MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM last_states
WHERE has_c = 1        -- closed
  AND has_p = 0;       -- never approved
```

• If many rows appear, H1, H4, or tool-error (H3) is plausible.

--------------------------------------------------
3.2  Claims where C occurred before P or E
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
SELECT ce1.claim_id
FROM claim_events ce1                -- C
JOIN claim_events ce2                -- P
  ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
WHERE ce1.activity = 'C'
  AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;   -- closed earlier than approval
```

Add another join for E to detect C before any evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------
3.3  Multiple approvals for the same claim
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS approvals
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'P'
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY approvals DESC;
```

• High numbers support the “loop causes repeated P” observation.

--------------------------------------------------
3.4  Approvals without a matching evaluation (P but no E)
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'E') AS has_e,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'P') AS has_p
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id
FROM stats
WHERE has_p AND NOT has_e;
```

• Would indicate that the loop’s exit path (skip after E) or direct P insertion happened.

--------------------------------------------------
3.5  Frequency of skipped customer notification (N)
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'N') AS has_n,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'C') AS has_c
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN has_c AND NOT has_n THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float /
    NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN has_c THEN 1 ELSE 0 END),0) AS pct_closed_without_notify
FROM stats;
```

• A high percentage validates that the XOR skip branch is used often.

--------------------------------------------------
3.6  Durations of loops (EP cycles) – evidence of iterative re-work
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
SELECT claim_id,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS num_e,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS num_p,
       MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') AS first_e,
       MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS last_p
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') > 1
   OR COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 1;
```

• Long spans between first E and last P or a high count of loops may suggest unclear criteria for “done”, supporting H2.

--------------------------------------------------
3.7  Cross-checking model/tool versions (meta-data)
--------------------------------------------------
If you store deployment info (e.g., in `claim_events.additional_info`), extract distinct `model_version` to correlate anomalies with specific versions  evidence for H3 or H1.

--------------------------------------------------
3.8  Tie anomalies to adjusters or regions (organizational root-causes)
--------------------------------------------------
```sql
SELECT a.region,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ce.claim_id) AS premature_closures
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
  AND NOT EXISTS (   -- no approval before close
       SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id
         AND ce2.activity = 'P'
         AND ce2.timestamp < ce.timestamp)
GROUP BY a.region
ORDER BY premature_closures DESC;
```

• Clusters may reveal training or policy gaps.


4.  Next steps once data are extracted

1.  Quantify each anomaly’s frequency and financial impact (`claim_amount`).  
2.  Present findings to process owners: which paths are legitimate fast-tracks and which are real defects.  
3.  Refine the POWL / BPMN model:  
   • Replace LOOP with a sequence (E  P) plus an explicit re-open subprocess if re-evaluation is needed.  
   • Make Notify Customer obligatory unless a data condition (“fraud”, “duplicate”) is true.  
   • Add an edge xor  C (or, better, move C outside XOR) and remove the A  C shortcut, or guard it by a data-based exclusive gateway.  
4.  Enforce the corrected model in the workflow engine and build automated database checks (the SQL above in scheduled jobs) to prevent regression.

By first mining the event data with the queries above, you can confirm which of the hypotheses are actually occurring in real life, prioritize the most damaging deviations, and then redesign or repair the process accordingly.
