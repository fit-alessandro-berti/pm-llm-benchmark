# Model the loop for In-line Quality Check (IQC) followed by Assembly (AS)
# The loop means you do IQC, then AS, then either exit or repeat IQC and AS.
# Based on the log, AS is performed after each IQC within this loop structure.
# A simpler interpretation for this log might be that AS and IQC are linked
# in an iterative refinement. Let's model this as a loop where AS is the
# initial execution and (IQC, AS) is the part that can be repeated.
# However, the provided LOOP definition is *(A, B) meaning A, then either exit or B then A again.
# A more accurate model for (IQC, AS) repeating would be a loop of (IQC, AS).
# Let's adjust the interpretation of the log to fit the LOOP operator definition.
# It seems IQC is performed, then sometimes another IQC happens, sometimes Assembly follows.
# The log suggests a pattern where AS is performed, then potentially IQC, and if IQC is
# successful, you move on. If not, maybe more IQC and AS?
# The logs show AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> ...
# This suggests a loop where AS is the initial part and IQC is the part that can lead
# back to AS. So, the loop is AS then (IQC then AS again, or exit).
# Let's represent the repetitive AS and IQC as a loop node. The log suggests
# that AS always precedes IQC in the repeated sequence. The definition of
# LOOP is * (A, B) which is A, then either exit, or B then A again.
# If A=AS and B=IQC, this means AS, then either exit or IQC then AS again.
# This fits the observed pattern.

# Packaging must precede the Labeling choice
