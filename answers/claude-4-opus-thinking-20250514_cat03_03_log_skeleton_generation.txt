Looking at this order fulfillment process, I'll construct the Log Skeleton by analyzing the relationships between activities:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'D'),     # Every received order must be dispatched
        ('RO', 'IC'),    # Every received order must be invoiced
        ('PI', 'PO'),    # Every picked order must be packed
        ('GSL', 'D')     # Every shipping label generated leads to dispatch
    },
    
    'always_before': {
        ('RI', 'CA'),    # Check availability before reserving items
        ('PI', 'RI'),    # Reserve items before picking
        ('QC', 'PI'),    # Pick items before quality check
        ('PO', 'QC'),    # Quality check before packing
        ('GSL', 'PO'),   # Pack before generating shipping label
        ('D', 'GSL'),    # Generate shipping label before dispatch
        ('RP', 'IC'),    # Invoice before recording payment
        ('CA', 'RO'),    # Receive order before checking availability
        ('IC', 'D')      # Dispatch before invoicing
    },
    
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # After receiving order, check availability
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # After checking availability, reserve items
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # After reserving, pick items
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # After picking, perform quality check
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # After quality check, pack order
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # After packing, generate shipping label
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # After generating label, dispatch
        ('D', 'IC')      # After dispatch, invoice customer
    },
    
    'never_together': set(),  # All activities can co-exist in the same case
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},       # Receive order exactly once
        'CA': {1},       # Check availability exactly once
        'RI': {1},       # Reserve items exactly once
        'PI': {1},       # Pick items exactly once
        'QC': {1},       # Quality check exactly once
        'PO': {1},       # Pack order exactly once
        'GSL': {1},      # Generate shipping label exactly once
        'D': {1},        # Dispatch exactly once
        'IC': {1},       # Invoice customer exactly once
        'RP': {0, 1}     # Record payment 0 or 1 time (payment might be pending)
    },
    
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # Check availability directly after receiving order
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # Reserve directly after checking availability
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # Pick directly after reserving
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # Quality check directly after picking
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # Pack directly after quality check
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # Generate label directly after packing
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # Dispatch directly after generating label
        ('D', 'IC')      # Invoice directly after dispatch
    }
}
```

This Log Skeleton represents a sequential order fulfillment process where each step must be completed before moving to the next, with the exception that payment recording may or may not occur after invoicing.
