Justifications:

1. `Verify Documents`: This activity was renamed to differentiate the verification purposes related to handling an `Initiate Request` from a standard identity check at the beginning or re-verification following an account adjustment. 

2. `Call Customer`: My aim was to distinguish between scenarios where a call seeks additional details for verification versus those for resolving discrepancies.

3. `Submit Documents` (named replacing `Initiate Request` for the "Submit Documents" after verification): Represents the upfront step taken by the customer to upload the document directly after getting a call for details needing documents.

4. `Adjust Account`: The explicit terminology “Adjustment” was kept to highlight that the action performed here alters account details following a discrepancy or error verification call.

5. `Verify Adjustment` (subsequently used): This was added to signify that once an account adjustment is complete, there's usually a check done by the frontline agent interspersed with other activities.

6. `Begin Walk-in Request (C003)`, `Call for Return (C003)`, `Adjust Documents (C003)`, and `Re-verify Identity (C003)`: The prefix ‘Begin’ honors the walk-in nature of the process that differs from previous consultations via digital means, 'Call for' indicates actioning a follow-up call instead of the standard process calls. ‘Adjust Documents' and 'Reverify Identity' are specialized activities post-account adjustments/satisfactory document collection respectively.
