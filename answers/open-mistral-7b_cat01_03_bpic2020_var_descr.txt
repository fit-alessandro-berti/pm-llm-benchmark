Based on the provided data, it appears to be a process flow for handling employee declarations, which likely include expense reports or other types of requests. The process has several variants, each with different approval steps and potential outcomes. Here's a description of the process based on the data:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration is reviewed and approved or rejected by an administrator.
3. If the declaration is approved, it moves on to the next step. If it's rejected, the employee may have the opportunity to resubmit the declaration or make changes.
4. If the declaration is approved, it may be reviewed and approved or rejected by a budget owner, a pre-approver, or a supervisor. The specific approval steps and number of approvers depend on the variant of the process.
5. Once all approvals are obtained, the declaration is considered finalized.
6. At this point, the employee can request payment for the expenses or requests covered in the declaration.

There are several variants of this process, with different approval steps and outcomes. For example, some declarations may require approval by only an administrator, while others may require approval by multiple individuals, such as a budget owner, pre-approver, and supervisor. In some cases, the declaration may be rejected by an approver and the employee may have the opportunity to resubmit it or make changes. Additionally, there is a variant where the declaration is saved by the employee but not proceeded further.

The data also includes performance metrics for each variant of the process, which can be used to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the different approval steps and overall process.
