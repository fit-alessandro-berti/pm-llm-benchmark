### Rationale (how the added constraints reduce bias)
- **`existence(CreditScoreCheck)` + `response(StartApplication  CreditScoreCheck)`**: forces a consistent, *objective* assessment step in every case, reducing the chance that outcomes depend mainly on sensitive attributes.
- **`response(CheckApplicantRace/Gender/Age  ManualReview)`**: if the process accesses sensitive attributes, it must trigger **human oversight**, making biased automated/unchecked decisions less likely.
- **`response(ManualReview  BiasMitigationCheck)`**: ensures the extra scrutiny feeds into an explicit **bias-mitigation gate** (e.g., fairness checklist, policy compliance, disparate-impact screening).
- **`precedence(CreditScoreCheck  BiasMitigationCheck)` and `precedence(RequestAdditionalInfo  BiasMitigationCheck)`**: prevents running the mitigation gate too early; the gate happens only after the applicant’s substantive (non-sensitive) information is available.
- **`chainprecedence(BiasMitigationCheck  FinalDecision)`**: guarantees the **last step immediately before deciding** is the bias-mitigation gate, preventing bypass or last-minute biased judgment after the gate.
- **`nonchainsuccession(CheckApplicantRace/Gender/Age  FinalDecision)`**: blocks “knee-jerk” decisions right after seeing sensitive attributes, requiring intervening controls (manual review / mitigation gate).
- **`response(FinalDecision  ExplainDecision)`**: enforces **traceable justifications**, enabling audits to detect and correct discriminatory decision rationales.
