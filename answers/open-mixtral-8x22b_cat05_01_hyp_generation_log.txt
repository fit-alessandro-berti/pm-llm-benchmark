Based on the provided event log data, here are some anomalies and undesirable behaviors that can be identified:

1. **Out-of-order activities**: In case 1002, the "Confirm Shipment" activity (event_id 9) occurs before "Perform Credit Check" (event_id 11), which seems anomalous as credit checks are typically performed before confirming shipments.

   Hypothesis: This could be due to a system error, manual input mistake, or a policy violation where a shipment was confirmed without a credit check.

   SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.activity, oel1.timestamp, oel2.activity, oel2.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel1
   JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel1.event_id < oel2.event_id
   WHERE oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check';
   ```

2. **Missing activities**: In case 1003, the "Validate Stock" activity is missing, which is a crucial step to ensure the availability of goods before shipping.

   Hypothesis: This could be a system error, manual input mistake, or a policy violation where goods were shipped without validating the stock.

   SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel
   WHERE oel.activity NOT IN ('Validate Stock') AND oel.case_id IN (SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log WHERE activity = 'Ship Goods');
   ```

3. **Late activities**: In case 1003, the "Confirm Shipment" activity (event_id 19) occurs after "Ship Goods" (event_id 17), which seems anomalous as shipments should be confirmed before goods are shipped.

   Hypothesis: This could be a system error, manual input mistake, or a policy violation where the shipment was confirmed after the goods were already shipped.

   SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.activity, oel1.timestamp, oel2.activity, oel2.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel1
   JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel1.event_id < oel2.event_id
   WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment';
   ```

4. **Premature activities**: In case 1004, the "Receive Payment" activity (event_id 22) occurs before "Issue Invoice" (event_id 23), which seems anomalous as payments are typically received after invoices are issued.

   Hypothesis: This could be a system error, manual input mistake, or a policy violation where a payment was received before an invoice was issued.

   SQL Query:
   ```sql
   SELECT oel1.case_id, oel1.activity, oel1.timestamp, oel2.activity, oel2.timestamp
   FROM order_event_log oel1
   JOIN order_event_log oel2 ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id AND oel1.event_id < oel2.event_id
   WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice';
   ```
