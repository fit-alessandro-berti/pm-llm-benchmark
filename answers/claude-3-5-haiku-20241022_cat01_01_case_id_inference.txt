Based on the analysis of the event sequence, I can group the events into three distinct cases:

Case 1 (Patient ID: 45, Male, ER/Surgery):
- Event 1: Register patient (08:05:13)
- Event 4: Initial triage (08:10:50)
- Event 7: X-ray imaging (08:15:42)
- Event 12: Doctor consultation - diagnosis of hairline fracture (08:23:10)
- Event 15: Patient discharged (08:30:05)

Case 2 (Patient ID: 62, Female, ER):
- Event 2: Register patient (08:07:02)
- Event 5: Initial triage (08:12:29)
- Event 8: Lab test requested (08:16:10)
- Event 10: Lab test completed (08:20:27)
- Event 11: Doctor consultation - diagnosis of minor infection (08:22:54)
- Event 14: Prescription created (08:27:00)
- Event 17: Patient discharged (08:35:29)

Case 3 (Patient ID: 28, Male, Surgery):
- Event 3: Register patient (08:07:15)
- Event 6: Doctor consultation for scheduled knee surgery (08:13:00)
- Event 9: Surgery preparation (08:16:45)
- Event 13: Surgery performed - arthroscopy (08:25:19)
- Event 16: Recovery room (08:31:37)
- Event 18: Patient discharged (08:40:13)

Reasoning for Case Grouping:
1. Consistent patient age and gender across events
2. Logical progression of activities within a reasonable time frame
3. Coherent departmental flow
4. Matching patient attributes across related events

Key Observations:
- The events are interleaved but can be clearly separated
- Each case follows a distinct patient journey
- The events maintain a logical sequence within each case
- Time intervals between related events are reasonable

This approach demonstrates how event logs can be reconstructed into meaningful patient cases even without an explicit case identifier.
