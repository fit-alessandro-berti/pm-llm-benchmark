**Explanation of Transformation Logic:**

**Case Identification:**

The core principle for case identification in this log is based on the **primary application and document/window being interacted with**. A "case" represents a coherent period of work focused on a specific task involving a particular file or window.

- When the user `FOCUS`es on or `SWITCH`es to a new unique application/window combination that indicates the start of a new task, a new case is initiated.
- Events that follow within the same application/window context are grouped into that case until a `SWITCH` or `CLOSE` indicates a transition to a different task or the completion of the current one.
- The initial `FOCUS` on `Quarterly_Report.docx` is noted but doesn't immediately become a case until later, as the activity shifts to `Document1.docx`. The first case starts when the user focuses on `Document1.docx` at 09:00:00Z.
- Subsequent switches to the browser for email, the PDF reader, and Excel each represent the beginning of a new, distinct work item or case.
- When the user switches *back* to `Document1.docx`, it is treated as resuming the existing `Document_Editing_Document1` case.
- The final sequence focusing on `Quarterly_Report.docx` after `Document1.docx` is closed constitutes a new case focused on the report document.

Case IDs are generated by combining the primary activity type (e.g., `Document_Editing`, `Email_Handling`, `Document_Review`, `Spreadsheet_Editing`) and a identifier from the window title (e.g., `Document1`, `Annual_Meeting`, `Report_Draft`, `Budget`).

**Activity Naming:**

Raw system actions (`FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SWITCH`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `SAVE`, `HIGHLIGHT`, `CLOSE`) are translated into more meaningful, process-oriented activity names:

- `FOCUS` and the start of a sequence in a new window often indicate the start of a task, leading to activities like `Start Document Editing`, `Open Email Inbox`, `Open Document for Review`, or `Start Spreadsheet Editing`. If returning to an existing window, it's `Resume Document Editing`, etc.
- `TYPING` combined with the application/window context becomes `Draft Document Content`, `Draft Email Content`, or `Update Spreadsheet Content`.
- `SWITCH` events are typically absorbed into the activity they are switching *to*, defining the beginning of the new task's sequence. The `FromApp`/`FromWindow` are implicitly part of the preceding activity's end.
- `CLICK` actions are interpreted based on their likely user intent in the given application/window context (e.g., `Open Specific Email`, `Initiate Email Reply`, `Send Email`).
- `SCROLL` in an email or document is interpreted as `Read Email Content` or `Review Document Content`.
- `SAVE` is a standard activity name: `Save Document` or `Save Spreadsheet`.
- `HIGHLIGHT` in a PDF is specific to review, hence `Highlight Document Section`.
- `CLOSE` signifies the end of work on a specific window/document, translated to `Close Document` or `Close Spreadsheet`.

The goal is to create activities that represent the logical steps a user takes within a specific work item, rather than merely logging every low-level interaction. The application (`App`) and window title (`Window`) attributes are retained as additional information for each event, providing context for the activity.
