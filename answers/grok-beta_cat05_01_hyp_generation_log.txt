### Identifying Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors

Let's analyze the event logs for anomalies and undesirable behaviors:

1. **Out of Order Events:**
   - **Observation:** Case ID 1002 and 1003 show events out of the normal process flow. For example, "Confirm Shipment" or "Ship Goods" happens before "Perform Credit Check" or "Validate Stock."
   - **Hypothesis:** This could be due to:
     - **System Errors:** Errors in the logging or event recording system where events are not timestamped or logged in the correct sequence.
     - **Policy Violations:** Employees might be attempting to expedite the order process by skipping or rearranging steps, possibly to meet sales targets or reduce customer wait times.
     - **Training Issues:** Lack of training on the correct order of operations or misunderstanding of process flow.

   **SQL Query to Investigate:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, 
          LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity NOT IN ('Register Order', 'Receive Payment')
     AND LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) NOT IN (
       'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice'
     )
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

2. **Missing Steps:**
   - **Observation:** In Case ID 1004, the order was registered, payment received, invoice issued, but "Confirm Shipment" was marked as not scheduled (shipment_scheduled=N).
   - **Hypothesis:** 
     - **Process Bypassing:** Employees might bypass or forget steps due to high workload, system complexity, or lack of oversight.
     - **System Malfunction:** The system might not be correctly recording all events or there might be a bug where certain events are not logged.

   **SQL Query to Investigate:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity) as activities
   FROM order_event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) < 7;  -- Assuming there should be 7 steps
   ```

3. **Early or Late Events:**
   - **Observation:** Some events like "Confirm Shipment" occur very early or late in the process (e.g., case 1002 attempted early, case 1003 late confirmation).
   - **Hypothesis:**
     - **Operational Efficiency:** Efforts to optimize logistics might lead to these anomalies, but if not properly managed, it can cause confusion or errors.
     - **Communication Gaps:** Lack of communication between departments can result in premature or delayed actions.

   **SQL Query to Investigate:**
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp, 
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp - MIN(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)) / 3600 AS hours_from_start
   FROM order_event_log
   WHERE activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods')
   ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
   ```

### Further Analysis

- **Investigate Resource Behavior:**
  ```sql
  SELECT resource, role, department, COUNT(*) as total_events, 
         COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 1 END) as shipment_confirmations
  FROM order_event_log oel
  JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
  GROUP BY resource, role, department
  HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 1 END) > 0
  ORDER BY total_events DESC;
  ```
  This query can help identify if certain resources or roles are more prone to causing anomalies.

- **Check Order Value Correlation:**
  ```sql
  WITH event_count AS (
      SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count
      FROM order_event_log
      GROUP BY case_id
  )
  SELECT o.order_value, ec.event_count, COUNT(*) as num_orders
  FROM orders o
  JOIN event_count ec ON o.case_id = ec.case_id
  GROUP BY o.order_value, ec.event_count
  ORDER BY o.order_value, ec.event_count;
  ```
  This would help see if there's a correlation between order value and the number of steps taken in the process.

By running these queries, one can gather more insights into why these anomalies occur and propose solutions like process re-engineering, better training, or system upgrades to mitigate these issues.
