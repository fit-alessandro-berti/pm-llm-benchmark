Here's a breakdown of the anomalies and a corresponding SQL query for each case.

**Anomalies and Hypotheses:**

1.  **Anomaly:** The `R to P (Receive to Approve)` interval shows a remarkably low STDEV for the given duration.
    *   **Hypothesis:** This might indicate a potential issue in the process:
        *   **Hypothesis 1:** Automized approval of claims.
        *   **Hypothesis 2:** A standardized, and possibly accelerated, approval process for specific claim types that causes an unnaturally rigid timeline.
        *   **Hypothesis 3:** Data entry error that has led to incorrect timestamps.

2.  **Anomaly:** The `P to N (Approve to Notify)` interval shows an extremely long average delay and the largest STDEV.
    *   **Hypothesis:** This anomaly suggests one of the following:
        *   **Hypothesis 1:** Delays in notifying customers.
        *   **Hypothesis 2:** Some claims are being processed and notified very rapidly, leading to a wide range of values and a high STDEV.
        *   **Hypothesis 3:** Problems or inefficiencies in the notification process.
        *   **Hypothesis 4:** The notification is being delayed, potentially due to internal review or data quality checks.

3.  **Anomaly:** The `A to C (Assign to Close)` interval is relatively quick, with the lowest STDEV.
    *   **Hypothesis:**
        *   **Hypothesis 1:** This could indicate that some claims are being quickly closed without proper evaluation, a process that is not consistent across all claims.
        *   **Hypothesis 2:** The quick turnaround may be related to an accelerated closing process to make room for newer claims.

4.  **Anomaly:** The `E to N (Evaluate to Notify)` time is too short.
    *   **Hypothesis:**
        *   **Hypothesis 1:** It is possible that these activities are done quickly and in a fully automatized way.
        *   **Hypothesis 2:** There is a data quality issue, indicating that some activities are missed.

**Verification Queries:**

1.  **Anomaly: `R to P (Receive to Approve)`**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        e_r.timestamp AS receive_timestamp,
        e_p.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_p.timestamp - e_r.timestamp))) / 3600 AS time_diff_hours
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events e_r ON c.claim_id = e_r.claim_id AND e_r.activity = 'R'
    JOIN
        claim_events e_p ON c.claim_id = e_p.claim_id AND e_p.activity = 'P'
    WHERE (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_p.timestamp - e_r.timestamp))) / 3600 BETWEEN 20 AND 30; -- Hours between 20 and 30 - approximately the given average
    ```

    *   This query identifies claims where the difference between receiving and approval timestamps is close to the given average.

2.  **Anomaly: `P to N (Approve to Notify)`**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        e_p.timestamp AS approve_timestamp,
        e_n.timestamp AS notify_timestamp,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.timestamp - e_p.timestamp))) / 86400 AS time_diff_days
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events e_p ON c.claim_id = e_p.claim_id AND e_p.activity = 'P'
    JOIN
        claim_events e_n ON c.claim_id = e_n.claim_id AND e_n.activity = 'N'
    WHERE (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.timestamp - e_p.timestamp))) / 86400 > 14; -- Filter for claims taking > 14 days to notify
    ```

    *   This query aims to show claims with long delays between approval and notification.

3.  **Anomaly: `A to C (Assign to Close)`**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        e_a.timestamp AS assign_timestamp,
        e_c.timestamp AS close_timestamp,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_c.timestamp - e_a.timestamp))) / 3600 AS time_diff_hours,
        c.claim_type
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events e_a ON c.claim_id = e_a.claim_id AND e_a.activity = 'A'
    JOIN
        claim_events e_c ON c.claim_id = e_c.claim_id AND e_c.activity = 'C'
    WHERE (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_c.timestamp - e_a.timestamp))) / 3600 < 1; -- Time between assign and close less than 1 hour.
    ```

    *   This query focuses on claims where the closing happens shortly after assignment.

4.  **Anomaly: `E to N (Evaluate to Notify)`**

    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        e_e.timestamp AS evaluate_timestamp,
        e_n.timestamp AS notify_timestamp,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.timestamp - e_e.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events e_e ON c.claim_id = e_e.claim_id AND e_e.activity = 'E'
    JOIN
        claim_events e_n ON c.claim_id = e_n.claim_id AND e_n.activity = 'N'
    WHERE (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.timestamp - e_e.timestamp))) < 180 ; -- Time between evaluate and notify < 3 minutes
    ```

    *   This query checks for the cases where the time difference between Evaluate and Notify is under 3 minutes.
