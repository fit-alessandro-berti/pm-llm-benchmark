Great — let’s carefully analyze the provided event log against the standard **Procure-to-Pay (P2P)** lifecycle, which usually follows:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**   
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**   
3. **Issue Purchase Order**   
4. **Receive Goods**   
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**   
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (3-way match: PO, goods receipt, invoice)   
7. **Release Payment**   
8. **Close Case**  

This is the "happy path" in most organizations. Now, let’s spot anomalies in the log.

---

###  Case 1001 (Normal)
Sequence: requisition  approval  PO  goods receipt  invoice  match  payment  close.  
- **This case is perfectly compliant**. The order is logical and aligns with the standard P2P flow.  
- **No anomaly here.**

---

###  Case 1002 (Multiple Anomalies)
Sequence: requisition  **PO before approval**  invoice  **payment before approval**  **payment before goods receipt**  goods receipt  match  close.  

**Problems:**
1. **PO issued before requisition approval**  
   - Risk: Orders are committed without appropriate budgetary or managerial approval.  
   - Typically, requisitions must be approved *before* converting to a purchase order.

2. **Payment released before goods receipt**  
   - Risk: The company pays the vendor before ensuring goods or services were delivered. This exposes the firm to fraud, errors, or disputes.

3. **Payment released before requisition approval**  
   - Extremely risky. Payments should never bypass internal approval controls.

4. **Invoice not matched before payment**  
   - Standard practice requires 3-way matching before releasing funds. Here, payment was done prior to the match step, which undermines internal controls.

 **Summary:** This case shows serious **internal control violations** — early PO creation, premature payment, and payments without validation. This would be considered a high-risk anomaly.

###  Case 1003 (Wrong Order of Later Steps)
Sequence: requisition  approval  PO  **payment before invoice and receipt**  invoice  goods receipt  match  close.  

**Problems:**
1. **Payment released before invoice received**  
   - Payment should always be based on a legitimate invoice. This suggests bypassing accounts payable controls.

2. **Payment released before goods receipt**  
   - Paying before receiving goods poses financial control risks. Vendor could be overpaid or fail to deliver.

 **Summary:** This case also violates process order by making **prepayments without valid documentation**. Unless this was a legitimate prepayment contractually agreed (common for some vendors), it is an anomaly and high compliance risk.

---

###  Case 1004 (Process Steps Mixed Up)
Sequence: requisition  approval  **goods receipt before PO**  PO  invoice  match  payment  close.  

**Problems:**
1. **Goods received before PO issuance**  
   - Standard P2P requires an approved PO before vendors supply goods. Receiving goods without a PO implies poor purchase planning or off-contract buying.  
   - This indicates a “maverick buying” scenario, where employees may have ordered goods informally and only later created documentation to justify it.

 **Summary:** This case breaks the logical ordering — receiving goods before issuing a purchase order. This is operationally risky and can cause reconciliation difficulties.

##  Overall Findings

- **Case 1001:**  Compliant, no anomaly.  
- **Case 1002:**  Multiple anomalies: PO before approval, payment before goods receipt, payment before approval, invoice matching after payment. Major control weaknesses.  
- **Case 1003:**  Payment before invoice and before goods receipt. High financial risk, unless explicitly structured as a prepayment agreement.  
- **Case 1004:**  Goods receipt before PO issuance. Sign of maverick or unplanned buying.

##  Why Problematic?
Across the anomalous cases, the issues boil down to:
1. **Control Risks:** Payments without approval, invoice match, or goods receipt undermine financial integrity.  
2. **Compliance Risks:** Regulatory frameworks (e.g., SOX, internal audit) demand proper sequencing of approvals and payments.  
3. **Operational Risks:** Receiving goods without a PO or approving payments prematurely can lead to fraud, duplicate payments, or disputes with suppliers.  
4. **Audit Trail Integrity:** Event orders that don’t align with documented approvals weaken auditability and may fail external or internal audits.

---

 In summary: **Case 1001 is clean**. **Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 show sequencing anomalies that indicate weak process controls.**

Would you like me to also **visualize the correct "ideal” P2P sequence and then annotate where each case deviates** (like a process map with deviations highlighted)? This could make the anomalies very clear at a glance.
