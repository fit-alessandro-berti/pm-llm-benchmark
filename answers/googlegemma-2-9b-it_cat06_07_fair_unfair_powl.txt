## POWL Models for GlobalTeq Solutions Hiring Process

Here are two POWL models representing the GlobalTeq Solutions hiring process, one with and one without potential bias:

**1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="Receive Application")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="Data Completeness Check")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="Request More Info")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="Skill Assessment")

# XOR branch based on affiliation
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="Community Affiliation Check")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="Standard Cultural Fit Check")

ManagerialReview = Transition(label="Managerial Review")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="Final Decision")

loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
xor1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop1, SkillAssessment, xor1, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop1)
root.order.add_edge(loop1, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor1)
root.order.add_edge(xor1, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

**Explanation:**

- The process starts with "ReceiveApplication," moving to a loop (`loop1`) for data completeness checks.
- After the loop, applicants proceed to "SkillAssessment."
-  Here, an XOR branch emerges (`xor1`).
    - One path goes to "StandardCulturalFitCheck"  for regular evaluation.
    - The other path leads to "CommunityAffiliationCheck," potentially giving preferential treatment.
- Based on the outcome of the cultural fit check, the workflow proceeds to "ManagerialReview" and finally "FinalDecision."

**2. POWL Model Without Unfairness:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="Receive Application")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="Data Completeness Check")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="Request More Info")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="Skill Assessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="Cultural Fit Check")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="Managerial Review")

loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop1, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop1)
root.order.add_edge(loop1, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)


```

**Explanation:**


- The process follows a similar structure but removes the biased branch.
- After the skill assessment, all applicants proceed directly to "CulturalFitCheck" without any distinction based on affiliations.
- The rest of the process remains consistent, leading to the final "FinalDecision."



By eliminating the XOR branch based on community affiliation in the second POWL model, the potential for unfair bias during the cultural fit evaluation is removed. All applicants are assessed equally, promoting a fairer and more transparent hiring process.
