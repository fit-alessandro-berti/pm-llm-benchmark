Sure, here's the opposite concept and two more general concepts for each of the listed process mining concepts:

1. Automated Process Discovery:	The opposite concept could be "Manual Process Discovery," where the process analyst manually identifies and documents process activities, instead of using automated tools to discover and analyze processes.
2. Predictive Monitoring:	A more general concept is "Process Analytics," which covers a wider range of methods and techniques used to analyze and optimize business processes. Process analytics includes both real-time and historical analysis, as well as predictive monitoring.
3. Bottom-up Discovery:	The opposite concept could be "Top-down Discovery," where the process analyst starts from the highest level of the process hierarchy and works their way down to the finer details, rather than starting with individual activities and building up to the higher levels.
4. Process Simulation:	A more general concept is "Business Process Management (BPM)," which encompasses a range of activities, methods, and tools used to design, model, analyze, optimize, and implement business processes. Process simulation is just one aspect of BPM.
5. Process Efficiency:	The opposite concept could be "Process Inefficiency," where processes are not optimized for efficiency, leading to wasted resources, bottlenecks, and poor performance.
6. Real-time Monitoring:	A more general concept is "Process Performance Management," which includes a broader set of techniques and tools used to monitor, analyze, and optimize process performance in real-time and historically. Real-time monitoring is just one component of process performance management.
