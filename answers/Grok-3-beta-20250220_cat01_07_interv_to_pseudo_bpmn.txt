Below is a structured BPMN-like textual process model based on the provided interview transcripts for the invoice approval process. The model consolidates the perspectives of the Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), and Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen). It captures the key activities, sequence flow, decision points, roles, artifacts, and exceptions as described. Ambiguities or variations are noted where applicable.

### BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

#### Start Event
- **Event:** Invoice Received  
  - **Description:** The process begins when an invoice is received, typically via email, by the Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk.  
  - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice (email attachment or document)

---

#### Activities and Sequence Flow

1. **Task: Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number**

   - **Description:** The AP Clerk verifies if the invoice includes a valid PO number.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice  
   - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Gateway 1.

2. **Gateway 1: Valid PO Number Present?**  
   - **Type:** Exclusive Gateway (XOR)  
   - **Condition:**  
     - **Yes:** Invoice has a valid PO number → Proceed to Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System.

3. **Task: Request PO from Supplier**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
   - **Description:** The AP Clerk sends the invoice back to the supplier requesting a PO number. Alternatively, the Supplier Relationship Manager may contact the supplier to resolve this.  
   - **Artifact/Output:** Email to supplier  
   - **Sequence Flow:** Loops back to Start Event once supplier provides a revised invoice with a PO number (Exception Path 1).  

4. **Task: Log Invoice in Accounting System**

   - **Description:** The AP Clerk enters the invoice details into the accounting system.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice  
   - **Artifact/Output:** Invoice Record (system entry)  
   - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Task: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation.

5. **Task: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Description:** The AP Clerk sends the logged invoice to the Purchasing Department to confirm receipt of goods/services.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice Record

6. **Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer compares the invoice against the PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges) and confirms receipt of goods/services.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice Record, Purchase Order (PO)  
   - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Gateway 2.

7. **Gateway 2: Invoice Matches PO?**  
   - **Type:** Exclusive Gateway (XOR)  
   - **Condition:**  
     - **Yes:** Invoice matches PO details → Proceed to Task: Send Confirmation to AP.  
     - **No:** Discrepancies found (e.g., pricing, quantities) → Proceed to Task: Resolve Discrepancy.

8. **Task: Resolve Discrepancy**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan), Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), or Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
   - **Description:** The Purchasing Officer contacts the supplier for clarification or a corrected invoice, or the AP Clerk emails Purchasing for further details. The Supplier Relationship Manager may intervene to verify contract terms.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice, PO, Contract (if applicable)  
   - **Artifact/Output:** Revised Invoice (if supplier corrects it) or Clarification Notes  
   - **Sequence Flow:**  
     - If resolved → Loops back to Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details.  
     - If unresolved → Proceeds to Task: Escalate to Supervisor (Exception Path 2).

9. **Task: Escalate to Supervisor**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
   - **Description:** The AP Supervisor steps in to resolve complex discrepancies (e.g., missing PO for informal services) by coordinating with departments or suppliers. May involve creating a retrospective PO.  
   - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice, PO (if available), Clarification Notes  
   - **Artifact/Output:** Retrospective PO or Rejection Decision  
   - **Sequence Flow:**  
     - If resolved → Loops back to Task: Confirm Receipt and Match Details.  
     - If rejected → Proceeds to End Event: Invoice Rejected (Exception Path 3).

10. **Task: Send Confirmation to AP**  
    - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
    - **Description:** Purchasing sends confirmation to AP that the invoice matches the PO and goods/services were received.  
    - **Artifact/Output:** Confirmation Email  
    - **Sequence Flow:** Proceeds to Task: Match Invoice in System.

11. **Task: Match Invoice in System**  
    - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
    - **Description:** The AP Clerk matches the invoice line items against the PO in the accounting system.  
    - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice Record, PO, Confirmation Email

    - **Description:** The Manager reviews the invoice details, PO, and confirmation in the system and either approves or rejects it.  
    - **Artifact/Input:** Invoice Record, PO, Confirmation Email

---

#### Roles/Participants
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Checks PO, logs invoice, matches details, schedules payment.  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt and matches PO details.  
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Approves or rejects the invoice.  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles exceptions and escalations.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Resolves supplier-related issues.  
- **Accounting System:** Automates logging, matching, and notifications.

---

#### Artifacts
- **Inputs:** Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Contract (if applicable), Confirmation Email, Approval Request Email  
- **Outputs:** Invoice Record, Email to Supplier, Confirmation Email, Retrospective PO, Payment Schedule Entry, Rejection Notification

---

#### Exceptions and Variations
1. **Exception Path 1: Missing PO Number**  
   - Invoice returned to supplier; process restarts with revised invoice.  
2. **Exception Path 2: Unresolved Discrepancy**  
   - Escalation to AP Supervisor; may result in retrospective PO or rejection.  
3. **Exception Path 3: Supervisor Rejects Invoice**  
   - Invoice rejected after escalation if issues persist.  
4. **Exception Path 4: Manager Rejects or Holds Invoice**  
   - Loops back for investigation; may lead to rejection if unresolved.  
5. **Variation:** In rare cases (noted by Rita), invoices for informal services lack a PO initially, requiring a retrospective PO.

---

### Notes on Ambiguities
- **Supplier Contact:** It’s unclear whether the AP Clerk, Purchasing Officer, or Supplier Relationship Manager primarily contacts the supplier for discrepancies; the model assumes shared responsibility with escalation to Karen for complex cases.  
- **Retrospective PO Process:** The creation of a retrospective PO is mentioned but not detailed; it’s assumed to re-enter the normal flow after creation.  
- **Manager Rejection Frequency:** Carlos notes rejections are rare (once every couple of months), suggesting this is an exception rather than a frequent branch.

This textual model provides a clear, logical representation of the invoice approval process that can be visualized as a BPMN diagram. Each task, gateway, and flow is explicitly defined, with roles and artifacts included where relevant, making it suitable for conversion into a graphical format.
