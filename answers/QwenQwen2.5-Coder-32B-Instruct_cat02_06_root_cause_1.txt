### Analysis of Support Ticket Resolution Times

First, let's compute the total resolution time for each ticket by calculating the difference between the "Receive Ticket" and "Close Ticket" timestamps.

**Total Resolution Times:**

| Case ID | Receive Ticket      | Close Ticket      | Total Resolution Time (Hours) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00    | 2024-03-01 10:15  | 2.25                         |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05    | 2024-03-02 09:15  | 25.1667 (approx. 25.17)        |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10    | 2024-03-01 09:30  | 1.333 (approx. 1.33)           |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20    | 2024-03-02 08:30  | 24.1667 (approx. 24.17)        |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25    | 2024-03-03 09:30  | 49.75                        |

### Identification of Significantly Longer Cases
- **Case 105**: Total Resolution Time = ~49.75 hours
- **Case 102**: Total Resolution Time = ~25.17 hours
- **Case 104**: Total Resolution Time = ~24.17 hours

Cases 105, 102, and 104 have significantly longer total resolution times compared to others.

### Detailed Analysis of Performance Issues

#### Case 105

- **Receive Ticket**: 2024-03-01 08:25
- **Triage Ticket**: 2024-03-01 08:35 (10 minutes)
- **Assign to Level-1 Agent**: 2024-03-01 09:00 (25 minutes)
- **Investigate Issue**: 2024-03-01 09:10 (10 minutes)
- **Escalate to Level-2 Agent**: 2024-03-01 10:00 (50 minutes)
- **Investigate Issue**: 2024-03-02 14:00 (28 hours, 4 hours)
- **Resolve Ticket**: 2024-03-03 09:00 (19 hours)
- **Close Ticket**: 2024-03-03 09:30

**Observations:**
- Long delay of **28 hours** between the first investigation and escalation to Level-2 Agent.
- Further delay of **19 hours** from the second investigation to resolving the ticket.

#### Case 102

- **Receive Ticket**: 2024-03-01 08:05
- **Triage Ticket**: 2024-03-01 08:30 (25 minutes)
- **Assign to Level-1 Agent**: 2024-03-01 09:00 (30 minutes)
- **Escalate to Level-2 Agent**: 2024-03-01 11:30 (2 hours, 30 minutes)
- **Investigate Issue**: 2024-03-01 14:00 (2 hours, 30 minutes)
- **Resolve Ticket**: 2024-03-02 09:00 (17 hours, 30 minutes)
- **Close Ticket**: 2024-03-02 09:15

**Observations:**
- Long delay between assigned to Level-1 Agent and escalation to Level-2 Agent.
- Significant waiting time of **17 hours and 30 minutes** between the investigation by Level-2 Agent and resolving the ticket.

#### Case 104

- **Receive Ticket**: 2024-03-01 08:20
- **Triage Ticket**: 2024-03-01 09:00 (40 minutes)
- **Assign to Level-1 Agent**: 2024-03-01 09:30 (30 minutes)
- **Investigate Issue**: 2024-03-01 13:00 (3 hours, 30 minutes)
- **Resolve Ticket**: 2024-03-02 08:00 (17 hours)
- **Close Ticket**: 2024-03-02 08:30

**Observations:**
- Delay of **3 hours and 30 minutes** between assigned to Level-1 Agent and investigation.
- Significantly long delay of **17 hours** between investigation and resolving the ticket.

### Potential Root Causes

1. **Escalations**: High delays in cases that require escalation to Level-2. This suggests inefficiencies or bottlenecks in handling escalated tickets.
2. **Waiting Times Between Activities**: Significant waiting times occur at multiple stages, particularly between investigation and resolution actions.
3. **Complexity of Investigations**: Issues that require escalation or further investigation after initial analysis might indicate more complex problems, leading to longer resolution times.

### Recommendations

#### General Improvements

1. **Prioritize Escalations**: Develop a faster escalation process. Prioritize Level-2 escalations and ensure Level-2 agents are readily available.
2. **Investigation Streamlining**: Improve communication channels between Level-1 and Level-2 agents for quicker handoffs and investigations of complex issues.
3. **Agent Training**: Enhance training for Level-1 agents to better identify and handle complex issues, reducing the need for escalation.

#### Specific Actions

- **Reduce Investigation-Resolution Gap**: Implement regular follow-ups after issue investigation to keep tickets moving efficiently.
- **Dedicated Escalation Team**: Form a dedicated escalation team that can take ownership of escalated tickets immediately.
- **Automate Escalation Notifications**: Automate alerts and notifications to streamline the escalation process.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Develop SOPs for handling different types of issues to ensure uniformity and efficiency.

By addressing these delays and bottle-necks, the customer support team can improve overall efficiency and reduce the average time to resolve tickets.
