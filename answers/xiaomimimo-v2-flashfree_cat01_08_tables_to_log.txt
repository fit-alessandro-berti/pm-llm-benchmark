Here is the comprehensive event log integrating all provided tables.

### Assumptions and Transformations

1.  **Order Creation**: Every `order_id` has a single "Order Created" event based on the `order_date`.
2.  **Item Picking**: Each item in the `Order Lines` table results in a separate "Item Picked" event.
    *   *Note*: If the process requires a single "Order Picked" event, one could group by `order_id` and `item_picking_date`. However, granular events are preferred for process mining to detect bottlenecks or partial picking. I have included the specific `item_id` in the attributes.
3.  **Delivery**: Since an order can have multiple deliveries (split shipments), each row in the `Delivery` table creates two distinct events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
4.  **Invoicing**: Each row in the `Invoice` table creates an "Invoice Issued" event.
5.  **Payments**: Each row in the `Payments` table creates a "Payment Received" event.
6.  **Linking**:
    *   Delivery is linked directly to `order_id`.
    *   Invoices are linked to `order_id`.
    *   Payments are linked to `order_id` via the `invoice_id` (matching the invoice table's `order_id`).
7.  **Chronology**: The events are sorted by `order_id` and then by `Timestamp`.
8.  **Attributes**: I have merged information from the `Resources` table to provide human-readable names for Sales Persons, Warehouse Staff, Carriers, and Billing Clerks in the "Resource" column.
