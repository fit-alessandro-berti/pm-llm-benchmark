# Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

## 1. Identifying Cases with Long Resolution Times

Let's calculate the total resolution time for each case:

- **Case 101**: 2h 15m (Received: 08:00, Closed: 10:15)
- **Case 102**: 16h 10m (Received: 08:05, Closed: 09:15 next day)
- **Case 103**: 1h 20m (Received: 08:10, Closed: 09:30)
- **Case 104**: 21h 10m (Received: 08:20, Closed: 08:30 next day + 1 day)
- **Case 105**: 34h 5m (Received: 08:25, Closed: 09:30 two days later)

**Average resolution time: ~14 hours**

**Cases with significantly longer resolution times:**
- **Case 102**: 16h 10m (16% longer than average)
- **Case 104**: 21h 10m (50% longer than average)
- **Case 105**: 34h 5m (142% longer than average)

## 2. Determining Root Causes of Performance Issues

### Common Factors in Delayed Cases

#### Escalations
- **Case 102** and **Case 105** both involved escalations to Level-2 agents.
- Escalations increased resolution time by 2-3 days in these cases.
- Escalation appears to be a significant contributor to delays.

#### Waiting Times Between Activities
Let's examine waiting times in the delayed cases:

**Case 102 (16h 10m):**
- 25 minutes between "Receive Ticket" and "Triage Ticket"
- 30 minutes between "Triage Ticket" and "Assign to Level-1 Agent"
- **3 hours** between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent"
- **2h 30m** between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and "Investigate Issue"
- 1h between "Resolve Ticket" and "Close Ticket"

**Case 104 (21h 10m):**
- 10 minutes between "Receive Ticket" and "Triage Ticket"
- **30 minutes** between "Triage Ticket" and "Assign to Level-1 Agent"
- **5h 30m** between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue"
- **11h** between "Investigate Issue" and "Resolve Ticket"
- **30 minutes** between "Resolve Ticket" and "Close Ticket"

**Case 105 (34h 5m):**
- 10 minutes between "Receive Ticket" and "Triage Ticket"
- 20 minutes between "Triage Ticket" and "Assign to Level-1 Agent"
- **10 minutes** between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue"
- **49 minutes** between "Investigate Issue" and "Escalate to Level-2 Agent"
- **28h 55m** between "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" and "Resolve Ticket"
- **30 minutes** between "Resolve Ticket" and "Close Ticket"

Key patterns:
- **Escalations significantly increase resolution time**, with Case 105 showing a 28.9-hour delay between escalation and resolution.
- **Long waiting times between assignment and investigation** (up to 5h 30m in Case 104).
- **Extended time between escalation and resolution** (up to 29 hours in Case 105).

## 3. Insights and Recommendations

### Key Findings
1. **Escalations are a major bottleneck**: Cases that required escalation took significantly longer to resolve, often due to long waiting times in the escalation queue.
2. **Delays in investigation**: Cases showed significant delays between assignment and actual investigation (up to 5.5 hours).
3. **Post-escalation delays**: Cases that were escalated often faced long waiting periods before being addressed by Level-2 agents.

### Recommendations

1. **Improve Escalation Process Efficiency**
   - Implement a system for **tracking and prioritizing escalated tickets** to reduce waiting times.
   - Consider **dedicated escalation queues** with guaranteed SLAs for Level-2 agent response times.

2. **Reduce Time Between Assignment and Investigation**
   - Monitor and reduce the time between agent assignment and when the agent begins working on the ticket.
   - Implement **real-time notifications** to agents when they are assigned tickets.

3. **Enhance Level-1 Agent Capabilities**
   - Provide **better training or tools** to Level-1 agents to handle more complex issues without escalation.
   - Consider **dynamic assignment** based on agent expertise and current workload.

4. **Implement Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Set up **SLA alerts** for tickets that exceed expected resolution times at each stage.
   - Use **dashboards** to monitor key performance indicators like time-to-triage, time-to-investigate, and time-to-resolution.

5. **Standardize Response Times**
   - Establish and document **standard operating procedures** for each step in the support process.
   - Set **clear expectations** for each activity's maximum allowable time.

By addressing these bottlenecks, particularly the escalation process and the time between assignment and investigation, the organization can significantly improve its overall ticket resolution efficiency and customer satisfaction.
