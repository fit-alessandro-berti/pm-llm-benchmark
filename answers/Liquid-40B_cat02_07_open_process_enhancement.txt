Process enhancement is a concept in process mining that involves improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of a process. It is a proactive approach that aims to identify areas of improvement and implement changes to optimize the process.

Process discovery, on the other hand, is a passive approach that involves analyzing the data from a process to understand how it is currently being executed. It aims to discover the actual process flow, identify bottlenecks, and understand the behavior of the process.

Conformance checking is a method used to compare the actual process execution with the expected process model. It aims to identify deviations between the actual process and the expected process, and to understand why these deviations occur.

The main difference between process enhancement and process discovery/conformance checking is the focus. Process discovery and conformance checking are focused on understanding the current state of the process, while process enhancement is focused on improving the process. Process enhancement uses the insights gained from process discovery and conformance checking to identify areas of improvement and implement changes to optimize the process.
