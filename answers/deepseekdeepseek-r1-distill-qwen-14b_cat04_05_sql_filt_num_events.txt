Okay, so I need to write a DuckDB SQL query that filters out cases with more than six events. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I know that each case is identified by a `case_id`, and each case has multiple events. The goal is to exclude any case that has more than six events. So, my first thought is to count the number of events per `case_id`.

I remember that in SQL, to count events, I can use the `COUNT()` function. Since I want to count the number of events per case, I should group by `case_id`. So something like `GROUP BY case_id` would be needed.

Next, I need to filter out the cases where the count is greater than six. I can use a `HAVING` clause for this because it applies to aggregated functions. So, I'll add `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` to include only those cases with six or fewer events.

But wait, I don't just want to count the events; I need to return all the events from the cases that meet this condition. So, I can't just stop at the count; I need to include all the rows from those cases.

I recall that using a Common Table Expression (CTE) might help here. A CTE can be used to create a temporary result set that I can then query. So, I'll create a CTE named `filtered_cases` that includes `case_id` and the count of events. In this CTE, I'll filter out cases where the count is more than six.

After creating the CTE, I need to join it back with the original `event_log` table to get all the events from the cases that are included in the CTE. I'll use a `JOIN` on `case_id` to ensure I get all relevant events.

Putting it all together, the query will first create the CTE with the filtered cases, then join it with the original table to retrieve all the events from those cases.

I should also make sure that the syntax is correct for DuckDB. I'll structure the query with the CTE, then use a `WITH` clause followed by the main `SELECT` statement that joins the CTE with the event log.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create a CTE named `filtered_cases` that counts the number of events per `case_id` and filters out cases with more than six events.
2. In the main query, join `event_log` with `filtered_cases` on `case_id` to get all events from the filtered cases.
3. Select all necessary columns from `event_log`.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll write the SQL query accordingly.

To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases from an event log that contain more than six events and return all events from the remaining cases. 

### Approach
1. **Count Events per Case**: First, we count the number of events for each `case_id`.
2. **Filter Cases**: We then filter out any `case_id` that has more than six events.
3. **Retrieve Events**: Finally, we retrieve all events from the cases that have six or fewer events.

This approach efficiently narrows down the cases we are interested in and then fetches all relevant events from those cases.

### Solution Code

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc
ON 
    el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation
- **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `filtered_cases` CTE is used to count the number of events per `case_id` and filter out cases with more than six events.
- **Join Operation**: The main query joins the original `event_log` table with the `filtered_cases` CTE to retrieve all events from the cases that meet the criteria.
- **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently filters cases and retrieves events in a single query, ensuring that we only process relevant data.
