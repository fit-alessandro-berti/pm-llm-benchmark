Below is a detailed analysis based on the given event log.

**Step 1: Identifying Cases with Longer Resolution Times**

First, let’s calculate the total time each case took from "Receive Ticket" (first event) to "Close Ticket" (last event):

- **Case 101:**  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:00 (Receive Ticket)  
  - End: 2024-03-01 10:15 (Close Ticket)  
  - Total Duration: About 2 hours 15 minutes
  
- **Case 102:**  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:05 (Receive Ticket)  
  - End: 2024-03-02 09:15 (Close Ticket)  
  - Total Duration: Approximately 25 hours 10 minutes
  
- **Case 103:**  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:10 (Receive Ticket)  
  - End: 2024-03-01 09:30 (Close Ticket)  
  - Total Duration: About 1 hour 20 minutes
  
- **Case 104:**  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:20 (Receive Ticket)  
  - End: 2024-03-02 08:30 (Close Ticket)  
  - Total Duration: Approximately 24 hours 10 minutes
  
- **Case 105:**  
  - Start: 2024-03-01 08:25 (Receive Ticket)  
  - End: 2024-03-03 09:30 (Close Ticket)  
  - Total Duration: Approximately 49 hours 5 minutes

**Summary of Durations:**  
- Very short/normal durations: **Case 101** (~2.25 hours), **Case 103** (~1.3 hours)  
- Significantly longer durations: **Case 102** (~25 hours), **Case 104** (~24 hours), **Case 105** (~49 hours)

From this, we see that Cases 102, 104, and 105 are the outliers with substantially longer total resolution times.

**Step 2: Determining Potential Root Causes**

By comparing the cases that took longer with those that closed quickly, several patterns emerge:

1. **Presence of Escalations:**  
   - **Case 102:** Involves an escalation to Level-2 Agent at 11:30 on the first day, and the ticket isn’t resolved until the next morning.  
   - **Case 104:** No explicit escalation event is labeled, but the long delay occurs before the final resolution. The "Investigate Issue" step is done at 13:00 on the first day, but "Resolve Ticket" only happens the next day at 08:00, indicating a long wait after investigation.  
   - **Case 105:** Explicitly escalated to Level-2 at 10:00 on the first day, and then the next investigation by Level-2 only starts at 14:00 the following day (a huge delay). The ticket is not resolved until the day after that.

   In contrast, the quicker cases (101 and 103) do not have escalations beyond Level-1 and move smoothly through the resolution steps.

2. **Extended Waiting Times Between Activities:**  
   - **Case 102:**  
     - Assigned to Level-1 at 09:00, escalated to Level-2 at 11:30, but the next "Investigate Issue" by Level-2 only starts at 14:00, indicating a 2.5-hour lag waiting for the L2 agent to pick it up. After investigation, it still takes until the following day (09:00) to resolve the ticket—an overnight delay.
   
   - **Case 104:**  
     - After the ticket is assigned to Level-1 at 09:30 and investigated at 13:00 on the same day, the next step (resolve) only occurs the next day at 08:00, implying a long gap between investigation and resolution.
   
   - **Case 105:**  
     - After escalation at 10:00 on Day 1, the next "Investigate Issue" (presumably by Level-2) does not happen until 14:00 on Day 2, which is a delay of 28 hours. The final resolution then happens on Day 3 at 09:00. This suggests severe backlog or resource constraints at Level-2.

3. **Comparing Non-Delayed Cases:**  
   - **Case 101 and Case 103** proceed through each step swiftly without any significant downtime. The activities follow one another within short intervals, and no escalation beyond Level-1 is recorded. This suggests that the standard path (receive → triage → assign to L1 → investigate → resolve → close) can be done quickly if all parties are available and no specialized intervention is needed.

**Step 3: Explaining the Impact and Proposing Recommendations**

**Impact of Identified Factors on Increased Cycle Times:**

- **Escalations:**  
  When tickets require Level-2 intervention, it introduces dependence on a potentially more limited resource pool or specialized team. Delays in starting the L2 investigation or in finalizing resolution once the issue is known can cause significant extensions in total cycle time.

- **Long Waiting Periods Between Activities:**  
  Even after being assigned to Level-1 or escalated to Level-2, there are substantial idle periods before the next action is taken. These waiting times could be due to agent workload, inefficient ticket routing, or unclear prioritization rules.

**Recommendations to Address Performance Bottlenecks:**

1. **Increase Level-2 Team Capacity or Availability:**  
   If L2 resources are scarce or heavily burdened, increasing staff or allocating time slots for escalated tickets could reduce waiting times.

2. **Improve Triage and Escalation Criteria:**  
   Better upfront triaging might reduce unnecessary escalations. Providing additional training or authority to Level-1 agents to handle slightly more complex issues could prevent tickets from entering lengthy L2 queues.

3. **Implement SLA and Priority Management:**  
   Setting service-level agreements for each step, especially post-escalation, ensures that tickets aren’t left in the queue for extended periods. Automated reminders or alerts can prompt agents to pick up stalled tickets.

4. **Optimize Workflow Scheduling:**  
   Assess work shifts and agent availability to ensure tickets requiring Level-2 expertise are addressed promptly. Implementing tools that track and forecast workloads could help in balancing workloads more evenly.

5. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loops:**  
   Regularly review metrics like average waiting time between activities, volume of escalations, and resolution times. Feedback from agents and customers can guide process refinements.

**In Conclusion:**

The primary factors causing delays in Cases 102, 104, and 105 revolve around escalations to Level-2 agents and the subsequent long waiting periods before investigative or resolution activities occur. By improving triage procedures, increasing the availability or efficiency of specialized teams, and establishing clearer priority rules and SLAs, the overall resolution times can be significantly reduced.
