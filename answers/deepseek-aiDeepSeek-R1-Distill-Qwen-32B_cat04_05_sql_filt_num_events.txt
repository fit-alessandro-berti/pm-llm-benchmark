Okay, so I need to write a DuckDB SQL query to filter out cases in an event log where each case has more than six events. The table is called `event_log` and has columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to return all events from cases that have six or fewer events.

First, I should figure out how to get the count of events per `case_id`. That sounds like a GROUP BY operation. So maybe I can use something like COUNT(*) to get the number of events for each case.

I think I'll need a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the number of events per case. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the number of events for each `case_id`:
   ```sql
   SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
   ```

2. From this, I need to filter out the `case_id`s where `event_count` is greater than 6. So I'll add a WHERE clause:
   ```sql
   WHERE event_count <= 6
   ```

3. Now, I need to get all the events from these filtered `case_id`s. So I can join this result back to the original `event_log` table. That means the main query will select from `event_log` where `case_id` is in the list of `case_id`s from the subquery.

Putting it all together, I can use a subquery in the WHERE clause like this:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
```

Wait, but I should make sure that the subquery correctly groups and filters. Using HAVING instead of WHERE in the subquery makes sense because I'm filtering on an aggregate function (COUNT(*)).

Alternatively, I could use a CTE for better readability:
```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_counts cc ON el.case_id = cc.case_id
WHERE cc.event_count <= 6
```

Both approaches should work, but the first one with the subquery is more concise. I think that's the way to go.

I should also test if this works with some example data. Suppose I have a case with 7 events; it should be excluded, and all other cases with 6 or fewer should be included.

Yes, this should correctly return only the events from cases with six or fewer events.

To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases in an event log where each case has more than six events. The goal is to return all events from cases that have six or fewer events. 

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Calculate Event Count per Case**: First, we calculate the number of events for each `case_id` using the `COUNT(*)` function.
2. **Filter Cases by Event Count**: We then filter out the `case_id`s where the event count exceeds six.
3. **Retrieve Events for Filtered Cases**: Finally, we retrieve all events from the cases that have six or fewer events.

To achieve this, we use a subquery to determine which `case_id`s meet the criteria and then use these `case_id`s to filter the main table.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation
1. **Subquery for Event Count**: The subquery `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` groups the events by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case. It then filters out cases where the count is greater than six.
2. **Main Query Filtering**: The main query selects all events from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is in the list of `case_id`s returned by the subquery. This ensures that only events from cases with six or fewer events are included.

This approach efficiently filters the event log to include only the relevant cases, ensuring that the result set is both accurate and optimized.
