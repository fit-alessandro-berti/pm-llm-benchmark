## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To reconstruct and analyze the actual flow of jobs and task execution sequences, we would leverage **process mining techniques** on the MES event logs. Key steps include:

### **A. Process Discovery & Flow Analysis**
- **Process Model Reconstruction:**
  Use **process discovery algorithms** (e.g., Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner) to generate an **as-is process model** showing job routings, task sequences, and resource dependencies.
  - Identify common job paths (e.g., Cutting  Milling  Heat Treatment  Inspection).
  - Detect deviations (e.g., reprocessing due to defects, skipped steps).

- **Variant Analysis:**
  Classify jobs into **variant clusters** based on their routing patterns (e.g., jobs requiring Heat Treatment vs. those that don’t).
  - Compare performance metrics (lead time, tardiness) across variants to identify inefficient paths.

### **B. Key Performance Metrics Extraction**
1. **Job Flow Times & Lead Times:**
   - Measure the time between job release and completion (flow time) and compare against planned lead times.
   - Use a **performance spectrum** (process mining technique) to visualize distributions and outliers.

2. **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
   - For each workstation (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03), calculate the average and variance of queue times by analyzing the timestamps between **"Queue Entry"** and **"Task Start"** events.
   - Identify stations with excessive waiting times, indicating bottlenecks.

3. **Resource Utilization Breakdown:**
   - Compute:
     - **Productive time:** Time spent on actual task execution.
     - **Setup time:** Extracted from **"Setup Start"** to **"Setup End"** events.
     - **Idle time:** Gaps between task completions and new task starts.
     - **Breakdown time:** From **"Breakdown Start"** to **"Breakdown End"** events.
   - Visualize utilization with a **Gantt-like resource workload chart** derived from logs.

4. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Analysis:**
   - Extract sequences of jobs processed on each machine (e.g., CUT-01: JOB-6998  JOB-7001  JOB-7005).
   - For each pair of consecutive jobs, record the setup time and classify by:
     - Material type
     - Previous job’s operation type
     - Tooling requirements (if logged)
   - Build a **setup time matrix** to predict future setup durations based on job sequence.

5. **Tardiness & Schedule Adherence:**
   - Calculate:
     - **Tardiness:** `(Completion Time - Due Date)` for each job.
     - **% On-Time Delivery:** Fraction of jobs completed before/on due date.
   - Use **survival analysis** to model the probability of tardiness based on job characteristics.

6. **Disruption Impact Analysis:**
   - For each breakdown or priority change event, track its ripple effect:
     - Delays in subsequent jobs on the same machine.
     - Knock-on delays downstream (e.g., a milling delay impacts grinding).
   - Use **root cause analysis** to quantify disruption severity.

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

### **A. Key Inefficiencies Identified**
1. **Bottleneck Identification:**
   - Machines with consistently high queue times (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03) are bottlenecks.
   - Measure **workload imbalance** (e.g., some machines at 90% utilization while others idle).

2. **Poor Task Prioritization:**
   - Jobs with near-term due dates may be delayed because:
     - Urgent "hot jobs" preempt others without considering downstream impact.
     - Static rules (e.g., FCFS) ignore due dates or remaining slack time.

3. **Suboptimal Sequencing & Setup Times:**
   - Frequent long setups due to poor job sequencing (e.g., switching from steel to aluminum parts unnecessarily).
   - Identify sequences where setup times could have been minimized with better ordering.

4. **Starvation & Blocking:**
   - Downstream resources (e.g., Inspection) may starve because upstream stations (e.g., Heat Treatment) are overloaded.
   - Conversely, upstream blocks may occur if downstream is unavailable.

5. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
   - Variability in job arrivals and processing times causes WIP accumulation between stations.
   - Measure WIP levels over time to identify unstable periods.

### **B. Process Mining Techniques for Evidence**
- **Bottleneck Analysis:**
  - Use **throughput time analysis** to identify stages with the highest waiting times.
  - Apply **DFA (Decision Flow Analysis)** to see how jobs flow between stations.

- **Variant Comparison:**
  - Compare on-time vs. late jobs:
    - Do late jobs have longer queue times at specific machines?
    - Are they more likely to require certain setup-heavy sequences?

- **Resource Contention Analysis:**
  - Overlay a **resource utilization heatmap** to visualize periods of high contention.
  - Correlate high contention periods with tardiness spikes.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis**

### **A. Potential Root Causes**
1. **Static Dispatching Rules:**
   - FCFS/Earliest Due Date rules ignore real-time shop floor conditions (e.g., downstream queue lengths).

2. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Schedulers don’t see live machine statuses, leading to poor allocation decisions.

3. **Inaccurate Estimations:**
   - Planned durations may differ significantly from actuals due to operator variability or unaccounted complexities.

4. **Poor Setup Time Management:**
   - No optimization for minimizing sequence-dependent setups.

5. **Reactive Disruption Handling:**
   - Breakdowns and hot jobs are handled ad-hoc, causing cascading delays.

### **B. Process Mining for Differentiation**
- **Poor Scheduling Logic vs. Capacity Issues:**
  - If a machine is always at 100% utilization but still has high tardiness  capacity issue.
  - If a machine has low utilization but high queue times  poor task sequencing.

- **Variability Analysis:**
  - If actual processing times vary widely despite similar planned durations  estimation inaccuracies.
  - If setup times vary unpredictably  need better sequencing rules.

## **4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
**Core Logic:**
- Replace static rules (FCFS, EDD) with a **weighted multi-criteria rule** considering:
  - Remaining processing time.
  - Due date slack (remaining time until due date).
  - Downstream queue lengths (avoid starving next station).
  - Estimated sequence-dependent setup time for the next job.

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Historical setup time matrices to predict setup penalties.
- Bottleneck identification to prioritize jobs that would reduce downstream congestion.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce tardiness by dynamically prioritizing high-slack-risk jobs.
- Minimize setup overhead via smarter sequencing.

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Simulation**
**Core Logic:**
- Use **Monte Carlo simulation** with logged distributions for:
  - Task durations (min, max, average per job type).
  - Breakdown probabilities (derived from historical MTBF/MTTR).
- Generate probabilistic completion forecasts and adjust schedules proactively.

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Task duration distributions stratified by job type, operator, or machine.
- Breakdown frequency and recovery time patterns.

**Expected Impact:**
- More accurate due date commitments.
- Proactive rerouting of jobs away from high-risk machines.

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization via Batching**
**Core Logic:**
- Group jobs with similar setup requirements (e.g., same material, tooling) into **batches**.
- Sequence jobs on bottleneck machines to minimize setup transitions.
- Use a **Traveling Salesman-like optimization** to find the lowest total setup time sequence.

**Process Mining Insights Used:**
- Setup time matrix to identify compatible job sequences.
- Identification of machines where setup time dominates processing time.

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce WIP by minimizing non-value-added setup time.
- Increase effective capacity at bottlenecks.

   - Use **reinforcement learning** to adjust dispatching weights dynamically.
