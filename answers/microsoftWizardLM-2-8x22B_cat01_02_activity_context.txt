 **Step 1: Identification and Interpretation of Recurring Activities**

1. **Verify Documents** - This activity occurs twice within Case C001 and Case C003. In the first instance, it represents an initial document verification, while in the second instance, it is a re-verification after additional information or documents have been provided.

2. **Call Customer** - This activity occurs twice within Case C002 and once in both Case C001 and Case C003. For C001, it is a call to request additional documents. In C002, the first occurrence is to clarify account discrepancies, and the second is to confirm adjustments made to the account. In C003, the call is made to request the customer's return to the branch.

3. **Adjust Account** - Appears once in Case C002 and once in Case C003. In both cases, it involves making internal corrections or adjustments to the customer's account details, but the specifics of the adjustments may differ based on the preceding interactions.

**Step 2: Renaming Activities to Reflect Context**

1. **Verify Documents** (initial) -> **Initial Document Verification**
2. **Verify Documents** (after additional submission) -> **Additional Document Re-verification**
3. **Call Customer** (for missing documents) -> **Call for Additional Documents**
4. **Call Customer** (to clarify discrepancy) -> **Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy**
5. **Call Customer** (to confirm adjustments) -> **Call to Confirm Account Adjustments**
6. **Call Customer** (to have them return) -> **Call for Customer Return**
7. **Adjust Account** (after call for discrepancy) -> **Adjust Account for Discrepancy**
8. **Adjust Account** (after call for missing info) -> **Adjust Account for Missing Information**

**Step 3: Revised Event Log**

**Step 4: Justification for Naming Choices**

- **Initial Document Verification** and **Additional Document Re-verification** - These names reflect whether it is the first time the documents are being verified or a subsequent verification after additional documents have been submitted. This distinction is crucial as it indicates progression in the verification process.

- **Call for Additional Documents**, **Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy**, and **Call to Confirm Account Adjustments** - Each of these call purposes is distinct and affects the customer differently. By specifying the reason for the call, we clarify the purpose and urgency of the communication.

- **Adjust Account for Discrepancy** and **Adjust Account for Missing Information** - These names indicate the specific reasons for the account adjustment, which can vary based on the context of the customer interaction. This helps in understanding the nature of the changes made to the account.

- **Call for Customer Return** - This name reflects the immediate action required by the customer and the reason for the call, which is to physically return to the branch, making it distinct from other types of calls.
