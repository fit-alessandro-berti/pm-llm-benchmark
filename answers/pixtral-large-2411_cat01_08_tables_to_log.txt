To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, we need to integrate the data from the provided tables. Here is the detailed step-by-step process and the final event log:

### Steps to Integrate Data:

1. **Identify Cases**:
   - Use `order_id` as the case identifier for each process instance.

2. **Derive Activities**:
   - "Order Created" from the `Orders` table.
   - "Items Picked" from the `Order Lines` table.
   - "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from the `Delivery` table.
   - "Invoice Issued" from the `Invoice` table.
   - "Payment Received" from the `Payments` table.

3. **Map Timestamps**:
   - For each event, use the respective timestamp column (e.g., `order_date`, `item_picking_date`, `delivery_dispatch_date`, `invoice_issue_date`, `payment_date`).

4. **Combine Data**:
   - Link each event using the keys provided (`order_id`, `invoice_id`, etc.).
   - Ensure each event row is placed in sequence and can be traced from order initiation to completion.

5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**:
   - Include the "Resource" or "Actor" column where available (e.g., `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `billing_person_id`).

### Final Event Log:

Below is the structured event log in Markdown format:

### Assumptions and Notes:
- Each event for every `order_id` is included.
- The chronological order reflects the real process flow.
- For the "Payment Received" event, the `Resource/Actor` column is left empty as the payments table does not specify who processed the payment.
- The `Other Attributes` column includes additional relevant data where applicable.
- The `customer_type` and `order_priority` are included in the "Other Attributes" for the "Order Created" event.
- The `item_id` and `quantity` are included in the "Other Attributes" for the "Items Picked" event.
- The `delivery_id` is included in the "Other Attributes" for the "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events.
- The `invoice_id` and `invoice_amount` are included in the "Other Attributes" for the "Invoice Issued" event.
- The `payment_id` and `payment_method` are included in the "Other Attributes" for the "Payment Received" event.
