### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules (Strict Constraints)**

Normative rules define the **mandatory** sequence and logic of the loan application process. Violations of these rules represent **serious deviations** from the prescribed process.

---

#### **Case 2: Violates Multiple Normative Rules**

- **Violation 1: Risk Assessment before Credit Check**  
  - **Sequence Error:** Risk Assessment occurs at `2024-01-11 08:20`, but Credit Check only happens at `2024-01-11 09:00`.  
  - **Rule Broken:** *Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.*  
  - **Impact:** This reverses the required order of core evaluation steps, potentially leading to an invalid risk assessment based on incomplete information.

- **Violation 2: Finalize Documentation after Loan Rejection**  
  - **Contradictory Action:** The loan is rejected (`2024-01-11 09:30`), yet *Finalize Documentation* is performed at `2024-01-11 10:00`.  
  - **Rule Broken:** *If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.*  
  - **Impact:** This is a procedural and possibly compliance violation—finalizing documentation implies approval and may lead to legal or operational confusion.

>  **Conclusion for Case 2:**  
> This case **violates normative process behavior** in two critical ways: incorrect activity order and execution of an action forbidden after rejection. These are **serious process deviations**.

---

#### **Case 1: No Normative Violations**

- All activities follow the correct sequence:  
  `Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (since approved)  Close Case`
- Finalize Documentation is correctly performed only after an **approval**.
- All ordering constraints are respected.

>  **Conclusion for Case 1:**  
> Fully compliant with normative rules.

---

#### **Case 3: No Normative Violations**

- Sequence is correct:  
  `Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`
- The loan was approved, so Finalize Documentation is allowed and correctly placed.
- No skipped or reordered mandatory steps.

>  **Conclusion for Case 3:**  
> Compliant with all **normative constraints**, despite timing issues (see below).

---

###  **Summary of Normative Rule Violations:**
| Case ID | Violation(s) |
|--------|--------------|
| **1**  | None |
| **2**  | - Risk Assessment before Credit Check<br>- Finalize Documentation after rejection |
| **3**  | None |

---

### **2. Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata (Recommended Practices)**

Desiderata are **soft constraints**—ideally followed, but not mandatory. Deviations are **suboptimal but not critical**.

---

#### **Case 1: Meets All Desiderata**

- **Credit Check Timing:** Performed at 09:30, just **30 minutes** after application (well within 24-hour recommendation).
- **Inform Applicant Timing:** Done at 13:00, **2 hours** after decision (far under 48-hour window).
- **Follow-up Call:** Not present — but this is only encouraged, not required. No penalty.

>  **Conclusion:** Meets all desiderata. **Ideal process execution.**

---

#### **Case 2: Fails Some Desiderata (but this is secondary to normative violations)**

- **Credit Check Timing:** Conducted **40 minutes after Risk Assessment**, which already violates the normative rule. Even if timing were ignored, the sequence is invalid.
- **Inform Applicant:** Not recorded — likely occurred, but even if delayed, it's irrelevant due to **serious normative violations**.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not performed — again, not required.

>  **Conclusion:** Suboptimal timing and missing follow-up, but these are **overshadowed by critical normative breaches**.

---

#### **Case 3: Fails Multiple Desiderata**

- **Credit Check Delay:**  
  - Application received: `2024-01-12 09:00`  
  - Credit Check: `2024-01-14 10:00`  **~49 hours later**  
  -  **Violates desideratum** of completing credit check within 24 hours.

- **Inform Applicant Delay:**  
  - Loan Decision: `2024-01-14 12:00`  
  - Inform Applicant: `2024-01-16 15:00`  **~51 hours later**  
  -  **Exceeds the 48-hour recommendation** for prompt notification.

- **Follow-up Call Missing:**  
  - No record of a follow-up call before closing.  
  -  **Missed opportunity**, but not a violation per rules.

>  **Conclusion:** All deviations are **desiderata failures only** — process is normatively correct, but **delays reduce efficiency and customer experience**.

---

###  **Summary of Desiderata Failures:**
| Case ID | Desiderata Not Met |
|--------|--------------------|
| **1**  | None |
| **2**  | - Incorrect order undermines timing<br>- No follow-up call (minor) |
| **3**  | - Credit Check >24h after application<br>- Inform Applicant >48h after decision<br>- No follow-up call |

---

### **3. Interpretations and Justifications**

Despite observed deviations, we can attempt **plausible explanations** consistent with process intent:

---

#### **Case 2: Possible Justifications (though insufficient to excuse violations)**

- **Why Risk Assessment before Credit Check?**  
  Possibly a **data entry error** (e.g., timestamp misrecorded), or a **temporary workaround** due to system unavailability for credit checks. However, no justification overrides the need for correct sequence — this remains a **critical flaw**.

- **Why Finalize Documentation after rejection?**  
  Could be **accidental** (e.g., clerical error in selecting the next step), or due to **lack of system enforcement** (e.g., no guardrails preventing the action). This suggests a **control gap** in the process system.

>  **Assessment:** These actions cannot be justified under normative rules. Process controls must be strengthened.

---

#### **Case 3: Justifiable Delays (within desiderata flexibility)**

- **Long delay in Credit Check (49 hours):**  
  May reflect **weekend processing lags** (application on Jan 12 (Fri), credit check on Jan 14 (Sun)?). If team operates only on weekdays, this delay may be **operationally acceptable**, though still suboptimal.

- **Delayed communication (51 hours):**  
  Could be due to **approval review backlog** or **manual notification process**. While not ideal, it doesn’t break rules.

- **No Follow-up Call:**  
  Possibly omitted due to **resource constraints** or **low perceived risk**. Since it's optional, this is **acceptable**, though customer engagement may suffer.

>  **Assessment:** Delays are **understandable but improvable**. Recommend process monitoring and automation to meet timeliness goals.

---

###  **Final Summary and Recommendations**

| Case | Normative Compliance | Desiderata Compliance | Overall Assessment |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **1** |  Fully Compliant |  Fully Compliant | **Ideal execution** |
| **2** |  Critical Violations |  Poor | **Serious deviation** — requires process correction and training |
| **3** |  Compliant |  Missed recommendations | **Correct but slow** — opportunity for efficiency improvement |

---

###  **Recommendations:**

1. **Enforce Process Order in System:**  
   Implement workflow controls to **prevent Risk Assessment before Credit Check** and **block Finalize Documentation if loan is rejected**.

2. **Improve Timeliness:**  
   Introduce **alerts or SLAs** for Credit Check (within 24h) and Inform Applicant (within 48h) to support desiderata.

3. **Encourage Follow-up Calls:**  
   Add optional task prompts in the system to **nudge staff** to perform follow-ups, improving customer experience.

4. **Audit and Monitor:**  
   Regularly review logs for **sequence violations** and **timing delays** to identify recurring issues.

---

By distinguishing **normative violations** (must-fix) from **desiderata gaps** (nice-to-fix), the organization can prioritize compliance while gradually improving performance and service quality.
