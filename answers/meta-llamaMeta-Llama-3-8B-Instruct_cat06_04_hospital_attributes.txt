Based on the attributes provided, the sensitive attributes for fairness appear to be:

* `case:citizen` (True/False): This attribute indicates whether the patient is a citizen or not. This information could be potentially sensitive and affect decisions made during the treatment process.
* `case:gender` (True/False): This attribute indicates the patient's gender. Gender is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions, and fairness analysis should consider its potential impact on decision-making.
* `case:german speaking` (False/True): This attribute indicates whether the patient can speak German or not. This information could be relevant to the treatment process and should be considered in fairness analysis.
* `resource` (e.g., Doc. Low, Doc. Pro, Nurse 3, etc.): This attribute indicates which doctor or nurse is involved in the treatment process. This information could be sensitive, as it may influence the decision-making process and potentially lead to biases.
* `case:private_insurance` (False/True): This attribute indicates whether the patient has private insurance or not. This information could be relevant to the treatment process and should be considered in fairness analysis.
* `case:underlying_condition` (True/False): This attribute indicates whether the patient has an underlying condition or not. This information could be sensitive, as it may affect the treatment decisions made and potentially lead to biases.

These attributes are potentially sensitive and could be used to identify biases in the treatment process. Fairness analysis should consider these attributes to ensure that the treatment decisions are unbiased and do not unfairly discriminate against specific groups.
