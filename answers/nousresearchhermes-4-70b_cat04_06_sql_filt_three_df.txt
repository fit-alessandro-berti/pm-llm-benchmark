Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a DuckDB SQL query that filters out certain cases based on a sequence of activities and a time condition. The final result should include all events except those from the cases that meet both criteria. 

First, I need to identify the cases that have the exact sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in immediate succession. That means no other events from the same case can be between these three. So, for each case, I need to check the order of activities and ensure that these three appear consecutively in that exact order.

Next, among those cases, I need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days. If both the sequence and timing conditions are met, the case should be excluded from the final result.

So, the plan is:

1. Assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This will help in checking the sequence of activities.
2. Use window functions to look for the next two activities in the sequence to ensure they follow immediately after the first activity in the sequence.
3. Calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events for the identified sequences.
4. Mark the cases that meet both conditions (sequence and timing) and then exclude all their events from the final result.

Wait, but how do I ensure that the three activities are consecutive? Let's think. For each occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', I need to check if the next activity (by timestamp) is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. So, using the row_number partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp, I can check the next two rows.

Alternatively, using the LEAD window function. For each row, check the next two activities. If the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next (LEAD 1) should be 'Create Order', and the next after that (LEAD 2) should be 'Confirm Order'. That way, the three form a consecutive sequence.

But wait, what if there are other activities in between? For example, if after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' there's another activity before 'Create Order'? Then the LEAD approach would not catch that. So, the LEAD function would check the next two rows in order, which are the immediate next events. So, if the three activities are consecutive, their row numbers would be consecutive. So, the LEAD approach should work here.

So, step 1: For each event in the event_log, assign a row number within the case ordered by timestamp. Then, for rows where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next row's activity is 'Create Order' and the third row's activity is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to structure this in SQL. Let's think. Using a common table expression (CTE) to add row numbers and lead activities.

So, first CTE:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
)

Then, in the next step, for each case, check if there exists a trio of consecutive rows where the activities are in the required order. So, for each row in ordered_events where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', we need to check if the next two rows (rn +1 and rn +2) exist and have the required activities.

But how to join this? Maybe using a self-join. Alternatively, using the LEAD function to get the next two activities in the same case.

Another approach: For each row, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next activity (using LEAD) is 'Create Order', and the next next activity (LEAD(1, 2)) is 'Confirm Order'. But that would require using LEAD twice. Let's see.

Using LEAD:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity1,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity2,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp2
FROM event_log

Then, for rows where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and next_activity1 is 'Create Order', and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order', those rows are part of the sequence. But we need to capture the entire case if such a sequence exists in any part of the case.

But also, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in this sequence must be more than 5 days. Wait, but in the sequence, 'Create Order' is the next activity after 'Approve', and 'Confirm' is the third. So, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' is the difference between their timestamps.

But in the LEAD approach, the 'Create Order' is the next activity (rn+1) and 'Confirm Order' is rn+2. So, the time between them is (next_timestamp2 - next_timestamp1). But how to get that?

Alternatively, when we have a row where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and the next two activities are 'Create' and 'Confirm', then the timestamp of 'Create' is the next row's timestamp, and 'Confirm' is the one after. So, the time difference between 'Create' and 'Confirm' is (timestamp of 'Confirm' - timestamp of 'Create').

But how to get that. Let's see. For each row in the ordered_events, if the current activity is 'Approve', and the next is 'Create', and the one after is 'Confirm', then the time difference between 'Create' and 'Confirm' is the timestamp of the third row (rn+2) minus the timestamp of the second row (rn+1). So, in the ordered_events CTE, we can get the next two rows' timestamps using LEAD.

So, perhaps:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
with_leads AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2
    FROM ordered_events
)
SELECT *
FROM with_leads
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
    AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'

This would give all the 'Approve' activities that are followed by 'Create' and then 'Confirm'. Each such row represents the start of the sequence. Then, for each such row, the time between 'Create' and 'Confirm' is next_ts2 - next_ts1. We need to check if that difference is more than 5 days.

So, in the same with_leads CTE, we can compute the difference and filter for that.

So, the next step is to find all case_ids that have at least one occurrence of this sequence where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Once we have those case_ids, we need to exclude all events from those cases from the final result.

So, the steps are:

1. Identify all case_ids that have the sequence and the time condition.
2. Select all events from event_log where the case_id is not in the identified list.

Putting it all together:

First, create a CTE that identifies the sequences and checks the time difference. Then, collect the case_ids from there. Then, in the main query, select all events where the case_id is not in that list.

So, the SQL query would look something like:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2
    FROM event_log
),
problem_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM problem_sequences ps
    WHERE ps.case_id = el.case_id
)

Wait, but in the problem_sequences CTE, we are selecting case_ids where there's at least one occurrence of the sequence with the time condition. Then, the main query selects all events not in those cases.

But need to make sure that the time difference is calculated correctly. The difference between next_ts2 (timestamp of 'Confirm Order') and next_ts1 (timestamp of 'Create Order') is indeed the duration between 'Create' and 'Confirm'.

Yes. So, the WHERE clause in problem_sequences checks that the difference is more than 5 days.

But wait, in the ordered_events CTE, the LEAD(timestamp, 1) gives the timestamp of the next row (Create Order), and LEAD(timestamp, 2) gives the timestamp of the third row (Confirm Order). So, the difference between them is the time between Create and Confirm.

Yes. So, that's correct.

But what about cases where there are multiple sequences? For example, a case might have multiple instances of the sequence. But we only need to exclude the case once. So, the EXISTS clause in the main query will check if the case_id is present in the problem_sequences list, regardless of how many times it occurs.

So, the problem_sequences CTE collects all case_ids that have at least one occurrence of the sequence with the time condition. Then, the main query selects all events not in those cases.

This should work.

But let's test for possible edge cases. For example, a case that has the sequence but the time difference is exactly 5 days. Then, it's not included in problem_sequences, so the case is not excluded. That's correct.

Another edge case: a case has the correct sequence, but between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' there's another event. But in our approach, since we're checking the next two activities after 'Approve', if there's an event in between, the next_act1 would not be 'Create Order', so the sequence wouldn't be detected. So, that's correct because the problem requires the three activities to be in direct succession.

So, the LEAD approach correctly captures consecutive events.

Now, putting it all together in DuckDB SQL. DuckDB supports window functions and CTEs, so this should work.

Another thing to consider: the ordering by timestamp. We need to ensure that the events are ordered correctly within each case. The ROW_NUMBER() and LEAD functions are ordered by timestamp, which is correct.

So, the final query would be as written above.

Wait, but in the ordered_events CTE, do we need the ROW_NUMBER? Because in the LEAD function, the order is determined by the PARTITION and ORDER BY. So, even without the ROW_NUMBER, the LEAD functions would work as they are ordered by timestamp. So, perhaps the ROW_NUMBER is not necessary. Let me check.

The ordered_events CTE includes ROW_NUMBER() but in the with_leads CTE, we use LEAD functions. However, the ROW_NUMBER is not used in the with_leads. So, perhaps the ordered_events CTE can be simplified.

Wait, the ordered_events CTE is:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
FROM event_log

But in the next step, the with_leads CTE uses LEAD functions. Maybe the ROW_NUMBER is not necessary here. Because the LEAD functions already use the PARTITION BY case_id and ORDER BY timestamp. So, perhaps the ordered_events CTE can be replaced with a direct LEAD in the with_leads CTE.

Wait, no. The with_leads CTE is based on the ordered_events. But perhaps we can combine it into a single CTE.

Let me adjust:

WITH with_leads AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2
    FROM event_log
),
problem_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM with_leads
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problem_sequences)

But wait, the with_leads CTE is created by selecting from event_log and applying the LEAD functions. So, each row in with_leads represents an event, and the next_act1 and next_ts1 are the next event's activity and timestamp. So, for each 'Approve' event, if the next two events are 'Create' and 'Confirm', and the time between 'Create' and 'Confirm' is more than 5 days, then the case_id is added to problem_sequences.

Yes. Then, the main query selects all events not in those cases.

But what about cases where there are multiple 'Approve' events followed by 'Create' and 'Confirm'? For example, if a case has two instances of the sequence. But the problem_sequences would include the case_id once, so the NOT IN clause would exclude all events from that case regardless.

That's correct, as per the problem statement: exclude the entire case if it meets the criteria.

So, this approach should work.

Testing for possible issues:

- What if a case has the sequence but the time difference is not more than 5 days? Then, it's not in problem_sequences, so the case is included. Correct.

- What if a case has the sequence but the 'Confirm' event is not the third in the sequence? For example, 'Approve' followed by 'Create' followed by another event, then 'Confirm'. Then, the LEAD(2) would not capture it. So, the sequence is not detected. Correct.

Another possible approach is to use a self-join. For each case, find the 'Approve' event, then check if there's a 'Create' event after it, and a 'Confirm' event after that. But that would require joining on case_id and timestamps. However, that might be more complex, especially ensuring that the events are consecutive.

But the window function approach seems more straightforward here.

Another thing to consider: DuckDB's handling of intervals. The subtraction of next_ts2 - next_ts1 gives a INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND result. Comparing that to INTERVAL '5 days' should work. So, (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days' is correct.

So, the final query should be as written above.

But let's check the syntax. DuckDB uses standard SQL for intervals. So, INTERVAL '5 days' is correct.

Yes.

So, the final query is:

WITH with_leads AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2
    FROM event_log
),
problem_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM with_leads
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problem_sequences)

Wait, but in the with_leads CTE, the LEAD functions for activity and timestamp. So, for each row in event_log, next_act1 is the next activity, etc. But when the current row is the second to last event in the case, next_act1 would be NULL. Similarly, for the last event, next_act1 and next_act2 would be NULL. So, the WHERE clause in problem_sequences would correctly ignore those cases where the sequence is not complete.

Yes. So, only rows where all three activities are present and in order would be considered.

This should correctly identify the case_ids that need to be excluded.

Therefore, the final query should work as intended.

</think>


To solve this problem, we need to identify and exclude specific process instances (cases) from an event log based on a sequence of activities and a time condition. The goal is to return all events except those from cases that meet both the sequence and timing criteria.

### Approach
1. **Identify Consecutive Activities**: Use window functions to check if each case contains the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' with no intervening events.
2. **Check Timing Condition**: For cases that meet the sequence requirement, calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'. Exclude cases where this difference exceeds 5 days.
3. **Exclude Identified Cases**: Filter out all events from cases that meet both the sequence and timing conditions from the final result.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH with_leads AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_act2,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts1,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_ts2
    FROM event_log
),
problem_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM with_leads
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_act1 = 'Create Order'
        AND next_act2 = 'Confirm Order'
        AND (next_ts2 - next_ts1 > INTERVAL '5 days')
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM problem_sequences);
```

### Explanation
1. **Window Functions for Sequence Detection**: The `with_leads` CTE uses `LEAD` functions to fetch the next two activities and their timestamps for each event. This helps in identifying consecutive sequences within each case.
2. **Filtering Problematic Cases**: The `problem_sequences` CTE filters cases where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' occurs consecutively and the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
3. **Excluding Problematic Cases**: The main query selects all events from the `event_log` table, excluding those from cases identified in `problem_sequences`.

This approach efficiently identifies and filters out the required cases using window functions and set operations, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.
