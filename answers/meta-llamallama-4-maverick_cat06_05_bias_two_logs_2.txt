## Step 1: Understand the given event logs
The problem presents two event logs: one for Group A (Protected Group) and one for Group B (Unprotected Group). Each log contains details about candidates going through a hiring process, including their scores at various stages and the final hiring decision.

## Step 2: Identify key differences between Group A and Group B
Group A candidates do not receive any adjustments to their scores based on their professional associations. In contrast, Group B candidates who are affiliated with the 'LocalBusinessLeadersClub' receive a +5 boost to their Cultural Fit score.

## Step 3: Analyze the hiring decisions and score adjustments
For Group A, the hiring decisions seem to be based solely on their SkillScore, PersonalityScore, and CulturalFit without any adjustments. For Group B, candidates affiliated with 'LocalBusinessLeadersClub' (U001 and U003) receive a +5 adjustment to their CulturalFit score, which potentially influences their hiring decision.

## Step 4: Examine the impact of score adjustments on hiring decisions
U001 and U003 in Group B were hired after receiving the +5 CulturalFit score adjustment. U002, not being part of 'LocalBusinessLeadersClub', did not receive this adjustment and was not hired. In Group A, P001 and P003 were hired without any score adjustments, based on their original scores.

## Step 5: Assess bias in the hiring process
The bias is evident in the different treatment of candidates based on their professional association membership. Group B candidates with the 'LocalBusinessLeadersClub' affiliation receive a score boost, potentially giving them an unfair advantage over others.

## Step 6: Discuss the implications of the identified bias
This bias can lead to unfair hiring practices, where candidates with certain professional associations are favored over others, regardless of their actual qualifications or fit for the role. It can result in less qualified candidates being hired over more qualified ones, solely based on their association membership.

## Step 7: Consider the impact on fairness and equity
The presence of such bias undermines fairness and equity in the hiring process. It may lead to discrimination against candidates who are not part of the favored professional associations, potentially resulting in a less diverse and less merit-based workforce.

## Step 8: Identify which group exhibits bias
Group B exhibits bias due to the preferential treatment given to candidates with 'LocalBusinessLeadersClub' affiliation through the +5 CulturalFit score adjustment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Group B}$
