## Merged Event Log Analysis and Integration

### Matching Strategy

I've analyzed both logs using the following criteria:
1. **Order ID matching**: All events share Order#1234
2. **Semantic similarity**: Matching event names that represent the same business activity
3. **Timestamp tolerance**: 2-second window for matching events
4. **Exception handling**: Slightly relaxed tolerance (up to 5 seconds) when semantic similarity is strong

### Event Matching Decisions

| Log A Event | Log B Event | Time Diff | Decision |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Order Received (10:00:00) | OrderReceived (09:59:58) | 2 sec | **MERGE** - Within tolerance |
| Order Validated (10:01:30) | OrderValidation (10:01:29) | 1 sec | **MERGE** - Within tolerance |
| Payment Processed (10:02:00) | PaymentCheck (10:02:05) | 5 sec | **MERGE** - Strong semantic match despite slight time difference |
| Item Shipped (10:05:00) | Shipping (10:05:02) | 2 sec | **MERGE** - Within tolerance |
| Item Delivered (10:20:00) | - | - | **KEEP SEPARATE** - No match in Log B |
| - | Quality Check (10:03:00) | - | **KEEP SEPARATE** - No match in Log A |

## Integration Decisions & Rationale

### 1. **Timestamp Selection**
- For merged events, I selected the **earlier timestamp** as the primary_timestamp, assuming Log B's timestamps more accurately reflect when events began
- Both original timestamps are preserved for audit trail

### 2. **Event Name Standardization**
- Used Log A's naming convention as the standard (more business-friendly)
- Examples: "OrderReceived"  "Order Received", "OrderValidation"  "Order Validated"

### 3. **Attribute Enrichment**
- All attributes from both logs are preserved
- Log B's additional attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) enrich the merged events
- Missing attributes are marked with "-" for clarity

### 4. **Special Cases**

**Payment Processing (5-second difference):**
- Despite exceeding the 2-second tolerance, the semantic similarity between "Payment Processed" and "PaymentCheck" strongly suggests these are the same event
- The 5-second delay is explained by Log B's note: "Payment gateway delay"

**Quality Check (Log B only):**
- This appears to be an internal process step captured only by System B
- Inserted chronologically between Payment and Shipping events
- Represents additional value in the merged log

**Item Delivered (Log A only):**
- Final delivery event only captured by System A
- Likely System B doesn't track post-shipping events

### 5. **Data Quality Observations**
- Log B appears to capture events slightly earlier (more real-time)
- Log A has complete end-to-end visibility but less detail
- The merged log provides both comprehensive coverage and rich detail

This integrated log now provides a complete, enriched view of the order fulfillment process with full traceability to both source systems.
