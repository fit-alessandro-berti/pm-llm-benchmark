### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Average Time**: ~25 hours (90000 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation**: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - **Anomaly**: The very low standard deviation suggests a highly consistent and possibly artificial schedule for claim approval, which is unusual in a dynamic process like claim handling.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Average Time**: 7 days (604800 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation**: 2 days (172800 seconds)
   - **Anomaly**: The extremely long average delay and high standard deviation indicate significant variability, possibly due to resource constraints or bottlenecks.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Average Time**: 2 hours (7200 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
   - **Anomaly**: This quick closure time suggests that some claims might be prematurely closed without completing necessary steps like evaluation and approval.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Average Time**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
   - **Standard Deviation**: 1 minute (60 seconds)
   - **Anomaly**: The very short average time suggests that the notification might be happening too quickly, possibly indicating skipped steps or automated processes that are not aligned with business rules.

### Hypotheses on Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: There might be an automated approval system for certain types of claims, leading to a very consistent and short approval time. Alternatively, there could be a systemic issue where approvals are batch-processed at specific times, leading to a low standard deviation.
   - **Verification**: Check if claims with a very short R to P time are of a specific type or handled by specific adjusters.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: There could be a significant backlog of notifications, leading to longer delays. Alternatively, the notification process might be manually driven and subject to resource availability, causing variability.
   - **Verification**: Identify claims where the P to N time exceeds the average and check if they are concentrated in certain regions or during specific periods.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: Some claims might be prematurely closed due to errors in the system, lack of resources, or specific policies for certain claim types.
   - **Verification**: Find claims that are closed immediately after assignment and check if they are associated with particular adjusters or claim types.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - **Hypothesis**: The evaluation and notification steps might be automated, leading to very quick transitions. Alternatively, there could be a process where notifications are sent out before all evaluations are completed.
   - **Verification**: Check if the quick E to N time is consistent across different claim types and adjusters.

### Verification Queries

1. **Identify claims with R to P time outside expected ranges**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.customer_id, 
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS r_to_p_time
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (90000 - 3 * 3600) 
     OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > (90000 + 3 * 3600);
   ```

2. **Correlate P to N anomalies with adjusters and claim types**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name AS adjuster_name, 
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS p_to_n_time
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (604800 - 3 * 172800) 
     OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) > (604800 + 3 * 172800);
   ```

3. **Filter claims closed immediately after assignment**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name AS adjuster_name, 
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS a_to_c_time
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (7200 - 3 * 3600);
   ```

4. **Check quick E to N transitions**:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.name AS adjuster_name, 
          EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS e_to_n_time
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   JOIN claims c ON ce1.claim_id = c.claim_id
   JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.name
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) < (300 - 3 * 60);
   ```

These queries will help identify specific instances where the timing between activities deviates significantly from the expected norms, allowing for further investigation into the underlying causes.
