Here's an example Python code to create a temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (PTP) process:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the possible processes and their expected durations in hours
processes = {
    'Buy Product': 12,
    'Send Order': 24, # 1 day after Buy Product
    'Purchase Product': 48, # 1 week after Send Order (3 days)
}

# Initialize an empty temporal profile dictionary with the standard attributes added to each couple of activities
temporal_profile = {}

def calculateTemporalProfile(processes):
    for process, duration in processes.items():
        if process == 'Buy Product':
            avg_time = duration / 7 # average time of Buy Product is 12 hours / 7 days per month
        elif process == 'Send Order':
            avg_time = duration / 3 # average time of Send Order is 24 hours / 3 days per week
        else:
            avg_time = duration / 14 # average time of Purchase Product is 48 hours / 14 calendar weeks

        std_dev_time = np.exp(-((duration - avg_hours) ** 2) / (2 * (avg_hours / (1 + (avg_hours**3)))) )

        temporal_profile[(process, process)] = {
            '_average': avg_time,
            'std_deviation': std_dev_time
        }

# Calculate the temporal profile for the PTP process
calculateTemporalProfile(processes)
print(temporal_profile)
```

This code defines a dictionary `processes` that contains hypothetical expected durations for each process in hours. It then initializes an empty dictionary called `temporal_profile` to store the average and standard deviation times for each couple of activities.

After calculating average time based on duration and then taking the square root of mean squared error between each pair time difference, we define a function `calculateSemanticProperties` (`calculateTemporalProfile`) which iterates over all available processes; extracts an 'average_time' (in hours) from that process's defined model: to determine how frequently there are events for one 'item1', another item2 within one period.

We calculate the times of these items by assuming their start time is 0, therefore `avg_hours` in the definition can be changed if required.
