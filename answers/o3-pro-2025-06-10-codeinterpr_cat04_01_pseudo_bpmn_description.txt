Detailed narrative of the process  

1. Start event  
   • The process is triggered when the company receives a new customer request (for a product or a service).

2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • A sales-desk or CRM system logs the request, captures the customer information and records whether the request is for a standard catalogue item or a customer-specific (custom) item.


FIRST DECISION – “Check Request Type” (XOR gateway)  
• Exclusive (XOR) = only one outgoing branch can be taken.  
• The content of the request determines which branch is followed:

A. STANDARD request branch

3. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
   • Basic checks: Is the customer registered? Is the shipping address valid? Are payment terms acceptable?  

4. Parallel gateway (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”  
   • AND-split: every outgoing branch is executed simultaneously.  
   • Reason: creditworthiness and inventory availability can be assessed at the same time.

    4a. Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
        – Finance verifies that the customer’s credit limit covers the potential order value.  
    4b. Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
        – Warehouse/ERP confirms that the required quantity is on hand or can be picked in time.

5. AND-join – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
   • The flow waits here until BOTH C1 and C2 are finished.  
   • Only then does it continue.

6. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
   • Lead time is calculated using actual stock levels, shipping calendars, transport lead-times, etc.  
   • The result is a provisional delivery promise that will later appear on the quotation/invoice.

B. CUSTOM request branch

3. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
   • Technical department estimates engineering effort, checks capacity, tooling, compliance, etc.

4. XOR gateway – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
   • If NO  Task E2 “Send Rejection Notice”  End event (process terminates politely).  
   • If YES  Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
        – Costing, engineering hours, special materials and price margins are converted into a formal quotation for the customer.


CONVERGENCE OF THE TWO MAIN BRANCHES  

• Whichever path was followed (Standard path finishing with D, or Custom path finishing with E1) the process meets at a common point before an approval decision is made.

7. XOR gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Typical rule: approval is required if the order value exceeds X €, discount larger than Y %, or lead-time shorter than Z days.  
   • Outcomes:  
     – Yes  go to Task F  
     – No   skip directly to Task G

8. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   • Sales manager (or engineering manager for custom jobs) reviews margin, risk, capacity.

9. XOR gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  
   • If YES  Task G “Generate Final Invoice” (or Order Confirmation).  
   • If NO   Task H “Re-evaluate Conditions”.

10. Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions” (rework loop)  
    • For a custom order the quotation (Task E1) is revised; for a standard order the delivery date/calculation (Task D) is revisited.  
    • The dashed arrow shows a loop:  
        – From H back to E1 if we came from the custom path.  
        – From H back to D if we came from the standard path.  
    • After rework the flow again passes through the “Is Approval Needed?” decision; the loop continues until approval is obtained or commercial rules change.


COMPLETION

11. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
    • System creates the sales order, invoice/quotation number, payment instructions.

12. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    • Customer receives the formal document plus delivery date or validity period of the quotation.

13. End event  
    • The process instance is closed in the BPM system.


Gateway semantics in short

• XOR (exclusive) – Only one outgoing arrow is taken, based on a condition (Type, Feasibility, Approval flag).  
• AND (parallel) – All outgoing arrows are taken; processing continues only when every parallel branch has reached the corresponding AND-join.  
• Loop-back arrow – Creates repetition; execution returns to an earlier activity until exit conditions are met.


Differences between Standard and Custom requests

Standard  
• Relies on predefined products.  
• Validation is mostly compliance / availability oriented.  
• Runs the credit & inventory checks in parallel, then computes a delivery date (Task D).  
• Rework (if approval is denied) adjusts the delivery date, pricing, or quantity.

Custom  
• Requires a feasibility study (engineering, tooling, capacity).  
• May immediately terminate if not feasible (E2).  
• Produces a detailed custom quotation (E1) instead of a delivery-date calculation.  
• Rework (if approval is denied) revises the quotation content, price, or technical specification.


When are approvals or rework triggered?

1. “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Triggered by corporate rules (value thresholds, discounts, special terms).  
   • If No  process continues without managerial intervention.

2. “Obtain Manager Approval” + “Is Approval Granted?”  
   • Manager can accept or reject.  
   • If rejected, Task H is executed.

3. Task H – Re-evaluate  
   • Sends the flow back to whichever preparatory task produced the commercial offering (E1 for custom, D for standard).  
   • Loop ends when a subsequent approval is granted or the customer withdraws the request.

That description maps every element of the pseudo-BPMN diagram to its business meaning, shows how the XOR and AND gateways shape the paths, and explains the conditions that cause convergence or looping.
