Based on the event log, we can infer the underlying process structure by analyzing the sequences, repetitions, optional steps, and concurrency patterns across all cases.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Fixed Sequential Prefix:**
All cases follow:
> **OR  MS  QS  AS**

This is **mandatory and sequential**.

#### **2. Assembly and Quality Screening Loop (IQC & AS):**
In cases 1, 2, 3, and 5, after the initial **AS**, there is **at least one IQC**, and often **multiple AS-IQC cycles** before proceeding to testing.

- Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  TST  
- Case 3: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST  
- Case 5: AS  IQC  AS  IQC  AS  TST  RT  TST  RT  TST  

This indicates a **loop** where **AS** and **IQC** can repeat arbitrarily, but **IQC always follows AS** (never the reverse), and **AS always precedes IQC**.

But note: **AS is executed multiple times**, and **IQC is executed between AS executions**.

This suggests a **loop structure** where:
> **AS  IQC** can repeat **zero or more times**, and then we proceed to **TST**.

But wait — in **Case 4**, there is **no IQC at all**. So **IQC can be skipped entirely**.

Therefore, we need a **choice** between:
- Skipping the entire loop (go straight to TST), or
- Executing **AS  IQC** at least once, and possibly repeating it.

This is best modeled as a **loop** where:
- **A = AS  IQC** (the loop body)
- **B = (skip)**  exit the loop

But note: the loop must start with **AS**, then optionally **IQC**, and then possibly repeat.

Actually, the pattern is:
> **AS** (first time)  [**IQC  AS**]*  TST

This is a **loop** where:
- The **loop body** is **IQC  AS** (but note: the first AS is outside the loop)
- So we can model it as:
  - First **AS**
  - Then a **loop**: **X( (IQC  AS),  )**  meaning: either do IQCAS again, or skip

But in POWL, the **loop operator \*(A, B)** means:
> Execute A, then either exit, or execute B and then A again.

So if we want:  
**AS**  ( **IQC  AS** )*  

We can model:
- A = **IQC  AS**  
- B = **** (silent transition, to exit)

But the first AS is outside the loop.

So the structure becomes:
> **AS**  \*( **IQC  AS**,  )

This is correct:  
- Execute AS (first time)  
- Then loop:  
  - Execute **IQC  AS**  
  - Then either exit () or repeat the loop body

This matches all cases:
- Case 4: AS  (skip loop)  TST   
- Case 1: AS  IQC  AS  (skip)  TST   
- Case 3: AS  IQCAS  IQCAS  IQCAS  (skip)  TST   
- Case 5: AS  IQCAS  IQCAS  IQCAS  (skip)  TST 

>  So: **AS  \*(IQC  AS, )**

#### **3. Testing and Re-testing Loop (TST & RT):**
In cases 1, 3, and 5, we see:
> TST  RT  TST  (possibly RT  TST again...)

Case 1: TST  RT  TST  
Case 3: TST  RT  TST  
Case 5: TST  RT  TST  RT  TST  

Case 2 and 4: TST only (no RT)

So: **TST** is always executed. Then, **RT may follow**, and if it does, it is **always followed by TST again**.

This is a classic **loop**:
> Execute TST, then either exit, or execute **RT  TST** and repeat.

So:
> **TST  \*( RT  TST,  )**

But wait — in this structure, we are saying:  
- Execute TST (first time)  
- Then loop: either exit, or do RT  TST again

This matches:  
- Case 4: TST  exit   
- Case 1: TST  RT  TST  exit   
- Case 5: TST  RT  TST  RT  TST  exit 

Perfect.

#### **4. Packaging and Labeling:**
All cases have **PK** after testing.

Then:
- Cases 1, 3, 5: **PK  LB**  
- Cases 2, 4: **PK  DP** (LB skipped)

So **LB is optional**.

Thus:  
> **PK  X( LB,  )**

#### **5. Distribution Planning and Dispatch:**
All cases have:
> **LB (or skip)  DP  D**

No concurrency or choice here — always sequential.

#### **6. Concurrency?**
Is there any concurrency?

Look at **DP** and **LB**:  
In all cases, **LB (if present) precedes DP**, and **DP always follows PK**.

So **DP cannot start until PK is done**, and **LB (if done) must be done before DP**.

But **LB** is optional and happens right after PK.

So **LB and DP** are **not concurrent** — DP always waits for PK, and if LB is executed, it waits for LB.

So no concurrency between LB and DP — it’s a strict sequence: PK  [LB]  DP.

Also, **DP and D** are always sequential.

#### **7. Final Structure Summary**

We now assemble the full process:

1. **OR  MS  QS** — fixed sequence  
2. **AS** — first assembly  
3. **Loop1**: \*( **IQC  AS**,  ) — repeat assembly & quality check  
4. **TST** — first test  
5. **Loop2**: \*( **RT  TST**,  ) — repeat testing & re-testing  
6. **PK** — packaging  
7. **Choice**: X( **LB**,  ) — labeling optional  
8. **DP  D** — distribution planning and dispatch

Now, we need to define the **partial order** between these high-level blocks.

Note: The entire structure is **sequential**, with two loops and one choice embedded.

So the top-level structure is a **StrictPartialOrder** with nodes:

- OR  
- MS  
- QS  
- AS (first)  
- Loop1 = \*(IQC  AS, )  
- TST (first)  
- Loop2 = \*(RT  TST, )  
- PK  
- LB_choice = X(LB, )  
- DP  
- D  

But wait — **AS** is a **single transition**, and the **loop body** is **IQC  AS** — which is a **sequence**.

We need to model **IQC  AS** as a **sequence** inside the loop.

So we define:

- `iqc = Transition("IQC")`  
- `as_trans = Transition("AS")`  
- `rt = Transition("RT")`  
- `tst = Transition("TST")`  
- `pk = Transition("PK")`  
- `lb = Transition("LB")`  
- `dp = Transition("DP")`  
- `d = Transition("D")`  
- `or_act = Transition("OR")`  
- `ms = Transition("MS")`  
- `qs = Transition("QS")`  
- `tau = SilentTransition()`

Now build the model:

###  **Final POWL Model**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define atomic transitions
OR = Transition("OR")
MS = Transition("MS")
QS = Transition("QS")
AS = Transition("AS")
IQC = Transition("IQC")
TST = Transition("TST")
RT = Transition("RT")
PK = Transition("PK")
LB = Transition("LB")
DP = Transition("DP")
D = Transition("D")
tau = SilentTransition()

# Loop 1: AS  *(IQC  AS, )
# First AS
# Then loop body: IQC  AS
loop1_body = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[IQC, AS])
loop1_body.order.add_edge(IQC, AS)
loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[loop1_body, tau])

# Loop 2: TST  *(RT  TST, )
loop2_body = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RT, TST])
loop2_body.order.add_edge(RT, TST)
loop2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[loop2_body, tau])

# Optional Labeling: X(LB, )
lb_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, tau])

# Now build the full sequential flow with partial order

# Nodes in top-level partial order
nodes = [
    OR,
    MS,
    QS,
    AS,           # first AS (before loop1)
    loop1,        # *(IQC  AS, )
    TST,          # first TST (before loop2)
    loop2,        # *(RT  TST, )
    PK,
    lb_choice,    # X(LB, )
    DP,
    D
]

# Create the root partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Define the full sequential dependency chain
# Each node must complete before the next one starts
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, AS)
root.order.add_edge(AS, loop1)
root.order.add_edge(loop1, TST)
root.order.add_edge(TST, loop2)
root.order.add_edge(loop2, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, lb_choice)
root.order.add_edge(lb_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# This model now captures:
# - OR  MS  QS  AS  *(IQC  AS, )  TST  *(RT  TST, )  PK  X(LB, )  DP  D
```

---

###  **Final POWL Structure (Textual Representation)**

We can represent the final model in **POWL notation** as:

```
PO = (
  nodes = {
    OR, MS, QS, AS,
    *(IQC  AS, ),
    TST,
    *(RT  TST, ),
    PK,
    X(LB, ),
    DP, D
  },
  order = {
    OR  MS,
    MS  QS,
    QS  AS,
    AS  *(IQC  AS, ),
    *(IQC  AS, )  TST,
    TST  *(RT  TST, ),
    *(RT  TST, )  PK,
    PK  X(LB, ),
    X(LB, )  DP,
    DP  D
  }
)
```

>  **Note**: `IQC  AS` is a **strict partial order** of two transitions, so it's a sequence.  
>  The loops and choice are modeled correctly with POWL operators.  
>  All concurrency is absent — the process is fully sequential except for the embedded loops and optional step.

This POWL model captures:
- The **mandatory sequence** of initial steps.
- The **repetitive assembly and quality check** loop.
- The **repetitive testing and re-testing** loop.
- The **optional labeling** step.
- The **mandatory final steps** (packaging  distribution planning  dispatch).

It is **complete, minimal, and matches all observed traces** in the event log.
