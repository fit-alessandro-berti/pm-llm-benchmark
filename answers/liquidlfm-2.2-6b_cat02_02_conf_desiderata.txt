### **1. Normative Violations (Strict Rule Breaches)**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Failure:**  
  - *Credit Check before Risk Assessment*: The credit check occurred at 08:20, before the risk assessment at 09:00.  
    - This violates the normative rule that **Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment**.  
  - *Finalize Documentation after Loan Decision (but at rejection time)*: The case was rejected at 09:00, but $Finalize Documentation$ was performed at 09:30 (still after decision, but critically, this follows the rejection rule that Disallowed Finalize Documentation after rejection—though timing of rejection at 09:00 and finalization at 09:30 slightly violates the tighter requirement).  
    - More importantly, **Following Normative  Inform Applicant**, the case was informed first, then documentation finalized *after* rejection, even though per normative, informing should occur after loan decision. However, **Key Normative** explicitly states that informing occurs *after* loan decision—hence, delaying information to inform after finalization at rejection without fully complying with decision-based flow is problematic.  
- **Recommendation for Improvement**:  
  Acceptable, but questionable timing. Ideally, inform the applicant **immediately after** receiving the decision outcome to ensure transparency. The current practice risks dissatisfaction but does not breach hard rules (if legally frame allows delaying brief case update to tighten compliance).  

#### **Case 3:**
- **Failure:**  
  - *Delayed Credit Check (24-hour desideratum violation)*: Credit check happened 14 days after application at 10:00 on January 14, missing the **ideal 24-hour** recommendation.  
  - *Late Risk Assessment and Early Loan Decision*: Risk assessment at 11:00, followed immediately by a **loan decision at 12:00** (skipping Natural readiness pauses).  
    - Skipping final review window violates the **Ordering Rules**: Risk Assessment must precede Loan Decision, and ideally, a short delay followed by decision ensures stability.  
  - *Late Inform Applicant (48-hour desideratum)*: The uninformed applicant should wait at least 48 hours after decision, but the credit check delay alone already signals poor practice.  
  - *No Follow-up Call*: Required under desiderata but entirely missing.  
- **Interpretation/Justification**:  
  - The skip of final review (despite risk assessment) and the rushed timelines likely stem from internal workload pressures or prioritization issues (e.g., frontline staff rushing toward closure).  
  - Missing desiderata (delaying, non-follow-up call) may reflect neglect of customer experience best practices, not malicious underclass.  
  - The extended credit wait (48 hours) might be genuine due to external factors (e.g., third-party systems slow), though it undermines desiderata alignment.

### **2. Desiderata Failures (Recommended but Not Strictly Enforced)**

#### **Case 2:**
- **Delayed Credit Check (14 days  24-hour guideline violation)**:  
  - Not critical for compliance, but reflects system bottleneck (e.g., backlogged credit-checking department).  
- **Late Documentation Finalization (after rejection)**:  
  - Not allowed per normative, but *allowed* in case 2 because **Finalize Documentation** occurs before close in the event of rejection. However, desideratum encourages informing *before* documentation finalization, which was not done.  
- **No Follow-up Call**:  
  - Recommended for drift prevention but absent, aligning not with marginal severity but opportunity loss.  

#### **Case 3:**
- **Extended Credit Check (14 days)**:  
  - Significant desideratum violation (25x normative lag).  
- **Late Risk Assessment & Follow-up Decision**:  
  - **Risk Assessment too soon** (after application receipt) undermines quality of decision.  
  - **No Inform Applicant** until near close (contrary to "prompt information" best practice).  
- **No Follow-up Call**:  
  - May reduce efficiency assertively, but conflates procedural continuity with customer care.  
- **Late Inform Applicant (48-hour guideline breach)**:  
  - Applicant was uninformed through the process, exacerbating dissatisfaction risk despite valid desideratum framing.  
- **Justification**:  
  - Rapid processing (likely calibrated to meet volume demands) sacrifices normative and desideratum standards.  
  - Social desk (inbound application feedback) delays test reliability and may fragment case audit trails (re-aggregation needed).

### **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violation(s)                                                   | Desiderata Failures                                                                                      |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | Credit Check < Risk Assessment, Finalize Documentation after rejection | Inform Applicant delayed (normative violation), No Follow-up Call (desideratum)|  
| 3    | No Credit Check within 24 hours, Late & Skipped Risk Step, Late Follow-up | Credit Check delay (Louisiana Time delay), Late Risk Assessment, No Follow-up Call, Late Inform |

### **Recommendations**  
- **For Case 2**: Strengthen cueing between Credit Check and Risk Assessment (e.g., workflow trigger). Re-evaluate inform timing—default to 1 hour of decision completion.  
- **For Case 3**: Implement tighter monitoring & alerts for desideratum breaches above business hours (e.g., automated SMS notifications for delays >24 hours).  
- Globally: Standardize follow-up call as non-optional post-loan decision to improve customer experience, even if just optional post-rejection. Train teams on balancing speed vs. compliance.
