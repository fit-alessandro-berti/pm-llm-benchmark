Based on the provided directly follows graph for the object-centric event log, several process and data-specific factors contribute to the performance issues in your process. Here are the primary root causes identified:

### 1. **Inefficient Vehicle Booking Processes**
- **High Duration in "Book Vehicles" Transitions:**
  - **"Book Vehicles" → "Book Vehicles"**: Duration = **295,965.56**
  - **"Book Vehicles" → "Load to Vehicle"**: Duration = **283,101.01**
  - **"Book Vehicles" → "Reschedule Container"**: Duration = **371,476.42**
  
  **Impact:** These high durations indicate significant delays and inefficiencies in the vehicle booking process. Frequent rescheduling and prolonged booking times can lead to bottlenecks, limiting the availability of trucks and delaying subsequent steps in the process.

### 2. **Delays in Container Management**
- **Prolonged Ordering and Picking Up Empty Containers:**
  - **"Order Empty Containers" → "Pick Up Empty Container"**: Duration = **368,943.92**
  - **"Order Empty Containers" → "Depart"**: Duration = **1,007,066.16**
  
  **Impact:** The extended time taken to order and pick up empty containers causes significant delays in container availability. This affects the loading processes and can create a cascading effect of delays throughout the supply chain.

- **Excessive Rescheduling of Containers:**
  - **"Reschedule Container" → "Load to Vehicle"**: Duration = **177,997.60**
  - **Multiple Rescheduling Transitions** with high durations (e.g., **"Reschedule Container" → "Reschedule Container"**: **8,635.50**)
  
  **Impact:** Frequent rescheduling indicates potential issues such as inaccurate demand forecasting, inventory mismatches, or logistical challenges. This leads to repeated adjustments in the process, increasing overall cycle time.

### 3. **Prolonged Departure Processes**
- **Extended Duration in Departure Steps:**
  - **"Depart" → "Depart"**: Duration = **1,051,301.41**
  - **"Reschedule Container" → "Depart"**: Duration = **275,189.97**
  - **"Depart" → "Reschedule Container"**: Duration = **255,614.86**
  
  **Impact:** These prolonged durations in departure-related transitions suggest inefficiencies in the final stages of the logistics process. Possible causes include delays in documentation, clearance procedures, or coordination issues between different departments or external partners.

### 4. **Stock Management Inefficiencies**
- **Long Duration in Stock Handling:**
  - **"Place in Stock" → "Bring to Loading Bay"**: Duration = **743,380.51**
  
  **Impact:** The significant time taken to move items from stock to the loading bay indicates potential issues in inventory management, such as poor stock organization, manual handling delays, or insufficient automation in the storage system.

### 5. **Truck Operations Delays**
- **High Duration in Truck Movement:**
  - **"Drive to Terminal" → "Load Truck"**: Duration = **84,119.09**
  
  **Impact:** Delays in truck movements between loading and terminal operations can disrupt the overall flow, causing trucks to remain idle longer than necessary and reducing throughput.

### 6. **Forklift Coordination Issues**
- **Extended Durations in Forklift-Related Transitions:**
  - **"Place in Stock" → "Bring to Loading Bay"**: Duration = **112,600.53**
  - **"Load to Vehicle" → "Weigh"**: Duration = **29,836.64**
  
  **Impact:** Inefficiencies in forklift operations can lead to delays in material handling, affecting the speed at which goods are moved and loaded, thereby slowing down the entire process.

### Summary of Root Causes:
1. **Vehicle Booking Inefficiencies:** High durations in booking and rescheduling vehicles.
2. **Container Management Delays:** Prolonged times in ordering, picking up, and rescheduling containers.
3. **Departure Process Bottlenecks:** Extended durations in departure-related transitions.
4. **Stock Handling Inefficiencies:** Long times in moving items from stock to loading bays.
5. **Truck Movement Delays:** High durations in truck operations between loading and terminal.
6. **Forklift Coordination Issues:** Extended durations in forklift-related material handling.

### Recommendations:
- **Optimize Vehicle Booking:** Implement automated booking systems, improve scheduling algorithms, and enhance coordination between departments to reduce booking and rescheduling times.
- **Streamline Container Processes:** Improve inventory forecasting, enhance container tracking systems, and reduce the need for frequent rescheduling.
- **Enhance Departure Procedures:** Automate documentation processes, improve inter-departmental communication, and streamline clearance procedures.
- **Improve Stock Management:** Utilize better inventory management systems, reorganize stock layout for faster access, and consider automation in stock handling.
- **Optimize Truck Operations:** Implement real-time tracking and better coordination between loading and terminal operations to minimize idle times.
- **Enhance Forklift Efficiency:** Provide better training, optimize forklift routing, and consider investing in more forklifts or automation to handle material movement more efficiently.

By addressing these specific process and data-related issues, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of your overall process.
