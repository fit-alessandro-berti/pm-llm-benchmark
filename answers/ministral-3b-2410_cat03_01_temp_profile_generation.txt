Certainly! Here's a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. The profile is expressed as a Python dictionary, with keys being tuples representing activity pairs and values being tuples of average and standard deviation times.

```python
p2p_temporal_profile = {
    ('P0', 'R1'): (86400, 1800),  # 1 day, 30 minutes
    ('P1', 'R1'): (86400, 1800),  # 1 day, 30 minutes
    ('R1', 'P2'): (3600, 600),    # 1 hour, 10 minutes
    ('P2', 'P3'): (3600, 600),    # 1 hour, 10 minutes
    ('P3', 'R2'): (7200, 900),    # 2 hours, 15 minutes
    ('R2', 'P4'): (21600, 3600),  # 6 hours, 30 minutes
    ('P4', 'R3'): (3600, 600),    # 1 hour, 10 minutes
    ('R3', 'P5'): (86400, 1800),  # 1 day, 30 minutes
    ('P5', 'A'): (3600, 600),     # 1 hour, 10 minutes
    ('A', 'R4'): (21600, 3600),   # 6 hours, 30 minutes
    ('R4', 'P6'): (86400, 1800)   # 1 day, 30 minutes
}

```

In this hypothetical purchase-to-pay process:

- **P0 to R1**: Average 1 day, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.
- **P1 to R1**: Average 1 day, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.
- **R1 to P2**: Average 1 hour, Standard Deviation 10 minutes.
- **P2 to P3**: Average 1 hour, Standard Deviation 10 minutes.
- **P3 to R2**: Average 2 hours, Standard Deviation 15 minutes.
- **R2 to P4**: Average 6 hours, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.
- **P4 to R3**: Average 1 hour, Standard Deviation 10 minutes.
- **R3 to P5**: Average 1 day, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.
- **P5 to A**: Average 1 hour, Standard Deviation 10 minutes.
- **A to R4**: Average 6 hours, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.
- **R4 to P6**: Average 1 day, Standard Deviation 30 minutes.

This profile can help in understanding the expected timing between different steps in the P2P process and in identifying potential deviations.
