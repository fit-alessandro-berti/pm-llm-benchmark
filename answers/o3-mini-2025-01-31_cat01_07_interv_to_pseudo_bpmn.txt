Below is a BPMN-like textual process model that combines the key steps, decision points, roles, and exceptions mentioned in the interviews. Note that where interview accounts differ slightly, the model notes the potential variation or feedback loop.


Start Event: Invoice Arrival  
  • Trigger: Invoice received via email.


Task 1: Receive and PreValidate Invoice  
  Actor: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  ­– Activity: Upon receiving the invoice, check for an associated valid Purchase Order (PO) number.  
  ­– Artifact: Invoice document.

Gateway 1: Valid PO Check  
  • Condition: Is there a valid PO number on the invoice?  
    - If NO (Missing PO):  
          Task 1A: Return invoice to supplier requesting additional details, including a valid PO number.  
               Actor: Mary (with input possibly from Supplier Relationship Manager, Karen, if needed)  
          End Path: Wait for a corrected invoice before re-entering the process.  
    - If YES:  
          Proceed to Task 2.


Task 2: Log Invoice into Accounting System  
  Actor: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  ­– Activity: Enter invoice details into the system.  
  ­– Artifact: Logged invoice record.


Task 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department  
  Actor: Accounts Payable (Mary)  
  ­– Activity: Send the logged invoice and PO data to Purchasing for confirmation of received goods/services.


Task 4: Confirm Goods/Services Receipt and PO Matching  
  Actor: Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
  ­– Activity:  
       • Review the PO details (quantities, pricing, delivery charges) against the invoice.  
       • Check confirmation that goods/services were received.  
  ­– Artifact: PO document and confirmation email.  

Gateway 2: PO and Invoice Detail Verification  
  • Condition: Do the invoice line items match the PO details?  
    - If YES:  
          Task 4A: Send a confirmation email back to Accounts Payable.  
               Actor: Purchasing (Dan)  
          Proceed to Task 5.  
    - If NO (Discrepancy Detected):  
          Task 4B:  
              • Resolve the discrepancy. Options include:  
                    - Contact the supplier directly (often with assistance from Supplier Relationship Manager, Karen) to obtain a corrected invoice or confirm contract details;  
                    - Request that Accounts Payable hold the invoice pending resolution.  
              • If the discrepancy cannot be resolved easily, escalate to the Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita).  
          Loop back: Once the discrepancy is resolved, re-confirm and then continue to Task 5.


Task 5: Match Invoice Line Items in System (Verification by AP)  
  Actor: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  ­– Activity: Compare the invoice details with the PO record (this may occur concurrently with or immediately after purchasing confirmation).  
  ­– Note: Minor variations exist in interview accounts regarding whether matching occurs before or after purchasing confirmation; here we assume a verification step before final approval.


Task 6: Initiate Manager Approval Process  
  Trigger: Both receipt confirmation and matching verification are complete.  
  Actor: System/Accounts Payable  
  ­– Activity: Automatically forward the invoice (with attached PO, confirmation emails, and discrepancy resolution notes, if any) to the Department Manager for final approval.  
  ­– Artifact: Automatic approval request email.


Task 7: Department Manager Review and Approval  
  Actor: Department Manager (Carlos)  
  ­– Activity:  
       • Review all details including invoice’s quantities, pricing, comparison against PO, and any notes regarding discrepancies.  
       • Decide whether the invoice is acceptable.  
  Gateway 3: Manager Decision  
       - If APPROVED:  
              Task 7A: Approve the invoice in the system.  
       - If REJECTED (e.g., unexpected differences with budgeted amounts or flagged issues):  
              Task 7B: Reject or hold the invoice and notify Accounts Payable (Mary) for further investigation.  
              Exception: This rejection initiates a rework loop (potentially involving further review, contacting suppliers, or additional verification steps with Purchasing or the AP Supervisor).


Task 8: Schedule Invoice for Payment  
  Actor: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  ­– Activity: After receiving the manager’s approval, schedule the invoice into the next payment cycle.  
  ­– Artifact: Payment schedule entry in the system.


End Event: Invoice Processing Complete/Main Flow  
  • Outcome: Invoice is either set for payment or, if unresolved issues remain, held for further action.


Exception Handling & Alternate Flow:  
  • If discrepancies are unresolved in Task 4B:  
       – Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) to negotiate or determine whether a retrospective PO may be created (especially for informal service invoices) or if the invoice should be rejected outright.  
       – Once resolved, the invoice re-enters at Task 4A (confirmation) and proceeds through the normal workflow.  
  • During Manager Review (Task 7), if issues are detected:  
       – The invoice is either rejected or flagged for additional investigation before re-submission, resulting in a potential loop back to Task 4 or Task 1A for rework with the supplier.


Notes on Ambiguities and Variations:  
  • There is slight ambiguity as to whether line-item matching occurs strictly after Purchasing confirmation or concurrently with it; this model places the matching verification at Task 5 following the Purchasing confirmation.  
  • In some reported cases, after Purchasing confirmation, the invoice may bypass some revalidation steps and move directly to Manager Request if no discrepancies are identified.  
  • Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) plays an indirect role—engaged via communications during disputes over missing PO numbers or pricing discrepancies.


Overall Process Flow Summary:  
1. Invoice received  Check for valid PO (yes/no decision)  Log invoice  Forward to Purchasing  
2. Purchasing verifies receipt and compares invoice to PO  Confirm or escalate resolution of discrepancies  
3. Accounts Payable matches invoice line items  Forward for Manager approval  
4. Manager reviews and approves/rejects invoice  On approval, schedule for payment; on rejection, initiate rework  
5. Exception processes via AP Supervisor handle unresolvable discrepancies or missing PO issues, with supplier contacts as needed.

This structured textual model can be directly used to create a detailed BPMN diagram showing events, tasks, decision gateways, roles, artifacts, and rework loops.
