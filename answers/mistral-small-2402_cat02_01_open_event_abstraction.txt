Event abstraction is a powerful concept that can significantly improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. Here are some ways it can be effectively utilized:

1. **Reducing Complexity**: By grouping similar events into abstract events or activities, the number of unique events in the model can be reduced, making it easier to understand and analyze.

2. **High-Level View**: Event abstraction allows for a higher-level view of the process. Instead of getting lost in the details of individual events, stakeholders can focus on the overall flow of the process.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Abstracting events can help identify patterns and frequent behavior in the process model, which can provide valuable insights for process improvement.

4. **Improving Scalability**: With fewer events to handle, abstract models can be more scalable, allowing for the analysis of larger and more complex event logs.

5. **Privacy Preservation**: In some cases, event abstraction can be used to anonymize sensitive data, preserving privacy while still allowing for process analysis.

To effectively utilize event abstraction, it's important to have a clear understanding of the process and its goals. The level of abstraction should be chosen carefully to strike a balance between simplicity and information loss.
