# **Process Mining-Based Optimization of Resource Assignment for TechSolve Solutions**

## **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

### **Key Metrics to Focus On:**
To assess agent and tier performance, the following metrics should be analyzed from the event log:

- **Workload Distribution:**
  - Number of tickets handled per agent per day/week.
  - Average handling time per agent/tier.
  - Peak workload periods and agent availability.

- **Activity Processing Times:**
  - Time taken per activity (e.g., L1 resolution time, L2 escalation time).
  - Average resolution time per agent/tier.
  - Comparison of resolution times for similar tickets across agents.

- **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate for L1:**
  - Percentage of tickets resolved by L1 without escalation.
  - FCR rate per agent and per ticket category.

- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:**
  - Which agents handle which ticket categories most frequently?
  - Are agents with specialized skills (e.g., "Networking-Firewall") consistently assigned to relevant tickets?

### **Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Pattern Analysis:**
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:**
  - Visualize how tickets flow between agents (e.g., frequent reassignments, unnecessary escalations).
  - Identify agents who frequently receive reassignments (indicating skill mismatches or workload imbalances).

- **Social Network Analysis (SNA):**
  - Map handovers between agents to identify bottlenecks (e.g., certain agents acting as "choke points").
  - Detect informal collaboration patterns (e.g., agents bypassing formal escalation paths).

- **Role Discovery:**
  - Compare actual agent behavior against their documented roles (e.g., L1 agents handling L2 tasks).
  - Identify agents who frequently work outside their assigned tier.

### **Skill Utilization Analysis:**
- **Skill Matching vs. Actual Assignments:**
  - Compare required skills (e.g., "App-CRM") with assigned agent skills.
  - Identify cases where specialists (L2/L3) were assigned to tasks that could have been handled by L1.

- **Underutilization of Specialized Skills:**
  - Are agents with rare skills (e.g., "Security-IAM") frequently idle or overloaded?
  - Are generalists (L1) handling tasks that could be delegated to specialists?

## **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

### **Key Bottlenecks and Problems:**
1. **Insufficient Availability of Specialized Skills:**
   - High delays when tickets require rare skills (e.g., "Database-SQL").
   - Frequent reassignments due to incorrect initial skill matching.

2. **Delays from Frequent Reassignments:**
   - Each reassignment adds ~10-15 minutes of delay (quantified via event log).
   - High reassignment rates correlate with SLA breaches (e.g., 30% of P2/P3 breaches linked to reassignments).

3. **Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
   - L1 agents escalating tickets prematurely (e.g., 40% of escalations could have been resolved by L1 with better training).
   - Dispatchers assigning tickets without considering agent workload.

4. **Underperforming or Overloaded Agents:**
   - Some agents have consistently high resolution times (indicating skill gaps or excessive workload).
   - Others have low utilization (indicating understaffing in certain skill areas).

5. **Correlation Between Assignment Patterns and SLA Breaches:**
   - Tickets reassigned 2+ times have a 60% higher SLA breach rate.
   - Tickets assigned to agents without the required skill have 40% longer resolution times.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

### **Potential Root Causes:**
1. **Deficient Assignment Rules:**
   - Current round-robin approach ignores skill requirements and workload.
   - No dynamic prioritization based on ticket urgency (e.g., P2 tickets waiting behind P3).

2. **Inaccurate Agent Skill Profiles:**
   - Skills are not updated in real-time (e.g., agents gain new certifications but profiles remain outdated).
   - Some agents self-assign tickets outside their expertise.

3. **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization:**
   - Required skills are misidentified (e.g., "Software-App" ticket incorrectly tagged as "Network").
   - L1 agents lack tools to accurately assess ticket complexity.

4. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Dispatchers assign tickets without seeing agent workload or availability.
   - No predictive analytics to anticipate skill shortages.

5. **Insufficient L1 Training:**
   - L1 agents escalate too quickly due to lack of troubleshooting knowledge.
   - No feedback loop to improve initial categorization.

### **Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Compare smooth assignments (few reassignments) vs. problematic cases (many reassignments).
  - Identify patterns (e.g., tickets with vague descriptions lead to more reassignments).

- **Decision Mining:**
  - Analyze escalation decisions (e.g., why was a ticket escalated when an L1 agent could have resolved it?).
  - Detect biases in assignment logic (e.g., certain agents always assigned to high-priority tickets).

## **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

### **Proposed Strategies:**

#### **1. Skill-Based Routing with Workload Awareness**
- **Problem Addressed:** Frequent reassignments due to skill mismatches.
- **Implementation:**
  - Use process mining to identify which skills are most in demand.
  - Assign tickets based on agent skills + current workload (e.g., least busy agent with required skill).
- **Data Required:**
  - Agent skill profiles, real-time workload metrics.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - 30% reduction in reassignments.
  - 20% improvement in SLA compliance.

#### **2. Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics**
- **Problem Addressed:** Incorrect initial categorization leading to escalations.
- **Implementation:**
  - Train a model on historical data to predict required skills from ticket descriptions.
  - Auto-assign tickets to agents with matching skills.
- **Data Required:**
  - Ticket descriptions, historical skill requirements.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - 25% fewer unnecessary escalations.
  - Faster resolution for high-priority tickets.

#### **3. Dynamic Tier Reallocation Based on Demand**
- **Problem Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution (some agents overloaded, others idle).
- **Implementation:**
  - Use real-time data to shift agents between tiers (e.g., move L2 agents to L1 during peak hours).
  - Implement a "skill pool" where agents can temporarily assist in other tiers.
- **Data Required:**
  - Real-time queue lengths, agent availability.
- **Expected Benefits:**
  - 15% reduction in resolution times.
  - Better utilization of specialized skills.

## **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

### **Business Process Simulation:**
- Use the mined process models to simulate different assignment strategies.
- Test scenarios like:
  - "What if we implement skill-based routing?"
  - "What if we reduce L1 escalations by 20%?"
- Validate expected improvements before full deployment.

### **Post-Implementation Monitoring Plan:**
- **Key KPIs to Track:**
  - SLA compliance rate per priority.
  - Number of reassignments per ticket.
  - Agent utilization rates (overloaded vs. underutilized).
  - First-call resolution (FCR) rate.

- **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  - Real-time visualization of ticket flow and agent assignments.
  - Alerts for bottlenecks (e.g., high queue lengths for a specific skill).
  - Comparative analysis of pre- vs. post-optimization performance.

### **Conclusion:**
By leveraging process mining to analyze resource behavior, identify bottlenecks, and implement data-driven assignment strategies, TechSolve can significantly improve efficiency, reduce SLA breaches, and optimize agent utilization. Continuous monitoring ensures sustained improvements.
