## 1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Rules):

**Case 2 clearly violates normative rules.**

**Reasons:**
- **Order Violation:**  
  The **Risk Assessment** (08:20) was performed **before** the **Credit Check** (09:00). According to the given strict sequence, "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."
  
- **Post-Rejection Activity Violation:**  
  After the **Loan Decision was "Rejected" (09:30)**, the activity **"Finalize Documentation" (10:00)** was performed. According to the normative rule, "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation."   

Thus, Case 2 violates the normative rules in two critical ways:
- Incorrect order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
- Performing disallowed documentation finalization after rejection.

## 2. Deviations from Recommended Practices (Desiderata):

**Case 3 violates desiderata (recommended but not strictly required conditions).**

**Specific Desiderata Violations in Case 3:**
- **Delayed Credit Check:**  
  The Credit Check (2024-01-14 10:00) occurred more than **48 hours after** Application Received (2024-01-12 09:00), which significantly exceeds the recommended 24-hour window.
  
- **Delayed Informing of Applicant:**  
  The applicant was informed (2024-01-16 15:00), more than **48 hours after** the Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00), exceeding the recommended time for informing the applicant promptly.
  
- **Missing Follow-up Call:**  
  The optional but recommended Follow-up Call before closing the case was not performed at all.

These issues are not severe normative violations, but reflect suboptimal process execution according to recommended best practices.

## 3. Interpretations and Possible Justifications:

### **Case 1 (Fully Normative and Optimal):**  
- Case 1 strictly adheres to all normative constraints and time recommendations. It completes all activities in the correct sequence and within recommended time intervals. Thus, it provides an example of ideal behavior.

### **Case 2 (Normative Violations):**   
- The process deviation observed (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) may represent human or technical error or misunderstanding of process sequences.  
- Finalizing documentation after a rejection is likely a more serious error in usage or misunderstanding, as it directly contradicts explicitly stated normative logic.  
- This case should trigger an immediate investigation into training or system checks to avoid future occurrences.

### **Case 3 (Desiderata deviations):**  
- Delays in Credit Check and informing applicants might hint toward understaffing, resource bottlenecks, or increased workload during that period. While these delays violate only softer guidelines (desiderata), addressing their underlying reasons can foster improved efficiency.   
- The missing Follow-up Call, while not mandatory, suggests missed opportunities for enhancing customer experience and satisfaction. Stakeholders might review its potential impact and balance benefits versus feasibility.

### **Summary Table**

| Case ID | Normative Violations | Desiderata Deviations                         | Notes & Potential Justification |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 1       | None               | None                                         | Ideal execution; exemplar scenario. |
| 2       |  **Yes**           | None detected                                  | Serious normative violations. Needs investigation and corrective action. |
| 3       | None               |  Yes: Delayed Credit Check, Delayed Applicant Notification, Missing Follow-up Call | Non-critical suboptimality; possibly due to resource constraints. Consider improving the timeliness and engagement. |

## **Overall Recommendation:**

- Immediately address normative violations evidenced in **Case 2** due to their critical nature.
- For **Case 3**, investigate timings and consider improvements, noting they are desirable rather than mandatory improvements for overall process efficiency and customer satisfaction.
