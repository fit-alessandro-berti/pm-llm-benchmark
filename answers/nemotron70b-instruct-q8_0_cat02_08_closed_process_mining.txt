Below are the requested concepts for each item on your list in the field of process mining, including:

1. **The Opposite Concept**: A concept that is essentially the reverse or antithesis of the original.
2. **A More General Concept**: A broader concept under which the original could be categorized.

### 1. Automated Process Discovery

* **Original Concept**: Automated Process Discovery - Refers to the automatic generation of process models from event logs without manual intervention.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Manual Process Mapping** - Involves the creation of process models solely through human effort, without the aid of automated tools or algorithms, relying on observation, interviews, and documentation review.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Identification Techniques** - Encompasses all methods (automated, semi-automated, and manual) used to recognize, understand, and document business processes.

### 2. Predictive Monitoring

* **Original Concept**: Predictive Monitoring - Utilizes data and statistical models to forecast future states or anomalies in ongoing processes.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Retroactive Analysis** - Focuses solely on analyzing what has already occurred within a process, without attempting to predict future outcomes.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Analytics** - A broader term that covers all types of analysis (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive) applied to process data.

### 3. Bottom-up Discovery

* **Original Concept**: Bottom-up Discovery - Involves starting with detailed, individual elements (e.g., activities, events) and synthesizing them into a comprehensive process view.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Top-down Approach** - Begins with an overview or high-level understanding of the process and then drills down into the finer details.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Elucidation Methods** - Spans all systematic approaches used to clarify and delineate process structures, whether starting from general overviews or specific details.

### 4. Process Simulation

* **Original Concept**: Process Simulation - The imitation of a process model over time to understand its dynamic behavior and potential outcomes.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Live Process Execution** - Involves the actual running of processes in real-world conditions, as opposed to simulated environments.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Evaluation Strategies** - Includes all tactics (simulation, prototyping, piloting, live execution with monitoring) used to assess and improve process performance.

### 5. Process Efficiency

* **Original Concept**: Process Efficiency - Measures how well the output of a process is produced relative to the resources consumed.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Process Inefficiency** - Specifically focuses on identifying and quantifying wasted resources, unnecessary complexities, or suboptimal outcomes within processes.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Performance Metrics** - Covers all measurable aspects (efficiency, effectiveness, cycle time, throughput, etc.) used to assess process quality and identify areas for improvement.

### 6. Real-time Monitoring

* **Original Concept**: Real-time Monitoring - The continuous observation and analysis of process activities as they occur.
* **The Opposite Concept**: **Periodic Auditing** - Involves examining process performance at discrete intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), rather than continuously.
* **A More General Concept**: **Process Surveillance Strategies** - Encompasses all approaches (real-time monitoring, scheduled audits, ad-hoc checks) organizations use to oversee and manage their processes.
