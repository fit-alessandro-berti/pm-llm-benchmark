### **Analysis and Renaming of Activities in the Support Workflow**

---

### **Step 1: Identify Recurring Activities and Their Contextual Differences**

We observe that the following activities occur more than once within individual cases:

- **Verify Documents** – Appears twice in C001, C002, and C003.
- **Call Customer** – Appears twice in C002 and C003.
- **Adjust Account** – Only appears once per case (no recurrence), so no renaming needed.
- **Approve Request** – Only once per case.

Let’s analyze each recurring activity:

---

####  **Verify Documents** (Recurring)
- **First occurrence**: Initial check of identity documents after request initiation.
- **Second occurrence**: Re-check after additional documents were submitted or after account adjustments.
- **Contextual difference**:
  - First: **Initial verification** – based on original submission.
  - Second: **Re-verification** – after missing data was provided or internal changes were made.
- **Key clue**: In C001, the second `Verify Documents` happens *after* `Submit Additional`, indicating it’s a follow-up. In C003, it occurs *after* `Adjust Account`, suggesting it’s validating updated info.

 **Conclusion**: Two distinct phases:
1. Initial document verification.
2. Post-correction or post-submission re-verification.

---

####  **Call Customer** (Recurring)
- **First occurrence** (C002): Outbound call to **clarify an issue** (account discrepancy).
- **Second occurrence** (C002): Follow-up call to **confirm resolution** after adjustment.
- **C003**: First call is to **retrieve the customer** (they stepped out), not to discuss an issue.
- **Contextual difference**:
  - First call: **Proactive outreach** to gather information or resolve an issue.
  - Second call: **Confirmation or closure** call after action taken.
- **Key clue**: In C002, the second call is labeled “Follow-up to confirm adjustments” — clearly a closure step.

 **Conclusion**: Two distinct purposes:
1. **Issue Clarification Call** – to gather missing data or resolve discrepancies.
2. **Resolution Confirmation Call** – to verify that changes were made and customer is informed.

### **Step 2: Rename Activities to Reflect Context**

| Original Activity | Renamed to (Contextual Name) | Justification |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `Verify Documents` (first) | `Verify Documents – Initial` | First check after request; foundational step. |
| `Verify Documents` (second) | `Verify Documents – Re-verification` | Occurs after new data or internal changes; validation after correction. |
| `Call Customer` (first) | `Call Customer – Issue Clarification` | Used to resolve discrepancies or missing info. |
| `Call Customer` (second) | `Call Customer – Resolution Confirmation` | Follow-up to confirm actions were taken and customer is satisfied. |

> Note: In C003, the first `Call Customer` is not about a discrepancy but about retrieving the customer. However, since the intent is to **facilitate the process** (get the customer back), it still falls under **Issue Clarification** in a broader sense — the process is stalled due to absence. So it’s contextually aligned with the first call type.

### **Step 3: Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities**

```  
| Case ID | Activity                            | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |

```

### **Step 4: Justification of Naming Choices**

| Activity | New Name | Justification |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| `Verify Documents`  `Verify Documents – Initial` | First verification step after request; foundational and unconditioned on prior actions. | All cases begin with this. Context: no prior data or changes. |
| `Verify Documents`  `Verify Documents – Re-verification` | Occurs after document submission (C001), account adjustment (C003), or internal correction. | Indicates validation *after* a change or update. Clear distinction from initial check. |
| `Call Customer`  `Call Customer – Issue Clarification` | Used to resolve ambiguity, missing data, or discrepancies. Applies to C001 (missing docs), C002 (discrepancy), C003 (customer absent). | All are proactive calls to **unblock** the process. |
| `Call Customer`  `Call Customer – Resolution Confirmation` | Follow-up call to confirm that actions were taken and the customer is informed. | Only in C002 and C003, after internal changes. Explicitly labeled “follow-up” and “confirm” in context. |

---

###  **Summary of Key Improvements**

- **Eliminated ambiguity**: The same activity name no longer masks different roles.
- **Improved process clarity**: Each activity now reflects its *purpose* in the workflow.
- **Supports process mining & analysis**: Enables accurate discovery of subprocesses (e.g., re-verification loops, confirmation phases).
- **Enhances auditability and training**: New names make it easier to understand what happened and why.

###  Final Note:
This renaming strategy aligns with best practices in **event log preprocessing** for **process mining**, where **activity semantics** must be preserved and disambiguated based on **context, sequence, and outcome**. The new names are **descriptive, consistent, and actionable**.
