<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from the event_log table except those that belong to cases which have a specific sequence of activities and a time condition. 

First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The main task is to exclude cases that have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in direct succession. Additionally, the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' must be more than 5 days. So, any case that meets both these conditions should be excluded from the final result.

Let me break down the steps needed:

1. **Identify the sequence of activities in direct succession**: For each case, check if there are three consecutive events with the exact activities in order. Since they need to be in direct succession, there shouldn't be any other events from the same case between them. 

2. **Check the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'**: For the cases that have the sequence, calculate the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. If this duration is more than 5 days, those cases should be excluded.

3. **Exclude those cases from the final result**: The final query should return all events except those from the cases identified in steps 1 and 2.

Now, how to approach this in SQL?

For the first part, identifying the sequence, I think using window functions might help. For each event, I can look at the previous two events in the same case and check if they form the required sequence. But since the events need to be in direct succession, the timestamps should be ordered, and there should be no gaps. 

Alternatively, maybe using a self-join approach. For each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event, check if there's a 'Create Order' event after it in the same case, and then a 'Confirm Order' after that. But ensuring that there are no other events in between is tricky. 

Wait, the problem states that the three activities must appear in direct succession. So, for a case to have this sequence, there must be three consecutive events in the order specified. So, for each case, we can order the events by timestamp and check if there are three consecutive rows where the activities are exactly the required ones.

So, perhaps for each case, we can assign a row number ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to do that in SQL? Maybe using window functions to get the previous two activities. For example, for each event, look at the previous two events in the same case. If the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the previous one should be nothing (since it's the first in the sequence), but wait, no. Wait, the sequence is three activities in order. So, for a case to have this sequence, there must be three events in a row with those activities. 

So, for each case, we can order the events by timestamp. Then, for each event, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next event (row number +1) is 'Create Order', and the one after that (row number +2) is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to check that these three events are consecutive? Because if there are other events in between, then they are not in direct succession. So, the row numbers must be consecutive. 

So, for each case, assign a row number ordered by timestamp. Then, for each row, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next row (row_num +1) is 'Create Order', and the row after that (row_num +2) is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to get the next rows? Maybe using lag or lead functions. Alternatively, for each event, check if there exists a 'Create Order' event after it in the same case, and then a 'Confirm Order' after that. But that might not ensure that they are consecutive. 

Alternatively, for each case, we can look for the sequence of three activities in order. So, for each case, we can generate a list of activities in order and check if the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' appears as a substring. 

But in SQL, that's a bit challenging. Maybe using a window function to get the previous two activities. For example, for each event, look at the previous two events in the same case. If the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the previous one should be nothing (since it's the first in the sequence), but that's not right. Wait, the sequence is three activities in order. So, for a case to have this sequence, there must be three events in a row with those activities. 

So, for each case, we can order the events by timestamp. Then, for each event, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next event (row number +1) is 'Create Order', and the one after that (row number +2) is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to get the next events? Maybe using a window function with a frame that looks ahead. For example, using the LEAD function. 

Alternatively, for each case, we can create a window that orders the events by timestamp and then check for the sequence. 

Let me think of an example. Suppose a case has events in the order: Approve, Create, Confirm. Then, for the first event (Approve), the next two events are Create and Confirm. So, in this case, the sequence is present. 

But if there are other events in between, like Approve, X, Create, Confirm, then the sequence is not in direct succession. 

So, the key is that the three activities must be consecutive in the ordered list of events for the case. 

So, the approach could be:

- For each case, order the events by timestamp.
- For each event, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next event (row number +1) is 'Create Order', and the one after that (row number +2) is 'Confirm Order'. 

But how to get the next events? Using the LEAD function. 

For example, for each row in the ordered list, we can get the activity of the next row (LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)), and the activity after that (LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)). 

Then, for each row where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check if the next two activities are 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' respectively. 

But this would only check for the sequence starting at that row. However, there could be multiple such sequences in a case. But for the purpose of this problem, we just need to know if the case has at least one such sequence. 

Once we identify such cases, we need to check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence. 

So, for each such sequence, we need to find the timestamp of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' and calculate the difference. If that difference is more than 5 days, then the case should be excluded. 

But how to get the timestamps for those specific events in the sequence? 

Once we have identified the cases that have the sequence, we can then for each of those cases, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events that are part of the sequence. 

But this might be complicated. 

Alternatively, once we have the cases that have the sequence, we can for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events that are part of the sequence. 

But perhaps a better approach is to first find all cases that have the sequence, then for each of those cases, check the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence. 

But how to link the sequence to the specific 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events? 

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. For each case, order the events by timestamp. 

2. For each event in the case, check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next event is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. 

3. For each such case, collect the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events that are part of this sequence. 

4. Calculate the time difference between these two events. 

5. If the difference is more than 5 days, mark the case as to be excluded. 

6. Finally, exclude all events from such cases. 

But how to implement this in SQL?

Let me think of the first part: identifying the cases with the sequence. 

We can use a window function to get the next two activities. 

For example:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        rn,
        activity,
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity2
    FROM ordered_events
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM sequence_check
WHERE activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order';

This would give us the case_ids that have the required sequence. 

But wait, this would check for each event in the case. For example, if a case has multiple instances of the sequence, it would be counted multiple times, but we just need to know if the case has at least one such sequence. 

Once we have these case_ids, the next step is to check for each of them whether the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days. 

But how to get the timestamps for those specific events? 

In the sequence_check CTE, for each row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next_activity1 is 'Create Order' and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order'. So, for that row, the 'Create Order' event is the next one (rn +1), and 'Confirm Order' is rn +2. 

So, for each such case, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' (which is the timestamp of the row with rn +1) and the 'Confirm Order' (rn +2). 

But how to get those timestamps? 

Alternatively, for each case that has the sequence, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events that are part of the sequence. 

But perhaps we can join the sequence_check with the original event_log to get the timestamps. 

Alternatively, in the sequence_check CTE, for each row that meets the condition (activity is 'Approve', next is 'Create', next next is 'Confirm'), we can get the timestamp of the 'Create' and 'Confirm' events. 

Wait, the 'Create Order' event is the next one after the 'Approve' event. So, in the ordered_events CTE, for a row with rn = x, the 'Create Order' is at rn = x+1, and 'Confirm' at x+2. 

So, for each such row in sequence_check, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' (which is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1) and the 'Confirm' (rn = x+2). 

But how to get those timestamps? 

Maybe we can join the sequence_check with the ordered_events again. 

Alternatively, in the sequence_check CTE, we can also get the timestamps of the next two events. 

Wait, the ordered_events CTE has the timestamp for each row. So, for a row in sequence_check where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity1 is 'Create Order' (from the next row), and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order' (from the row after that). 

So, the 'Create Order' event's timestamp is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1, and the 'Confirm' is rn = x+2. 

So, in the sequence_check CTE, for each row that meets the condition, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

But how? 

Maybe we can use the row number to get those timestamps. 

Alternatively, for each case that has the sequence, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But this might require a subquery. 

Alternatively, once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we can for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But how to ensure that those events are part of the sequence? 

Alternatively, for each case in the sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But this might be complex. 

Alternatively, once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we can for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But how? 

Maybe for each case in the sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' event that is immediately after the 'Approve' event, and the 'Confirm' event that is immediately after the 'Create Order' event. 

So, for each case in the sequence_check, we can get the 'Create Order' event's timestamp and the 'Confirm' event's timestamp. 

But how to get those timestamps? 

Perhaps, in the sequence_check CTE, for each row that meets the condition (activity is 'Approve', next is 'Create', next next is 'Confirm'), we can get the timestamp of the 'Create' and 'Confirm' events. 

But how? 

The 'Create Order' event is the next row after the 'Approve' event. So, in the ordered_events CTE, for a row with rn = x, the 'Create Order' is at rn = x+1. 

So, in the sequence_check CTE, for each such row, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' (which is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1) and the 'Confirm' (rn = x+2). 

But how to get those timestamps in the same query? 

Maybe we can join the sequence_check with the ordered_events again. 

Alternatively, in the sequence_check CTE, we can include the timestamps of the next two events. 

Wait, the ordered_events CTE has the timestamp for each row. So, for a row in sequence_check where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity1 is 'Create Order' (from the next row), and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order' (from the row after that). 

So, the 'Create Order' event's timestamp is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1, and the 'Confirm' is rn = x+2. 

But how to get those timestamps in the same query? 

Maybe we can use a subquery or a join. 

Alternatively, for each case in the sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But this might require a subquery. 

Alternatively, once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we can for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence.

But how? 

Maybe for each case in the sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' event that is immediately after the 'Approve' event. 

But this requires that for each 'Approve' event in the sequence, there is a 'Create Order' next, and then a 'Confirm' after that. 

So, for each such case, the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events are part of the sequence. 

So, for each case in the sequence_check, we can get the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

But how to get their timestamps? 

Perhaps, in the sequence_check CTE, we can also get the timestamps of the next two events. 

Wait, the ordered_events CTE has the timestamp for each row. So, for a row in sequence_check where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity1 is 'Create Order' (from the next row), and next_activity2 is 'Confirm Order' (from the row after that). 

So, the 'Create Order' event's timestamp is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1, and the 'Confirm' is rn = x+2. 

But how to get those timestamps in the same query? 

Maybe we can use a subquery to get those timestamps. 

Alternatively, for each case in the sequence_check, we can find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

But this might require multiple steps.

But this might require joining the sequence_check with the ordered_events again. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can create a CTE that for each case, finds the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But this is getting complicated. 

Let me think of another approach. 

Once we have the case_ids that have the sequence, we can for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events that are part of the sequence. 

But how? 

For example, for a case_id, we can find all 'Create Order' events that are immediately after an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event, and then check if there is a 'Confirm Order' event after that. 

But this might not be efficient. 

Alternatively, for each case, we can find all instances where 'Approve' is followed by 'Create' and then 'Confirm' in order. 

Once we have those cases, we can then for each such case, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

But how to get their timestamps? 

Maybe for each case in the sequence_check, we can get the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

But perhaps the key is that for each case in the sequence_check, the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events are part of the sequence. 

So, for each such case, we can get the 'Create Order' event's timestamp and the 'Confirm' event's timestamp. 

But how to get those timestamps? 

Maybe in the sequence_check CTE, for each row that meets the condition (activity is 'Approve', next is 'Create', next next is 'Confirm'), we can get the timestamp of the 'Create' and 'Confirm' events. 

But how? 

The 'Create Order' event is the next row after the 'Approve' event. So, in the ordered_events CTE, for a row with rn = x, the 'Create Order' is at rn = x+1. 

So, in the sequence_check CTE, for each row that meets the condition, we can get the timestamp of the 'Create Order' (which is the timestamp of the row with rn = x+1) and the 'Confirm' (rn = x+2). 

But how to get those timestamps in the same query? 

Maybe we can use a subquery to get those timestamps. 

Alternatively, we can join the sequence_check with the ordered_events again. 

For example:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT 
    sc.case_id,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 1) AS create_order_time,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 2) AS confirm_order_time
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order';

This would give us for each case that has the sequence, the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

Then, we can calculate the time difference between these two timestamps. 

Once we have that, we can filter the cases where the difference is more than 5 days. 

Once we have those case_ids, we can exclude all events from those cases. 

So, the final query would be to select all events from event_log where case_id is not in the list of case_ids that meet both the sequence and the time condition. 

Putting it all together:

First, find the case_ids that have the sequence. Then, for each of those case_ids, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' is more than 5 days. 

So, the steps in code would be:

1. Find all case_ids that have the sequence. 

2. For each of those case_ids, find the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events in the sequence. 

3. Calculate the time difference between those two events. 

4. Filter the case_ids where the difference is more than 5 days. 

5. Exclude all events from those case_ids. 

So, the final query would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    -- subquery to get case_ids that have the sequence and time condition
);

Now, the challenge is to write the subquery that gets the case_ids that meet both conditions. 

Let me try to write that subquery. 

First, the sequence_check CTE as before. 

Then, for each case in sequence_check, get the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' timestamps. 

Then, calculate the difference. 

So, the subquery could be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT 
    sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (
      (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 1) 
      - (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 2)
  ) > INTERVAL '5 days';

Wait, but the timestamp difference would be (confirm_order_time - create_order_time) > 5 days. 

But in SQL, subtracting two timestamps gives an interval. So, we can compare that interval to INTERVAL '5 days'. 

But in DuckDB, the syntax for intervals might be different. 

Alternatively, we can calculate the difference in days. 

But perhaps using the interval is better. 

But in the subquery, for each row in sequence_check, we need to get the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' timestamps. 

But the problem is that for each row in sequence_check, the 'Create Order' is at rn +1, and 'Confirm' at rn +2. 

So, for each such row, we can get those timestamps. 

But in the subquery, we can't directly reference the ordered_events table again unless we have it in the CTE. 

Alternatively, we can join the sequence_check with the ordered_events to get the timestamps. 

Wait, the sequence_check CTE already has the ordered_events data. So, for each row in sequence_check, the 'Create Order' is the next row (rn +1), and 'Confirm' is rn +2. 

So, in the sequence_check CTE, we can get the timestamps of those rows. 

But how? 

Maybe we can use a subquery to get the timestamps. 

Alternatively, in the sequence_check CTE, we can include the timestamps of the next two events. 

But that would require joining with the ordered_events again. 

Alternatively, for each row in sequence_check, we can get the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' timestamps by joining with the ordered_events table. 

For example:

SELECT 
    sc.case_id,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 1) AS create_order_time,
    (SELECT timestamp FROM ordered_events WHERE case_id = sc.case_id AND rn = sc.rn + 2) AS confirm_order_time
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order';

This would give us for each case that has the sequence, the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm' events. 

Then, we can calculate the difference between these two timestamps. 

So, the subquery would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT 
    sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
JOIN ordered_events co ON sc.case_id = co.case_id AND co.rn = sc.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events co2 ON sc.case_id = co2.case_id AND co2.rn = sc.rn + 2
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days';

Wait, but in this case, the 'co' is the 'Create Order' event (rn = sc.rn +1), and 'co2' is the 'Confirm' event (rn = sc.rn +2). 

So, the difference between co2.timestamp and co.timestamp should be more than 5 days. 

But in DuckDB, the subtraction of two timestamps gives an interval. So, (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) would be an interval. 

So, comparing that to INTERVAL '5 days' would work. 

But I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. 

Once we have this subquery that returns the case_ids that meet both conditions, we can then exclude those case_ids from the final result. 

So, the final query would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    -- the subquery above
);

But there's a problem here. The subquery might return multiple rows for the same case_id if there are multiple sequences in the same case. But since we are using DISTINCT in the subquery, that's okay. 

Wait, in the sequence_check CTE, we are selecting sc.case_id, but in the final subquery, we are selecting sc.case_id. However, if a case has multiple sequences (like multiple instances of the three activities in order), then the same case_id would be returned multiple times. But using NOT IN would still work, as it's a set. 

But in the subquery, we need to make sure that we are getting distinct case_ids. 

So, adding DISTINCT in the subquery. 

So, the subquery would be:

SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
JOIN ordered_events co ON sc.case_id = co.case_id AND co.rn = sc.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events co2 ON sc.case_id = co2.case_id AND co2.rn = sc.rn + 2
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days';

This would give us the case_ids that have at least one sequence meeting both conditions. 

Then, the final query is to select all events where case_id is not in this list. 

But there's another thing to consider: the same case might have multiple sequences. But since we are using DISTINCT, it's okay. 

Now, putting all this together into a single query. 

But in DuckDB, can we have nested CTEs? Yes. 

So, the full query would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT 
    sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
JOIN ordered_events co ON sc.case_id = co.case_id AND co.rn = sc.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events co2 ON sc.case_id = co2.case_id AND co2.rn = sc.rn + 2
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
    FROM sequence_check sc
    JOIN ordered_events co ON sc.case_id = co.case_id AND co.rn = sc.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events co2 ON sc.case_id = co2.case_id AND co2.rn = sc.rn + 2
    WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
      AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

But wait, in the sequence_check CTE, the 'next_activity1' and 'next_activity2' are already calculated. So, in the subquery, we can use those instead of joining again. 

So, the subquery can be simplified. 

Instead of joining with ordered_events again, we can use the next_activity1 and next_activity2 from the sequence_check CTE. 

So, the subquery can be:

SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days';

Wait, but in this case, how do we get co and co2? 

Ah, right, in the sequence_check CTE, we don't have the timestamps of the next events. So, we need to join with ordered_events again to get the timestamps. 

So, the previous approach is necessary. 

But in the sequence_check CTE, we have the rn for each event. So, for each row in sequence_check, the 'Create Order' is at rn +1, and 'Confirm' at rn +2. 

So, in the subquery, we can join with ordered_events to get the timestamps for those rn values. 

So, the subquery would be:

SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
JOIN ordered_events co ON sc.case_id = co.case_id AND co.rn = sc.rn + 1
JOIN ordered_events co2 ON sc.case_id = co2.case_id AND co2.rn = sc.rn + 2
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (co2.timestamp - co.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days';

This should work. 

But there's a possible issue here: if a case has multiple sequences, this would return the same case_id multiple times, but using DISTINCT would handle that. 

Now, the final query is to select all events where case_id is not in this list. 

But what about cases that have the sequence but the time difference is less than or equal to 5 days? They should not be excluded. 

So, the subquery correctly filters out only those cases where the time difference is more than 5 days. 

Therefore, the final query would exclude those cases. 

But there's another thing to consider: the same case might have multiple sequences. For example, a case could have multiple instances of the three activities in order. But since we are using DISTINCT, it's okay. 

Now, testing this query. 

But what if a case has the sequence but the time between 'Create' and 'Confirm' is exactly 5 days? Then, it's not excluded. 

Yes, because the condition is 'more than 5 days'. 

Another thing: the timestamps are in datetime format. So, the subtraction would give the correct interval. 

But in DuckDB, the syntax for intervals is correct. 

Now, what about cases where the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events are not part of the sequence? For example, if a case has the sequence but also other events. But the sequence_check CTE would only consider the rows where the three activities are in order. 

So, the subquery correctly identifies the cases that have at least one such sequence with the time condition. 

Therefore, the final query should work. 

But let me check for possible errors. 

For example, in the sequence_check CTE, the LEAD functions are used. The LEAD function with a window of 1 and 2. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Another thing: the row numbers are assigned per case, ordered by timestamp. So, the rn is correct. 

Another possible issue: if a case has multiple 'Approve' events, each followed by 'Create' and 'Confirm', then the same case_id would be included multiple times in the subquery. But with DISTINCT, it's handled. 

So, the final query should correctly exclude all events from cases that have at least one such sequence with the time condition. 

Therefore, the final SQL query should be as written above. 

But I need to make sure that the subquery is correctly structured. 

Another thing: in the sequence_check CTE, the 'next_activity1' and 'next_activity2' are the activities of the next and next next rows. 

So, for a row in sequence_check where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity1 is 'Create' and next_activity2 is 'Confirm', then that row is part of a valid sequence. 

So, the subquery correctly identifies those cases. 

Therefore, the final query should work. 

But I should also make sure that the timestamps are correctly retrieved. 

Another possible optimization: instead of joining ordered_events twice, maybe we can get the timestamps in the sequence_check CTE. 

But that would require more complex window functions. 

Alternatively, in the sequence_check CTE, we can get the timestamps of the next two events. 

But that would require using LEAD on the timestamp as well. 

For example:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS create_order_time,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT 
    sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (sc.confirm_order_time - sc.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days';

This way, we can avoid joining with ordered_events again. 

This would be more efficient. 

Yes, this is better. 

So, in the sequence_check CTE, we can use LEAD on the timestamp as well. 

So, the sequence_check CTE would have:

LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) AS create_order_time,
LEAD(ce.timestamp, 2) AS confirm_order_time

Then, in the WHERE clause, we can check if (confirm_order_time - create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'. 

This would simplify the subquery. 

So, the revised sequence_check CTE would be:

sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS create_order_time,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events ce
)

Then, the subquery becomes:

SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
FROM sequence_check sc
WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
  AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (sc.confirm_order_time - sc.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days';

This is better because it avoids multiple joins. 

So, this would be more efficient. 

Therefore, the final query would be:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS create_order_time,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
    FROM sequence_check sc
    WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
      AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (sc.confirm_order_time - sc.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

This should work. 

But I need to make sure that the LEAD functions are correctly applied. 

For example, for a row in ordered_events, the LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) would get the timestamp of the next row in the same case. 

Yes. 

So, for each row in ordered_events, the create_order_time is the timestamp of the next event (rn +1), and confirm_order_time is the one after that (rn +2). 

Therefore, the condition (sc.confirm_order_time - sc.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days' checks the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events in the sequence. 

This should correctly identify the cases that meet both conditions. 

Therefore, the final query is as above. 

Now, the final step is to write this in DuckDB SQL. 

But I need to make sure that the syntax is correct. 

In DuckDB, the INTERVAL '5 days' is valid. 

Also, the LEAD function is available. 

Yes. 

So, the final query should be correct. 

Another thing to consider: what if a case has multiple sequences? For example, multiple instances of the three activities in order. But since we are using DISTINCT, it's okay. 

Also, the final query excludes all events from those cases. 

Yes. 

So, this should solve the problem.

To solve this problem, we need to identify and exclude specific cases from the `event_log` table based on a sequence of activities and a time condition. The goal is to return all events except those from cases that have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' in direct succession, with the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeding 5 days.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Sequence**: For each case, check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive activities in the exact order: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order'.
2. **Check Time Condition**: For cases that have the sequence, verify if the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events is more than 5 days.
3. **Exclude Relevant Cases**: Exclude all events from cases that meet both the sequence and time conditions.

### Solution Code
```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_check AS (
    SELECT 
        ce.case_id,
        ce.rn,
        ce.activity,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity1,
        LEAD(ce.activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS next_activity2,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS create_order_time,
        LEAD(ce.timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.case_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) AS confirm_order_time
    FROM ordered_events ce
)
SELECT * 
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sc.case_id
    FROM sequence_check sc
    WHERE sc.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND sc.next_activity1 = 'Create Order'
      AND sc.next_activity2 = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (sc.confirm_order_time - sc.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);
```

### Explanation
1. **ordered_events CTE**: This CTE assigns a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This helps in identifying the sequence of activities.
2. **sequence_check CTE**: This CTE uses window functions to check for the required sequence of activities. It also retrieves the timestamps of the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events using the `LEAD` function.
3. **Final Query**: The main query selects all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is not in the list of cases identified by the `sequence_check` CTE. This ensures that only events from cases not meeting the sequence and time conditions are returned.

This approach efficiently identifies the relevant cases using window functions and ensures the final result excludes only those cases that meet both the sequence and time criteria.
