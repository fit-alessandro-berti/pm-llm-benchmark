### Justification:

1. **Verify Initial Documents**: This activity appears first in all cases where it involves checking the initial set of identity documents submitted by the customer.
   
2. **Call Customer for Docs/Clarification/Return**: These activities involve contacting the customer either to request additional information, clarify discrepancies, or ask them to return to the branch. The specific purpose ("Docs," "Clarification," "Return") helps distinguish these similar activities based on their context.

3. **Submit Additional Docs/Post-Adjustment Docs**: These activities involve the customer providing additional documents or confirming the status post-adjustment. The suffixes help differentiate between submitting additional documents before an adjustment and verifying documents after an internal adjustment has been made.

By renaming these activities, we ensure clarity about their role in the overall process flow while maintaining the original sequence and context of the events.
