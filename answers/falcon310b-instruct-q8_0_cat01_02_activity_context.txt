**Justification of Naming Choices:**

1. **Initiate Customer Request** - This activity appears the same across all cases and signifies the customer initiating contact with the service.

2. **Initial Document Verification** - This is the first instance of document verification, typically done soon after a request is initiated.

3. **Request Missing Docs** - This clarifies that the verification process requires additional information from the customer, necessitating a call to request these documents.

4. **Submit Additional Docs** - When a customer submits missing documents, this activity is used to reflect the upload or submission of these documents.

5. **Final Document Verification** - This indicates a re-verification after additional documents have been submitted and processed.

6. **Clarify Account Discrepancy** - This is a specialized call aimed at resolving inconsistencies in account details, distinguishing it from other calls for verification purposes.

7. **Adjust Account Details** - This activity reflects the internal changes made to an account following a call for clarification or after a customer submits additional information.

8. **Confirm Account Adjustments** - A follow-up call to ensure that the adjustments made are confirmed by the customer.

9. **Retrieve Customer** - This activity is context-specific to cases where the customer has left and needs to be contacted again to return.

10. **Adjust Account for Missing Info** - Reflects an internal adjustment made due to missing information from the customer.

11. **Reverify Docs After Adjustment** - Indicates a re-verification step following an internal adjustment to ensure all necessary documents are in order.

These changes aim to make the event log more readable and understandable by clearly delineating the roles and purposes of each activity within its specific context.
