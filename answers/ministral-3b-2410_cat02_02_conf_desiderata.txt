### Interpretations and Justifications

#### Case 2
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check:** This could be due to a misunderstanding of the process or a system error. The risk assessment might have been triggered by a preliminary review that did not require a full credit check.

#### Case 3
- **Delayed Credit Check:** This could be due to a backlog or system inefficiency. The delay in completing the credit check might have been due to resource constraints or system issues.
- **Delayed Applicant Notification:** This could be due to a delay in processing the loan decision or a miscommunication within the team.
- **No Follow-up Call:** This might be due to a lack of awareness about the recommended practice or a lack of resources to conduct follow-up calls.

### Recommendations

1. **Case 2:**
   - Ensure that the team is well-trained on the process sequence.
   - Implement checks or alerts to prevent the Risk Assessment from being performed before the Credit Check.

2. **Case 3:**
   - Investigate and address the system inefficiencies causing delays in the Credit Check.
   - Implement a system to ensure that the applicant is informed within the recommended time frame.
   - Encourage or mandate follow-up calls to ensure all parties are aligned.

By addressing these issues, the loan application process can be made more efficient and compliant with both normative rules and desiderata.
