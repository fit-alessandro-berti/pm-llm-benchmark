# Advanced Scheduling Optimization Framework for Precision Parts Inc.

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Mining Analysis Approach

**Objective:** Reconstruct and analyze job flow times, lead times, makespan distributions, task waiting times, resource utilization (machines and operators), sequence-dependent setup times, schedule adherence/tardiness, impact of disruptions, and the influence on KPIs.

#### Data Preparation:
- **Event Log Extraction**: Extract event logs from Precision Parts Inc.'s MES focusing exclusively on jobs/tasks. Ensure timestamps are precise to allow granular analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Normalization**: Remove duplicate entries, fill missing values where appropriate (using imputation techniques), and standardize units for task durations (e.g., minutes). Normalize due dates across all cases.

#### Process Mining Techniques:

1. **Process Flow Diagram Construction**:
   - Utilize *process mining* tools like Celonis or Blue J to build detailed process flow diagrams from the event logs.
   - Identify key activities, decision points (prioritization rules), and resource transitions (machine swaps).

2. **Sequence Analysis for Task Execution**:
   - Perform sequence analysis by identifying task dependencies among jobs based on *precedence relationships* derived from job release timestamps in the log.

3. **Performance Metrics Quantification**:

   a) **Job Flow Times & Makespan Distribution**:
      - Calculate average, median, and standard deviation of overall job flow times (from first arrival to completion).
      - Generate makespan distribution curves for individual jobs or batches using histograms.
   
   b) **Task Waiting Time Analysis**:
      - Quantify queue times at each work center/machine by comparing *arrival time* and *completion time* per task/event.
      - Use inter-arrival (wait) analysis to identify common causes of delays.

   c) **Resource Utilization Metrics**:
      - Compute productive, idle, setup, and total machine utilization rates over the analyzed period.
      - Apply process mining’s “resource contention” metrics like resource saturation levels where multiple tasks are queued for a single machine consecutively.

4. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times Analysis**:
   - Extract timestamps of *setup* events associated with job transitions (e.g., from previous case to new one).
   - Aggregate setup times by task type or machine and apply time-series analysis to observe patterns based on sequence.
   - Employ statistical methods like regression models to predict set-up durations as a function of preceding jobs.

5. **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness Metrics**:
   - Compute adherence percentages (jobs completed before due date) using `job completion timestamp vs. scheduled end`.
   - Calculate tardiness metrics: average delay, maximum variance from due dates, and identify outliers with abnormal delays.
   - Integrate *time-dependent* factors such as machine availability calendars to account for real-world constraints.

6. **Impact of Disruptions**:
   - Segregate data by incident type (breakdowns, priority changes) using categorical variables in the log.
   - Use time-series decomposition techniques on disruption datasets to isolate impact duration and frequency from normal operational patterns.
   - Conduct causal analysis through *causal graphs* or "before-after" studies comparing jobs preceding vs. following disruptions.

## 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

### Key Pathologies Identified:

1. **Bottleneck Resource Identification**:
   - Use resource utilization metrics to pinpoint machines with consistently high idle times.
   - Apply *bottleneck analysis*—identify tasks or sequences that disproportionately affect machine load, and quantify their impact on overall throughput.

2. **Ineffective Prioritization of High-Value Jobs**:
   - Analyze task prioritization rules (e.g., due date vs. priority) to determine if high-priority jobs are consistently delayed.
   - Correlate turnaround times for critical orders with *dispatching rule* adherence patterns derived from the logs.

3. **Suboptimal Task Sequencing Impact on Setup Times**:
   - Quantify setup time sequences using process mining's "variant analysis" comparing optimal vs. non-optimal job order permutations (e.g., different task scheduling).
   - Identify where suboptimal ordering increased total setup times by more than 20%, indicating potential waste.

4. **Starvation of Downstream Resources**:
   - Detect instances where upstream jobs consume machine time beyond their capacity, causing downstream machines to idle or wait.
   - Calculate the *resource consumption ratio* for each work center; deviations from a balanced distribution suggest resource starvation patterns.

5. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels**:
   - Analyze variability in Work In Progress (WIP) metrics across tasks and compare them against due date deadlines to identify potential bullwhip effects.
   - Use variance analysis to correlate high WIP with delays or rework, indicating systemic scheduling inefficiencies.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **Static Dispatching Rules Limitation**:
   - Process mining reveals that current dispatch rules do not adapt in real-time (e.g., changes in machine availability).
   - Identify rule limitations by comparing *historical scheduling outcomes* with actual performance and demand surges.

2. **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**:
   - Disruptions such as breakdowns or priority changes are only visible after they occur, impeding timely corrective actions.
   - Process mining provides the visibility needed to establish a real-time monitoring dashboard that updates on-demand for decision-makers.

3. **Inaccurate Task Duration/Setup Time Estimations**:
   - Variance in estimated vs. actual task durations suggests incomplete or outdated historical data used for planning.
   - Use predictive analytics (e.g., machine learning) derived from the logs to refine duration estimations, especially considering operator expertise and job complexity.

4. **Ineffective Handling of Sequence-Dependent Setups**:
   - Analysis may reveal that similar jobs are not batched together due to rule-based prioritization rules.
   - Process mining can uncover hidden patterns in sequence dependencies (e.g., multiple parts from the same mold) indicating opportunities for batching or machine sequencing.

5. **Coordination Between Work Centers Issues**:
   - Insufficient cross-center communication results in resource conflicts and inefficient task handovers.
   - Identify "critical path" delays by analyzing how tasks transition between machines, pinpointing points of coordination failure using event logs.

6. **Unplanned Breakdowns & Urgent Jobs Impact**:
   - Disruptions lead to unpredictable schedule variance; process mining’s disruption analysis reveals frequency and duration patterns.
   - Develop contingency scheduling policies based on historical breakdown incidence data (e.g., buffer times before high-impact tasks).

## 4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Proposed Strategies:

#### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules

**Core Logic**: 
Combine real-time factors such as remaining processing time, due date urgency, current machine load, and sequence-dependent setup estimates (derived from historical data). Assign weights to each factor based on strategic priorities.

**Implementation**:
- Develop a dynamic dispatch engine that recalculates task sequencing every 5 minutes using an optimized scoring algorithm.
- Implement constraints-driven scheduling where tasks are re-prioritized if they violate capacity limits or due dates, guided by real-time feedback from the MES event logs.

#### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling

**Core Logic**: 
Leverage historical performance distributions and predictive models to forecast task durations and potential bottlenecks.
- Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., ARIMA for time-series forecasting or decision trees) that incorporate:
    - Machine utilization patterns
    - Operator skill levels inferred from past job complexity
    - Historical setup duration data

**Implementation**: 
Generate daily/montly schedules with built-in buffers based on predicted lead times, and automatically trigger buffer adjustments when variance exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., >10%).

#### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization

**Core Logic**: 
Apply intelligent batching strategies for tasks processed by the same machine to reduce idle time.
- Analyze past data of jobs that share common characteristics or tooling requirements and propose optimal sequences within each batch phase.

**Implementation**: 
Develop a "setup optimizer" powered by process mining’s variant analysis which evaluates permutations in real-time, ensuring no suboptimal setups are introduced during execution. 

## 5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Framework:

1. **Parameterization with Process Mining Data**:
   - Feed DES models with accurate task durations, setup times derived from historical logs, resource availability patterns, machine breakdown rates.
   - Incorporate the identified pathologies as variables to simulate real-world disruptions.

2. **Scenario Testing & Comparative Analysis**:
   - Run scenarios under normal load, peak demand periods (e.g., holiday production spikes), and disruption-heavy conditions.
   - Compare results of Strategy 1-3 against a baseline static rule system using key performance indicators such as tardiness rate, makespan variance, WIP levels.

### Framework for Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation:

1. **KPI Tracking Dashboard**:
   - Create real-time KPI dashboard (tardiness rates, utilization ratios, queue lengths) powered by process mining to ensure ongoing insight.
   - Integrate automated alerts when any KPI breaches predefined thresholds.

2. **Adaptive Learning Loop**:
   - Use reinforcement learning techniques where the scheduling system adjusts its rule weights based on past performance outcomes versus actual results in real-time simulations and operational data (e.g., new machines, operator shifts).
   
3. **Feedback Integration with MES**:
   - Feed back from simulation runs into MES to refine task execution times dynamically, ensuring future schedules reflect improved patterns.
  
4. **Periodic Review Cycle**: 
- Establish quarterly review meetings where the team reviews outcomes against strategic targets and updates parameters of predictive models as new data becomes available.
