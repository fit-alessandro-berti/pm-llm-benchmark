# 1. SR must complete before CS
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)

# 2. CS must complete before both DA and ACI
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)

# 3. Both DA and ACI must complete before the loop can start
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_body)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_body)

# 4. The loop must complete before the deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(loop_body, xor_deployment)

# 5. The deployment choice (CD or MD) must complete before QA and SA
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)

# 6. Both QA and SA must complete before GLA
root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Note: QA and SA have no order between them -> they are concurrent, which is naturally
# represented by the absence of an edge between them in the partial order.

# The model is now complete
# root is the root POWL model representing the entire process

This code constructs the complete POWL model for the telecom corporate network provisioning process as described. It:

- Uses `Transition` objects for all named activities.
- Uses `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP` for the BNCD&R loop.
- Uses `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR` for the exclusive choice between CD and MD.
- Uses `StrictPartialOrder` as the top-level container for the entire process.
- Models concurrency between DA/ACI and between QA/SA by omitting edges between them.
- Enforces all required sequential dependencies (SRCS, CSDA/ACI, DA/ACIloop, loopdeployment, deploymentQA/SA, QA/SAGLA).

The resulting model faithfully captures the partial ordering, loops, and exclusive choices as specified in the scenario.
