The final process tree structure to represent the given process is as follows:

```
-> (
    'Receive Application (RA)',
    * (
        -> (
            'Validate Form (VF)',
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
        ),
        'Request Missing Info (RMI)'
    ),
    'Approval Decision (AD)',
    'Send Confirmation (SC)',
    'Archive Case (AC)'
)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Main Sequential Flow (`->`):**
   - The process starts with **Receive Application (RA)**.
   - After handling loops and optional activities (described below), it progresses through:
     - **Approval Decision (AD)**.
     - **Send Confirmation (SC)**.
     - **Archive Case (AC)**.

2. **Loop Structure for Missing Information (`*`):**
   - After **Validate Form (VF)** and **Assess Eligibility (AE)**, there is a possibility of entering a loop to request missing information.
   - The loop captures:
     - Execution of **Request Missing Info (RMI)**.
     - Re-validation of the form (**Validate Form (VF)**) and re-assessment of eligibility (**Assess Eligibility (AE)**).
   - This loop allows for multiple repetitions until the loop exits and the process continues to the next step.

3. **Parallel Handling of Validation and Eligibility (`->` inside the loop):**
   - The sub-process of validating the form and assessing eligibility is executed in a strict sequence before determining whether additional information is needed.

This structure balances:
- **Fitness:** Accounts for all traces, including cases with and without missing information loops.
- **Precision:** Clearly distinguishes the main sequence of steps from optional and repeated ones.
- **Simplicity:** Represents the process using well-defined operators without unnecessary complexity.
