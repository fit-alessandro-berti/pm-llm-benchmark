We are given a DECLARE model and need to add constraints to mitigate bias. The bias mitigation constraints we are to add are:

1. **Coexistence Constraint**: If a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), ensure a `ManualReview` activity always coexists in the trace.

2. **Response/Succession Constraint**: Ensure that certain decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`.

3. **Non-succession Constraint**: Prevent a direct succession from a sensitive attribute event (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision event (`Reject`).

However, note that the original model does not include activities like `CheckApplicantRace`, `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, or `ManualReview`. Therefore, we must first define these activities and then add the constraints.

But the problem states: "You must introduce constraints that ensure the sequence of activities does not discriminate based on these attributes." and we are to use the DECLARE constraints.

Since the example model does not have these activities, we have two options:
1. Extend the model with new activities that represent the bias mitigation steps and the sensitive attribute events.
2. However, the problem does not specify what the sensitive attributes are by name, but we know they exist (e.g., ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace). We are to create constraints that prevent biased outcomes.

Given the complexity, we will introduce the following activities:

- `CheckApplicantRace`: An activity that discloses the sensitive attribute (e.g., checks the applicant's race).
- `BiasMitigationCheck`: A manual review step that a mitigation officer checks the decision for bias.
- `Approve_Minority`: A decision to approve the loan for a minority applicant.
- `Reject_Minority`: A decision to reject the loan for a minority applicant.

But note: The original model uses activities like "StartApplication", "FinalDecision", "RequestAdditionalInfo". We must integrate the new activities appropriately.

However, the problem does not specify the exact flow. We assume that the process includes:

1. StartApplication
2. CheckApplicantRace (if needed)
3. RequestAdditionalInfo (if needed)
4. FinalDecision (which might be Approve or Reject, and might be for a minority or non-minority)

We are to add constraints that if a sensitive applicant is being processed (which we assume is indicated by having a `CheckApplicantRace` activity followed by a `FinalDecision` without an intervening `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`), then we require a `ManualReview` to occur either at the same time (coexistence) or prevent the immediate biased decision.

But note: The DECLARE constraints are about frequencies and co-occurrences, not about the logical flow. We are to add constraints that force certain activities to occur together or avoid certain sequences.

Let's break down the constraints:

**Constraint 1: Coexistence (unary constraint on existence of ManualReview for sensitive decisions)**

We want that whenever a decision for a sensitive applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) occurs, then a `ManualReview` must also occur in the same trace (i.e., same case). We can express this as an `existence` constraint for `ManualReview` but only when the sensitive decision is present.

However, DECLARE does not have a direct way to express "if activity X then activity Y must exist". Instead, we can use the `coexistence` constraint which is binary and specifies that two activities must co-occur. But note: `coexistence` in DECLARE is defined as: 
   "coexistence(A, B): A and B must always occur together in any case."

But we don't always want them together? Only when there is a sensitive decision? 

Alternatively, we can use the `exactly_one` or `noncoexistence` to express that without the sensitive decision, the `ManualReview` is not required? That doesn't directly help.

Another idea: We can use the `response` or `succession` constraints to express that after a sensitive attribute event, a bias mitigation check must occur? But note: the coexistence constraint we are going to add is for the sensitive decision and the manual review.

Actually, the problem states: "ensure a `ManualReview` activity always coexists in the trace" for sensitive decisions. So we can define:

   coexistence({sensitive_decision_activities}, {ManualReview})

But we don't have the sensitive_decision_activities defined. We can define:

   sensitive_decisions = {"Approve_Minority", "Reject_Minority"}

But note: the original model does not have these activities. We must add them as new activities in the model.

However, the problem says: "You must introduce constraints that ensure the sequence of activities". We are allowed to add new activities? The example model only has "StartApplication", "FinalDecision", etc.

But the instructions say: "Insert new DECLARE constraints into the model". We are allowed to extend the model with new activities? The example model does not have them, but we must because of the bias mitigation.

So we will extend the model with the following activities:

   "Approve_Minority", "Reject_Minority", "CheckApplicantRace", "ManualReview"

But note: the original model has "FinalDecision", which is a unary constraint. We are going to create a new unary constraint for `ManualReview`? Actually, we can just use the `existence` constraint for `ManualReview` but only when a sensitive decision is made? 

Alternatively, we can define:

   "existence": {
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
   }

But that would require `ManualReview` to always exist? That might be too strong. Instead, we want that whenever a sensitive decision is made, then `ManualReview` must exist. This is a conditional requirement.

Unfortunately, DECLARE does not have built-in support for conditional existence. Therefore, we must think of an alternative.

We can use the `response` constraint to express that after a sensitive decision, a `ManualReview` must occur? But note: the sensitive decision might be followed by a manual review at any time, not necessarily immediately. The problem says "without first performing a BiasMitigationCheck", meaning that the `ManualReview` must occur before the next decision? But the problem does not specify the timing.

Alternatively, we can use the `precedence` constraint to require that `ManualReview` precedes the next decision? But that is complex.

Given the complexity and the fact that DECLARE is a constraint language for frequencies, we might need to model the bias mitigation as additional unary constraints and binary constraints that enforce the requirements.

But note: the problem says "add new constraints". We are going to add:

1. `existence` constraints for `ManualReview` in the context of sensitive decisions? Not directly.

Instead, we can add:

   - A new `existence` constraint for `ManualReview` that must hold only when a sensitive decision is made? We cannot do that in DECLARE.

Therefore, we must change our approach. We will add:

   **Constraint 1: Coexistence of ManualReview with sensitive decisions**

   We define a new binary constraint: `coexistence` between every sensitive decision activity and `ManualReview`. But note: the sensitive decision activities are new ones we are introducing: `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`.

   We add:

      "coexistence": {
          "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   This means that whenever `Approve_Minority` occurs, `ManualReview` must coexist (i.e., occur in the same trace). Similarly for `Reject_Minority`.

   However, note: the original `coexistence` constraint in DECLARE requires that the two activities occur together in every case. This constraint will be true only for cases that have `Approve_Minority` and also have `ManualReview`. We must set the support and confidence appropriately. Since we are requiring that if `Approve_Minority` is present then `ManualReview` must be present, the support will be the frequency of `Approve_Minority` (divided by the total cases? but DECLARE uses probabilities). Actually, we are not given a frequency basis. We assume that the model is built from a set of cases.

   But the problem does not specify the frequency basis. We set the support and confidence to 1.0 meaning that in every case where `Approve_Minority` occurs, `ManualReview` must occur. However, this might be too strong? But it is the requirement.

   **Constraint 2: Response constraint to prevent immediate biased decision**

   We want to prevent that after `CheckApplicantRace` (which discloses the sensitive attribute) a `Reject_Minority` occurs immediately (or without a manual review in between). But note: we already have a coexistence constraint that requires a `ManualReview` for `Reject_Minority`. So the immediate succession of `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority` is allowed if we have a `ManualReview` in between? Not necessarily.

   The requirement: without a proper check in between. The proper check is the `ManualReview`. So we want that between `CheckApplicantRace` and `Reject_Minority`, there must be a `ManualReview`? But that is a precedence constraint? And we don't know the order.

   Alternatively, we can use the `nonsuccession` constraint to prevent a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority`? But that would be too broad because we don't want the sensitive attribute to lead to a decision without mitigation. So we want to break any succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to any sensitive decision? 

   We can define:

      "nonsuccession": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {}}
      }

   But that would break the succession even if there is a `ManualReview` in between? And it is only for `Reject_Minority`? We also have `Approve_Minority`.

   Alternatively, we can use `nonchainresponse` or `nonchainsuccession`? The problem says "immediately follow or be preceded only by events where a sensitive attribute leads to a biased outcome". We want to break the chain from `CheckApplicantRace` to a sensitive decision without an intervening `ManualReview`.

   But note: we already require `ManualReview` for the sensitive decision via the coexistence constraint. So we can express that `ManualReview` must succeed `CheckApplicantRace` before the sensitive decision? That is a precedence constraint: `ManualReview` must precede `Reject_Minority` and `Approve_Minority`? But not necessarily immediately? The problem says "without a proper check", meaning that the mitigation must happen. We can use:

      "response": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # This is not the right syntax
      }

   The `response` constraint is unary: it maps a source activity to a target activity. So we can have:

      "response": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {
              "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
              "Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
          }
      }

   But that would mean that after `CheckApplicantRace`, both `ManualReview` and `Reject_Minority` must occur? That is too strong.

   Instead, we want that after `CheckApplicantRace`, if we are to make a decision on the same case, then `ManualReview` must occur before the decision? This is a precedence constraint. DECLARE has `precedence` and `succession` but they are binary and linear.

   We can use:

      "precedence": {
          "ManualReview": {"Response": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}}
      }

   But that doesn't exist.

Given the complexity and the fact that DECLARE is not designed for temporal constraints, we might have to use `nonsuccession` to prevent a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority`? But that would only break the immediate succession. We also want to break if there is no `ManualReview` in between? 

We might need to introduce a new activity for the bias mitigation check and then use `precedence` to require that `ManualReview` precedes the sensitive decision? But precedence in DECLARE is defined as: A must precede B if for every possible case, A occurs and B occurs and A does not occur after B. But we can set a precedence constraint between `ManualReview` and `Reject_Minority`? 

   "precedence": {
        "ManualReview": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
   }

   This would mean that in every case where `ManualReview` and `Reject_Minority` occur, `ManualReview` must occur before `Reject_Minority`. Similarly for `Approve_Minority`.

   But note: `ManualReview` might occur multiple times? We are only concerned with the one that immediately follows the sensitive attribute? Not exactly. We require that before a sensitive decision, a `ManualReview` must have occurred for that same case? 

   This precedence constraint would ensure that. However, it might be too broad because it would require a `ManualReview` to occur before any `Reject_Minority` in the same case, even if the `ManualReview` was not related to the sensitive attribute? But we are only adding the constraint for the sensitive decisions? We can specify that the `ManualReview` must be for the purpose of bias mitigation? But we don't have an activity for that.

   We can create an activity `BiasMitigationCheck` that is specific to this purpose. Then we require:

      "precedence": {
          "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   And we also require that `CheckApplicantRace` precedes `BiasMitigationCheck`? 

   This is getting very complex.

Given the time, we will simplify and add the following:

   **Constraint 1: Coexistence of ManualReview with sensitive decisions (as above)**

   **Constraint 2: Precedence between BiasMitigationCheck and sensitive decisions**

   **Constraint 3: Precedence between CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck**

   **Constraint 4: Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and sensitive decisions without BiasMitigationCheck?** 

But note: the problem says to prevent a direct succession from a sensitive attribute event to a decision event. We can use `nonsuccession` to break the succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority` and `Approve_Minority` if there is no `BiasMitigationCheck` in between? But we cannot condition on the presence of `ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck` in DECLARE.

Alternatively, we can use `nonchainresponse` to break the chain from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority` if the next step is not `BiasMitigationCheck`? That doesn't work.

We decide to add:

   - `existence` for `BiasMitigationCheck` in the same way as `ManualReview`? But then we also need a coexistence between `BiasMitigationCheck` and the sensitive decisions? That would be two manual reviews? 

Given the complexity, we will stick to a simpler set of constraints that are easier to express in DECLARE:

   **Constraint 1: Coexistence of ManualReview with sensitive decisions (already described)**

   **Constraint 2: Precedence between BiasMitigationCheck and sensitive decisions (if we have defined `BiasMitigationCheck`)**

   But we haven't defined `BiasMitigationCheck`. Let's define it as an activity.

   We will add new activities:

      "CheckApplicantRace", "BiasMitigationCheck", "Approve_Minority", "Reject_Minority"

   And then add:

   **Constraint 1: Coexistence** for each sensitive decision with `ManualReview` (as above).

   **Constraint 2: Precedence** between `BiasMitigationCheck` and each sensitive decision.

   **Constraint 3: Precedence** between `CheckApplicantRace` and `BiasMitigationCheck`.

   **Constraint 4: Non-succession** to prevent a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority` or `Approve_Minority` without an intervening activity? But that is not specific.

   Alternatively, we can use `nonchainresponse` to break the chain from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject_Minority` if the next step is not `BiasMitigationCheck`? But DECLARE doesn't support this.

Given the constraints we are adding, we hope to cover the bias mitigation.

But note: the problem says "You must introduce constraints that ensure the sequence of activities does not discriminate". We are introducing:

   - Coexistence of ManualReview with sensitive decisions (so every sensitive decision has a manual review)
   - ManualReview must come before the sensitive decision (precedence)
   - The sensitive attribute event (CheckApplicantRace) must come before the ManualReview (precedence)

This creates a required process flow: CheckApplicantRace -> BiasMitigationCheck -> [ManualReview?] -> SensitiveDecision

But note: we have two manual reviews? We only need one. We have `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` as separate activities. We might combine them? But the problem says "additional checks" (e.g., `ManualReview`). We are introducing `BiasMitigationCheck` as a distinct step.

Alternatively, we can have only one manual review step, which we call `ManualReview`. Then we can express:

   - Coexistence between sensitive decisions and `ManualReview`.
   - Precedence: CheckApplicantRace -> ManualReview -> SensitiveDecisions

   But then we don't need `BiasMitigationCheck`? 

   We decide to use only `ManualReview` for both the check after the sensitive attribute and the bias mitigation. Then we can express:

      "precedence": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "ManualReview": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "ManualReview": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   But the precedence constraint is binary and transitive? The DECLARE precedence constraint is defined as a binary relation. We can chain:

      "precedence": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {...}},
          "ManualReview": {"Approve_Minority": {...}}
      }

   But the syntax does not allow chaining in one constraint. We would need two separate precedence constraints:

      "precedence": {
          "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "ManualReview": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "ManualReview": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   This means that in any case, if `CheckApplicantRace` occurs then `ManualReview` must occur, and if `ManualReview` occurs then `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority` must occur? That is not what we want. We want that after `ManualReview`, the decision can be either Approve or Reject (non-minority) or for minority with manual review we might have Approve_Minority or Reject_Minority.

   Actually, the requirement is that the manual review must occur before the decision. So the decision activities (`Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`) must occur after `ManualReview`. We can express:

      "precedence": {
          "ManualReview": {"Approve_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "ManualReview": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   But this is not quite right because it says that every `ManualReview` must be followed by `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`? But that is not necessarily true (there might be other outcomes). We want that `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` must be preceded by `ManualReview`. We can use:

      "precedence": {
          "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
          "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
      }

   This means that in any case where `Approve_Minority` occurs, `ManualReview` must occur (and similarly for `Reject_Minority`). And this is exactly the coexistence constraint we already have? 

   So we are duplicating.

Given the above, we decide to only add the coexistence constraint for `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` and then the precedence constraint from `CheckApplicantRace` to `ManualReview` and from `ManualReview` to `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`? But the latter is already covered by the coexistence if we ensure that `ManualReview` occurs between `CheckApplicantRace` and the decision? Not exactly, because the coexistence only says that if the decision occurs then `ManualReview` must occur, not that it must occur before.

We need to enforce the order. Therefore, we add:

   **Constraint 1: Coexistence** between `Approve_Minority` and `ManualReview`, and between `Reject_Minority` and `ManualReview`.

   **Constraint 2: Precedence** from `CheckApplicantRace` to `ManualReview`.

   **Constraint 3: Precedence** from `ManualReview` to `Approve_Minority`.

   **Constraint 4: Precedence** from `ManualReview` to `Reject_Minority`.

   But note: the precedence constraint in DECLARE is unary: it says that if A occurs then B must occur (eventually, not necessarily immediately) and vice versa? Actually, it is a temporal constraint: A must occur before B. And it is based on frequency. We set support and confidence to 1.0.

   However, the precedence constraint between `ManualReview` and `Approve_Minority` will be true if in every case where `ManualReview` occurs, `Approve_Minority` also occurs? That is not true because there might be cases that only do `ManualReview` and then something else. We want the reverse: if `Approve_Minority` occurs, then `ManualReview` must occur (which is the coexistence) and also `ManualReview` must occur before `Approve_Minority`? The precedence constraint we defined with "ManualReview" -> "Approve_Minority" means that in every case where `ManualReview` occurs, `Approve_
