### **Analysis of Anomalies and Undesirable Behaviors in the Event Log**

Based on the assumed normal process flow and the provided event logs, I have identified several **anomalies** and **undesirable behaviors** that deviate from the expected order lifecycle. Here's a breakdown of these anomalies, followed by **hypotheses** and **SQL queries** to investigate further.

---

##  **1. Order 1004: Payment Received Before Order Registration**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 22 (Receive Payment)** occurred **before** **Event 21 (Register Order)**.
- This is a **complete reversal** of the expected process flow.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **System error or data entry mistake:** The payment might have been recorded prematurely due to a bug or manual data entry error.
- **Policy violation:** A finance team member may have bypassed the order registration process and directly issued a payment.
- **Fraud or internal theft:** The payment could have been recorded without an actual order, possibly for fraudulent purposes.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    o.case_id,
    oel1.event_id AS payment_event_id,
    oel1.timestamp AS payment_timestamp,
    oel2.event_id AS register_order_event_id,
    oel2.timestamp AS register_order_timestamp
FROM 
    order_event_log oel1
JOIN 
    order_event_log oel2
ON 
    oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
JOIN 
    orders o
ON 
    oel1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE 
    oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Register Order'
    AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;
```

---

##  **2. Order 1002: Credit Check Performed After Shipment**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 11 (Perform Credit Check)** occurred **after** **Event 10 (Ship Goods)**.
- This violates the expected order of:
  1. Register Order
  2. Perform Credit Check
  3. Validate Stock
  4. Confirm Shipment
  5. Ship Goods

### **Hypotheses:**
- **Process shortcut or system error:** The credit check might have been skipped or performed late due to an error.
- **Training or procedural gap:** A resource might not be following the correct order of steps.
- **Policy violation:** The shipment was approved without proper credit verification.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel1.case_id,
    oel1.event_id AS shipment_event_id,
    oel1.timestamp AS shipment_timestamp,
    oel2.event_id AS credit_check_event_id,
    oel2.timestamp AS credit_check_timestamp
FROM 
    order_event_log oel1
JOIN 
    order_event_log oel2
ON 
    oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE 
    oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND oel2.timestamp > oel1.timestamp;
```

---

##  **3. Order 1003: Confirm Shipment After Ship Goods**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 19 (Confirm Shipment)** occurred **after** **Event 17 (Ship Goods)**.
- This is a reversal of the expected sequence: **Confirm Shipment** should occur **before** **Ship Goods**.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **Process error or system bug:** The system might have recorded the event in the wrong order.
- **Lack of process compliance:** A resource might not be following the correct steps.
- **Unplanned shipment:** The shipment might have been executed before formal confirmation, leading to potential logistical issues.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel1.case_id,
    oel1.event_id AS ship_goods_event_id,
    oel1.timestamp AS ship_goods_timestamp,
    oel2.event_id AS confirm_shipment_event_id,
    oel2.timestamp AS confirm_shipment_timestamp
FROM 
    order_event_log oel1
JOIN 
    order_event_log oel2
ON 
    oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE 
    oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel2.timestamp > oel1.timestamp;
```

---

##  **4. Order 1003: Invoice Issued Before Shipment Confirmation**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 18 (Issue Invoice)** occurred **before** **Event 19 (Confirm Shipment)**.
- This is a deviation from the expected flow: **Confirm Shipment** should occur before **Issue Invoice**.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **System error or manual mistake:** The invoice might have been issued prematurely.
- **Process shortcut:** The finance team might have issued the invoice without proper confirmation of shipment.
- **Internal control gap:** There may be no enforcement of a check that shipment must be confirmed before invoicing.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel1.case_id,
    oel1.event_id AS issue_invoice_event_id,
    oel1.timestamp AS issue_invoice_timestamp,
    oel2.event_id AS confirm_shipment_event_id,
    oel2.timestamp AS confirm_shipment_timestamp
FROM 
    order_event_log oel1
JOIN 
    order_event_log oel2
ON 
    oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE 
    oel1.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp;
```

##  **5. Order 1004: Shipment Scheduled as "N" (No) Before Shipment**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 24 (Confirm Shipment)** has `additional_info = 'shipment_scheduled=N'`.
- This indicates that the shipment was **not scheduled** yet, but **Event 25 (Ship Goods)** was still executed.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **System error or manual override:** The shipment might have been forced through despite the lack of scheduling.
- **Process deviation:** The logistics team may have bypassed the confirmation step.
- **Lack of validation:** The system may not be enforcing that shipment can only occur after confirmation.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel1.case_id,
    oel1.event_id AS confirm_shipment_event_id,
    oel1.additional_info AS shipment_scheduled_status,
    oel2.event_id AS ship_goods_event_id
FROM 
    order_event_log oel1
JOIN 
    order_event_log oel2
ON 
    oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id
WHERE 
    oel1.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel2.activity = 'Ship Goods'
    AND oel1.additional_info ILIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%';
```

##  **6. Order 1002: Credit Check with Low Score (650) but Shipment Proceeded**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 11 (Perform Credit Check)** for **Order 1002** has `credit_score=650`, which is below the assumed threshold for a "good" credit score.
- However, the order still proceeded with shipment.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **Policy not enforced:** The system may not be checking credit scores before proceeding with shipment.
- **Manual override:** A resource may have bypassed the credit check.
- **Credit score threshold is not defined or not being used.**

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    oel.additional_info AS credit_score,
    o.order_value
FROM 
    order_event_log oel
JOIN 
    orders o
ON 
    oel.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE 
    oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
    AND oel.additional_info ILIKE '%credit_score=%'
    AND CAST(SUBSTRING(oel.additional_info FROM 'credit_score=(\d+)') AS INTEGER) < 700;
```

---

##  **7. Order 1003: Late Confirmation of Shipment**

### **Observation:**
- **Event 19 (Confirm Shipment)** has `additional_info = 'late_confirmation=Y'`.

### **Hypotheses:**
- **Logistical delays:** The shipment confirmation might have been delayed due to internal or external issues.
- **Process inefficiency:** The logistics team might be slow in confirming shipments.
- **Lack of automation:** The system may not be triggering confirmations automatically.

### **SQL Query to Investigate:**
```sql
SELECT 
    oel.case_id,
    oel.event_id AS confirm_shipment_event_id,
    oel.additional_info AS confirmation_status
FROM 
    order_event_log oel
WHERE 
    oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
    AND oel.additional_info ILIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%';
```
