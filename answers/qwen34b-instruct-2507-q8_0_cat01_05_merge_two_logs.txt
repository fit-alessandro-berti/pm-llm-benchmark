##  Reasoning & Matching Decisions

### 1. **Event Name Normalization**
Events from Log A and Log B use different naming conventions:
- Log A: `Order Received`, `Order Validated`, `Payment Processed`, `Item Shipped`, `Item Delivered`
- Log B: `OrderReceived`, `OrderValidation`, `PaymentCheck`, `Quality Check`, `Shipping`

We mapped these to consistent event types using semantic meaning:
- `OrderReceived`  `Order Received`
- `OrderValidation`  `Order Validated`
- `PaymentCheck`  `Payment Processed`
- `Shipping`  `Item Shipped`
- `Quality Check`  distinct, not directly equivalent to any Log A event  retained as a separate event
- `Item Delivered`  unchanged (no equivalent in Log B)

>  **Note**: "Quality Check" is a new, process-specific event not aligned with any Log A step. It is included as a valid, observed activity in System B.

---

### 2. **Timestamp Matching & Tolerance**

We applied a **2-second tolerance** to determine if two events represent the same occurrence.

| Pair | Timestamps | Difference | Match Decision |
|------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| Order Received (Log A: 10:00:00) vs Log B: 09:59:58 | 09:59:58  10:00:00 | 2 seconds |  Matched — Log B event slightly earlier, likely part of same process. Log B is more granular and has context. |
| Order Validated (Log A: 10:01:30) vs Log B: 10:01:29 | 10:01:29  10:01:30 | 1 second |  Matched — within tolerance. Both represent validation. Merged with enriched attributes. |
| Payment Processed (Log A: 10:02:00) vs Log B: 10:02:05 | 10:02:00  10:02:05 | 5 seconds |  Not within 2-second tolerance  **left as separate events**, though semantically similar. |
| Item Shipped (Log A: 10:05:00) vs Log B: 10:05:02 | 10:05:00  10:05:02 | 2 seconds |  Matched — within tolerance. Merged. |
| Item Delivered (Log A: 10:20:00) | No Log B equivalent | — |  Included as-is (Log A only) |

>  **Important Note**: While the payment events are close in time, the **Log B event has a note** ("Payment gateway delay") indicating a delay or issue. This adds valuable context. Therefore, we **do not merge** the two payment events — instead, we present both as distinct events with their respective notes.

---

### 3. **Handling of Missing or Non-Overlapping Events**

- **Log A events with no Log B match**:
  - `Order Received` at 10:00:00  matched with Log B’s 09:59:58 (slightly earlier)  considered same event.
  - `Order Validated` at 10:01:30  matched with Log B’s 10:01:29  merged.
  - `Item Shipped`, `Item Delivered`  matched with Log B events.
  - `Payment Processed` at 10:02:00  no direct match in Log B (only at 10:02:05)  kept separate.

- **Log B events with no Log A match**:
  - `Quality Check` at 10:03:00  not present in Log A  included as standalone event.
  - `PaymentCheck` at 10:02:05  not in Log A  included as a payment-related event with note.

>  All Log B events that were not matched are preserved with their source.

---

### 4. **Event Merging Strategy**

For **matched events**, we:
- Use the **event type from Log A** as the primary label (since it's the primary timeline).
- **Include all attributes from both logs** (e.g., user_id, resource_id, notes).
- If timestamps differ by 2 seconds, we **merge** and list the event once, with **combined attributes**.

> Example:  
> - Log A: `Payment Processed` at 10:02:00  
> - Log B: `PaymentCheck` at 10:02:05  
>  **Not merged** due to 5-second gap.  
>  **Both are listed separately** to preserve context of delay.

> However, for **Order Validated** (10:01:29 vs 10:01:30)  within 1 second  merged into **one event** with **both user_id and notes**.

---

### 5. **Chronological Order**

All events are sorted by **timestamp** (UTC), using the original timestamps from both logs.

> The merged log now reflects a **realistic, detailed timeline**, including both system-level actions and operational notes.

##  Summary of Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **Matched Order Received (09:59:58  10:00:00)** | Within 2 seconds; Log B has context. System A may record reception after processing starts. |
| **Matched Order Validated (10:01:29  10:01:30)** | Within 1 second; both events represent validation. Enriched with user and notes. |
| **Did not merge Payment Processed (10:02:00 vs 10:02:05)** | 5 seconds apart; Log B notes a delay. Important to preserve discrepancy. |
| **Matched Item Shipped (10:05:00  10:05:02)** | Within 2 seconds; both describe shipment. Enriched with user and note. |
| **Included Quality Check** | Unique event in Log B, not in Log A. Retained as process step. |
| **Retained Item Delivered** | Only in Log A  no alternative source. |

##  Final Notes

- **Enrichment** is achieved by combining attributes from both logs where events are matched.
- **Temporal precision** is preserved with a 2-second tolerance for matching.
- **Semantic alignment** is prioritized over strict naming.
- **Operational context** (e.g., "Payment gateway delay") is preserved even when events are slightly out of sync.
- **No event is lost or silently merged** without justification.

This merged log provides a **complete, accurate, and context-rich timeline** of the order fulfillment process, suitable for audit, analysis, or process improvement.
