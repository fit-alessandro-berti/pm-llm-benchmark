Okay, I need to create an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process described. Let me start by breaking down the scenario step by step. 

First, the process starts with the customer filing an Insurance Claim (C), which is the initial step. The initial marking should have a token at the start place, representing a new claim.

The steps after C are Claim Registration (CR), then Document Verification (DV). But if documents are incomplete, there's a Re-Document Submission (RDS) step before continuing. So between DV and the next steps, there's a loop where RDS can be triggered and repeated until the documents are complete. Similarly, after Fraud Check (FC), if there's a doubt, an In-depth Investigation (II) is done, and this can happen multiple times. So there's another loop between FC and II.

Let me list all the activities in order, considering the possible loops:

Main path:
C -> CR -> DV -> (maybe RDS loop) -> FC -> (maybe II loop) -> CA -> AP (if needed) -> P -> N -> CL

Wait, but Approval (AP) is conditional: only needed if the compensation amount exceeds a threshold. Hmm, the problem statement says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So AP is optional unless the amount is over the threshold. So the Petri net needs to represent that AP is an optional step depending on the condition. But in Petri nets, conditions like this are typically handled by using silent transitions or by having a split. Since we can't have conditions in the Petri net model, perhaps the AP transition is part of a branch. Wait, but the problem says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So in cases where the amount is over the threshold, AP must occur; otherwise, it can be skipped? Or maybe AP is always required but only triggered when the amount is over? Hmm, the problem says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So if it does, then AP must happen; otherwise, it's not needed. So the Petri net needs to model that AP is an optional step that can be taken when needed. But since Petri nets don't handle conditions, perhaps we can model this as an optional transition, i.e., using an OR-split and OR-join. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the Approval step is required only when the amount is over the threshold. Since the Petri net doesn't have conditions, maybe the process is modeled such that after CA, there's a decision whether to go through AP or not. So the transition AP is a possible path here. This can be represented with an OR-split and OR-join. 

Let me outline the main sequence and the loops:

Starting with the main flow:

1. Start at the initial place, after C (the filing of the claim), then CR, then DV. 

Wait, actually, according to the given steps:

- After C (the customer files the claim), the first step is Claim Registration (CR). So the first transition after the start is CR.

Wait the steps are: 

After C (customer files), the process steps are:

1. Claim Registration (CR)
2. Document Verification (DV)
   - If incomplete, loop back to RDS (Re-Document Submission), then back to DV again. So the DV must be done again after RDS, which might again lead to RDS again? Or maybe after RDS, it goes back to DV once, and repeats until documents are okay. So the loop between DV and RDS needs to allow multiple cycles. Similarly, after FC (Fraud Check), if there's a doubt, then In-depth Investigation (II) is done, and then back to FC again? Or after II, it might loop back to FC again?

The problem says "This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)." So for the Document Verification (DV) step: after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again. So the loop is between DV and RDS. So the structure would be: after DV, there's a transition to RDS, then back to DV, forming a loop until documents are okay. Similarly for FC and II.

So the loops for RDS and II need to be modeled as loops. 

Let me try to outline the transitions and places step by step:

First, the main path without considering loops:

Start -> CR -> DV -> (maybe loops here) -> FC -> (maybe loops here) -> CA -> (AP if needed) -> P -> N -> CL -> End.

Wait, but the loops complicate this. Let's think about the Document Verification (DV) and the RDS loop first. 

The process after DV:

- After DV, the system checks if documents are complete. If not, RDS (Re-Document Submission) occurs, then back to DV again. This needs to form a loop where after RDS, you go back to DV again until it passes. 

So the transitions would be:

DV is followed by a decision: does the document verification pass? The Petri net can't have such a condition, so we need to model it as a loop. 

To model the loop, you can have an OR-split and OR-join, but perhaps using a loop structure. Let's see.

Alternatively, the transitions can be arranged such that after DV, you can either proceed to the next step (FC) or loop back via RDS. But in Petri nets, this requires a place with two outgoing transitions. Hmm, perhaps the structure is:

DV's outgoing arc can go either to the transition RDS or to the next step (FC). Wait, but after RDS, you need to go back to DV again. 

Let me think of the DV-RDS loop:

Place after DV (let's call it p_DV_end). Wait, perhaps the transitions and places need to be arranged as:

Place p0 (start after CR) -> DV transition leads to a place p1. From p1, there's a split: one path goes to RDS and back to DV again, and another path proceeds to FC.

Wait, perhaps the loop for RDS is structured as:

DV is followed by a place p1. From p1, two options:

- If documents are incomplete (leading to RDS), so the RDS transition is there. After RDS, there's a transition back to DV again? So after RDS, you have to go back to DV again. Thus, the transitions would form a loop.

Wait, maybe the structure would be:

After DV, there's a place. From that place:

- If documents are incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again. The loop continues until documents are okay. 

In Petri net terms, the loop would be modeled as a loop with transitions RDS and arcs that allow the loop to repeat. Let me think of it as:

Place p_DV_out comes from DV. From p_DV_out, there's two outgoing transitions: one is RDS and the other goes to FC. Wait, but that's not a loop. Alternatively, after RDS, there's a transition back to DV again, so that after RDS, the process goes back to DV again. So the loop would be:

DV  p_DV_out  RDS  p_RDS_out  back to DV again? But that would create a loop between DV and RDS. But that would require a loop structure where the token can loop through DV and RDS multiple times until some condition is met, but since Petri nets can't have conditions, this is represented with a loop that can be traversed multiple times. So the RDS loop is modeled with a loop between DV and RDS, allowing multiple iterations until the process decides to proceed forward. 

Wait, but in Petri nets, the flow is based on tokens. So perhaps the structure is:

After DV, you have a place leading to two transitions: one is the continuation (FC), and the other is RDS. But to form a loop, the RDS transition must lead back to DV again. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

DV -> place p1. From p1, the RDS transition goes to a place, which then leads back to DV again (so that after RDS, you must go back to DV again). So the loop would be:

DV  p_DV_out  RDS  p_RDS_out  back to DV's input place? Wait, that might not work. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the loop can be modeled with a loop between DV and RDS such that after DV, you can optionally repeat RDS and DV again. 

Wait, maybe the structure is like this:

- After the initial steps, the process is at a place where after DV, you can decide to go to RDS, then back to DV again, or proceed to the next step FC. But since Petri nets can't have conditions, the model must allow the loop to be taken any number of times. 

Hmm, perhaps using a loop where the transitions and places form a loop that can be traversed multiple times. Let's try to design it as a loop. 

For the DV-RDS loop:

- The transition DV is followed by a place p1. From p1, there is an arc to an AND-split or something. Wait, perhaps:

DV is followed by a place p1. From p1, there are two outgoing transitions: RDS and the next step (FC). But that's not a loop. Alternatively, after RDS, you need to go back to DV again. 

Wait here's a possible structure for the RDS loop:

- The DV transition leads to a place p_DV_out.

- From p_DV_out, there are two options: either proceed to the next step (FC), or go to RDS.

But the RDS transition leads back to the input of DV again, so that after RDS, the process can repeat DV again. 

Wait, perhaps the RDS transition leads to a place, then back to DV's input place. 

Wait let me think in terms of transitions and places:

Let me sketch the RDS loop part step by step:

Start after CR:

The places and transitions:

After CR, the process proceeds to DV. 

After DV, the place p1 is created. From p1, two transitions: one is RDS, and another is the next step (FC). But to form a loop, the RDS transition would need to lead back to the input of DV. 

Alternatively, after RDS (transition), you have to go back to DV again. So the RDS transition's output place connects to the input of DV. 

Wait, here's a possible structure:

- The DV transition is followed by a place p_DV_out.

- From p_DV_out, there are two options: 

   a) proceed to the next step (FC) via a transition.

   b) take the RDS path. 

The RDS path would be: from p_DV_out, you have an arc to RDS transition. RDS's output is a place p_RDS_out, which then has an arc back to the input of DV. 

Wait, but that would require that after RDS, the process goes back to the input of DV, so that when the token reaches DV again, it can be fired again. 

Wait, perhaps the structure would look like this:

DV has an input place p_DV_in and output p_DV_out.

From p_DV_out, arcs go to two transitions: RDS and FC. 

Wait no, that would allow choosing between RDS or FC. But if you choose RDS, after that, you have to go back to the DV's input. 

Wait, let me think in terms of transitions and places:

Suppose after the CR step, the next transition is DV. 

DV's output place (p_after_DV) can have two outgoing transitions:

- one is the RDS transition, which leads to a place p_RDS, then transitions to the input of DV again (the input place of DV). So that RDS's output place connects back to the input of DV, so that after RDS, DV can be triggered again. 

Wait, let's structure the RDS loop as follows:

- After DV, the place p_DV_out has an outgoing transition RDS. 

- RDS's output place is connected to the input of DV again. 

Wait, but that would form a loop between DV and RDS. 

Wait, let me see: 

Suppose the places and transitions are arranged so that after DV, the token can either proceed to FC or go through RDS and back to DV again. 

Alternatively, the transition RDS is a loop that can be taken multiple times. Let me think of it as a loop where after RDS, the process goes back to the input of DV. 

Wait, perhaps the RDS loop is structured with a loop between DV and RDS. 

Let me try to model this:

Suppose the transitions involved in the DV/RDS loop are:

- DV is a transition with input place p_after_CR (the place after CR) and output p_DV_out.

- p_DV_out has two outgoing transitions: one is RDS, and another is the FC transition. 

Wait, but if you take the RDS path, then:

After RDS, the token would need to go back to the input of DV again. 

Wait, perhaps:

DV transitions to p_DV_out. From p_DV_out, the RDS transition is available, and after RDS, there's a place which connects back to the input of DV. 

So:

DV's output is p_DV_out.

From p_DV_out, transitions can be RDS or the next step (FC).

Wait, but how to get back to DV? Maybe after RDS, there's an arc to the input of DV again. 

Wait, here's a possible setup for the RDS loop:

Transition DV has an output place p_DV_out.

From p_DV_out, there is a transition RDS. The RDS transition leads to a place p_RDS_out. 

p_RDS_out has an arc to the input place of DV (p_DV_in). So that after RDS, the token is back to the input of DV, allowing it to be fired again. 

This way, the loop can be taken any number of times. 

Similarly for the FC and II loop:

After FC, if there is a doubt, then you proceed to II, then back to FC again. 

So the FC-FC loop would be similar:

After FC, the transition leads to a place p_FC_out.

From p_FC_out, there are two options: proceed to CA, or go to II.

If the II path is taken, after II, you go back to the input of FC, allowing it to be fired again.

So the structure for FC and II is similar to the RDS loop.

Now, for the AP step (Approval):

AP is required only if the compensation amount exceeds a threshold. Since Petri nets can't conditionally choose, perhaps the AP transition is optional, meaning there's a choice to take it or not. Wait, but the problem states that AP is required only when the amount is over the threshold. Since we can't model conditions, maybe the AP is a transition that is optional but can be chosen. But according to the problem statement, the AP must be done when needed. But since in Petri nets, all paths must be allowed, perhaps the model allows skipping AP when not needed, but in reality, the process requires it when needed. However, the problem says it's a must when the threshold is exceeded. Since we can't enforce that, perhaps the model allows both paths, but in the actual process, the token would only take the AP transition when needed. But since the Petri net must allow all possible paths, perhaps the AP is a transition that can be skipped when not needed. Wait, but according to the problem's description, the AP is mandatory when the amount is over the threshold. However, since the Petri net can't model the condition, perhaps the model allows both paths: with or without AP. The user is to decide when to take the AP path. 

Wait, but the problem says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold". So in the Petri net, the AP transition must be part of the path only when the threshold is crossed. Since we can't model that, perhaps the model allows both paths, but the user (or another part of the system) would decide when to take the path. Alternatively, perhaps the AP is a mandatory step, but that contradicts the problem's condition. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. 

Wait, the problem says that AP is required only if the amount is over the threshold. Since the Petri net can't have conditions, the model must allow both paths (with or without AP), but in the process, when the amount is over, the AP must be taken. So in the Petri net, the AP can be an optional transition, but the process must have a choice to take it or not. 

Therefore, after CA (Claim Assessment), which decides the amount), the process must decide between going to AP or skipping it. 

Therefore, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: one that goes directly to P (Payment), but that's not correct. Wait, the steps after CA would be: after CA, if the amount is over, you go to AP, then P, then N, CL. If not, then go directly to P, then N, CL. 

Therefore, after CA, there's a decision point. 

So, the transition CA leads to a place p_CA_out. From p_CA_out, there are two outgoing transitions: AP and (a transition that skips AP, maybe a dummy transition? Or the AP path must be taken when needed. Since in Petri net terms, the place after CA must split into two paths: one going through AP and one not. 

Wait, but the problem says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So whenever the amount is over, the AP must be taken. But in the Petri net, the model must allow both paths, so the user can choose. The Petri net's final marking is the end, so the path must eventually reach the final marking. 

Alternatively, the AP transition is optional, but in the Petri net, it's allowed to be taken or not. But the problem requires that when the amount is over the threshold, AP must be taken. Since we can't model that, perhaps the model must have AP as a possible transition that can be chosen when needed. 

Therefore, after CA, the token is at a place which has transitions AP and the next step (the one that goes to P). Wait, the next step after CA is AP (if needed) followed by P, then N, CL. 

Wait, the steps after CA are:

If AP is needed: CA  AP  P  N  CL.

Else: CA  P  N  CL.

Therefore, the place after CA (p_CA_out) has two transitions: AP and (direct to P). So the transition for the direct path would be a silent transition (tau) or perhaps a dummy transition, but since transitions are labeled with activity names, perhaps the direct path must be modeled by a choice between AP and skipping it. 

Alternatively, the transitions after CA are AP and a transition that leads to P without going through AP. 

So, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and a transition that leads to P. 

Wait, but the problem says "must be approved if the amount surpasses the threshold." So the Petri net must allow for both paths, so the model must have that choice. 

Therefore, in the Petri net, after CA, you can choose between going through AP or not. 

Now, moving on, the rest of the steps: after the AP (if taken) or not, then the next step is Payment (P), then N, then CL.

Now putting this all together. Let me try to list all transitions and their dependencies:

Transitions in order (without loops):

C (but C is the initial step, perhaps modeled as the start place. Wait, the first step after the start is CR (Claim Registration). Wait, the initial marking has a token at the start place, which fires CR first. 

Let me outline all transitions and their order, considering the loops:

Transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Wait, but the steps are:

The steps are:

After CR comes DV.

After DV, there's a possible loop of RDS and back to DV until it's okay. 

Then, after DV is cleared (i.e., the loop is exited when documents are okay), then proceed to FC.

Then FC may lead to II, loop, then FC again until it's cleared. 

Then CA, then AP (if needed), then P, N, CL.

Now, let me start building the Petri net step by step.

Starting with the initial place (im is the start, so the initial marking (im) has a token in the initial place (start_p). Then the first transition is CR (Claim Registration), which is the first activity after the start.

Wait, the process starts with the customer filing the claim (C), but according to the problem description, the first process step is CR (Claim Registration). So the first transition is CR.

Wait the steps listed in the scenario are:

After the customer files the claim (C), the first step is Claim Registration (CR). So the process's first transition is CR.

Therefore, the initial marking (im) has a token in the start place (place_start). Then CR is fired, leading to the next steps.

Let me structure the Petri net step by step, starting with the main flow and then adding the loops.

First, the start place (start_p) has the initial token. 

1. Start_p  CR (transition "CR")  then to a place p_CR_out.

2. p_CR_out  DV (transition "DV")  p_DV_out.

Now, at p_DV_out, the process can either proceed to RDS or proceed to FC. 

Wait, no. The problem says that if the documents are incomplete after DV, then RDS is done, then back to DV again. So the loop is that after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again, until the documents are complete (so that the next time, the process can proceed to FC). 

To model this loop, the RDS and DV steps must form a loop. 

So after DV, the token is at p_DV_out. 

From p_DV_out, there are two transitions: 

- RDS (Re-Document Submission), which would take the token and loop back to DV's input place, so that after RDS, the process goes back to DV again. 

- The other option is to proceed to FC. 

Wait, the RDS transition would have to go back to the input of DV. 

So:

p_DV_out has two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC (wait, no, FC is not the next step until after the RDS loop is done. Wait, the next step after the RDS loop is FC. 

Wait, the RDS is part of the loop. So after DV, if RDS is needed, then after RDS, the process must loop back to DV again. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

After DV's output place p_DV_out, the token can choose to go to RDS, which leads to a place p_RDS, which then connects to the input of DV (so that DV can be fired again), or proceed to FC. 

Wait, to allow the loop, the RDS transition's output place must arc back to the input of DV. 

Wait, let me draw it step by step:

- After DV's transition, the output place is p_DV_out.

- From p_DV_out, the RDS transition's input is p_DV_out. 

- RDS's output is a place p_RDS_out. 

- p_RDS_out has an arc to the input of DV. 

- Additionally, p_DV_out also has an arc to FC's input. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

- The transition RDS is between p_DV_out and p_RDS_out. 

- p_RDS_out has an arc to the input place of DV (the input of DV is the place before DV's firing. 

Wait, the input place of DV is the place where the token comes from. 

Wait, transitions have input and output places. Let me think of the transitions and their connections.

Let me try to model the RDS loop:

The DV transition's output is p_DV_out. 

The RDS transition requires that after DV, if RDS is needed, the token goes through RDS and then back to the input of DV, so that DV can be fired again. 

So the input of DV is the place before DV's firing. Let's call the input of DV as p_DV_in. 

Wait, the initial input for DV is the place after CR's output. 

Wait, starting from the beginning:

Start place (p_start) has a token in im. 

p_start  transition CR  p_CR_out.

p_CR_out  transition DV  p_DV_out.

At p_DV_out, the token can either go to RDS (if needed), or to FC. 

Wait, but if the documents are incomplete, the process must do RDS, then loop back to DV again. 

So the transitions for the RDS loop would be:

From p_DV_out, the RDS transition is possible. 

After RDS, the transition RDS leads to a place p_RDS_out. 

p_RDS_out needs to connect back to the input place of DV (the place that feeds into DV's input. Wait, the input of DV is p_DV_in which is p_CR_out (since it's the place after CR's output, which is p_CR_out. Wait, the input of DV is p_CR_out, but after DV is fired, the input place (p_DV_in) is consumed. 

Wait perhaps the loop requires that after RDS, the token goes back to the input of DV (p_DV_in). 

Wait, the DV transition consumes the token from its input place (p_DV_in) and produces a token in p_DV_out. 

So, to loop back, after RDS, the token must be placed back into p_DV_in, so that the next time, DV can fire again. 

So the RDS transition:

The RDS transition would need to have an input place p_DV_out and output p_RDS_out. 

Then, from p_RDS_out, there's an arc to p_DV_in (the input place of DV). 

Wait but in Petri nets, each transition consumes tokens from its input places and produces tokens in output places. 

Wait, let's try to model the RDS loop:

The loop between DV and RDS must allow multiple iterations. 

Let me try to model the RDS loop as follows:

- After DV (transition), the output is p_DV_out.

- From p_DV_out, the token can choose between two transitions: RDS or FC. 

Wait, but FC is the next step after DV is successful. 

Wait, to form a loop, the RDS must loop back to the input of DV. 

So:

After RDS, the transition RDS has an output p_RDS_out, which then has an arc to the input place of DV (p_DV_in). 

Wait, the input place for DV is p_DV_in (the place where the token was before DV was fired, which was the output of CR, p_CR_out). Wait, perhaps the DV's input is p_CR_out (the output of CR. 

Wait, the sequence is:

Start_p (initial marking)  CR (transition)  p_CR_out.

p_CR_out is the input place for DV. 

DV's transition consumes p_CR_out's token and produces a token in p_DV_out. 

Then, after DV, if documents are incomplete, the token is at p_DV_out, and the RDS transition is available. 

The RDS transition consumes p_DV_out's token, produces a token in p_RDS_out. 

Then, p_Rds_out has an output arc to p_DV_in (the input of DV, which was p_CR_out. 

Wait, but after RDS, the process must loop back to the input of DV, so that when the token is back in p_CR_out, the DV can be fired again. 

Thus, after RDS, the token is placed back into p_CR_out, allowing DV to be fired again. 

Wait, but the RDS transition's output place is connected to the input of DV (p_CR_out). 

Wait, but that would mean that after RDS, the token is placed back into p_CR_out. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

After DV outputs to p_DV_out, the RDS transition is available. 

RDS's output place connects to the input of DV (the place before DV's input? Wait, the input of DV is p_CR_out. 

Wait, maybe the RDS transition's output place has an arc to p_DV_in (the input place of DV. 

Thus:

RDS's output is p_RDS_out. 

p_RDS_out has an arc to the input of DV (p_DV_in, which is p_CR_out. 

Wait, but then after RDS, the token is placed back to p_CR_out, allowing the DV transition to be fired again. 

This allows the loop. 

Thus, the loop between DV and RDS would form a loop that can be repeated any number of times, until the process decides to proceed to FC. 

But how does the process decide to proceed to FC? 

Wait, the loop can be exited when the documents are complete, so the process can choose to proceed to FC instead of going back. 

Therefore, the p_DV_out (the output of DV) has two outgoing transitions:

- RDS (leading back to the DV loop) 

- FC (leading to the next step)

Wait, no. The FC transition's input would be p_DV_out's token. But to proceed to FC, the token must be consumed from p_DV_out. 

Alternatively, the structure is:

After DV fires, the token is at p_DV_out. 

From p_DV_out, the RDS transition can be fired, leading back to the input of DV (so that another DV can fire after that). 

Alternatively, to proceed to FC, the token must go through FC transition from p_DV_out. 

Wait, perhaps the FC transition's input is p_DV_out. 

Wait, this might require that proceeding to FC requires that the transition FC can be taken from p_DV_out. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows:

The place after DV (p_DV_out) has two outgoing transitions: 

- RDS (which loops back to the input of DV) 

- FC (the next step). 

Wait, but to allow the loop, the RDS transition's output must lead back to the input of DV. 

Wait, let's try to model the RDS loop:

- After DV's output p_DV_out, the transitions available are RDS and FC. 

Wait, but if the user chooses to take the RDS path, then after RDS, the token is back to the input of DV (p_DV_in, which is p_CR_out). 

Thus, after RDS's firing, the token is placed back into p_CR_out (DV's input), consuming the token from p_DV_out. 

Wait, this might require that RDS's output is connected back to the input of DV. 

Wait, let me try:

- RDS transition has input p_DV_out and output p_RDS_out. 

- p_RDS_out has an arc to p_DV_in (the input of DV, which is p_CR_out. 

Thus, after RDS, the token is placed back into the input of DV (p_CR_out), allowing the DV transition to fire again. 

Therefore, the RDS loop is formed between DV and RDS. 

Similarly for the FC and II loop. 

Now, for the FC and II loop:

After FC (Fraud Check), the check may require an In-depth Investigation (II) which loops back to FC again. 

So, the structure would be:

After FC's output place (p_FC_out), the token can choose to go to II (leading to the II transition, which loops back to FC's input, or proceed to the next step (CA). 

Wait, the next step after FC is CA (Claim Assessment). But if FC detected fraud, then II is done, leading back to FC again. 

Thus, the FC-FC loop:

After FC's output place p_FC_out, the token can go to II (In-depth Investigation) or proceed to CA. 

The II transition's output leads back to FC's input place (p_FC_in), so that FC can be fired again. 

Thus, the II loop is similar to the RDS loop. 

Now, the Approval (AP) step is only required if the amount is over the threshold. 

After CA (Claim Assessment), which decides the amount. 

The CA transition's output is p_CA_out. 

From p_CA_out, there's a choice between going to AP (if needed) or proceeding directly to P. 

Wait, but the problem says "must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold." So AP is only taken when needed. 

Thus, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: AP and a transition that skips AP. 

Wait, but how? 

Perhaps the AP is an optional transition that can be taken when needed. So the transition AP is optional. 

Thus, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and (a transition leading to P without taking AP). 

Wait, but the next steps after CA are either AP followed by P, or directly to P. 

Wait, the AP is only required when needed. So the Petri net allows choosing between taking AP or not. 

Therefore, the transitions after CA are:

From p_CA_out, transitions are AP and a silent transition? No, each transition must be labeled. 

Alternatively, the path without AP would require a dummy transition, but the problem requires the transitions to have the activity names. 

Wait, perhaps the model allows the process to choose either to take AP (when needed) or skip it (when not needed). Thus, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: AP and the transition to P. 

Wait, but then the path without AP would go to P directly. 

Alternatively, the AP transition is optional. 

So the transitions after CA are AP and the next step (P. 

Wait, but the next step after CA is either AP or P. 

Wait, the steps after CA are:

If AP is needed: CA  AP  P  N  CL

Or if AP is not needed: CA  P  N  CL.

Thus, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and (a transition to P. 

Wait, but the transition to P is "Payment", but then the AP is only taken when needed. 

Therefore, the structure after CA is:

p_CA_out can fire either AP or P. 

Wait, but that would mean that AP is optional. 

Therefore, the transitions from p_CA_out are AP and P. 

Wait, but the P transition's input would be p_CA_out, but if AP is taken, then AP's output would go to P's input. 

Hmm, perhaps:

The place after CA (p_CA_out) has two outgoing transitions: AP and the transition to P (but that can't be, since P is after AP. 

Wait, actually, the correct flow is:

If AP is needed, then the path is CA  AP  P  N  CL.

If not needed, it's CA  P  N  CL.

So the place after CA must split into two transitions: AP (leading to AP, then to P, etc.), or directly to P. 

Thus, the structure is:

After CA, the token is in p_CA_out. 

From p_CA_out, there are two transitions: 

- AP (if the amount is over threshold), then this is taken, and after AP, it goes to P. 

- A dummy transition that skips AP, leading directly to P. 

Wait, but the problem says that AP is only needed when the threshold is crossed. Since the Petri net can't enforce that, the model must allow both paths, and the final marking must have the process reach the end regardless of the path taken. 

Thus, the Petri net must have both paths. 

Therefore, the transitions after CA are:

AP and another transition (the direct path to P. Wait, but the direct path would require a transition, which would have to be labeled with a new activity, but the problem states that the steps are CA  (AP if needed)  P  N  CL. 

Alternatively, the path without AP would have the token go directly to P. 

Wait, perhaps the transitions after CA are AP and P. 

Wait, but then the P transition would have two incoming places? 

Alternatively, the structure is:

p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: 

- the AP transition, which requires that the token goes through AP, then to P. 

- a transition that goes directly to P (but that would be a separate path). 

Wait this is getting complicated. Let me think of the places and transitions for the AP condition:

Let me structure it as an OR-split and OR-join. 

Wait, perhaps after CA, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and a silent transition (tau), but the problem requires transitions to have activity labels, so that can't be. 

Alternatively, the model can have an OR-split at p_CA_out, leading to two paths: 

- Path 1: AP  P  N  CL.

- Path 2: (skip AP)  P  N  CL. 

Wait, but the transitions must have labels. 

Thus, the transitions would be:

AP is one transition, and the other path must have a transition that's not AP. But that's not an activity. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem requires that the AP is an optional transition. The Petri net can have the AP transition as optional, so the model allows both paths. 

Thus,
