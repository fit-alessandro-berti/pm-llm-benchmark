To group the events into separate cases based on the given attributes and logical order, we need to identify sequences of activities that logically belong together for each patient. We can do this by matching the `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and `timestamp` across events, ensuring that the activities flow logically from one to the next.

Let's analyze and group the events:

### Case 1: Patient Age 45, Gender M, Department ER

### Summary of Cases:
1. **Case 1:** Patient Age 45, Gender M, Department ER
   - Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 15

2. **Case 2:** Patient Age 62, Gender F, Department ER
   - Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17

3. **Case 3:** Patient Age 28, Gender M, Department Surgery
   - Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

By following the sequence and matching the attributes, we can confidently group these events into the three distinct cases.
