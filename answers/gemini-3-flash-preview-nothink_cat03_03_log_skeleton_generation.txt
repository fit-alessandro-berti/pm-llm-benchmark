Based on the scenario provided for the order fulfillment process, here is the Log Skeleton represented as a Python dictionary.

This model assumes a standard sequential flow where each step is required to complete the order, and each activity occurs exactly once.

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('CA', 'RO'),    # CA needs RO to have happened
        ('RI', 'CA'),    # RI needs CA
        ('PI', 'RI'),    # PI needs RI
        ('QC', 'PI'),    # QC needs PI
        ('PO', 'QC'),    # PO needs QC
        ('GSL', 'PO'),   # GSL needs PO
        ('D', 'GSL'),    # D needs GSL
        ('IC', 'D'),     # IC needs D
        ('RP', 'IC')     # RP needs IC
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),    # RO is followed eventually by CA
        ('CA', 'RI'),    # CA is followed eventually by RI
        ('RI', 'PI'),    # RI is followed eventually by PI
        ('PI', 'QC'),    # PI is followed eventually by QC
        ('QC', 'PO'),    # QC is followed eventually by PO
        ('PO', 'GSL'),   # PO is followed eventually by GSL
        ('GSL', 'D'),    # GSL is followed eventually by D
        ('D', 'IC'),     # D is followed eventually by IC
        ('IC', 'RP')     # IC is followed eventually by RP
    },
    'never_together': set(),  # In this linear success path, all activities co-exist
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},
        'CA': {1},
        'RI': {1},
        'PI': {1},
        'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1},
        'GSL': {1},
        'D': {1},
        'IC': {1},
        'RP': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('RO', 'CA'),
        ('CA', 'RI'),
        ('RI', 'PI'),
        ('PI', 'QC'),
        ('QC', 'PO'),
        ('PO', 'GSL'),
        ('GSL', 'D'),
        ('D', 'IC'),
        ('IC', 'RP')
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Constraints:
1.  **Equivalence**: Since this is a mandatory linear pipeline, every activity occurs exactly the same number of times as the others (once).
2.  **Always Before**: Defines the prerequisites. For example, `('CA', 'RO')` indicates that Checking Availability cannot happen unless the Order has been Received.
3.  **Always After**: Defines the obligations. For example, `('RO', 'CA')` indicates that once an Order is Received, the system is obligated to eventually Check Availability.
4.  **Never Together**: This is empty because all listed activities are part of a single cohesive process flow and are expected to occur in the same case (order).
5.  **Activity Freq**: Each activity is constrained to occur exactly `{1}` time per order to ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate billing or shipping.
6.  **Directly-Follows**: This defines the strict step-by-step sequence of the warehouse operations (e.g., you must generate the label immediately before dispatching, and pack the order immediately before generating the label).
