To determine which cases violate the normative process as described, we will systematically examine each case in the event log and compare its sequence of activities to the expected flow outlined in the normative description. Below is the analysis for each case:

### **Case 1**

Sequence of Activities:

- 2023-10-05 09:00: Receive order
- 2023-10-05 10:00: Check inventory
- 2023-10-05 11:00: Authorize payment
- 2023-10-05 12:00: Package items
- 2023-10-05 13:00: Ship order
- 2023-10-05 14:00: Close order

**Analysis:**

- **Check inventory** is correctly performed after "Receive order."
- **Authorize payment** is correctly performed after "Check inventory."
- **Package items** is correctly performed after "Authorize payment."
- **Ship order** is correctly performed after "Package items."
- **Close order** is the final activity.

**Conclusion:** No violations—the case adheres to the normative process.

### **Case 2**

Sequence of Activities:

- 2023-10-06 09:00: Receive order
- 2023-10-06 09:30: Check inventory
- 2023-10-06 10:00: Package items
- 2023-10-06 10:30: Authorize payment
- 2023-10-06 11:00: Ship order
- 2023-10-06 11:30: Close order

**Analysis:**

- **Package items** occurs before **Authorize payment**, which violates the norm that packaging should only occur after payment is authorized.

**Conclusion:** Violates the normative process.

**Explanation of the Violation:** "Package items" should only happen after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order." The sequence in Case 2 ignores this requirement and proceeds to package items prematurely, which is not logical according to the normative flow.

### **Case 3**

Sequence of Activities:

- 2023-10-07 09:00: Receive order
- 2023-10-07 09:20: Check inventory
- 2023-10-07 09:40: Authorize payment
- 2023-10-07 10:00: Cancel order
- 2023-10-07 10:30: Ship order
- 2023-10-07 11:00: Close order

**Analysis:**

- After **Check inventory**, **Authorize payment** is performed, which is correct.
- The order is canceled with a **Cancel order** activity, but then **Ship order** is performed, which is a direct violation, as shipping should not occur after cancellation.

**Conclusion:** Violates the normative process.

**Explanation of the Violation:** "Ship order" should not occur after **Cancel order**. The process should have transitioned directly from "Cancel order" to "Close order" without any fulfillment activities like packaging, shipment, or payment authorization.

### **Case 4**

Sequence of Activities:

- 2023-10-08 09:00: Receive order
- 2023-10-08 09:10: Check inventory
- 2023-10-08 09:20: Cancel order
- 2023-10-08 09:50: Close order

**Analysis:**

- After **Check inventory**, **Cancel order** is performed, which is correct for an insufficient inventory scenario.
- The **Close order** activity is performed after **Cancel order**, which matches the expected behavior for an insufficient inventory scenario.

**Conclusion:** No violations—the case adheres to the normative process for insufficient inventory.

### **Case 5**

Sequence of Activities:

- 2023-10-09 09:00: Receive order
- 2023-10-09 10:00: Check inventory
- 2023-10-09 10:30: Authorize payment
- 2023-10-09 11:00: Ship order
- 2023-10-09 11:30: Close order

**Analysis:**

- **Check inventory** is correctly performed after "Receive order."
- **Authorize payment** is correctly performed after "Check inventory."
- **Ship order** is correctly performed after "Authorize payment."
- **Close order** is the final activity.

**Conclusion:** No violations—the case adheres to the normative process.

### **Summary of Findings:**

- **Case 2:** Violates the normative process by performing **Package items** before **Authorize payment**.
- **Case 3:** Violates the normative process by performing **Ship order** after **Cancel order**.
- **Case 4:** No violations.
- **Case 5:** No violations.

### **Explanation of Deviations:**

- In **Case 2**, the premature packaging of items before the payment is authorized deviates from the norm that **"Package items"** must follow **"Authorize payment"**.
- In **Case 3**, the sequence of **Ship order** after **Cancel order** is incompatible with the normative requirement that **"Ship order"** must not occur after cancellation. This step implies that the cancellation decision was ignored or improperly handled.

These deviations represent types of violations that can occur when certain steps in the normative process are either skipped, improperly ordered, or occur when they should not.
