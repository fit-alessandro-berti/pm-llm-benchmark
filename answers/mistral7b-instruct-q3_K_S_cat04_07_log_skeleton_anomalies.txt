1. There are multiple activity nodes for a single occurrence of a declaration, such as "Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION" and "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE". It is not clear which node should be considered the final approval status.
2. The "Request Payment" node has no input data, but it can only occur after a declaration has been approved by a budget owner or pre-approver. This could cause issues if there are no available budget owners or pre-approvers to approve the request.
3. The "Payment Handled" activity node appears to have inconsistent conditions for its execution. It is triggered by the payment amount, which should be used as a parameter in the decision model.
4. The decision model is missing some important details, such as the conditions under which a declaration can be approved or rejected by each approval authority (budget owner, pre-approver, supervisor, and administrator). These conditions should be explicitly defined in order to accurately reflect the process.
5. The decision model also lacks information on how the final approval status is determined if there are conflicting approvals from different authorities, such as when a budget owner rejects the declaration but a pre-approver approves it. A clear resolution mechanism should be included in the decision model to ensure that all approvals are properly resolved and a consistent final approval status is established.
