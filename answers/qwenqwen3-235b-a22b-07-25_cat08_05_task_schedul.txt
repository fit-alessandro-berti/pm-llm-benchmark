# **Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategy for Precision Parts Inc. Using Process Mining**

As a Senior Operations Analyst specializing in manufacturing optimization, I present a comprehensive, data-driven approach to transform Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling performance. This strategy leverages **process mining** as the foundational analytical engine to diagnose systemic inefficiencies and design adaptive, predictive scheduling solutions. The goal is to reduce tardiness, lower WIP, stabilize lead times, improve resource utilization, and build resilience against disruptions—all while leveraging existing MES data.

## **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

### **Reconstructing Actual Job Flow with Process Mining**

Using the detailed MES event logs, I would apply **process discovery algorithms** (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristic Miner) to reconstruct the *actual* execution paths of jobs across the shop floor. Unlike idealized routing templates, process mining reveals the real-world variability in job flows—deviations, rework loops, skipped tasks, or unexpected routing changes—caused by machine constraints, quality failures, or operator decisions.

Key reconstructed elements:
- **Job case trajectories**: Trace each `Case ID` from release to completion, identifying the sequence of tasks, resources used, and timing.
- **Resource-centric views**: Reconstruct the sequence of jobs processed on each machine (e.g., CUT-01, MILL-03) to analyze utilization and setup patterns.
- **Temporal alignment**: Synchronize timestamps to compute durations between key events (queue entry  start, setup start  end, task end  next queue).

### **Quantifying Performance with Process Mining Metrics**

#### **1.1. Lead Time, Flow Time, and Makespan**
- **Flow time per job**: Duration from `Job Released` to final `Task End` (e.g., Quality Inspection).
- **Lead time distribution**: Analyze via histograms and percentiles (e.g., 90th percentile) to understand predictability.
- **Makespan analysis**: For overlapping job sets, compute total shop floor makespan and identify periods of congestion.

*Technique*: Use **conformance checking** to compare actual flow times against quoted or planned lead times.

#### **1.2. Task Waiting Times (Queue Delays)**
- For each task, calculate the time between `Queue Entry` and `Task Start`.
- Aggregate by **work center**, **priority**, and **job type** to detect bottlenecks or priority inversion.
- Visualize using **bottleneck analysis maps** (e.g., heatmaps of average wait times per resource).

#### **1.3. Resource Utilization Analysis**
Decompose machine/operator time into:
- **Productive time**: Actual task execution.
- **Setup time**: From `Setup Start` to `Setup End`.
- **Idle time**: Gaps between jobs.
- **Downtime**: From `Breakdown Start` to recovery.

*Metrics*:
- **Utilization rate** = (Productive + Setup) / (Total available time – Scheduled downtime)
- **Setup-to-run ratio**: % of machine time spent on setups
- **Operator-machine matching**: Identify skill constraints (e.g., OP-105 only on CUT-01)

#### **1.4. Sequence-Dependent Setup Time Modeling**
This is critical due to metal properties affecting changeover complexity.

*Approach*:
- For each machine, extract sequences: `(Previous Job Material, Geometry)  (Current Job Material, Geometry)`
- Compute setup duration = `Setup End` – `Setup Start`
- Build a **setup time matrix** using clustering or regression:
  - Group jobs by material (e.g., stainless steel, aluminum), geometry (e.g., cylindrical, flat), and tooling requirements.
  - Apply **machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest) to predict setup time based on job pair features.
  - Validate using cross-validation on historical data.

*Output*: A predictive model of setup duration given job transition characteristics.

#### **1.5. Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**
- **Tardiness** = max(0, Completion Time – Due Date)
- **On-time delivery rate**: % of jobs completed before due date
- **Earliness/Tardiness distribution**: Assess penalty exposure
- **Slack time erosion**: Monitor how remaining time-to-due-date shrinks relative to remaining work

*Process mining technique*: **Variant analysis** comparing on-time vs. late job paths.

#### **1.6. Impact of Disruptions**
- Tag events like `Breakdown Start`, `Priority Change`, `Rush Order Insertion`.
- Use **social network analysis** or **dependency graphs** to trace ripple effects:
  - Did MILL-02 breakdown cause JOB-7001 to wait at MILL-03?
  - How many jobs were delayed after JOB-7005 became "Urgent"?
- Quantify:
  - Average delay per breakdown hour
  - WIP inflation post-disruption
  - Recovery time to baseline throughput

## **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Using insights from process mining, we can identify root inefficiencies in the current scheduling logic.

### **Key Pathologies Identified**

#### **P1: Bottleneck Resources Driving Systemic Delays**
- **Evidence**: High queue times (>2h) at CNC Milling stations (MILL-02, MILL-03), especially for high-complexity jobs.
- **Process mining insight**: Bottleneck analysis shows MILL-02 has 85% utilization, but 40% of its time is idle due to upstream starvation—indicating **poor synchronization**, not pure capacity shortage.

#### **P2: Poor Prioritization Leading to Priority Inversion**
- **Evidence**: High-priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) waited behind medium-priority jobs despite urgent due dates.
- **Variant analysis**: Late high-priority jobs often entered queues *after* lower-priority jobs but were not expedited.
- **Root cause**: FCFS rule dominates at work centers, overriding global EDD logic.

#### **P3: Suboptimal Sequencing Increasing Setup Times**
- **Evidence**: Frequent transitions between dissimilar materials (e.g., aluminum  hardened steel) on CUT-01, leading to 30+ min setups.
- **Setup matrix analysis**: 60% of setups exceed 25 minutes when material changes; only 8 minutes when same family.
- **Opportunity**: Grouping similar jobs could reduce total setup time by 35–50%.

#### **P4: Starvation of Downstream Resources**
- **Evidence**: MILL-03 frequently idle despite long queues at CUT-01.
- **Root cause**: Jobs released in batches, creating "waves" of WIP followed by dry spells.
- **Bullwhip effect**: Upstream scheduling decisions amplify variability downstream.

#### **P5: Reactive Handling of Disruptions**
- **Evidence**: After MILL-02 breakdown, no rescheduling occurred for 90 minutes.
- **Impact**: 12 jobs delayed by average 4.2 hours; WIP increased by 27%.
- **Diagnosis**: Lack of real-time rescheduling capability.

## **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

The pathologies stem from deeper systemic flaws in scheduling philosophy and infrastructure.

### **Root Causes**

| Issue | Root Cause | How Process Mining Helps Diagnose |
|------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Inefficient sequencing** | Static dispatching rules ignore setup dependencies | Setup time matrix reveals cost of poor sequencing; clustering identifies optimal job families |
| **High tardiness** | Local rules (FCFS/EDD) don’t consider global constraints | Variant analysis shows late jobs often passed through high-wait resources ignored by local logic |
| **WIP inflation** | Batch-and-queue releases without load balancing | Flow analysis shows WIP spikes after job releases; Little’s Law confirms imbalance |
| **Unpredictable lead times** | Task duration estimates based on averages, not distributions | Mining reveals bimodal or skewed durations (e.g., Grinding: 30–90 min), invalidating point estimates |
| **Poor disruption response** | No integrated real-time scheduler | Event correlation shows long gap between breakdown and rescheduling action |

### **Differentiating Scheduling vs. Capacity Issues**
- **Process mining enables separation**:
  - If a machine has high **utilization + high idle time**, the issue is **scheduling/synchronization**.
  - If high **utilization + low idle + short queues**, it’s a **true capacity bottleneck**.
  - If queues grow but utilization drops, it’s a **coordination or release policy failure**.

In Precision Parts Inc.’s case, **scheduling logic** is the primary culprit—not raw capacity.

## **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

Based on the diagnosis, I propose three sophisticated, data-informed scheduling strategies.

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Factor Dispatching Rules (DMF-DR)**

#### **Core Logic**
Replace static FCFS/EDD with **context-aware, weighted scoring rules** applied at each work center. The job with the highest score gets priority.

**Scoring Function**:
```
Score = w1*(Urgency) + w2*(Setup Cost Avoidance) + w3*(Downstream Load) + w4*(Tardiness Risk)
```

Where:
- **Urgency** = (Due Date – Current Time) / Remaining Processing Time (Critical Ratio)
- **Setup Cost Avoidance** = 1 / Predicted Setup Time (from setup matrix)
- **Downstream Load** = 1 / (Queue length at next operation)
- **Tardiness Risk** = Probability job becomes late if delayed (from historical delay models)

Weights (`w1–w4`) are optimized via simulation (see Section 5).

#### **Process Mining Input**
- Setup time prediction model
- Historical task duration distributions (for remaining work estimate)
- Queue length patterns by time of day
- Due date performance by job type

#### **Pathologies Addressed**
- P2 (Poor prioritization)
- P3 (Suboptimal sequencing)
- P4 (Downstream starvation)

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
| KPI | Expected Change |
|-----|-----------------|
| Tardiness |  30–40% |
| WIP |  20–25% |
| Setup Time |  15% |
| Utilization |  8–10% (better flow) |

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Rolling Horizon Scheduling (PRHS)**

#### **Core Logic**
Implement a **receding horizon optimizer** that generates schedules over a 24–48 hour window, updated every 2–4 hours with real-time shop floor status.

The scheduler uses:
- **Stochastic task durations** (from mined distributions: Weibull, Lognormal fits)
- **Predictive setup times** (from ML model)
- **Predictive maintenance signals** (if sensor data available; else, use mined MTBF/MTTR)
- **Disruption probabilities** (e.g., 15% chance MILL-02 fails in next 8h)

Optimization objective:
```
Minimize: (Tardiness_i × Priority_i) +  × (Queue_j) +  × (Setup_k)
```

Solved via **metaheuristics** (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing) or **Constraint Programming**.

#### **Process Mining Input**
- Task duration distributions per job type/machine
- Breakdown frequency and duration patterns
- Setup time model
- Routing variants (to handle rework or skips)

#### **Pathologies Addressed**
- P1 (Bottlenecks)
- P5 (Reactive disruption handling)
- Unpredictable lead times

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
| KPI | Expected Change |
|-----|-----------------|
| Lead Time Predictability |  50% (narrower confidence intervals) |
| Tardiness |  45–55% |
| WIP |  30% |
| Makespan |  15–20% |

---

### **Strategy 3: Setup-Optimized Batching & Sequencing at Bottlenecks (SOBS-B)**

#### **Core Logic**
At identified bottlenecks (e.g., MILL-02, CUT-01), implement **intelligent batching**:
1. **Cluster jobs** into families based on:
   - Material type
   - Geometry
   - Tooling requirements
   (Using k-means or hierarchical clustering on job attributes)
2. **Sequence batches** to minimize inter-batch setup.
3. **Schedule batches** as super-jobs, with internal FCFS or EDD.

Use **setup transition graph** to find optimal sequence (Travelling Salesman Problem formulation).

#### **Process Mining Input**
- Setup time matrix
- Job attribute frequency (material/geometry distribution)
- Batch size vs. wait time trade-off analysis

#### **Implementation**
- Integrate with PRHS: Batches become scheduling units.
- Allow breaking batches only for true emergencies.

#### **Pathologies Addressed**
- P3 (Suboptimal sequencing)
- P1 (Bottleneck inefficiency)

#### **Expected KPI Impact**
| KPI | Expected Change |
|-----|-----------------|
| Setup Time at Bottlenecks |  40–50% |
| Effective Capacity |  12–18% |
| WIP near bottlenecks |  25% |
| Tardiness |  20% (via faster throughput) |

## **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

### **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) for Strategy Validation**

#### **Model Development**
Build a DES model (using tools like Simio, Arena, or AnyLogic) parameterized with process mining outputs:

- **Job arrivals**: Non-stationary Poisson process (from release log patterns)
- **Routings**: Probabilistic variants from discovered process maps
- **Task times**: Sampled from fitted distributions (e.g., Weibull for Grinding)
- **Setups**: Use setup matrix + clustering rules
- **Breakdowns**: MTBF/MTTR from downtime logs
- **Dispatching logic**: Implement baseline (FCFS) vs. DMF-DR vs. PRHS

#### **Test Scenarios**
| Scenario | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **Baseline (current)** | Establish performance floor |
| **High load (120% capacity)** | Stress-test strategies under congestion |
| **Frequent breakdowns (2× normal)** | Evaluate robustness |
| **Hot job surge (5 urgent jobs/day)** | Test responsiveness |
| **Mixed priorities** | Assess fairness and prioritization |

#### **Evaluation Metrics**
- Mean and 95th percentile **flow time**
- % **on-time delivery**
- **WIP level** and **WIP turnover**
- **Resource utilization** and **idle time**
- **Setup time per job**

Use **ANOVA or DOE** to statistically compare strategies.

### **Framework for Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation**

#### **Real-Time Process Mining Dashboard**
Deploy a live process mining engine (e.g., Celonis, UiPath Process Mining) to:
- Monitor KPIs in real time
- Detect **deviations** from expected behavior
- Trigger alerts for:
  - Tardiness risk > threshold
  - Queue length > 3
  - Setup time > predicted 95th percentile

#### **Automated Feedback Loop**
