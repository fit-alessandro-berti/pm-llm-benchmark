The XOR around `CheckLocalAffiliation (D)` encodes a structural, pathspecific advantage for some applicants.

After `PreliminaryScoring (C)`, the model does:

- `XOR(D, skip)`  
- then `ManualReview (E)`  
- then `FinalDecision (F)`

Only applicants routed through `D` get the “subtle score uplift.” Those routed through the silent `skip` never have access to that additional potential benefit. This is not just logging detail; it’s hardcoded into the control flow: the process gives an extra opportunity for improvement to some applicants and not to others.

### How the branching introduces bias

1. **Selective opportunity for uplift**  
   Two applicants with the same financial profile and identical preliminary score may be treated differently solely because one is eligible for `CheckLocalAffiliation` and the other is not. For example:

   - Applicant L (local, community member):  
     - Score after C: 590  
     - D adds a small uplift: 590  610  approved.
   - Applicant N (nonlocal, otherwise identical profile):  
     - Score after C: 590  
     - Goes through `skip`: stays at 590  rejected.

   The XOR encodes this difference: only some traces include `D`; others are forced to skip. That’s a processlevel bias, not an outcome accident.

2. **Asymmetric treatment, no symmetric alternative**  
   There is no corresponding “extra uplift” path for nonlocal applicants. The special treatment is onesided: a bonus for a specific group, not a neutral refinement that everyone goes through.

3. **Potential proxy discrimination**  
   Even if “local affiliation” is not, by itself, a legally protected characteristic, it can be strongly correlated with protected attributes (e.g., ethnicity, religion, national origin, socioeconomic status due to residential segregation). So:
   - On paper: “We favor local community members.”
   - In practice: “We favor groups that, statistically, look like X,” where X may overlap with protected classes.

   This is classic *proxy discrimination* or *disparate impact*: a seemingly neutral criterion that reproduces grouplevel inequalities.

### Implications for fairness and equity

1. **Violation of individual fairness**  
   A common notion of fairness is: similar individuals should be treated similarly. Because the XOR gives one group an extra positive step, applicants who are equivalent in risk terms can end up on opposite sides of the decision boundary solely due to local affiliation. That undermines individual fairness.

2. **Skewed portfolio and systemic effects**  
   Over many applications, locals accumulate approvals (and creditbuilding opportunities), while nonlocals are systematically more often rejected near the threshold. This can:
   - Concentrate credit access within certain communities.
   - Limit mobility or opportunities for those who move into the area or come from elsewhere.
   - Reinforce existing geographic and socioeconomic divides.

3. **“Nonprotected” does not mean harmless**  
   Giving an incremental advantage to a nonlegally protected group:
   - May be legally tolerated in some jurisdictions, but
   - Can still be ethically problematic, damage trust, and conflict with internal fairness policies or regulatory expectations on “responsible AI” and creditworthiness assessment.
   - Can become legally risky if the “nonprotected” feature acts as a strong proxy for protected features (e.g., redlining via postal codes).

4. **Opacity and auditability issues**  
   Because the “skip” is a silent transition, the uplift path may be invisible at a businessrule level unless explicitly analyzed. From logs, it might look like:
   - Some applicants have an extra event before manual review.
   - Others do not.
   If reviewers or regulators aren’t aware of the XOR logic, the source of grouplevel differences in outcomes can be hard to detect.

---

In summary, the XOR branch that conditionally inserts `CheckLocalAffiliation (D)` introduces a builtin advantage for a specific group. Even if that group is not explicitly protected by law, this selective opportunity for an uplift can be unfair at the individual level, can create or amplify grouplevel disparities via proxy effects, and can undermine the perceived equity and legitimacy of the final loan decisions.
