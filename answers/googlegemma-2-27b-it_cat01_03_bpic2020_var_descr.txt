This data describes the variations within a process related to  **expense reimbursement** or **approval of financial documents**. 

Here's a breakdown based on the common process of submitting a "Declaration" for approval:

**Process Stages:**

* **Declaration Submitted:**
    * The process begins with an employee submitting a "Declaration." This could be:
        * **Expense Declaration:** A request for reimbursement for work-related expenses. This variant seems common given the presence of "Approval" steps and its mention in the context of the other independent phrases.
        * **Document Submission:** My hunch is that "BUDGET OWNER" is part of a workflow for submissions, but it could be a different type of declaration for something like a promotion.

**Understanding the variants:**

* **Simple "Declaration":** This likely represents variations  within a single financial reimbursement process.

Here's a possible **scenario interpretation:**

1. **Process variations:**

The data suggests there are **variations within the employee's role in the process**.

2. **Initiating a Reimbursement Request:**

   *   Many steps start with "Declaration" **indicating a potential chain of events**:
        * **Employee Submitted (Standard/Regular Approval):** This is the normal flow of a reimbursement request.
        * **SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE:** Represents the initial paperwork submission for a reimbursement request.


   **Effortless and Common:**

   * **Multiple Stages of Approval:** The various "Approved" titles in the start of some entries suggest the process involves multiple stages of financial review. An "optional" or "senior level" watcher, like a "pre-approver" might only be available for certain types or levels of requests.

   * **Possible Rejection:** **Just like many templates, there's a "rejections" flow**: showing that a "rejected by (someone)" role can exist within these processes.

   * **Potential for Variation:** The presence of "Rejected by" and "employee" related nouns and verbs demonstrates that the process could include different

**Basic Process Details:**

The process starts with the Submission of a "Declaration Ro "PACKAGE SUBMITTED.  We can assume the employee had to submit a particular effort.

* The data focuses on **various roles in the process**: 

"Growing"  "Rejected by"

**Process Example:**
