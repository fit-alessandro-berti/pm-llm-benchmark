The picture is a process-flow diagram that shows how five different kinds of business objects travel through the same end-to-end “order-to-cash / procure-to-pay” process.  

1. Object types (colour-coded)  
   • Purple – Purchase-requisition items (2.0 M)  
   • Green  – Vendor-invoice items (1.2 M)  
   • Red    – Return-order items (0.8 M)  
   • Orange – Sales-order items (3.5 M)  
   • Blue   – Purchase-order items (5.0 M)

2. Structure  
   • Each object type has its own “Start” ellipse at the top.  
   • Coloured arrows lead downward through the activities; the colour tells you which object type is executing that step.  
   • Where several colours meet, the activity is shared by more than one object type.  
   • A small number beside every arrow (e.g., 300 ms, 650 ms) is the average time gap between the two steps.  
   • Rectangles are activities; each label shows the overall number of executions across all objects (e.g., “Approve Requisition – Overall: 5.7 M”).  
   • Ellipses at the bottom represent the “End” event for each path.

3. Main flows
    Procurement path (purple/blue/green)  
      Start  Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  
             Send Order / Check Stock  
             Approve Payment  Create Invoice  End  

    Sales/fulfilment path (orange)  
      Start  Create Order  Pack Goods  Ship Goods  
             Confirm Delivery  Close Order  End  

    Return handling path (red/green)  
      Start  Approve Requisition  Process Return  
             Approve Payment / Create Invoice  End  

4. Interpretation  
   • “Approve Requisition” is the central hub: it is executed 5.7 million times and is reached by almost every object type.  
   • The longest average waiting times (600–800 ms) sit between “Approve Requisition” and the downstream activities (“Process Return”, “Check Stock”, “Send Order”), highlighting possible bottlenecks.  
   • Sales objects continue deeper into logistics activities (“Pack”, “Ship”, “Confirm Delivery”) before closing, whereas procurement-related objects finish after invoicing or payment approval.  

In short, the visualisation overlays five intertwined but distinct lifecycles on one shared map, making it easy to see how each object type enters, converges, branches and exits the overall business process and where the slow hand-offs occur.
