This analysis identifies deviations from the normative order handling process by examining the sequence of activities in each case against the specified rules.

## Normative Process Summary and Key Rules

The normative process dictates two main paths stemming from "Check inventory":

**Path A: Inventory Sufficient (Fulfillment Path)**
1. Receive order $\rightarrow$ 2. Check inventory $\rightarrow$ 3. Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ 4. Package items $\rightarrow$ 5. Ship order $\rightarrow$ 6. Close order

**Path B: Inventory Insufficient (Cancellation Path)**
1. Receive order $\rightarrow$ 2. Check inventory $\rightarrow$ 3. Cancel order $\rightarrow$ 4. Close order

**Critical Sequential Constraints:**
* **Start:** Must begin with "Receive order."
* **Check Inventory Precedence:** "Check inventory" must occur before "Authorize payment" or "Cancel order."
* **Authorization Precedence:** "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items."
* **Packaging Precedence:** "Package items" must occur before "Ship order."
* **Cancellation Constraint:** If "Cancel order" occurs, subsequent fulfillment activities ("Package items," "Ship order") are forbidden.
* **End:** Must end with "Close order."

## Analysis of Event Log Cases

We will analyze the sequence for each Case ID.

### Case 1 Analysis
**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Package items $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
**Assessment:** This perfectly matches the expected **Fulfillment Path (Path A)** when inventory is sufficient.
**Deviation:** **None.**

### Case 2 Analysis
**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Package items $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
**Assessment:** The sequence violates the strict ordering defined for the fulfillment path.
* **Violation 1:** "Package items" (Activity 3) occurs *before* "Authorize payment" (Activity 4).
* **Normative Rule Violated:** The description explicitly states: "...after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment... Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment... this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.'" This implies $P(\text{Package items}) > P(\text{Authorize payment})$.
**Deviation:** **Yes.**

### Case 3 Analysis
**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Cancel order $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
**Assessment:** This case initiates the cancellation path but then attempts to resume fulfillment.
* **Violation 1:** "Cancel order" occurs (Activity 4), followed by "Ship order" (Activity 5).
* **Normative Rule Violated:** The description states: "If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... the process must branch into a cancellation scenario... Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)..." Shipping after cancellation is a direct violation.
**Deviation:** **Yes.**

### Case 4 Analysis
**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Cancel order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
**Assessment:** This perfectly matches the expected **Cancellation Path (Path B)** when inventory is insufficient.
**Deviation:** **None.**

### Case 5 Analysis
**Sequence:** Receive order $\rightarrow$ Check inventory $\rightarrow$ Authorize payment $\rightarrow$ Ship order $\rightarrow$ Close order.
**Assessment:** This sequence skips "Package items."
* **Violation 1 (Structural):** The step "Package items" is missing between authorization and shipping.
* **Normative Rule Violated:** The description states: "Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as 'Package items.' **Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order.'**" Skipping packaging before shipping violates the required direct sequence $P \rightarrow \text{Package} \rightarrow S$.
**Deviation:** **Yes.**

## Summary of Deviating Cases and Violations

The following cases deviate from the normative process: **Case 2, Case 3, and Case 5.**

| Case ID | Deviations Identified | Specific Normative Rule Violated |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **2** | Sequencing Error: Package items occurred before Authorize payment. | **Constraint Violation:** "Authorize payment" must occur before "Package items." |
| **3** | Logical Flow Error: Fulfillment occurred after cancellation. | **Constraint Violation:** "Ship order" cannot occur after "Cancel order." |
| **5** | Structural Error: The required step "Package items" was skipped between authorization and shipping. | **Constraint Violation:** "Ship order" must follow "Package items," which must follow "Authorize payment." |
