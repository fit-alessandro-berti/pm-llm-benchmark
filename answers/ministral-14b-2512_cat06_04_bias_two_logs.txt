### **Comparison of Event Logs: Bias Identification and Analysis**

The two event logs reveal a clear **systematic bias** in favor of **Group B (Unprotected Group)**, particularly those applicants who are **local residents** and/or members of the **Highland Civic Darts Club**. This bias manifests through **score adjustments** and **decision-making disparities**, despite similar preliminary scores in some cases.

---

### **Key Observations of Bias**

#### **1. Score Adjustments (Community Boost for Group B)**
- **Group A (Protected Group):**
  - No applicants receive any **score adjustments** (`ScoreAdjustment` remains **0** for all cases).
  - Decisions are purely based on **preliminary scores** (e.g., P002 with a score of **710** is rejected, while P001 with **720** is approved).

- **Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - Applicants who are **local residents** and part of the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** (e.g., U001 and U003).
  - This adjustment **artificially inflates their scores**, leading to approvals that would not have occurred otherwise (e.g., U003 with a **695  705** adjustment is approved, whereas a non-local with **710** is rejected).

#### **2. Decision Disparities Despite Similar Scores**
- **Group A:**
  - **P002 (710)  Rejected**
  - **P003 (740)  Approved**
  - Decisions align strictly with the **preliminary score threshold** (likely **720+** for approval).

- **Group B:**
  - **U002 (710, no boost)  Rejected** (consistent with Group A)
  - **U001 (720  730 with boost)  Approved** (would have been borderline without adjustment)
  - **U003 (695  705 with boost)  Approved** (would have been rejected without adjustment)

This suggests that **local residents in the community group receive preferential treatment**, while non-local or non-group members are held to stricter standards.

#### **3. Influence of LocalResident and CommunityGroup Attributes**
- **Local residents (Group B) with community ties (Highland Civic Darts Club) benefit from:**
  - **+10 score boost** (automatically applied in `PreliminaryScoring`).
  - **Higher approval rates** even with lower base scores.
- **Non-local or non-group members (Group A and U002) have no such advantages.**

This creates a **two-tiered system**:
- **Tier 1 (Protected/Unprotected Non-Local):** Strict scoring, no adjustments.
- **Tier 2 (Local + Community Group):** Score inflation, higher approval likelihood.

### **How This Bias Manifests Systematically**
1. **Automated Bias in Scoring:**
   - The **Scoring Engine** applies a **+10 boost** to local community members **without explicit human intervention**, embedding bias into the algorithm.
   - This is a form of **algorithmic discrimination**, where protected attributes (`LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`) directly influence outcomes.

2. **Disproportionate Approval Rates:**
   - In **Group A**, **2 out of 3** applicants are approved (P001, P003), but only those with **scores 720**.
   - In **Group B**, **2 out of 3** are approved, but **one (U003) would have been rejected without the boost**.
   - This means **Group B gets more approvals for the same or worse base scores** due to the adjustment.

3. **Potential for Exclusion of Non-Local Applicants:**
   - Non-local applicants (even with strong scores) face **higher rejection rates** because they lack the **community-based score boost**.
   - This could disproportionately affect **migrants, non-members, or outsiders**, reinforcing social exclusion.

4. **Lack of Transparency in Adjustments:**
   - The **ScoreAdjustment** column is **only populated for Group B**, suggesting that the bias is **intentionally applied** rather than an accidental error.
   - There is no equivalent adjustment mechanism for **Group A**, reinforcing the disparity.

### **Conclusion: Evidence of Bias**
The **Group B log exhibits clear bias** due to:
 **Automated score adjustments** (+10 for local community members).
 **Higher approval rates for lower base scores** when boosted.
 **Stricter standards for non-local/non-group applicants** (e.g., U002 rejected at 710 vs. U001 approved at 720  730).
 **Systematic favoritism** toward a specific subgroup (local + community members).

This is a **classic case of algorithmic bias**, where **protected attributes (`LocalResident`, `CommunityGroup`)** directly influence outcomes in a way that disadvantages certain groups. If this were a real-world system (e.g., loan approvals, housing allocations, or public services), it could lead to **unfair exclusion** of non-local or non-affiliated individuals.

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**
1. **Remove Automated Score Adjustments Based on Protected Attributes**
   - Eliminate the **+10 community boost** to ensure fairness.
2. **Audit Decision-Making for Consistency**
   - Ensure that **non-local applicants are not systematically disadvantaged**.
3. **Implement Blind Review Processes**
   - Remove `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` from scoring algorithms to prevent bias.
4. **Monitor Approval Rates Across Groups**
   - Track whether **disparate impact** exists (e.g., higher rejection rates for non-locals).
5. **Provide Justifications for Manual Overrides**
   - If manual reviews adjust scores, ensure they are **documented and fair**.
