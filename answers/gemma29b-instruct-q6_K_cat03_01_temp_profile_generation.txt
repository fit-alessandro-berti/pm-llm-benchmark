Here's a hypothetical temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process. 

**Temporal Profile (P2P Process):**

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Request_Purchase', 'Approve_Purchase'): (3600, 1800),  # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 30 minutes
    ('Approve_Purchase', 'Create_PO'): (3600, 600),       # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 10 minutes
    ('Create_PO', 'Send_PO'): (3600, 1200),      # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 20 minutes
    ('Send_PO', 'Receive_Goods'): (72000, 14400),  # Average: 20 hours, StDev: 4 hours
    ('Receive_Goods', 'Invoice_Received'): (3600, 1800), # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 30 minutes
    ('Invoice_Received', 'Verify_Invoice'): (3600, 1200), # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 20 minutes
    ('Verify_Invoice', 'Approve_Payment'): (3600, 600),  # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 10 minutes
    ('Approve_Payment', 'Make_Payment'): (3600, 1200)   # Average: 1 hour, StDev: 20 minutes
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Activity Pairs:** Each key in the dictionary represents a pair of activities in the P2P process.
* **Average & Standard Deviation:** The value associated with each key is a tuple containing the average (in seconds) and standard deviation (in seconds) of the time between those activities.

**Assumptions & Considerations:**

* This is a simplified example. Real-world P2P processes can be much more complex with additional steps and variations.
* The time values are estimates and can vary significantly based on factors like company size, industry, automation levels, and external factors.
* This profile assumes that the time between activities is relatively consistent. In reality, there can be outliers and significant fluctuations.
