Here’s a concise diagnostics of the event log, what’s slow, why, and how to fix it.

1) Which cases are slow
- Fast (sameday, ~1.5 hours): 2001 (1h30m), 2004 (1h25m)
- Slow (spill over to next day or more): 
  - 2002: 25h55m (Medium)
  - 2003: 48h20m (High)
  - 2005: 77h05m (High)

2) What correlates with long lead times
Main driver: repeated “Request Additional Documents” loops
- Number of doc requests per case vs total duration:
  - 0 requests  ~1.4–1.5h (2001, 2004)
  - 1 request  ~25.9h (2002)
  - 2 requests  ~48.3h (2003)
  - 3 requests  ~77.1h (2005)
- Effect size: each additional documents request adds roughly one extra day of waiting on average. The Evaluate Claim  Approve Claim segment balloons from ~25–30 minutes (no requests) to 24–72 hours (with requests).

Complexity
- Low: 1.4–1.5h, no rework.
- Medium: 25.9h, 1 request.
- High: 48.3–77.1h, 2–3 requests.
- Conclusion: higher complexity strongly increases the likelihood and count of additional-doc requests, which drives most of the delay.

Region and resource interactions (secondary contributors)
- Adjusters:
  - Adjuster_Mike (Region A): 0 requests on Low (fast), 2 requests on High (48.3h).
  - Adjuster_Lisa (Region B): 0 requests on Low (fast), 1 request on Medium (25.9h), 3 requests on High (77.1h).
  - Pattern: on high/medium complexity, Lisa tends to trigger more document rounds than Mike (3 vs 2 on High), suggesting either stricter local policy, piecemeal requesting, or case mix.
- Manager approvals and time-of-day:
  - Manager_Ann: approvals earlier in the day; Pay typically within 15–45 minutes.
  - Manager_Bill: handles High complexity; one approval at 16:00 led to nextmorning payment (17h lag in 2003). Late approvals miss sameday payment windows.
- Finance:
  - Finance_Alan (Region A): 15m when approval at 10:00; nextday when approval at 16:00 (timeofday effect).
  - Finance_Carl (Region B): 30–45m for Low/Medium; 4h on High (all approvals at 10:00). Indicates capacity/priority differences or extra checks for High complexity in Region B.
- Region effect:
  - Low complexity is fast in both regions.
  - High complexity is slower in Region B (77.1h) vs Region A (48.3h). Sample is small, but suggests Region B’s handling of highcomplexity claims (Lisa/Carl/Bill) accumulates more rework and queueing.

3) Why these attributes contribute to the delays and how to mitigate
Root causes
- Rework loops: additional documents are requested in multiple rounds, causing customer wait time between each loop.
- High complexity: more missing/unclear information at intake leads to more loops.
- Region B practices/resources:
  - Adjuster behavior (piecemeal requests) increases loop count.
  - Finance queueing/prioritization leads to longer pay times even after 10:00 approvals on complex cases.
- Approval timing:
  - Lateday approvals miss payment cutoffs, introducing overnight waits.

Mitigations
- Prevent rework loops
  - Introduce a “oneanddone” documentation checklist for each complexity tier; require adjusters to bundle all foreseeable requests in the first outreach.
  - Add an intake completeness check for Medium/High complexity (guided claim form, dynamic checklist).
  - After the first request, switch to a proactive call or joint review session to resolve all remaining gaps in one interaction.
  - SLA and reminders: autoreminders at 4/8 business hours; escalate to phone outreach if no response within 24 hours.
- Specialize and route by complexity
  - Route High complexity to a specialized team trained to minimize rework and to a senior adjuster pool with better “firsttimeright” rates.
  - Calibrate Region B with Region A practices; peer reviews of request bundles; playbooks for common highcomplexity scenarios.
- Approval and payment cadence
  - Set midday approval checkpoints (e.g., 11:00 and 14:00) so approved cases hit the sameday payment window.
  - Provide backup approvers for High complexity to avoid endofday congestion.
  - Finance SLAs by complexity: target <1h Pay after morning approvals; introduce priority queues for approved High complexity to avoid 4h waits.
  - If there are batch payment runs, add an additional midafternoon run.
- Monitoring and feedback loops
  - Track EvaluateApprove time and number of Request Additional Documents per case by adjuster and region; aim for 1 request per High complexity case and 0 for Low/Medium.
  - Track ApprovePay by timeofday and finance resource; enforce SLA alerts if >1h during business hours.
  - Publish weekly dashboards: rework rate, average requests per case, and cycle time by complexity/region/resource.

Expected impact
- Eliminating two extra document loops on High complexity would typically save ~2 days per case (observable difference between 3 vs 1 request).
- Aligning approvals to prenoon windows should avoid overnight pay delays, saving ~0.5–1 day when approvals previously landed late.

Summary
- Cases with performance issues: 2002, 2003, 2005.
- Primary root cause: repeated “Request Additional Documents” driven by higher complexity; each extra request adds ~1 day.
- Secondary contributors: Region B handling of highcomplexity (more rework); late approvals (missed payment window); finance queueing on complex cases.
- Focus on frontloading documentation, complexitybased routing, aligned approval/payment cadences, and targeted SLAs/monitoring to bring long cases back toward sameday postcompletion timelines.
