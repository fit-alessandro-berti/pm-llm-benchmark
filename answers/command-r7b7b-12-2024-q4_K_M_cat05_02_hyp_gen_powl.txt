### Anomalies Identified

1. **Loop Between Evaluation and Approval (E-P Loop)**: This loop allows the claim to go through repeated evaluations and approvals without a clear exit condition, potentially leading to infinite loops or stuck claims if not properly managed.

2. **XOR Structure with Omitted Notification (N Skip Option)**: The XOR structure can result in customer notifications being skipped, which might be due to specific conditions or exceptions in the process flow that are not clearly defined.

3. **Premature Claim Closure (C Before E/P)**: The lack of strict ordering allows closing a claim before evaluation and approval have been completed, indicating potential issues with the timing and sequence of events.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Incomplete Business Rule Implementation**: The E-P loop might be an attempt to implement a rule that requires claims to go through multiple evaluations before final approval but was not fully realized or properly constrained in the POWL model.
   
2. **Departmental Miscommunication**: The XOR with the option to skip notification could be a result of miscommunication between the customer service and claims processing departments, leading to an incomplete process design.

3. **Technical Workflow Error**: Technical issues in the workflow system might have inadvertently allowed for non-standard execution paths, such as premature claim closure or skipped notifications.

### Verification Queries Using Database Tables

#### 1. Identify Premature Claim Closure (C Before E/P)

```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.customer_id,
  c.claim_amount,
  a.name AS adjuster_name,
  ca.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ca ON c.claim_id = ca.claim_id AND ca.activity IN ('Evaluate', 'Approve')
JOIN adjusters a ON ca.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE ca.activity = 'Close'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM claim_events ce
    WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
      AND ce.activity IN ('Evaluate', 'Approve')
      AND ce.timestamp > ca.timestamp
  )
ORDER BY ca.timestamp;
```

This query identifies claims where a closure event occurs before the evaluation or approval events, indicating premature claim closing.

#### 2. Locate Repeated Approvals (Multiple Approve Events)

```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.customer_id,
  c.claim_amount,
  a.name AS adjuster_name,
  ca.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ca ON c.claim_id = ca.claim_id AND ca.activity = 'Approve'
JOIN adjusters a ON ca.resource = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id, c.claim_amount, a.name, ca.timestamp
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ca.timestamp) > 1;
```

By grouping and counting distinct approval events per claim, this query helps identify claims with multiple approvals, possibly indicating an issue in the process flow or data inconsistencies.

#### 3. Check Frequency of Customer Notification Skips (N Skipped)

```sql
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  COUNT(*) AS notification_skips
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'Notify'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ne ON c.claim_id = ne.claim_id AND ne.activity = 'SkipNotification'
WHERE ne.event_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.claim_id;
```

Here, the query joins claims with both notification and skip events to determine how often customer notifications are skipped in practice by comparing the count of actual notifications against the count of skips.
