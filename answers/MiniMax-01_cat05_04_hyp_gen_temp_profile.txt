### 1. **Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model**

- **Anomaly 1: Short Average Time Between "Receive" and "Approve" (R to P)**
  - **Observation:** The average time between receiving a claim and approving it is around 25 hours, with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour.
  - **Implication:** This low standard deviation suggests a rigid, potentially automated approval process that may not adequately account for the variability in claim complexity.

- **Anomaly 2: Long Average Time Between "Approve" and "Notify" (P to N)**
  - **Observation:** The average time between approving a claim and notifying the customer is 7 days, with a high standard deviation of 2 days.
  - **Implication:** This lengthy delay indicates potential bottlenecks or resource constraints in the notification process, leading to inconsistent customer communication.

- **Anomaly 3: Short Average Time Between "Assign" and "Close" (A to C)**
  - **Observation:** The average time between assigning a claim to an adjuster and closing the claim is 2 hours, without consistent evidence of evaluation or approval activities in between.
  - **Implication:** This rapid closure may suggest premature claim resolution, potentially bypassing necessary evaluation or approval steps.

- **Anomaly 4: Short Average Time Between "Evaluate" and "Notify" (E to N)**
  - **Observation:** The average time between evaluating a claim and notifying the customer is only 5 minutes.
  - **Implication:** This quick transition may indicate that the evaluation process is being rushed or skipped, or that notifications are being sent automatically without proper review.

### 2. **Hypotheses on the Causes of These Anomalies**

- **Hypothesis 1: Automated Approval System**
  - **Explanation:** The low standard deviation and short average time between "Receive" and "Approve" suggest the presence of an automated system that approves claims based on predefined criteria. This could lead to approvals without thorough human review, potentially missing nuanced claim details.

- **Hypothesis 2: Notification Backlog or Resource Constraints**
  - **Explanation:** The long average time and high standard deviation between "Approve" and "Notify" indicate a backlog or limited resources dedicated to customer communication. This could be due to a lack of staff, inefficient processes, or technical issues with the notification system.

- **Hypothesis 3: Premature Claim Closure**
  - **Explanation:** The short average time between "Assign" and "Close" suggests that some claims are being closed immediately after assignment, possibly due to an overreliance on automated assessments or a lack of thorough evaluation by adjusters.

- **Hypothesis 4: Inadequate Evaluation Process**
  - **Explanation:** The extremely short time between "Evaluate" and "Notify" implies that evaluations may be superficial or automated, with notifications being sent out before a comprehensive review is conducted. This could lead to inaccurate claim assessments and dissatisfied customers.

### 3. **Proposed Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries**

- **Query 1: Identify Claims with Anomalously Short Approval Times**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      ce.claim_id, 
      ce.timestamp AS receive_time, 
      ce2.timestamp AS approve_time, 
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS approval_time_seconds
  FROM 
      claim_events ce
  JOIN 
      claim_events ce2 
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
      AND ce2.activity = 'P'
  WHERE 
      ce.activity = 'R' 
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < 1800; -- Less than 30 minutes
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This query identifies claims where the time between "Receive" and "Approve" is less than 30 minutes, highlighting potential instances of premature or automated approvals.

- **Query 2: Analyze Notification Delays**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      ce.claim_id, 
      ce.timestamp AS approve_time, 
      ce2.timestamp AS notify_time, 
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS notify_delay_seconds
  FROM 
      claim_events ce
  JOIN 
      claim_events ce2 
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
      AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  WHERE 
      ce.activity = 'P' 
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) > 604800; -- More than 7 days
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This query identifies claims where the time between "Approve" and "Notify" exceeds 7 days, indicating potential delays in customer communication.

- **Query 3: Investigate Premature Claim Closures**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      ce.claim_id, 
      ce.timestamp AS assign_time, 
      ce2.timestamp AS close_time, 
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS closure_time_seconds
  FROM 
      claim_events ce
  JOIN 
      claim_events ce2 
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
      AND ce2.activity = 'C'
  WHERE 
      ce.activity = 'A' 
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < 7200; -- Less than 2 hours
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This query identifies claims that were closed within 2 hours of being assigned, suggesting possible premature closure without adequate evaluation or approval.

- **Query 4: Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters or Claim Types**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      a.name, 
      c.claim_type, 
      COUNT(*) AS anomaly_count
  FROM 
      claim_events ce
  JOIN 
      claims c 
      ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
  JOIN 
      adjusters a 
      ON c.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
  WHERE 
      ce.activity = 'C' 
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) < 7200
      AND ce2.activity = 'A'
  GROUP BY 
      a.name, 
      c.claim_type
  ORDER BY 
      anomaly_count DESC;
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This query correlates premature claim closures with specific adjusters or claim types, helping identify whether certain adjusters or claim categories are more prone to anomalies.

- **Query 5: Identify Claims with Rapid Evaluation to Notification Transitions**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
      ce.claim_id, 
      ce.timestamp AS evaluate_time, 
      ce2.timestamp AS notify_time, 
      EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS evaluation_to_notify_time_seconds
  FROM 
      claim_events ce
  JOIN 
      claim_events ce2 
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id 
      AND ce2.activity = 'N'
  WHERE 
      ce.activity = 'E' 
      AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) < 300; -- Less than 5 minutes
  ```
  - **Purpose:** This query identifies claims where the transition from "Evaluate" to "Notify" is less than 5 minutes, suggesting a rushed or automated notification process.
