Summary of long cases (from Submit Claim  Close Claim)
- Case 2005 (Region B, High complexity) — ~77.1 hours (Apr 1 09:25  Apr 4 14:30). Longest.
- Case 2003 (Region A, High complexity) — ~48.3 hours (Apr 1 09:10  Apr 3 09:30).
- Case 2002 (Region B, Medium complexity) — ~25.9 hours (Apr 1 09:05  Apr 2 11:00).
- Short cases for contrast: 2001 (Low, Region A) ~1.5 hours; 2004 (Low, Region B) ~1.4 hours.

What correlates with the extended lead times (evidence-based)
1. Complexity:
   - The two High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) are the slowest (48h and 77h). Both have multiple "Request Additional Documents" events.
   - The Medium case (2002) is slower than Low ones and has at least one additional-docs request.
   => High complexity strongly correlates with longer durations, largely via repeated document requests and multi-day cycles.

2. Resource behavior (Adjusters and Managers):
   - Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) appears on 2002 (Medium, 1 request + 1-day delay) and 2005 (High, 3 repeated requests across 3 days) — long durations when she handles medium/high complexity.
   - Adjuster_Mike (Region A) handled 2003 (High) and issued two repeated document requests on the same day; that case still stretched into subsequent days.
   - Manager_Bill approved the high-complexity cases later (2003 and 2005) after multiple document cycles; Manager_Ann handled approvals for faster low/medium cases.
   => Some adjusters (and the approval path) are associated with multiple request cycles and longer waits. This suggests either how they initiate/document requests or manager availability/assignment policies contributes to delay.

3. Region:
   - Region B contains the longest case (2005) and the medium slow case (2002), but also a fast low case (2004). So region alone is not sufficient as a root cause, but Region B has at least one very long high-complexity case. Likely an interaction: Region B + high complexity + specific adjuster(s) = worse performance.

Likely root causes (hypotheses)
1. Iterative document collection for high-complexity claims:
   - Multiple separate "Request Additional Documents" events indicate repeated rounds of missing or incomplete information; every round introduces wait time for the customer and follow-up.
2. Inconsistent request practices / insufficient initial intake:
   - Adjusters may not request a complete set of documents up front (or lack a checklist), causing multiple iterations.
3. Resource-specific handling patterns or workload:
   - Certain adjusters (e.g., Lisa, Mike) are associated with more iterations. This could be due to experience level, workload, or local practice.
4. Approval bottleneck for complex cases:
   - High-complexity approvals land with Manager_Bill and occur late — possibly due to limited availability, batching, or required escalation.
5. Customer response delay amplified by process design:
   - The process appears sequential (request  wait  approve) and so customer response delays have large impact.

Suggested mitigations (practical, prioritized)
1. Reduce document-iteration cycles (highest impact)
   - Implement standardized checklists/templates for each complexity tier to request all likely required documents in the first request.
   - Provide adjusters with a “document pack” for complex cases to send to customers immediately after evaluation.
2. Improve adjuster practices and training
   - Train adjusters to triage complexity and to request complete document sets; share examples of well-handled high complexity cases.
   - Review workload and reassign cases if an adjuster has many long-running high-complexity claims.
3. Reduce approval bottlenecks
   - Allow delegation or escalation rules so approvals for complex cases are not delayed by one manager’s availability (e.g., second-level approver, timed reminders).
   - Introduce SLAs for manager approvals for escalations.
4. Automate follow-ups and customer reminders
   - Automated reminders and status messages can reduce days lost waiting for customer responses.
   - Provide clear instructions and document checklists in outgoing requests to reduce incomplete responses.
5. Monitor & measure
   - Track key metrics: lead time by Complexity, number of "Request Additional Documents" per case, lead time by Adjuster, and approval wait time.
   - Run a pilot where high-complexity cases use the consolidated checklist + expedited approvals, and compare lead time.
6. Process/IT improvements
   - Enable pre-validation of submitted documents (auto-check for required fields/types).
   - Allow parallel tasks where safe (e.g., start parts of evaluation that do not depend on missing docs).

Concrete next steps to test hypotheses
- Compute averages: lead time by Complexity, by Adjuster, and by Region (to quantify patterns).
- Count number of "Request Additional Documents" per case and correlate with lead time (expect strong positive correlation).
- Run a small experiment: for next N high-complexity cases, require a single consolidated initial request + manager backup approver; measure change in cycle time.

Bottom line
- High complexity is the main driver of long cases here, primarily through multiple document-request cycles. Adjuster-specific handling (Adjuster_Lisa, Adjuster_Mike) and approval assignment (Manager_Bill for complex cases) amplify those delays. Simple, high-impact fixes are: consolidate document requests up-front, standardize checklists, improve adjuster training/assignment, and remove single-person approval bottlenecks. Implementing these should substantially reduce the multi-day lead times observed in 2003 and 2005.
