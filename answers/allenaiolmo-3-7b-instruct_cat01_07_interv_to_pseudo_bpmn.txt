## Process Model: Invoice Approval and Payment (Textual BPMN-like Representation)

### 1. High Level Overview

The process handles the end-to-end approval and payment of supplier invoices, involving multiple departments and roles. It begins with invoice receipt and ends with payment scheduling. The process includes validation, confirmation, approval, exception handling, and resolution.

---

### 2. Main Activities (Nodes)

#### A. Invoice Receipt
- **Participant:** Accounts Payable (Mary)
- **Description:** Invoice arrives (typically by email) in the Accounts Payable inbox.

#### B. Initial Validation (PO Check)
- **Participant:** Accounts Payable (Mary)
- **Activity:** Check if invoice has a valid PO number. If not, request PO from supplier.
    - *Variation:* If missing, send email requesting PO details.

#### C. Logging and Forwarding (if PO present)
- **Participant:** Accounts Payable (Mary)
- **Activity:** Log invoice into accounting system and forward to Purchasing Department for goods receipt confirmation.

#### D. Purchasing Confirmation
- **Participant:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)
- **Activity:** Confirm invoice matches PO (quantities, prices, delivery info). 
    - If discrepancy: contact supplier/AP to resolve.
    - If PO missing: inform Mary to request PO.

#### E. System Notification for Manager Approval
- **Trigger:** After Purchasing confirmation (automated email to Department Manager).
- **Participant:** Department Manager (Carlos)
- **Activity:** Review invoice via system for approval or rejection (check for suspicious items or discrepancies).

#### F. Manager Approval or Rejection
- **Decision Point:** "Manager Approves / Rejects Invoice"
    - If Approve  continue to payment scheduling.
    - If Reject  return to earlier stage for clarification or correction (e.g., resolve discrepancies with AP/Purchasing).

#### G. Payment Scheduling
- **Participant:** Accounts Payable (Mary/Rita)
- **Activity:** Schedule invoice for payment after approval. In case of unresolved exceptions, escalate to Supervisor (Rita) for further resolution.

### 3. Sequence Flow

1. **Invoice Arrival**  (Accounts Payable)  **PO Check & Forward if valid**  (Purchasing)  **Purchasing Confirmation**  (Automated)  **Manager Notification**  (Manager)  **Approval or Rejection**
    - *If Rejected*: Return to Purchasing/Accounts Payable for clarification (loop back to Purchasing Confirmation or PO validation).
    - *If Approved*: Continue to **Payment Scheduling**
2. **Exception Handling / Escalation** (if any discrepancy or missing info):
    - (Accounts Payable/Purchasing)  (Supervisor/Manager)  Re-validate and re-route for approval.

---

### 4. Decision Points / Gateways

#### A. PO Present?
- Yes  Proceed to Purchasing Confirmation  
- No  Request PO from supplier (dead-end or loop to re-try after PO received)

#### B. Does Invoice Match PO?
- Yes  Proceed to Manager Approval
- No  Contact supplier/AP to resolve (could lead to loop if unresolved)

#### C. Manager Review
- Approves  Payment Scheduling
- Rejects  Return to Purchasing or AP for resolution (could trigger re-validation)

#### D. Exception Detected (e.g., pricing discrepancy)
- Trigger Escalation to Supervisor/Manager for resolution

---

### 5. Roles and Participants

- **Accounts Payable (Mary, Rita)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier (Karen, via email/communication)**
- **Automated Systems** (for notifications and logging)

---

### 6. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs

**Inputs:**
- Incoming Invoice (email/document)
- Purchase Order (PO number/document)
- Supplier contract information (for pricing)

**Outputs:**
- Approved/Rejected invoice status in accounting system
- Payment scheduling request to the bank/payment system
- Communication emails (to suppliers/AP/Managers)
- Corrected or resubmitted invoices (in case of exceptions)

---

### 7. Variations / Exceptions

- **Missing PO:** Invoice is put on hold until PO received.
- **Discrepancies in quantities/pricing:** Repeated back-and-forth between AP, Purchasing, and supplier until resolved.
- **Unusual or suspicious invoices:** Sent for manager review; may be rejected or escalated.
- **Informal contracts:** Sometimes require special handling (e.g., creating retrospective POs).
- **Escalation Loop:** If exceptions can't be resolved at one level, moved to supervisor for final decision.

### 8. Visual Structure (Textual Schematic)

```plaintext
[Start]
   |
[Invoice Arrives] (Accounts Payable)
   |
[PO Check] --Yes--> [Log & Forward to Purchasing]
   |                   |
   |                   No--> [Request PO from Supplier] (Loop or Wait)
   |
[Purchasing Confirmation] (Dan)
   |           | (Discrepancy)
   |           v
   [Match PO?] --Yes--> [Manager Notification]
   |                     |
   |                     v
   [Manager Approves] --Yes--> [Payment Scheduling] --> [End]
   |                     |
   |                     No--> [Rejection/Return] (Back to Purchasing/AP for clarification)
   |
[Exception Detected] (e.g., pricing error) --> [Escalate to Supervisor] --> [Revalidate & Re-approve or Close]
```

### 9. Notes on Ambiguities

- The exact handoffs between departments after manager rejection are somewhat ambiguous (could be re-validated by AP or Purchasing).
- The final payment scheduling step may involve different participants depending on internal policies (not fully specified).
- The process is iterative in case of unresolved discrepancies, but the main linear flow is as above.

**Summary:**  
This model reflects the consensus and variations described by the interviewees, highlighting the core workflow, decision points, and exception handling. It can serve as a foundation for a BPMN diagram or a process documentation template. If you have additional interview transcripts or more detailed process descriptions, further refinement is possible.
