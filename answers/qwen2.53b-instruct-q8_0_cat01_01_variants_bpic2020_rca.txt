To identify the root causes of performance issues based on the given data, we need to analyze the frequency and performance metrics across different paths through the process. Here's a breakdown considering both:

### 1. **Path Length Variance**
- The longest path (4618) has the highest performance score (810187.903). 
- Smaller paths like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled" have lower frequencies but higher performance scores.
  
**Root Cause:** Longer processes can take more time to complete, leading to perceived performance issues. The longest path might be slower due to additional approval steps or complex conditions.

### 2. **Approval Steps and Roles**
- Paths involving multiple approvals (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR") have higher frequencies but lower performance scores.
  
**Root Cause:** Multiple approvals can lead to bottlenecks and delays, impacting the overall process efficiency.

### 3. **Rejections and Re-submissions**
- Paths with rejections (e.g., "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR") have higher frequencies but lower performance scores.
  
**Root Cause:** Rejection cycles can lead to significant delays, impacting the overall process efficiency. These often involve multiple iterations before approval is granted.

### 4. **Specific Approval Roles**
- Paths with roles like "Budget Owner" and "Missing" in specific steps tend to have higher frequencies but lower performance scores.
  
**Root Cause:** Certain roles (like Budget Owner) or missing approvals might be causing delays and inefficiencies, affecting the overall process.

### 5. **Initial Submission Frequency**
- The frequency of paths that start with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" is significantly higher than others. While these have lower performance scores relative to some longer paths, their high volume contributes to overall performance.
  
**Root Cause:** Initial submission processes can be more complex and might involve a larger number of steps, leading to varying degrees of efficiency.

### Summary of Root Causes:
1. **Longer Approval Paths:** Longer sequences with multiple approvals are slower and less efficient.
2. **Rejections and Re-submissions:** Multiple rejections lead to extended cycles and delays in the process.
3. **Roles Involved:** Roles that need additional scrutiny or approval (like Budget Owner, Missing) can slow down processes.
4. **Initial Submission Complexity:** The initial submission path is more complex with multiple steps leading to higher volume of submissions but lower efficiency.

Addressing these root causes would likely involve streamlining the process for longer paths, improving communication and coordination during rejections/re-submissions, ensuring timely resolution by Budget Owner/Missing roles, and simplifying initial submission processes.
