Based on the provided data and assuming that "performance" refers to the time it takes to complete or is influenced by the frequency of a request being handled through the approval process:

### Root Causes for Performance Issues (Data-Specific Considerations):

1. **High Frequency with Low Performance**:
   - There are processes where high frequencies result in low performance. For example, "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" has a frequency of 8 but performs poorly (performance = 1377215.500). This might indicate that the approvals are either inefficient, taking too long, or there's an inherent inefficiency in the process at this stage.

2. **Multiple Rejections and Resubmissions**:
   - Processes like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" have a high frequency (8) but very poor performance (1377215.500). This suggests that frequent rejections and resubmissions are causing delays.
   
3. **Inefficient Final Approvals**:
   - Processes like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" have a high frequency (7) but poor performance (4922455.714). This could indicate that the final approval steps are inefficient or that there is an issue with coordinating approvals among different parties.
   
4. **Unresolved Rejections**:
   - Processes like "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" have a high frequency (6) but poor performance (1482400.000). This shows that unresolved rejections are causing delays and inefficiencies.

5. **Inconsistent Approver Behavior**:
   - Processes where the behavior of approvers is inconsistent, such as "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR" has a frequency of 6 but poor performance (2936133.833), may be causing delays due to varying levels of approval and rejection.
   
### Suggested Actions:
- **Review High-Frequency, Poor-Performance Processes**: Identify which processes are contributing significantly to inefficiencies based on their high frequencies and poor performances.
- **Streamline Approver Workflow**: Ensure that the workflow for approving declarations is streamlined. This might involve reducing manual steps, improving communication channels between approvers, and ensuring consistent approval behavior.
- **Automate Where Possible**: Automating some of the checks or approvals can reduce human error and improve processing speed.
- **Analyze Rejection Patterns**: Identify why certain rejections are recurring and if there are patterns that can be addressed to prevent these delays.

By focusing on processes with high frequencies and poor performance, analyzing rejection behaviors, and improving overall workflow efficiency, significant improvements in the process could be achieved.
