The XOR node there  
   xor_local_check = X ( D, skip )  
means that some fraction of your applicants get an extra “local affiliation” check (D) – with its attendant small score-uplift – and the rest simply skip straight to manual review.  On the face of it, “local affiliation” isn’t a protected class like race or gender, so you might think it’s harmless.  But in practice this creates a hidden, process-level bias:

1. Unequal Treatment with Real Consequences  
   • Anyone routed through D picks up a small but systematic advantage in underwriting (a “subtle score uplift”).  
   • Applicants who happen not to be flagged for D are literally on a different path—no extra localties credit.  
   • Two candidates with identical credit profiles could end up with different outcomes solely because one got sent down the D branch.  

2. Who Gets Picked for D?  
   • If routing into D is correlated (however weakly) with geography, real estate ownership, communitygroup membership, or even the channel through which they applied, you’ve just codified a preference for those subgroups.  
   • Even if “local affiliation” is non-protected on paper, it often correlates (directly or indirectly) with protected attributes or socioeconomic factors.  You can end up with a de-facto disparity in approval rates.  

3. Fairness & Equity Implications  
   • Process Discrimination: By design you’re giving “locals” better odds.  That’s a form of disparate treatment—just not on a legally protected axis.  
   • Disparate Impact Risk: If local membership correlates with, say, race or income band, your process could trigger a disparate impact claim even though the original criterion isn’t protected.  
   • Erosion of Trust: Applicants who find out that “just being in the right ZIP code” or “belonging to the right club” got someone else ahead of them will view the process as arbitrary or unfair.  

4. Mitigations  
   • Eliminate the XOR entirely: Either everybody gets the local-check or nobody does.  
   • Make the branching criterion explicit, objective and justifiable – for example “all applicants with credit scores in [600–650] get D” rather than an opaque ‘local’ flag.  
   • Monitor approval rates, false-reject rates, average terms granted on both sides of the branch.  If you see systematic lifts, close the gap or codify it for everyone.  
   • If the local-affiliation check uncovers real, risk-reducing information, bake that information directly into your scoring model as a feature rather than as an optional branch.  

Bottom line: even “small”, non-protected shortcuts in your workflow can produce outsized fairness problems downstream.  Whenever you see an XOR that privileges one cohort over another, you should ask “Why does this group get special treatment, and is that defensible (or at least transparent)?”  If not, you’re embedding hidden bias into your POWL model.
