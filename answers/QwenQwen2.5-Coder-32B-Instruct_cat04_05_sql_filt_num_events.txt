Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task as described:

```sql
WITH CaseEventCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
    HAVING 
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    CaseEventCounts cec
ON 
    el.case_id = cec.case_id;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `CaseEventCounts`:**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id` by grouping the rows in `event_log` by `case_id` and using `COUNT(*)`.
   - The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause ensures that only `case_id`s with six or fewer events are included.

2. **Main Query:**
   - The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table (`el.*`).
   - It joins the `event_log` table with the `CaseEventCounts` CTE on `case_id`.
   - Only the events from `case_id`s that have six or fewer events are returned.

This query ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result set.
