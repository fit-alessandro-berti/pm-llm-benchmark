## Anomalies:

- **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  A very low standard deviation suggests pressure to approve quickly, potentially bypassing thorough review.

- **P to N (Approve to Notify):** An extremely long average delay with a high standard deviation indicates inconsistent notification times. This could be due to limited resources to handle notifications or unrelated delays within the notification process.

- **A to C (Assign to Close):** A rapid closure after assignment without consistent "E" (Evaluate) and "P" (Approve) steps suggests possible premature closure, potentially indicating incomplete investigations.

- **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** A very short average time between evaluation and notification implies rapid, perhaps automated, notification. This could suggest bypassing necessary quality checks or human review. 

## Possible Reasons:

 - **Automation:** Systems may be rapidly processing certain steps, causing short intervals. 
 - **Manual Bottlenecks:**  Stages like "Evaluate" or "Notify" might be reliant on manual input, leading to delays.
 - **Resource Constraints:**  Inadequate staffing or resource allocation could contribute to inconsistent processing times.
 - **Business Rules:** Specific business rules or time-sensitive procedures may drive irregular timelines.


## Verification Queries:

1. **Identify claims with unusually long P to N delays:**

 ```sql
 SELECT claim_id, timestamp - LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS delay 
 FROM claim_events
 WHERE activity = 'P' AND
 LEAD(activity, 1, 'N') OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'N' 
 AND delay > (SELECT 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 FROM UNNEST([7]) AS days) * 0.8; -- 7 days * 80%
 ```
2. **Recognize claims quickly closed without evaluation or approval:**

 ```sql
 SELECT claim_id
 FROM claim_events
 WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
 AND NOT EXISTS (
   SELECT 1 
   FROM claim_events ce2
   WHERE ce2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id
     AND ce2.activity IN ('E', 'P')
     AND ce2.timestamp BETWEEN claim_events.timestamp AND LEAD(claim_events.timestamp, 1, NULL) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)
 );
 ```

3. **Analyze for adjuster-specific patterns:**

 ```sql
 SELECT adjuster_id, COUNT(*) AS total_claims, AVG(delay) AS avg_delay
 FROM (
   SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.adjuster_id, 
          timestamp - LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS delay 
   FROM claim_events ce
   WHERE ce.activity = 'P' AND LEAD(activity, 1, 'N') OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) = 'N' 
 ) AS delayed_claims
 GROUP BY adjuster_id
 ORDER BY avg_delay DESC; 
 ```
