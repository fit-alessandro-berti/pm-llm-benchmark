Got it  — we need to **contextually disambiguate recurring activities** so that each moment in the case's sequence gets a name meaningful to what’s really happening, rather than just a generic activity title.

---

## **Step 1 – Identify Recurring Activities and Context Changes**

Looking at the log:

- **Verify Documents** appears **multiple times** in different places:  
  - First occurrence: initial verification after request initiation.  
  - Second occurrence: re-verification after missing/updated documents are provided or after account adjustment.  

- **Call Customer** appears more than once **in some cases**:  
  - First occurrence: to obtain missing documents or clarify account details.  
  - Second occurrence: to confirm changes or get customer to return.

---

## **Step 2 – Context-informed Activity Renaming**

We’ll suffix or change verbs to reflect what’s actually happening:

- **Verify Documents**  
  - `Verify Documents – Initial ID Check` (first check directly after request initiation)  
  - `Verify Documents – Follow-up/Re-check` (after receiving more docs or making adjustments)

- **Call Customer**  
  - `Call Customer – Request Missing Docs` (when verification was incomplete)  
  - `Call Customer – Clarify Account Issue` (for discrepancies)  
  - `Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments` (post-adjustment confirmation)  
  - `Call Customer – Request Return to Branch` (in-person follow up)

Other activities like **Initiate Request**, **Approve Request**, **Adjust Account**, **Submit Additional** occur only once per case and have clear meanings, so they remain unchanged.

## **Step 3 – Revised Event Log with Context-driven Names**

## **Step 4 – Justification for Naming Changes**

1. **Verify Documents:**  
   - **Reasoning:** The log shows it can happen at the start or after some corrective/clarifying event. The name therefore needs to indicate whether it's the **first verification** or a **follow-up check**.
   - **Example:** In C001, first check was incomplete  later re-check after receiving missing docs; in C003, re-verification after internal account fix.

2. **Call Customer:**  
   - **Reasoning:** This has very different purposes: chasing documents, clarifying an issue, confirming changes, or asking them to return in person. Generic "Call Customer" hides these distinctions.
   - **Example:** In C002, first call was to clarify a discrepancy; second was to confirm adjustments.

3. **Initiate Request:**  
   - **Reasoning:** Sometimes via online portal, sometimes at a branch — different channels can carry different time, resource, and customer experience implications; labelled accordingly.

These renamings mean that **process mining or root-cause analysis tools** will no longer conflate similar but contextually different actions, allowing for more precise process analytics.

If you’d like, I can create a **process diagram** showing both the original and renamed flow, so the changes are visually evident. Would you like me to include that?
