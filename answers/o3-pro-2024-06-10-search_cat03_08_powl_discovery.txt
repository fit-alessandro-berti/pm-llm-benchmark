Below is a compact POWL model that captures every path that appears in the five cases of the event-log while staying faithful to the POWL semantics specified in `pm4py.objects.powl.obj`.

Python-like pseudo code is used only as a readable notation; no code has to be run.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import Transition, SilentTransition, OperatorPOWL, StrictPartialOrder
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Elementary transitions (activities)
OR   = Transition(label="OR")     # Order Received
MS   = Transition(label="MS")     # Material Sourcing
QS   = Transition(label="QS")     # Quality Screening
AS   = Transition(label="AS")     # Assembly
IQC  = Transition(label="IQC")    # In-line Quality Check
TST  = Transition(label="TST")    # Testing
RT   = Transition(label="RT")     # Re-Testing
PK   = Transition(label="PK")     # Packaging
LB   = Transition(label="LB")     # Labeling (optional)
DP   = Transition(label="DP")     # Distribution Planning
D    = Transition(label="D")      # Dispatch

skip = SilentTransition()         #   – skips optional labeling

# 2. Loop that (a) assembles once, then (b) can do IQC + assemble again, repeat …
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[AS, IQC]            # * ( AS , IQC )
)

# 3. Loop that (a) tests once, then (b) can re-test and test again, repeat …
loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[TST, RT]            # * ( TST , RT )
)

# 4. Exclusive-choice after packaging: either label or silently skip it
xor_LB_skip = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[LB, skip]           # X ( LB ,  )
)

# 5. Global partial order (a pure sequence here, but expressed as a StrictPartialOrder)
nodes = [
    OR, MS, QS,
    loop_AS_IQC,                 # first loop
    loop_TST_RT,                 # second loop
    PK, xor_LB_skip, DP, D
]

process_powl = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# sequence constraints
process_powl.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
process_powl.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
process_powl.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)
process_powl.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)
process_powl.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
process_powl.order.add_edge(PK, xor_LB_skip)
process_powl.order.add_edge(xor_LB_skip, DP)
process_powl.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

Interpretation of the model
1. After an order is received (OR) the material is sourced (MS) and screened for quality (QS).  
2. The first loop `* ( AS , IQC )` means:  
   • an Assembly (AS) is always done once;  
   • after that, the process may either exit the loop or execute an In-line Quality Check (IQC) and return to Assembly, repeating as often as required.  
   This reproduces every “AS  IQC  AS  …“ pattern in the log, including the single-pass case with no IQC at all (Case 4).  
3. The second loop `* ( TST , RT )` behaves analogously: at least one Test (TST) is done, then the product can be Re-Tested (RT) and tested again as many times as needed until it finally passes.  
4. Once packaging (PK) is finished there is an exclusive-choice node `X ( LB ,  )`; the model either performs Labeling (LB) or silently skips it (). This covers cases where LB is present (1, 3, 5) and where it is absent (2, 4).  
5. Distribution Planning (DP) and Dispatch (D) complete the flow.

Because no concurrency appeared in the event log, all nodes are connected by direct order edges, yielding a single, well-structured partial order that accommodates every observed—and every logically possible—variant of the process.
