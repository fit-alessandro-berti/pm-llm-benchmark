Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I processed and merged the logs, followed by the **final integrated event log**.

---

### **Step 1: Review and parse all events**

**Log A (System A):**

| Timestamp              | Event Type          | Order ID     |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z   | Order Received      | Order#1234   |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z   | Order Validated     | Order#1234   |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z   | Payment Processed   | Order#1234   |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z   | Item Shipped        | Order#1234   |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z   | Item Delivered      | Order#1234   |

**Log B (System B):**

| Timestamp              | Event Name         | Order ID     | User ID | Resource ID | Notes                           |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z   | OrderReceived      | Order#1234   | u45     | r10         | Event captured at warehouse system |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z   | OrderValidation    | Order#1234   | u12     | r10         | Cross-check inventory           |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z   | PaymentCheck       | Order#1234   | u12     | r99         | Payment gateway delay            |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z   | Quality Check      | Order#1234   | u45     | r11         | Random inspection                |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z   | Shipping           | Order#1234   | u45     | r10         | Package handed to courier        |

### **Step 2: Event Matching**

**Matching Criteria:**

- Same `order_id`
- Timestamp difference  2 seconds
- Event names/types correspond semantically, ignoring naming variations

---

### **Step 3: Map matching events**

| Log A Event                     | Log B Event                    | Time Difference | Name Similarity/Reasoning                                        | Action                                  |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 10:00:00, Order Received        | 09:59:58, OrderReceived       | 2s              | Aligned: same semantics, within 2s                              | Merge                                    |
| 10:01:30, Order Validated       | 10:01:29, OrderValidation     | 1s              | Aligned: same semantics, within 2s                              | Merge                                    |
| 10:02:00, Payment Processed     | 10:02:05, PaymentCheck        | 5s              | Close, but over 2s – contextually related? **Maybe**, but >2s   | Do **not** merge, include separately     |
| 10:05:00, Item Shipped          | 10:05:02, Shipping            | 2s              | Aligned, same semantics, within 2s                              | Merge                                    |
| 10:20:00, Item Delivered        | –                             | –               | No matching event in Log B                                      | Include as-is (from A)                   |
| –                               | 10:03:00, Quality Check       | –               | No corresponding Log A event                                    | Include as-is (from B)                   |

---

### **Step 4: Conflict Resolution & Timestamp**

- For merged events, **primary timestamp** from Log A, but include the Log B timestamp as secondary.
- For unmatched events, attribute their origin (System A or B).

---

### **Final Integrated Event Log**

| Timestamp (Primary)          | Alt Timestamp (if merged)     | Unified Event Name       | Order ID     | Event Origin       | Attributes (merged or as-is)                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **2023-10-10T10:02:00Z**     | –                             | Payment Processed        | Order#1234   | Log A only         | –                                                                                                                                                      |
| **2023-10-10T10:02:05Z**     | –                             | Payment Check            | Order#1234   | Log B only         | user_id: u12<br>resource_id: r99<br>notes: "Payment gateway delay"                                                                                     |

| **2023-10-10T10:05:00Z**     | 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z         | Item Shipped             | Order#1234   | merged             | user_id: u45<br>resource_id: r10<br>notes: "Package handed to courier"                                                                                 |

### **Notes on approach**

- For **merged events** (rows 1, 2, and 6): timestamps match within 2 seconds; event names correspond; merged richer attributes from Log B with timestamps from both.
- For **closely related but not matching** Payment events, timestamp difference is 5s (above tolerance); semantics are related but likely different parts of payment handling, so kept separate.
- **Quality Check** appears only in Log B with no Log A equivalent—kept as separate event to preserve process info.
- **Item Delivered** appears only in Log A.
- **Chronological ordering** is by the primary timestamp (favoring Log A timing when merged, otherwise the event’s own log time).

---

### **Conclusion**

This integrated log provides a richer, more accurate view of the process by combining temporal data, mapping semantics despite naming differences, respecting timestamp tolerances, and including all distinctive events. It documents both the process as recorded by System A and the richer contextual data from System B.
