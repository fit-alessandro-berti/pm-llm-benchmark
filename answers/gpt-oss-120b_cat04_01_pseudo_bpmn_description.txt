We need to respond with a detailed explanation of the business process, describing each step, purpose, gateways, convergence, loops, differences between standard and custom, conditions for approvals and rework. Follow formatting rules: use LaTeX for math if any (likely none). Use proper paragraphs. No code needed. Ensure no mention of model unless asked. Provide thorough explanation.

**Overview of the Process**

The diagram models the end‑to‑end handling of a customer request, from the moment the request is received until a confirmation is sent back to the customer.  
It distinguishes two major request types—*Standard* and *Custom*—and embeds decision points (gateways) that determine which activities are executed, whether managerial approval is required, and how the flow can loop back for re‑work.

Below is a step‑by‑step walk‑through, together with the meaning of each gateway and the way the different branches converge or repeat.

---

## 1. Start Event → Task A – “Receive Customer Request”

* **Purpose:** Capture the incoming request (e.g., via email, portal, or phone).  
* **Output:** A request object that contains at least the *type* (Standard / Custom) and the basic customer data.

---

## 2. Gateway 1 (XOR) – “Check Request Type”

* **XOR (exclusive‑or) gateway** means that **exactly one** outgoing branch will be taken.  
* The decision is based on the request’s *type* field.

| Branch | Condition | Next Task |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Standard** | `type = Standard` | Task B1 |
| **Custom**   | `type = Custom`   | Task B2 |

---

## 3. Standard Path  

### 3.1 Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”

* Checks that the request complies with the normal product/service catalogue (e.g., correct SKU, valid pricing tier).

### 3.2 Gateway 2 (AND) – “Run Parallel Checks”

* **AND gateway** splits the flow **into parallel, independent branches** that must all complete before the flow can continue.

#### Parallel Branches  

| Parallel Task | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Task C1 – “Credit Check”** | Verify the customer’s credit limit or payment history. |
| **Task C2 – “Inventory Check”** | Confirm that the required items are in stock or can be procured. |

### 3.3 Join (implicit AND) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”

* The flow reconverges only after **both** C1 and C2 finish successfully.

### 3.4 Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”

* Uses the results of the credit and inventory checks to compute a realistic delivery schedule.

---

## 4. Custom Path  

### 4.1 Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”

* Evaluates technical, regulatory, and cost aspects of the bespoke request.

### 4.2 Gateway 3 (XOR) – “Is Customization Feasible?”

* Decision based on the feasibility study.

| Branch | Condition | Next Task |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Yes** | Feasibility = true | Task E1 |
| **No**  | Feasibility = false| Task E2 |

### 4.3 Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”

* Generates a detailed price and scope proposal for the custom solution.

### 4.4 Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice” → End Event

* Informs the customer that the request cannot be fulfilled; the process terminates here for this branch.

---

## 5. Convergence After Standard or Custom Path  

Both the **Standard** branch (ending at Task D) and the **Custom** branch (ending at Task E1) flow into the same next decision point:

### Gateway 4 (XOR) – “Is Approval Needed?”

* Determines whether a managerial sign‑off is required for the request.  
* The condition may depend on factors such as order value, discount level, or custom‑work complexity.

| Branch | Condition | Next Task |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Yes** | Approval required | Task F |
| **No**  | No approval needed | Task G (Generate Final Invoice) |

---

## 6. Approval Path (when “Yes” at Gateway 4)

### 6.1 Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”

* Sends the request (or quotation) to the appropriate manager for review.

### 6.2 Gateway 5 (XOR) – “Is Approval Granted?”

| Branch | Condition | Next Task |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Yes** | Manager approves | Task G |
| **No**  | Manager rejects | Task H |

### 6.3 Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”

* Produces the official invoice based on the agreed‑upon terms (standard or custom).

### 6.4 Task H – “Re‑evaluate Conditions”

* Triggers a re‑work loop when approval is denied.  
* The flow **loops back** to the most recent “decision‑making” task that can be altered:

  * **Standard request:** loops to **Task D** (re‑calculate delivery date after adjusting conditions such as lead time or pricing).  
  * **Custom request:** loops to **Task E1** (revise the custom quotation, perhaps by changing scope or price).

* This loop continues until the manager finally grants approval or the request is otherwise terminated.

---

## 7. No‑Approval Path (when “No” at Gateway 4)

* The process skips the approval activities and proceeds directly to **Task G** (Generate Final Invoice).

---

## 8. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”

* Communicates the final outcome (invoice, delivery date, or rejection) to the customer.  
* This step is common to **all** successful branches (standard, custom, approved, or not‑required‑approval).

---

## 9. End Event

* Marks the formal completion of the request handling.

### Summary of Key Differences Between Standard and Custom Requests

| Aspect | Standard Request | Custom Request |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Initial validation** | Simple checklist (Task B1) | Feasibility analysis (Task B2) |
| **Parallel checks** | Credit & inventory checks run in parallel (Tasks C1 & C2) | No parallel checks; only feasibility outcome matters |
| **Resulting activity before approval** | Delivery‑date calculation (Task D) | Custom quotation preparation (Task E1) |
| **Re‑work loop target** | Loops back to **Task D** (adjust delivery or related conditions) | Loops back to **Task E1** (revise quotation) |
| **Potential early termination** | Only after approval/re‑work; never ends early | May end early at **Task E2** (rejection notice) |

### When Are Approvals or Re‑work Triggered?

1. **Approval Needed?** – Determined by business rules (e.g., high‑value orders, special discounts, custom work).  
2. **Approval Granted?** – Manager evaluates the request; if **No**, the process enters the **Re‑evaluate Conditions** step (Task H).  
3. **Re‑evaluate Conditions** – Causes a **loop** back to the most recent task that can be modified (Task D for standard, Task E1 for custom). The loop repeats until approval is granted or the request is abandoned.

## Visual Flow (textual)

```
Start → A → XOR(Check Type)
   ├─ Standard → B1 → AND(Parallel) → C1 & C2 → Join → D
   └─ Custom   → B2 → XOR(Feasible?)
                     ├─ Yes → E1
                     └─ No  → E2 → End
Both branches → XOR(Approval Needed?)
   ├─ Yes → F → XOR(Approval Granted?)
               ├─ Yes → G
               └─ No  → H → (loop to D or E1)
   └─ No  → G
G → I → End
```

This description should give a clear picture of the business logic, the role of each gateway, and how the process adapts to the request type and approval outcomes.
