### 1) Example of a trace the model accepts but the domain should reject

One valid trace under the given process tree is:

**Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Ship_Order  Package_Items  Authorize_Payment  Close_Order**

This trace is accepted because the “successful” branch is modeled as:

- `PARALLEL(Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order)`

and a parallel (AND) node allows its children to occur in **any order** (as long as all occur once).

### 2) Why this trace is problematic in a real Order-to-Cash process

From domain knowledge, **shipping cannot happen before packaging**, and typically also **cannot happen before payment authorization** (at least in the “standard” flow you described):

- You must **package items before you can ship them**.
- You generally must **authorize payment before shipping** (otherwise you ship goods without confirmed payment).

So the trace is logically incorrect in the real process, but the model fails to prohibit it because it uses a **parallel operator** where a **sequence** (e.g., `Authorize_Payment  Package_Items  Ship_Order`) is needed to enforce the required ordering constraints.
