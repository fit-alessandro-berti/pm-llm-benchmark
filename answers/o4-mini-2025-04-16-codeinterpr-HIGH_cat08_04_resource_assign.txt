Below is a structured, stepbystep approach to mining TechSolve’s incident management event log for resourceassignment insights, diagnosing root causes of inefficient routing, and designing data-driven assignment strategies—with a plan for simulation and ongoing monitoring.

1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns  
——————————————————————————  
a) Key Metrics and Views  
• Workload Distribution  
  – # of tickets assigned and closed per agent, per tier, per time period  
  – Utilization rate = busy time (Work Start  Work End) ÷ logged-in time  
• Processing Times  
  – Cycle time per activity (average work duration at L1/L2/L3)  
  – Waiting times: queue time before “Work Start” at each tier  
• First-Call Resolution (FCR) for L1  
  – % of tickets closed at L1 without escalation  
• Skill-Type Frequency  
  – Volume of tickets by Required Skill (e.g. Networking-Firewall) handled by each agent/tier  
• Reassignments & Escalations  
  – # of reassignments per ticket, average delay per reassignment  
  – Escalation rate from L1L2 and L2L3  

b) Process-Mining Techniques  
• Variant Discovery & Throughput Paths  
  – Identify the most frequent routing variants (L1Closed vs. L1L2Closed vs. L1L2L3…)  
• Resource Interaction / Handover-of-Work Networks  
  – Build a directed graph where nodes are agents (or roles/tiers), edges represent handovers  
  – Detect “super-connectors” (agents who receive or forward many tickets) and isolate long handover chains  
• Role Mining (Clustering by Actual Work)  
  – Cluster agents by their performed activities and ticket types to discover informal roles (e.g. “Firewall Expert,” “Generalist L2”)  
• Skill Utilization Analysis  
  – Cross-tabulate Required Skill vs. Agent Skill: compute % of tickets where agent’s skill = required skill, > required proficiency, or < required proficiency  

c) Comparing Actual vs. Intended Logic  
• Overlay discovered paths on the documented round-robin / manual escalation rules.  
• Highlight deviations: e.g., tickets intended for “any L2 network specialist” actually funnel to B08 70% of the time.  

2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues  
——————————————————————————————  
a) Pinpointing Issues  
• Skill Scarcity Bottlenecks  
  – Identify skills with long queue times (e.g. “Database-SQL” tickets wait 2 h on average before L2 start)  
  – Correlate ticket backlog by skill with number of agents possessing that skill  
• Reassignment Delays  
  – Compute average delay introduced by each reassignment: e.g. 1st reassign adds 18 min, 2nd adds 25 min  
  – % of SLA breaches where >1 reassignment occurred  
• Incorrect Initial Assignments  
  – Cases where L1 agent lacked required skill, leading to immediate escalation: quantify % of L1 escalations due to skill mismatch vs. genuine complexity  
• Overloaded vs. Underutilized Agents  
  – Gini coefficient of workload distribution; identify top 10% agents handling 30% of tickets vs. bottom 10% handling <5%  
• SLA Breach Correlations  
  – Statistical correlation (e.g. chi-square or regression) between SLA violation and indicators like “skill mismatch,” “>2 reassignments,” “long queue at L2.”  

b) Quantifying Impact  
• Example: “Tickets with at least one reassignment have an average resolution time of 5.2 h vs. 2.1 h for straight-through cases, and account for 65% of P2 SLA breaches.”  

3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies  
————————————————————————————  
a) Potential Root Causes  
• Rigid Round-Robin / Manual Dispatch  
  – Ignores real-time workload and varying proficiency levels  
• Incomplete or Static Skill Profiles  
  – Agents’ skill certificates not updated, leading to misrouted tickets  
• Poor Ticket Categorization  
  – Initial category/skill tag inaccurate 20% of the time, driving misassignments  
• Lack of Real-Time Visibility  
  – Dispatchers and L1 agents can’t see current queue lengths or agent availability  
• Under-empowered L1 Agents  
  – Conservative escalation practices because L1 can’t access advanced KB or lacks coaching  

b) Process-Mining for Root Causes  
• Variant Comparison  
  – Compare low-reassign “golden path” variants vs. high-reassign variants: differences in ticket category tags, assignment timestamps, required-skill accuracy  
• Decision Mining  
  – Mine the dispatcher’s decision rules: e.g. “If Priority=P2 AND Category=Network, assign to B08”; identify missing conditions like agent load <80%.  
• Conformance Checking  
  – Align discovered process model with the prescribed model; violations point to broken rules or missing controls.  

4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies  
——————————————————————————————————  
Strategy 1: Skill-Proficiency-Weighted Routing  
  • Issue Addressed: misassignments and reassignments due to equal-weight routing  
  • How It Leverages Mining Insights: uses the skill-utilization matrix and handover delays to rank agents not just by skill presence but by historical resolution speed and first-time fix rate  
  • Data Required: up-to-date agent-skill proficiency levels, real-time availability, historical resolution times by skill/agent  
  • Expected Benefits:  
    –  Reassignments (est. –40%)  
    –  Mean resolution time for specialized tickets (est. –30 min)  
    –  SLA breaches for P2 by 15%  

Strategy 2: Workload-Aware Dynamic Load Balancing  
  • Issue Addressed: uneven workload, overloaded specialists  
  • How It Leverages Mining Insights: employs real-time queue lengths and agent utilization stats from the mined process dashboards  
  • Data Required: live agent status (busy/idle), queue lengths per skill/tier, expected handling times  
  • Expected Benefits:  
    – More even utilization (Gini index improvement from 0.420.25)  
    – Faster queue clearance for peak skills  
    – Reduction in ticket wait time before “Work Start” by 20%  

Strategy 3: Predictive Skill-Requirement Classification  
  • Issue Addressed: poor initial categorization leading to misrouting  
  • How It Leverages Mining Insights: trains a classification model on the historical log (ticket metadata + description  required skill) to suggest the correct skill tag at ticket creation  
  • Data Required: past tickets’ free-text descriptions, final resolved skill, category labels, resolution times  
  • Expected Benefits:  
    –  Initial assignment accuracy (from 80%93%)  
    –  L1 escalations due to wrong categorization by 25%  
    – Improved FCR by empowering L1 with better initial skill match  

5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring  
————————————————————————————  
a) Process Simulation  
• Model Building  
  – Derive a stochastic process model from the event log (arrival rates by priority, branching probabilities for escalations, resource pools with service time distributions)  
• Scenario Testing  
  – Simulate baseline vs. new routing logics (e.g. skill-weighted, workload-aware) under varying load scenarios (peak vs. off-peak)  
• Key Outputs  
  – SLA compliance rates, average resolution times, queue lengths by skill, resource utilization  
• Decision Criteria  
  – Choose strategy suite that best improves SLA for P2/P3 with minimal increase in L1 load  

b) Post-Implementation Monitoring  
• Process-Mining Dashboards (near real time)  
  – Resource Utilization Overview: busy vs. idle time by agent/tier  
  – Assignment Accuracy: % of tickets where assigned agent’s top skill matches required skill  
  – Reassignment Heatmap: number and delay of reassignments over time  
  – SLA Compliance Trends: by priority and by skill category  
• Continuous Improvement Loops  
  – Monthly variant analysis to detect any new bottlenecks or emerging skill shortages  
  – Decision-model re-training cadence (e.g. quarterly) for predictive classification  
  – Periodic skill-profile audits to update agent proficiency records

By applying these process-miningbased analyses and data-driven routing enhancements—and validating them via simulation—TechSolve can systematically reduce misassignments, balance workloads, cut resolution times, and drive SLA compliance well within targets.
