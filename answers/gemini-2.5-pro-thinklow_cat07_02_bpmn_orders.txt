This is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram** that illustrates an order fulfillment process. The diagram is structured into four horizontal sections called **pools**, each representing a department or functional area: **Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse**. The flow of work and information between these departments is shown through tasks and message flows (dashed lines).

Here is a step-by-step description of the process:

### 1. Sales Department
*   The process begins in the **Sales** pool with a timer start event labeled "Monday morning," suggesting this process might be initiated on a recurring schedule.
*   The first tasks are to "Check customer's order" and "Check order for completeness."
*   An **exclusive gateway** (a diamond with an 'X') follows, which checks if the customer is already in the database.
    *   If the customer is **not in the database**, they are added via the "Add customer to the database" task, which interacts with an external database.
    *   If the customer **is in the database**, this step is skipped.
*   The paths merge, and the Sales department then performs a "Send order details" task. This is a message-sending event, which transmits the order details to both the **Production** and **Procurement** departments.
*   The Sales process then waits at an intermediate message event until it receives a "Product sent" notification from the Warehouse.
*   Upon receiving this notification, the final task is to "Draft invoice," after which the process in the Sales department concludes.

### 2. Production Department
*   The process in the **Production** pool is initiated by receiving the "Order details arrive" message from Sales.
*   The flow proceeds to "Plan production."
*   An **inclusive gateway** (a diamond with a '+') indicates that the process must wait for multiple conditions to be met before proceeding. In this case, it waits for production to be planned and for a "Material not faulty" message from the Procurement department.
*   Once both conditions are met, the "Manufacture product" task begins.
*   After the product is manufactured, a "Product complete" message is sent to the **Warehouse** department, and this part of the process ends.

### 3. Procurement Department
*   Similar to Production, the **Procurement** process starts upon receiving the "Order details arrive" message from Sales.
*   This triggers a "Material Compensation Subprocess."
    *   Inside this subprocess, the first task is to "Order materials." This task has a **compensation boundary event**, which means if a compensation is triggered later, the "Return material" task will be executed.
    *   Next, the materials are checked ("Check materials").
*   If the materials check is successful and the subprocess completes normally, a "Material not faulty" message is sent to the **Production** department.
*   However, there is an alternative path leading to an "Order cancellation" end event. This suggests that if the material check fails, the order might be cancelled, which would trigger the compensation to return the ordered materials.

### 4. Warehouse Department
*   The process in the **Warehouse** pool starts when it receives the "Product complete" message from Production.
*   The only task is to "Send product" to the customer.
*   After the product is sent, a "Product sent" message is sent back to the **Sales** department to notify them of the shipment.
*   The process in the Warehouse then concludes, which in turn allows the Sales process to complete as well.

In summary, this BPMN diagram visualizes a coordinated workflow where the Sales team handles customer interaction and invoicing, Procurement secures materials, Production manufactures the goods, and the Warehouse manages the final shipment. The process relies heavily on messaging between departments to ensure smooth and sequential execution of tasks.
