Based on your instructions and the provided DECLARE model structure, we can introduce fairness constraints to mitigate potential biases. Let's add the necessary constraints that ensure actions taken during the loan review process are fair and do not unfairly disadvantage applicants based on sensitive attributes like race or gender. Here is how I'll incorporate these changes into the existing `declare_model`:

### Updated Model with Bias Mitigating Constraints

```python
updated_declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New coexistence constraints
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New response constraints
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New succession constraints
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    # New non-succession constraints
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

- **Coexistence (`coexistence`)**: Ensures that if a decision is made based on sensitive attributes (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), then a `ManualReview` must always be present. This helps in reviewing decisions concerning applicants from minority groups to ensure fairness.
  
- **Response (`response`)**: Adds a requirement that after checking the applicantâ€™s race, there needs to be a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that any sensitive attribute checks are followed by a bias mitigation step before reaching a decision.

- **Succession (`succession`)**: Ensures that decisions like `Approve` and `Reject` can only follow actions like `BiasMitigationCheck`, making sure these decisions occur after proper consideration of potential biases.
  
- **Non-succession (`nonsuccession`)**: Prevents a direct path from an event revealing sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision step that could unfairly reject applications. This stops immediate biased outcomes without proper review or mitigation.

By adding these constraints, we aim to build a process model that is more robust against bias, ensuring fair treatment for all applicants regardless of their demographic characteristics.
