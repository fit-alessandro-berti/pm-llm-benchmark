### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Process Mining Analysis:**

*   **Cold-Packing Stations:** Analyze event logs for Orders containing the attribute "Requires Cold Packing = TRUE" to find time spent at each station type. Calculate average wait time in queues for these vs. standard packing.
*   **Shipping Batches:** Identify Orders with the same "Destination Region" parameter and calculate average time from Quality Check completion until Label Generation (batch wait time).
*   **Priority Handling:** Track Express orders through the system, measuring average delays imposed on preceding Standard orders in current activities (via activity start/stop times) when Express orders preempt resources.
*   **Hazardous Material:** Create a timeline analysis of concurrent Hazardous orders in Packing and Quality Check. Compare throughput rates on days/times with high vs. low Hazardous order volumes.

**Metrics:**

*   **Resource Contention:** Time between "Activity START" and "Activity COMPLETE" timestamps compared to theoretical minimum times per resource type (using specialized vs. standard stations).
*   **Batch Wait Times:** Average time from "Quality Check COMPLETE" to "Shipping Label Gen. COMPLETE".
*   **Express Order Delays:** Measure delays in Standard order activity completion when followed by Express order resource occupancy (using timestamp differences).
*   **Throughput Impact:** Calculate number of orders completed per hour during Hazardous vs. non-Hazardous peak periods.

**Differentiation:**

*   **Within-instance:** Time between "START" and "COMPLETE" timestamps *during* uninterruptible activity (e.g., Packing).
*   **Between-instance:** Time *before* the "START" timestamp due to resource availability (previous order using the station) or *after* "COMPLETE" (waiting for batch).
*   Use multi-instance modeling techniques to track orders waiting for shared resources as "idle time" in between activities.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Examples:**

*   **Express Orders & Cold-Packing:** Express orders might monopolize these limited stations, causing Standard Orders with Cold-Packing needs to accumulate in queues.
*   **Hazardous Batching:** If hazardous orders destined for the same region cluster together in the batch, the system might reach regulatory limits during packing/quality of that batch.
*   **Cold-Packing & Shipping Batches:** Large batches might include multiple cold-packing orders, creating a bottleneck if those few stations become overloaded with priority.

**Importance:** Understanding interactions prevents "fix one, break another" scenarios. For instance, reducing batch wait times might increase Hazardous order processing conflicts.

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**1. Dynamic Cold-Packing Allocation**

*   **Target:** Cold-Packing content
*   **Action:** Implement a real-time resource scheduler based on predictive models (using historical data) prioritizing Express then cold-packing necessity (for Standards)
*   **Data:** Resource utilization patterns at different times
*   **Outcome:** Reduced wait times for Cold-Packing, improved Express order processing without excessive Standard delays

**2. Rolling Batch Windows**

*   **Target:** Shipping batches
*   **Action:** Implement variable batch trigger times (smaller batches for regions with fewer orders) & dynamic hazardous order de-prioritization during Hazardous peaks
*   **Data:** Region-wise order volume trends
*   **Outcome:** Faster label generation overall with compliance during Hazardous spikes

**3. Hazard Material Staggering**

*   **Target:** Regulatory compliance
*   **Action:** Implement a scheduling rule that identifies Hazardous orders and delays packing/QC by 10 minutes if >10 simultaneous detected (prioritizing Express)
*   **Data:** Real-time resource trackers for Hazardous limits
*   **Outcome:** Compliance while minimizing Standard order disruption

### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Focus Points:**

*   **Queue Modeling:** Simulate multiple scenarios (peak vs. low demand) with different resource allocation policies & batch triggers
*   **Constraint Simulation:** Simulate Hazardous material cap restrictions & priority handling interruptions
*   **KPI Tracking:** Model throughput/average lead times under each proposed strategy with the original workflow as a baseline.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics:**

*   **Cold-Packing Wait Time:** Average waiting for cold stations per hour
*   **Batch Queue Length:** Average number of orders waiting per batch 
*   **Hazardous Processing Compliance:** Percentage of shifts with violations

**Dashboards:**

*   **Hazardous Order Tracker:** Real-time monitoring of concurrent Hazardous orders in key steps
*   **Cold-Packing Resource Utilization:** Station availability percentages (specialized vs. standard)
*   **Batch Formation Progress:** Orders ready vs. current batch size by region

**Track Progress:**

Compare pre- and post-implementation metrics (batch wait times, Hazardous compliance rates) and conduct A/B testing on resource allocation strategies during quiet vs. peak hours. Utilize predictive analysis of order volumes to adjust batch triggers dynamically based on expected orders in the next time slot.
