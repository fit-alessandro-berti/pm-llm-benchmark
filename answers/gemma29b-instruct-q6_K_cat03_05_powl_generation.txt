This code defines a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process using POWL. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Activities:** Each step in the process is represented as a `Transition` object. 
2. **Choice Operator:** The `choose_supplier` operator allows for selecting a supplier based on received quotations. 
3. **Loop Operator:** The `renegotiate_price` operator models a potential loop for price renegotiation.
4. **Partial Order:** The `StrictPartialOrder` object represents the overall POWL model, defining the order of execution for the activities and operators. Edges are added to specify the dependencies between activities.

**Key Points:**

* This is a basic example, and real-world Purchase-to-Pay processes are more complex.
* You can expand this model by adding more activities, operators, and edges to represent the full complexity of the process.
* POWL models can be used for process analysis, simulation, and optimization.
