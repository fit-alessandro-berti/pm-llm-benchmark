**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary modules:**
   - `pm4py` for general process mining functionalities.
   - Relevant classes from `pm4py.objects.powl.obj` and `pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj` to construct the POWL model.

2. **Define activities as transitions:**
   - Each step in the Purchase-to-Pay process is represented as a `Transition` object with a descriptive label.

3. **Define choice nodes:**
   - `OperatorPOWL` objects with the `Operator.XOR` type are used to model decision points.
   - For example, `choose_approval_route` represents the choice between different approval pathways.

4. **Define loop nodes:**
   - `OperatorPOWL` objects with the `Operator.LOOP` type represent iterative processes.
   - `verify_invoice` models the potential need to correct and re-approve invoices.

5. **Construct the POWL model:**
   - `StrictPartialOrder` object is used as the root node to hold all the activities and operators.
   - Nodes are added to the `nodes` list of the root object.

6. **Add edges to define the partial order:**
   - `order.add_edge(source_node, target_node)` is used to specify the execution sequence between nodes.

7. **Print the POWL model:**
   - `pm4py.visualization.process_tree_visualization(root)` displays the constructed POWL model for visualization or further analysis.
