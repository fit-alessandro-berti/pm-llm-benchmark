### BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Process

#### **Activities/Tasks:**
1. **Receive Invoice**  
   - **Description:** Invoice arrives via email.
   - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).

2. **Check PO Number**  
   - **Description:** Verify if the invoice has a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
   - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
   - **Outputs:** If no PO, request more details from supplier.

3. **Log Invoice into Accounting System**

4. **Forward to Purchasing Department**  
   - **Description:** Send the invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan) for confirmation of receipt and accuracy against the PO.
   - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
   - **Outputs:** Confirmation email back to Accounts Payable or hold request.

5. **Confirm Receipt and Accuracy**  
   - **Description:** Compare invoice details with the PO in the system.
   - **Roles:** Purchasing Officer (Dan).
   - **Outputs:** Confirmation email or request for corrected invoice.

6. **Match Invoice Against PO**  
   - **Description:** Match invoice line items with the PO details.
   - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
   - **Gateways:** If discrepancy, escalate to supervisor or purchasing team.

7. **Send to Manager for Approval**  
   - **Description:** Forward the confirmed invoice to the Department Manager (Carlos) for final approval.
   - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary).
   - **Triggers:** After receiving confirmation from Purchasing.

8. **Manager Approves/Rejects Invoice**  
   - **Description:** Review invoice details and approve or reject based on accuracy and budget compliance.
   - **Roles:** Department Manager (Carlos).

9. **Schedule Payment**

10. **Handle Exceptions**  
    - **Description:** Resolve issues such as missing PO, discrepancies, or informal contracts.
    - **Roles:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).
    - **Outputs:** Return to normal flow after resolution.

#### **Sequence Flow:**
1. Start → Receive Invoice
2. Receive Invoice → Check PO Number
3. Check PO Number → [If No PO] Request More Details From Supplier OR [If Yes PO] Log Invoice into Accounting System
4. Log Invoice into Accounting System → Forward to Purchasing Department
5. Forward to Purchasing Department → Confirm Receipt and Accuracy
6. Confirm Receipt and Accuracy → [If Correct] Match Invoice Against PO OR [If Incorrect] Hold Invoice Until Correction
7. Match Invoice Against PO → [If No Discrepancy] Send to Manager for Approval OR [If Discrepancy] Email Purchasing Team or Escalate to Supervisor
8. Send to Manager for Approval → Manager Approves/Rejects Invoice
9. Manager Approves/Rejects Invoice → [If Approved] Schedule Payment OR [If Rejected] Investigate Further
10. Handle Exceptions → Return to Normal Flow (if resolved)

#### **Gateways/Decision Points:**
- **Gateway 1:** Check PO Number  
  - If No PO → Request More Details From Supplier
  - If Yes PO → Log Invoice into Accounting System

- **Gateway 2:** Confirm Receipt and Accuracy  
  - If Correct → Match Invoice Against PO
  - If Incorrect → Hold Invoice Until Correction

- **Gateway 3:** Match Invoice Against PO  
  - If No Discrepancy → Send to Manager for Approval
  - If Discrepancy → Email Purchasing Team or Escalate to Supervisor

- **Gateway 4:** Manager Approves/Rejects Invoice  
  - If Approved → Schedule Payment
  - If Rejected → Investigate Further

#### **Roles/Participants:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Handles initial checks, logging, forwarding, matching, and scheduling payments.
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Confirms receipt and accuracy against PO.
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Final approval step.
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Handles exceptions and escalations.
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Assists in resolving issues related to suppliers.

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
- **Invoice:** Primary document moving through the process.
- **Purchase Order (PO):** Required for validation and matching.
- **Confirmation Emails:** Sent between departments to confirm steps.
- **Payment Schedules:** Generated for approved invoices.

#### **Exceptions/Variations:**
- **Missing PO:** Invoice is returned to supplier for correction.
- **Discrepancies:** Invoice held until clarification or escalation.
- **Informal Contracts:** Supervisor works with department heads to resolve.
- **Suspicious Items:** Manager may reject or request further investigation.

### Notes:
- In some cases, after handling exceptions, the process might skip directly to confirmation by the Purchasing Officer if the issue was minor.
- There is uncertainty around how exactly the manager’s approval triggers the scheduling for payment, but it appears automatic within the system once approved.
- The role of the Supplier Relationship Manager is indirect but crucial for resolving specific supplier-related issues.
