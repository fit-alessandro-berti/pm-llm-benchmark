### Detailed Explanation of the Business Process:

The provided pseudo-BPMN representation outlines a business process for handling customer requests, with different paths depending on whether the request is "Standard" or "Custom." This process ensures that all necessary checks and validations are performed, and appropriate approvals are obtained before finalizing the process.

#### 1. **Start Event: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose:** The process begins when a customer submits a request.
- **Explanation:** This is the entry point of the process, where the system or team receives the customer's request.

#### 2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose:** To acknowledge receipt of the customer's request and start processing it.
- **Explanation:** This is a placeholder for the action that occurs when a request is received. It does not add any business logic but marks the beginning of the process.

#### 3. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**
- **Purpose:** To determine the type of request (Standard or Custom) and route the process accordingly.
- **Explanation:** An XOR (Exclusive OR) gateway is used because the process can only take one of the two paths at any given time. It checks the type of request and branches the process into two separate paths: one for "Standard" requests and another for "Custom" requests.

#### 4. **Path 1: Standard Request**
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
  - **Purpose:** To validate the standard request according to predefined rules.
  - **Explanation:** This task checks that the request meets the criteria for a standard request. If not, a more complex process is required (Custom Path).

- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
  - **Purpose:** To perform multiple checks in parallel and ensure all are completed before proceeding.
  - **Explanation:** This AND gateway ensures that both the Credit Check and Inventory Check are completed before moving to the next step. Parallel tasks are often used to speed up the process by completing multiple checks simultaneously.

- **Tasks C1: "Credit Check"**
  - **Purpose:** To verify the customer's creditworthiness.
  - **Explanation:** This task ensures that the customer has sufficient credit to proceed with the request.

- **Tasks C2: "Inventory Check"**
  - **Purpose:** To verify that the requested product or service is available in stock.
  - **Explanation:** This task ensures that the requested item is available for delivery.

- **Join: "All Parallel Checks Completed"**
  - **Purpose:** To ensure both checks are completed before proceeding.
  - **Explanation:** The join ensures that both the Credit Check and Inventory Check have been completed successfully. If either check fails, the process would need to loop back to the request validation or restart the checks.

- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
  - **Purpose:** To determine the delivery date based on available resources.
  - **Explanation:** Once the checks are completed, the process calculates the delivery date.

#### 5. **Path 2: Custom Request**
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
  - **Purpose:** To analyze whether the custom request is feasible.
  - **Explanation:** This task evaluates the feasibility of the custom request. If the request is not feasible, the process diverges to a rejection path.

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
  - **Purpose:** To check the feasibility of the custom request.
  - **Explanation:** This XOR gateway ensures that the process only proceeds if the customization is feasible. If not feasible, the process branches to the rejection path.

- **[If Yes] Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
  - **Purpose:** To create a quotation for the custom request.
  - **Explanation:** If the request is feasible, the process proceeds to prepare a quotation for the customer.

- **[If No] Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**
  - **Purpose:** To notify the customer that the request is not feasible.
  - **Explanation:** If the request is not feasible, this task sends a rejection notice to the customer.

- **End Event:**
  - **Purpose:** To conclude the process for unfeasible custom requests.
  - **Explanation:** This is the endpoint for the process when the request is not feasible.

#### 6. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Purpose:** To determine if any approval is required for the process to continue.
- **Explanation:** An XOR gateway is used to decide whether an approval step is necessary. This can vary based on the type of request.

#### 7. **[If Yes - Standard Path] Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
  - **Purpose:** To obtain approval from a manager for the standard request.
  - **Explanation:** This task ensures that the manager approves the delivery date before finalizing the process.

#### 8. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
  - **Purpose:** To check if the approval is granted.
  - **Explanation:** This XOR gateway ensures that the process only proceeds if the approval is granted. If not, the process loops back to a previous step (either re-evaluate conditions or continue with the custom path).

- **[If Yes] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
  - **Purpose:** To generate the final invoice based on the delivery date and other details.
  - **Explanation:** Once the approval is granted, the process generates the final invoice.

- **[If No] Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
  - **Purpose:** To re-evaluate the conditions of the request and potentially modify the delivery date.
  - **Explanation:** If the approval is not granted, the process returns to the previous step to re-evaluate the conditions and possibly modify the delivery date before seeking approval again.

#### 9. **[If No - No Approval Needed Path] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
  - **Purpose:** To generate the final invoice without requiring manager approval.
  - **Explanation:** If no approval is needed, the process directly generates the final invoice.

#### 10. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose:** To notify the customer that the process is complete and confirm the delivery date or quotation.
- **Explanation:** This task sends a confirmation to the customer, notifying them of the outcome of the process.

#### 11. **End Event:**
- **Purpose:** To conclude the entire process.
- **Explanation:** This is the endpoint of the process, marking the completion of the request handling.

### Summary:
- **Standard Path:** The process involves standard validation, parallel checks, and calculation of the delivery date. If approvals are required, the manager must approve the process before generating the final invoice.
- **Custom Path:** The process involves feasibility analysis, quotation preparation, and potentially rejection if the customization is not feasible.
- **Looping Back:** If approvals are not granted, the process loops back to re-evaluate conditions or modify the request before seeking approval again. This ensures that all necessary checks are completed before finalizing the process.
