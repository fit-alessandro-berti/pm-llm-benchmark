### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

Based on the provided event log sample, I analyzed the sequence of low-level events across cases (A1 and B2), which follow a highly consistent pattern. The events represent a linear manufacturing workflow for processing metal sheets into finished products, likely involving fabrication of metal components (e.g., frames or panels). To group them into high-level steps, I applied the following inference rules:

- **Temporal proximity**: Events occurring within short time windows (e.g., seconds to minutes) without significant gaps or resource switches were grouped together, indicating a continuous sub-process.
- **Logical coherence**: Events that form a clear functional sequence (e.g., setup actions leading to a core operation, or checks following production) were aggregated, even if involving different resources, as they contribute to the same phase.
- **Resource patterns**: Groupings considered shared resource types (e.g., operator actions for preparation, automated units for processing) and transitions between phases (e.g., from manual handling to machine operations).
- **Process phase identification**: The overall sequence suggests distinct stages: initial setup of materials, core fabrication/assembly, post-processing, and final validation. This avoids arbitrary splits and ensures each group represents a "coherent stage" as per the prompt.
- **Consistency across cases**: Both cases show identical activity sequences with minor timestamp variations, confirming repeatable groupings applicable to the full log.

This results in **4 high-level steps**, covering all events without overlap or omission. Each step is defined below with:
- The grouped low-level events (with timestamps from Case A1 for reference; Case B2 follows the same pattern).
- A rationale for the grouping.
- A proposed name.

The groupings transform the granular log into a high-level workflow: **Material Preparation**  **Welding Assembly**  **Coating Application**  **Quality Assurance**. This abstraction makes the manufacturing process easier to analyze for bottlenecks, durations, or compliance.

#### 1. High-Level Step: Material Preparation
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events** (Case A1 timestamps; similar for B2):
     - 08:00:05 | Retrieve raw metal sheet | Operator A | PartID: M-045
     - 08:00:07 | Scan barcode | Operator A | Barcode: 12345
     - 08:00:10 | Place metal sheet on table | Operator A | TableID: T-3
     - 08:00:15 | Align metal sheet | Robot Arm #2 | Alignment: Perfect
     - 08:00:20 | Preheat metal sheet | Heating Unit #1 | Temperature: 200°C
   - **Rationale**: These events form the initial setup phase for the raw material, occurring in rapid succession (within ~15 seconds) and focusing on handling, identification, positioning, and conditioning the metal sheet for subsequent operations. They are logically sequential (retrieval  scanning/verification  placement  alignment  preheating) and primarily involve Operator A transitioning to automated resources, marking the start of the process. Grouping them captures the preparation of a single component before any transformative actions, avoiding fragmentation of what is essentially a single "setup" sub-process.
   - **Proposed Name**: Material Preparation (domain-relevant as it aligns with standard manufacturing stages for raw material handling and readiness).

#### 2. High-Level Step: Welding Assembly
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events** (Case A1 timestamps; similar for B2):
     - 08:01:00 | Pick up welding tool | Operator B | ToolID: W-12
     - 08:01:05 | Weld corner A | Operator B | WeldType: Spot
     - 08:01:10 | Weld corner B | Operator B | WeldType: Spot
     - 08:01:20 | Measure weld integrity | Quality Sensor #1 | IntegrityScore: 95
   - **Rationale**: This sequence represents the core assembly/fabrication phase, with a ~40-second gap from the previous step indicating a phase transition (e.g., tool setup). The events are tightly linked: tool pickup enables the two welding actions (specific to corners A and B, suggesting structural joining), immediately followed by an integrity measurement as an inline check. All involve Operator B for manual precision work, plus a sensor for validation, forming a coherent "welding operation" that transforms the prepared sheet. The immediate post-weld measurement justifies inclusion here rather than as a separate QA step, as it directly ensures assembly quality before proceeding.
   - **Proposed Name**: Welding Assembly (reflects the domain-specific joining process using spot welding, common in metal fabrication).

#### 3. High-Level Step: Coating Application
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events** (Case A1 timestamps; similar for B2):
     - 08:01:30 | Apply protective coating | Coating Unit #3 | CoatingType: Polyurethane
     - 08:01:45 | Dry coating | Heating Unit #2 | Temperature: 120°C
   - **Rationale**: These events occur ~10 seconds after the welding measurement, forming a distinct post-assembly finishing phase focused on surface protection. The application and drying are directly sequential (coating requires immediate drying to set), involving automated units without operator intervention, and represent a self-contained sub-process to prepare the welded product for final checks. Grouping them avoids splitting a logical pair that occurs in under 20 seconds, emphasizing the protective treatment as a transitional stage between assembly and inspection.
   - **Proposed Name**: Coating Application (captures the finishing/protective layer process, standard in manufacturing for corrosion resistance).

#### 4. High-Level Step: Quality Assurance
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events** (Case A1 timestamps; similar for B2):
     - 08:02:00 | Visual check | Operator C | Check: Passed
   - **Rationale**: This single event marks the end of the process, occurring ~15 seconds after drying with a resource switch to Operator C for manual oversight. It serves as a final validation gate, confirming the product's readiness post all prior transformations. As a standalone check (no preceding low-level events in the log), it naturally forms its own group, but in a full log, similar isolated checks could aggregate if multiple occur. The rationale is its role as a comprehensive phase-end review, distinct from inline measurements (e.g., weld integrity, which is assembly-specific).
   - **Proposed Name**: Quality Assurance (broadly applicable to end-of-process inspections, aligning with manufacturing standards for defect detection).

### Additional Recommendations for Full Log Application
- **Aggregation Rules for Scalability**: For the complete event log, apply these groupings per CaseID by sequencing events chronologically and applying thresholds (e.g., group events within 1-minute windows unless a major resource/activity shift occurs, like from welding to coating). Use Activity keywords (e.g., "Weld" for assembly) and AdditionalInfo (e.g., scores for QA) to automate via scripting.
- **Potential Enhancements**: If the full log includes variations (e.g., failed checks or additional steps), refine groups dynamically—e.g., expand Quality Assurance to include multiple checks. Calculate high-level step durations (e.g., end timestamp minus start) for process mining insights.
- **Benefits**: This reduces ~12 low-level events per case to 4 high-level steps, revealing the workflow's structure (total cycle ~2 minutes per case) and enabling higher-level analysis like throughput or resource utilization.

This structured approach provides a clear, rationale-driven path from granular events to meaningful process stages.
