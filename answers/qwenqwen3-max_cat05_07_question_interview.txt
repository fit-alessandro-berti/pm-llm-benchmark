Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions designed to deepen understanding of the property onboarding process, clarify ambiguities, and uncover critical operational details:

1. **Initial Intake & Documentation**  
   - What specific documents are considered “mandatory” for onboarding, and how do these requirements vary by city or property type (e.g., single-family vs. multi-unit)?  
   - How do you determine whether a document is “outdated”? Is there a standard validity period for items like inspection reports or compliance certificates?

2. **Property Coordinator Role**  
   - Beyond verifying documents, what other responsibilities does the property coordinator have during the initial review phase?  
   - If a landlord repeatedly fails to provide required documentation, what is the escalation path or cutoff point for abandoning the onboarding attempt?

3. **Property Manager Assignment**  
   - Can you walk me through how the system (or team) weighs the different factors—workload, geography, experience, and landlord preferences—when assigning a property manager? Is there a scoring mechanism or is it primarily discretionary?  
   - Are there situations where a landlord can request a specific property manager, and how is that accommodated?

4. **Introductory Meeting**  
   - What are the most common “special conditions or policies” that landlords raise during this meeting, and how often do these require adjustments to standard company procedures?  
   - Is there a checklist or template used to ensure consistency across these introductory conversations?

5. **Inspection & Repairs**  
   - What types of issues typically require landlord involvement versus those the company handles directly?  
   - If repairs are needed, who selects and approves contractors—the landlord, the property manager, or a centralized vendor team?  
   - Is there a maximum allowable timeframe or budget threshold for repairs before the onboarding is paused or canceled?

6. **Marketing & Pricing**  
   - How frequently are the internal pricing models updated, and what data sources inform those updates (e.g., competitor listings, neighborhood trends)?  
   - Who has final approval over the rental price listed in marketing materials—the property manager, the landlord, or a pricing committee?

7. **Tenant Screening & Selection**  
   - What are the non-negotiable criteria for tenant approval (e.g., minimum credit score, income-to-rent ratio), and which aspects allow for managerial discretion?  
   - In competitive situations with multiple qualified applicants, what specific factors tip the decision (e.g., lease length, move-in timing, references)?

8. **Lease Finalization**  
   - How are custom lease clauses (requested by landlords) reviewed for legal and compliance risk before being included in the final agreement?  
   - Who is responsible for collecting the security deposit and first month’s rent—the property manager, a centralized finance team, or an automated system?

9. **Quality Assurance & Audits**  
   - At what stage(s) do the compliance officer, financial analyst, and IT department typically get involved? Are their reviews sequential or parallel?  
   - What happens if one of these audits identifies a discrepancy (e.g., pricing misalignment or fair housing concern)—is the property deactivated until resolved?

10. **Exception Handling & Communication**  
    - Can you describe a recent example of a significant exception (e.g., unique insurance needs, historic property restrictions) and how your team adapted the standard process?  
    - How is communication coordinated across so many stakeholders (landlords, coordinators, managers, inspectors, marketers, etc.) to avoid duplication or missed steps?  
    - Are there formal handoff points between roles (e.g., from coordinator to property manager), and how is accountability maintained during transitions?

11. **Process Timing & Metrics**  
    - What is the typical end-to-end duration for onboarding a standard property, and where do most delays tend to occur?  
    - Are there service-level agreements (SLAs) or internal KPIs tied to specific stages of this process?

12. **System Integration**  
    - When you say the property is “activated” in the rental portal, what specific data triggers this activation, and which system is considered the “source of truth” for property status?  
    - How are changes to property details (e.g., updated amenities, revised rent) communicated across systems once the property is live?

These questions aim to map decision logic, clarify handoffs, expose variability, and understand how the organization maintains consistency and compliance amid a highly contextual and multi-stakeholder workflow.
