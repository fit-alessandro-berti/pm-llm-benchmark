To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are the main differences based on the provided data:

### 1. **Rejection Frequency**
- **Protected Group:** The most frequent process variant is "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" with a frequency of 1036.
- **Unprotected Group:** The most frequent process variant is "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" with a frequency of 2490.

This indicates that the unprotected group is more frequently rejected after a more thorough screening process compared to the protected group.

### 2. **Screening and Extensive Screening**
- **Protected Group:** Extensive screening is a common step in multiple process variants, with a frequency of 793.
- **Unprotected Group:** Extensive screening is also common but with a slightly higher frequency of 1022.

### 3. **Contract Signing and Tenant Cancellation**
- **Protected Group:** There are several process variants involving contract signing followed by tenant cancellation. The most frequent is "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a frequency of 29.
- **Unprotected Group:** Similar process variants exist, but with higher frequencies, such as "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a frequency of 268.

### 4. **Missed Rent Payments and Evictions**
- **Protected Group:** There is a process variant involving missed rent payments and eviction with a frequency of 6.
- **Unprotected Group:** This process variant is not present in the data provided for the unprotected group.

### 5. **Tenant Cancellation After Multiple Rent Payments**
- **Protected Group:** There are multiple process variants where tenant cancellation occurs after several rent payments. For example, "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a frequency of 18.
- **Unprotected Group:** Similar process variants exist, but with higher frequencies, such as "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a frequency of 156.

### 6. **Performance (Execution Time)**
- **Protected Group:** The highest performance (execution time) is observed in the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a time of 1,349,975.636.
- **Unprotected Group:** The highest performance (execution time) is observed in the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Sign Contract -> Move In -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Pay Rent -> Tenant Cancels Apartment" with a time of 1,280,091.444.

### Summary of Unfair Differences
1. **Higher Rejection Rates:** The unprotected group is rejected more frequently after a thorough screening process.
2. **More Frequent Extensive Screenings:** Both groups undergo extensive screenings, but the unprotected group does so slightly more often.
3. **Higher Frequency of Contract Signing Followed by Cancellation:** The unprotected group more frequently signs a contract and then cancels the apartment.
4. **Missed Rent Payments and Evictions:** The protected group has instances of missed rent payments and evictions, which are not present in the unprotected group.
5. **Longer Process Variants:** The unprotected group has more frequent instances of longer process variants involving multiple rent payments before cancellation.

These differences suggest that the unprotected group may face more stringent screening and higher rates of rejection, as well as more instances of tenant cancellation after contract signing. This could indicate potential unfair treatment or bias in the process.
