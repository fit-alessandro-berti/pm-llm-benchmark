To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are the main differences based on the provided data:

1. **Screening Process**:
   - The 'protected' group undergoes more extensive screening processes compared to the 'unprotected' group. This includes steps like "Extensive Screening" and "Screen Prospective Tenant" more frequently.
   - The 'protected' group has more process variants involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments before cancellation, indicating a more rigorous evaluation process.

2. **Rejection Frequency**:
   - The 'protected' group has a significantly higher frequency of rejections after multiple steps, such as after "View The Property," "Hand In The Paperwork," and "Check Paperwork." This suggests that even after progressing through several stages, a higher number of 'protected' group members are ultimately rejected.
   - The 'unprotected' group also has rejections at various stages, but the frequency is generally lower compared to the 'protected' group.

3. **Contract Signing and Move-In**:
   - The 'protected' group has more process variants where they successfully sign the contract and move in, followed by multiple rent payments and eventual cancellation. This indicates that while they face more rigorous screening, some do manage to proceed to the rental phase.
   - The 'unprotected' group also has similar variants but with fewer instances of multiple rent payments before cancellation.

4. **Eviction Process**:
   - The 'protected' group has a specific process variant involving "Miss Rent Payment," "Issue Warning," and "Evict Tenant," which is not present in the 'unprotected' group. This suggests that the 'protected' group might face stricter enforcement of rental terms, including eviction for missed payments.

5. **Overall Performance**:
   - The 'protected' group has higher performance times for most process variants, indicating more time-consuming processes. This could suggest additional administrative or bureaucratic steps involved in their treatment.
   - The 'unprotected' group generally has lower performance times, indicating quicker processing times through the system.

### Key Unfair Differences:

1. **More Rigorous Screening**: The 'protected' group undergoes more extensive screening processes, which could indicate a higher level of scrutiny compared to the 'unprotected' group.

2. **Higher Rejection Rates**: Despite progressing through more steps, the 'protected' group has higher rejection rates, suggesting potential biases or stricter criteria.

3. **Stricter Enforcement**: The presence of an eviction process for the 'protected' group indicates stricter enforcement of rental terms, which may not be applied equally to the 'unprotected' group.

4. **Longer Processing Times**: The 'protected' group experiences longer processing times for most steps, suggesting a more time-consuming and potentially burdensome process.

These differences highlight potential unfair treatment and biases in the process, which need to be addressed to ensure equitable treatment for both groups.
