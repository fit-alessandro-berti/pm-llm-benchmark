### **Proposed High-Level Process Steps with Justifications**

Based on the event log provided, I have identified the following **high-level process steps**, each representing a coherent stage in the manufacturing workflow. These groupings are based on **temporal proximity, shared resources, and logical sequence** of actions.

---

### **1. Material Preparation**

**Low-Level Events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Justification:**
These events all pertain to **preparing the raw material** for further processing. They involve retrieving the material, identifying it via a barcode, positioning it, and preparing it (alignment and preheating) for the next stage. These actions are typically performed **before any assembly or modification** of the material.

**Resource Involvement:**
- Operator A (retrieval, scanning, placing)
- Robot Arm #2 (alignment)
- Heating Unit #1 (preheating)

**Proposed Name:**
> **Material Preparation**

---

### **2. Assembly (Welding)**

**Low-Level Events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Justification:**
These events are **directly related to the assembly of the metal sheet** using a welding tool. The sequence involves **tool retrieval** followed by **welding at two corners**, which are likely part of a **structured assembly task**. These actions are typically performed by a **skilled operator** and represent a **key manufacturing step**.

**Resource Involvement:**
- Operator B (tool pick-up and welding)

**Proposed Name:**
> **Assembly (Welding)**

---

### **3. Quality Assurance (Weld Integrity Check)**

**Low-Level Events:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Justification:**
This is a **quality check** performed after the welding step to ensure the **structural integrity** of the weld. The event involves a **quality sensor** measuring the **integrity score**, which is a standard part of **quality assurance** in manufacturing processes.

**Resource Involvement:**
- Quality Sensor #1

**Proposed Name:**
> **Quality Assurance (Weld Integrity Check)**

---

### **4. Surface Treatment (Coating & Drying)**

**Low-Level Events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Justification:**
These two events are **part of the surface treatment process**. After welding, the metal sheet is coated with a protective layer, and then the coating is dried using a heating unit. This is a **standard post-assembly treatment** to **protect the material from corrosion or damage**.

**Resource Involvement:**
- Coating Unit #3 (coating application)
- Heating Unit #2 (drying)

**Proposed Name:**
> **Surface Treatment (Coating & Drying)**

---

### **5. Final Inspection**

**Low-Level Events:**
- Visual check

**Justification:**
This is a **final quality check** performed by an operator to **visually inspect the product** and ensure it meets the required standards. It occurs after all prior steps and is typically the **last stage before the item is considered complete**.

**Resource Involvement:**
- Operator C (visual inspection)

**Proposed Name:**
> **Final Inspection**

## **Summary**

By grouping the low-level events into these **five high-level process steps**, we can now **easily visualize and analyze** the manufacturing workflow. This abstraction allows for:
- **Process optimization**
- **Quality control tracking**
- **Resource utilization analysis**
- **Identification of bottlenecks or delays**
