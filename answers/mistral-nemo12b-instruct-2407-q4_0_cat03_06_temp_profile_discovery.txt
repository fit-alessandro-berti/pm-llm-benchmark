To generate a temporal profile, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between each couple of activities that eventually follow each other in at least one process execution. However, from the provided data, we only have the frequency and performance of each process variant but not the actual timestamps or durations between activities.

To proceed with creating a temporal profile, I would need the following information:

1. The start time of each activity in each trace.
2. The end time of each activity in each trace.

Without this information, it's impossible to calculate the average and standard deviation of the times between activities. Could you please provide the actual timestamps or durations for each activity in the process variants?
