<think>
Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out which cases took longer than average. The user mentioned that cases taking significantly longer than average suggest performance issues. So, my first task is to calculate the total resolution time for each case and then find the average to identify outliers.

Looking at the event logs, each case has a "Receive Ticket" as the first event and "Close Ticket" as the last. The resolution time would be the difference between the timestamp of the last event and the first event for each case.

Let me list out each case with their start and end times and calculate the duration.

Starting with Case 101:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
- End: 2024-03-01 10:15
Calculating the duration: From 08:00 to 10:15 is 2 hours and 15 minutes, which is 2.25 hours.

Case 102:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
- End: 2024-03-02 09:15
That's from March 1st to March 2nd. Let's break it down. From 08:05 to 24:00 on the 1st is 15 hours 55 minutes. Then from 00:00 to 09:15 on the 2nd is 9 hours 15 minutes. Total is 15h55m +9h15m = 25 hours 10 minutes. Wait, let me check again. Wait, actually, from 08:05 to 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes? Wait, 24:00 minus 8:05 is 15h55m. Then adding 9h15m gives 25h10m total. That's 25.166... hours.

Case 103:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
- End: 2024-03-01 09:30
That's 1 hour 20 minutes, which is 1.333 hours.

Case 104:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
- End: 2024-03-02 08:30
So from March 1st 08:20 to March 2nd 08:30. The time between is 24 hours minus 8h20m plus 8h30m. Wait, let's compute it step by step. From 08:20 to 24:00 is 15h40m. Then from 00:00 to 08:30 is 8h30m. Total is 15h40m +8h30m =24h10m, which is 24.166 hours.

Case 105:
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
- End: 2024-03-03 09:30
This spans three days. Let's calculate. From 08:25 on the 1st to 08:25 on the 2nd is 24 hours. Then from 08:25 to 09:30 on the 3rd is 1 hour 5 minutes. Wait, actually, from March 1st 08:25 to March 2nd 08:25 is exactly 24h. Then from March 2nd 08:25 to March 3rd 09:30 is 24h + 1h5m? Wait no. Let me do it properly:

From 08:25 on 1st to 24:00 on 1st: 15h35m (since 24:00 - 08:25 is 15h35m). Then from 00:00 to 24:00 on 2nd is 24h. Then from 00:00 to 09:30 on 3rd is 9h30m. Wait, no, the end time is March 3rd 09:30. So total duration is:

Start: 2024-03-01 08:25

End: 2024-03-03 09:30

So total days between 1st and 3rd is 2 days. But let's compute in hours:

From 08:25 on day 1 to 08:25 on day 2 is 24h. Then from 08:25 day2 to 08:25 day3 is another 24h. But the end is at 09:30 on day3. So from day2 08:25 to day3 09:30 is 25h5m. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the total hours between the two timestamps.

Alternatively, converting all to minutes since a reference point. Let's see:

Case 105 start: March 1, 8:25 AM. Let's assume all dates are in March 2024 for simplicity.

Start time in minutes since midnight of March 1: 8*60 +25 = 505 minutes.

End time is March 3, 9:30 AM. So that's 2 days and 1 hour 5 minutes. 2 days is 48 hours, plus 1h5m = 49h5m. But since start was at 505 minutes (8:25), the end is 2 days later plus 9h30m.

Alternatively, total hours between start and end:

From 2024-03-01 08:25 to 2024-03-03 09:30.

Total days difference: 2 days (from 1 to 3). The time on the start day is 08:25, end day is 09:30. So the total time is 2 days + (09:30 - 08:25) = 2 days + 1 hour 5 minutes. But since 2 days is 48 hours, total is 49 hours 5 minutes. To convert that to hours, 49 + 5/60 49.083 hours.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute each case's duration precisely:

Let me do each case one by one with exact time differences.

Case 101:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:00
End: 2024-03-01 10:15
Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes = 2.25 hours.

Case 102:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:05
End: 2024-03-02 09:15

First day (March 1) from 08:05 to 24:00 is 15h55m (since 24:00 - 08:05 = 15h55m). Then from 00:00 to 09:15 on March 2 is 9h15m. Total: 15h55m +9h15m =25h10m. 25 +10/60 25.1667 hours.

Case 103:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:10
End: 2024-03-01 09:30  1h20m =1.333 hours.

Case 104:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:20
End: 2024-03-02 08:30

From March1 08:20 to March2 08:20 is 24h. Then add 10 minutes (since end is 08:30). So total 24h10m =24.1667 hours.

Case 105:
Start: 2024-03-01 08:25
End: 2024-03-03 09:30

From March1 08:25 to March2 08:25 is 24h. Then from March2 08:25 to March3 08:25 is another 24h. Then from March3 08:25 to 09:30 is 1h5m. So total is 24 +24 +1.0833 49.0833 hours. Alternatively:

Calculating in minutes:

Start time: 8h25m = (8*60)+25 = 505 minutes since start of day 1.

End time: March3 is two days later. So total days difference is 2 days, which is 2*1440 minutes (since 24*60=1440). Then the end time on day3 is 9h30m = 570 minutes. So total minutes from start:

2 days = 2880 minutes. Then from start time (505 min) to end time (570 min on day3):

Wait, actually, the end time is on day3, so:

Total time = (2 days * 1440) + (end_time - start_time of day1)

Wait maybe better to compute as:

Total duration in days:

From March1 08:25 to March3 09:30 is 2 days and 1 hour 5 minutes. So 2 days is 48 hours, plus 1h5m =49h5m. Converting to hours: 49 +5/60 49.0833 hours.

So compiling all durations:

Case | Duration (hours)
101: 2.25
102: ~25.1667
103: ~1.333
104: ~24.1667
105: ~49.0833

Now, to find which are significantly longer than average. Let's compute the average.

First sum all durations:

2.25 +25.1667 +1.333 +24.1667 +49.0833

Let's add step by step:

2.25 +25.1667 =27.4167

27.4167 +1.333 28.7497

28.7497 +24.1667 52.9164

52.9164 +49.0833 102.0 hours total.

Average = 102 /5 20.4 hours.

Now, looking at each case's duration compared to the average of ~20.4 hours:

Case 101: 2.25  much shorter

Case 102:25.17  slightly above average (about 4.7 hours more)

Case 103:1.33  much shorter

Case 104:24.17  about 3.8 hours above average

Case 105:49.08  way above, nearly double the average.

So clearly, Case 105 is the outlier with ~49 hours, and Cases 102 and 104 are also above average but not as extreme. The problem mentions "significantly longer", so probably Cases 102,104,105 are candidates, but especially 105 is the worst.

Now, the next part is to determine potential root causes. The user says to consider factors like escalations, long waiting times between activities, unnecessary delays before investigation/resolution, etc.

Looking at each case's event logs to see their timelines and steps:

Starting with Case 105, which took the longest. Let's look at its events:

Case 105:

2024-03-01 08:25 Receive
08:35 Triage
09:00 Assign to L1
09:10 Investigate
10:00 Escalate to L2
Then next event is 2024-03-02 14:00 Investigate again
Then 2024-03-03 09:00 Resolve, then close.

So between the initial investigation on 2024-03-01 09:10 and the next event on 2024-03-02 14:00 (which is also "Investigate Issue") there's a gap. Let's calculate the time between events here:

From 09:10 on the 1st to 14:00 on the 2nd.

That's 24h -9h10m =14h50m, plus 14h? Wait, from 09:10 to 24:00 on the 1st is 14h50m. Then from 00:00 to 14:00 on the 2nd is 14h. Total time between those two investigate steps is 14h50m +14h =28h50m? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the time between 09:10 on day1 and 14:00 on day2 is:

From 09:10 to 24:00 on day1: 24:00 -09:10 =14h50m

Then from 00:00 to 14:00 on day2 is 14h.

Total is 14h50m +14h =28h50m. That's almost 29 hours between the initial investigation and resuming investigation after escalation. That's a huge gap. Why would there be such a long delay after escalating?

Looking at the events, after the escalation on 2024-03-01 10:00, the next event is on 2024-03-02 14:00 again "Investigate Issue". So the escalation happened, but then there's a long delay before investigation resumes. Maybe the Level 2 agent took a long time to pick up the ticket after escalation? Or perhaps there was a waiting period for the Level 2 team to become available?

Alternatively, maybe after escalation, the investigation needed to be done by Level 2, but there was a delay in their response. The time between the escalation and the next investigate step is over a day. That seems like a significant bottleneck.

Additionally, the total time for Case 105 is almost 49 hours, mostly because of that gap between March 1st and 2nd. Let's check the timeline again:

From receiving to escalation: 2024-03-01 08:25 to 10:00 is about 1.75 hours. Then after escalation, the next activity is on the 2nd, which is two days later? Wait no, the next event after escalation is on the same day? Wait, no, the escalation is on 2024-03-01 10:00, then the next event is 2024-03-02 14:00. So that's a 28-hour gap between escalation and next investigation. That's a long time. So the escalation didn't immediately trigger action; perhaps the Level 2 team was unavailable, or the ticket was in a queue for a long time before someone picked it up.

Looking at Case 102, which took ~25 hours. Let's see its events:

Case 102:

2024-03-01 08:05 Receive
08:30 Triage
09:00 Assign L1
11:30 Escalate to L2
14:00 Investigate (L2?)
Then next event is 2024-03-02 09:00 Resolve, then close.

Wait, the events after escalation:

After Escalate on 11:30 March 1, the next event is "Investigate Issue" on 14:00 same day (March 1). That's about 2.5 hours later. Then from 14:00 to resolve on March 2 09:00 is about 18.5 hours. Hmm. So the investigation after escalation took until the next day to resolve. Maybe the Level 2 investigation took time, but the time between escalate and investigate was short. The main delay here might be in the investigation phase itself taking almost 19 hours? Or maybe after investigation, the resolution was quick but took until the next day.

Wait, the timeline:

From Escalate (11:30) to Investigate (14:00) is 2.5 hours. Then Investigate to Resolve is from 14:00 March1 to 09:00 March2. That's 18h 60m? Wait 14:00 to 24:00 is 10h, plus 9h on the next day is 19h. So 19 hours between investigate and resolve. That's a long time for resolution after investigation. Maybe the actual problem took time to resolve, but perhaps there was a delay in moving to resolution after investigation? Or maybe the Level 2 agent took a long time to work on it.

Alternatively, maybe after investigation, they had to wait for something else, but the next step is resolve, so perhaps the resolution step itself took that time. However, 19 hours seems long for a resolution step unless it's a complex issue. But compared to other cases, like Case 101, which resolved quickly after investigation.

Looking at Case 104, which took ~24.17 hours. Let's check its events:

Case 104:

2024-03-01 08:20 Receive
09:00 Triage
09:30 Assign L1
13:00 Investigate
Then next event is 2024-03-02 08:00 Resolve, then close.

So the timeline:

From Assign (09:30) to Investigate (13:00) is 3.5 hours. Then Investigate to Resolve is from 13:00 on March1 to 08:00 on March2. That's 19 hours (from 13:00 to 24:00 is 11h, plus 8h next day is 19h). Again, similar to Case 102, a long time between investigation and resolution. So maybe the investigation phase is quick, but resolution is delayed? Or perhaps the time between investigation and resolution is when they are waiting for a fix or something external?

Alternatively, maybe after investigation, they need to implement a fix which takes time, but in other cases like 101, that step was much shorter. For example, Case 101's Investigate (09:00) to Resolve (10:00) is 1 hour. So why in 104 and 102 it's taking 19 hours?

Possible factors:

1. Escalation leading to delays: In Case 105, the escalation caused a long wait before investigation resumed. In 102, the escalation didn't cause a long wait before investigation, but the time from investigation to resolution was long. Maybe when escalated, the Level 2 team takes longer to resolve? Or maybe the initial assignment to L1 takes time, but in 101, L1 handled it quickly.

2. Delays between steps: For example, in Case 105, after the initial investigation (09:10), they escalated at 10:00, but then the next investigation by L2 didn't happen until the next day. That's a huge gap. Why? Maybe L2 wasn't available, or the ticket wasn't assigned to an agent promptly after escalation. Escalation might require manual handoff, and if the L2 team is overloaded, it could take time.

3. Time between Investigation and Resolution: In Cases 102 and 104, the time from when investigation starts to when it's resolved is very long. This might indicate that the investigation phase is taking too long, or that after investigation, there's a delay in proceeding to resolution. For instance, maybe they need approval or some external process that's slow.

4. Overall process flow differences: Let's compare with the fastest case, Case 103:

Case 103:

08:10 Receive

08:15 Triage

08:30 Assign L1

08:45 Investigate

09:15 Resolve

09:30 Close

So from Assign to Investigate is 15 minutes, then Investigate to Resolve is 30 minutes. Very quick. So L1 agents are handling it efficiently. In contrast, Cases 102,104,105 had escalations or longer investigation phases.

Another point: Cases that didn't escalate (like 101 and 103) had shorter durations. Case 101 took 2.25 hours, 103 took 1.33 hours. The escalated cases (102,105) took much longer. Case 104 didn't escalate but still took longer. Wait, Case 104 didn't escalate. Let me check:

Looking at Case 104's events:

No Escalate activity. The steps are Receive, Triage, Assign L1, Investigate, then Resolve. So no escalation. So why did it take ~24 hours? Because the time from Investigate (13:00) to Resolve (next day 08:00) is 19 hours. So maybe the investigation phase itself took a long time? Or perhaps after investigation, there was a delay in moving to resolution. Maybe the L1 agent couldn't resolve it quickly and had to wait for something, but the process didn't escalate.

Alternatively, perhaps the investigation step in Case 104 was prolonged. Let's see the time between Assign and Investigate: Assign at 09:30, Investigate at 13:00, so 3.5 hours. That's longer than Case 101 (which was Assign at 08:20, Investigate at 09:00  40 minutes). So maybe in Case 104, the L1 agent took longer to investigate before deciding to resolve? Or maybe they needed more time, but even so, the time from investigate to resolve is way too long.

Possible root causes:

- Escalations introduce delays, especially if the higher-level team is slow to respond or the handoff isn't efficient. In Case 105, after escalation, the next investigation was two days later, suggesting a major bottleneck in L2's availability or process.

- For non-escalated cases like 104, the delay between investigation and resolution might be due to L1 agents needing more time to resolve complex issues without escalating, leading to longer cycles. But why didn't they escalate if it was taking too long? Maybe they didn't recognize the need, or the escalation process itself is not triggered automatically.

- General delays between certain steps: For example, between receiving and triage, triage and assignment, etc. But looking at the data:

Looking at the time between steps for all cases:

Case 101:

Receive (08:00) to Triage (08:10): 10 mins

Triage to Assign (08:20): 10 mins

Assign to Investigate (09:00): 40 mins

Investigate to Resolve (10:00): 60 mins

Resolve to Close (10:15): 15 mins

Total steps are quick, no big gaps.

Case 102:

Receive (08:05) to Triage (08:30): 25 mins

Triage to Assign (09:00): 30 mins

Assign to Escalate (11:30): 2h30m

Escalate to Investigate (14:00): 2h30m

Investigate to Resolve (next day 09:00): from 14:00 to 09:00 next day is 19h

Resolve to Close: 15 mins

The big gaps here are between Assign and Escalate (2.5h), and then Investigate to Resolve (19h). The escalation itself wasn't the issue, but the time after investigation.

Case 103 is very tight, all steps within an hour or so.

Case 104:

Receive (08:20) to Triage (09:00): 40 mins

Triage to Assign (09:30): 30 mins

Assign to Investigate (13:00): 3h30m

Investigate to Resolve (next day 08:00): ~19h

Resolve to Close: 30 mins

So the big gap here is between Assign and Investigate (3.5h), and then Investigate to Resolve (19h). Why did it take 3.5h after assignment to start investigating? Maybe the agent was busy, or the ticket wasn't picked up promptly. Then the investigation to resolution is again 19h, similar to Case 102.

Case 105:

Receive to Triage: 10 mins (08:25 to 08:35)

Triage to Assign: 25 mins (08:35 to 09:00)

Assign to Investigate: 10 mins (09:00 to 09:10)

Investigate to Escalate: 50 mins (09:10 to 10:00)

Escalate to next Investigate (on next day 14:00): 28h50m

Then Investigate to Resolve: from 14:00 to 09:00 next day (March3) is 19h

Resolve to Close: 30 mins

So the massive gap is after escalation, between 10:00 on March1 and 14:00 on March2. That's over a day. This seems like the main issue for Case 105. Why was there such a long delay after escalation?

Possible reasons for escalation delay in 105:

- The Level 2 team was not available or had a backlog, so the ticket sat in a queue for a long time before being picked up.

- The escalation process itself is slow; maybe they have to manually assign it to L2, and it took time for someone to take it.

- The L2 team requires more information or steps that caused a delay before they could proceed with investigation.

Other factors:

- The time between receiving and initial triage/assignment is generally quick in all cases except maybe some minor variations, so that's not the main issue.

- The presence of escalation in Cases 102 and 105 correlates with longer times, but Case 104 didn't escalate and still had a long duration. So escalations are a factor but not the only one.

Looking at the investigation to resolution time in non-escalated cases:

Case 101: 1 hour from investigate to resolve.

Case 104: 19 hours. That's a huge difference. Why? Maybe the issue in Case 104 was more complex, but since it didn't escalate, perhaps the L1 agent struggled to resolve it without escalation, leading to a long investigation phase or waiting for something.

Possible systemic issues:

1. **Escalation Handling Delays**: When tickets are escalated, there's a significant delay before the next step (investigation by L2). In Case 105, this delay was over 28 hours. This could be due to L2 team's capacity, prioritization, or process inefficiencies in handing off escalated tickets.

2. **Investigation to Resolution Time**: In Cases 102 and 104, the time from when investigation starts to when it's resolved is very long (19 hours). This might indicate that either the investigation phase is taking too long (e.g., needing more thorough analysis) or there's a bottleneck in moving from investigation to resolution, such as needing approvals, waiting for other teams, or the agent taking time to document and resolve.

3. **Assignment to Investigation Delay**: In Case 104, after assignment to L1, it took 3.5 hours to start investigating. This suggests that agents might be handling multiple tickets or not prioritizing promptly. If agents are overloaded, they might delay starting work on a ticket after assignment.

4. **Lack of Escalation in Some Long Cases**: Case 104 didn't escalate but still took long. This might mean that the criteria for escalation aren't clear, or agents don't escalate even when stuck, leading to prolonged investigation times by L1 who may not have the expertise.

5. **Variability in Agent Efficiency**: Comparing Cases 101 and 103, which were handled quickly by L1, versus 102,104,105 which had longer times. This suggests inconsistency in L1 agents' efficiency or workload.

Recommendations:

1. **Improve Escalation Process**: Ensure that when a ticket is escalated, it is promptly assigned to an L2 agent. Maybe implement an automated assignment or a priority queue for escalated tickets to reduce the handoff time. Monitor the L2 team's capacity and consider adding resources if they are overwhelmed.

2. **Reduce Investigation to Resolution Time**: Analyze why investigation takes so long before resolution. Is it because agents need more time to implement fixes? If so, maybe provide better tools or training. If it's waiting for something else (like a third-party response), establish SLAs with those teams. For non-escalated cases like 104, ensure that agents escalate sooner if they can't resolve within a reasonable time.

3. **Monitor Agent Workloads and Assignment Delays**: If L1 agents are taking too long to start investigating after assignment (like in Case 104's 3.5h delay), check their current workload. Maybe they have too many tickets assigned at once. Implement a system to balance assignments or set maximum ticket limits per agent.

4. **Standardize Escalation Criteria**: Create clear guidelines for when to escalate, so that agents don't hesitate to escalate complex issues, preventing prolonged L1 investigation times. For example, if an issue can't be resolved within X hours, it should be escalated.

5. **Process Automation**: Automate routine steps (like triage or assignment) to reduce manual delays. For instance, auto-assign tickets based on category after triage, instead of manual assignment which might have delays.

6. **Data-Driven Insights**: Use the event logs to identify stages where delays commonly occur. For example, if investigation-to-resolution is a bottleneck, focus on that phase. Set up alerts for tickets exceeding certain time thresholds in specific stages.

7. **Training and Resources**: Provide additional training to L1 agents on common issues or tools to resolve them faster. If L2 agents are slow, assess their training or provide more resources.

In summary, the main issues are delays post-escalation, prolonged investigation phases before resolution, and possible inefficiencies in agent task handling. Addressing these through process improvements, better resource allocation, and clearer escalation protocols could reduce resolution times.

### Analysis of Customer Support Ticket Resolution Delays

#### **1. Identification of Long-Resolution Cases**
Based on total resolution times calculated from the event logs:
- **Case 101**: 2.25 hours (shortest, baseline efficiency).
- **Case 102**: ~25.17 hours (above average by ~5 hours).
- **Case 103**: ~1.33 hours (shortest, highly efficient).
- **Case 104**: ~24.17 hours (above average by ~4 hours).
- **Case 105**: ~49.08 hours (**extremely delayed**, over twice the average).

**Key outliers**:  
- **Case 105** is the most critical, with a resolution time **21x longer than Case 103** and **double the average**.  
- **Cases 102 and 104** also exceed the average by significant margins, indicating systemic issues.

---

#### **2. Root Causes of Delays**
**A. Escalation-Related Delays (Case 105)**  
- **Critical Gap**: After escalation to Level-2 on **2024-03-01 10:00**, the next activity ("Investigate Issue") occurred **28.5 hours later** (on **2024-03-02 14:00**).  
  - **Possible Causes**:  
    - **L2 Team Bottleneck**: The ticket may have been stuck in a queue due to L2 agent unavailability or high workload.  
    - **Manual Handoff Inefficiency**: Escalation might require manual reassignment, leading to delays if L2 agents are not promptly notified.  
    - **Lack of Priority for Escalated Tickets**: Escalated cases may not be prioritized, causing them to languish.  

**B. Prolonged Investigation-to-Resolution Time (Cases 102, 104, 105)**  
- **Case 102**: 19 hours between "Investigate Issue" (2024-03-01 14:00) and "Resolve Ticket" (2024-03-02 09:00).  
- **Case 104**: 19 hours between "Investigate Issue" (2024-03-01 13:00) and "Resolve Ticket" (2024-03-02 08:00).  
  - **Possible Causes**:  
    - **Complex Issues**: Agents may spend excessive time troubleshooting without escalating.  
    - **Process Inefficiencies**: Delays in post-investigation steps (e.g., awaiting approvals, documentation, or external dependencies).  
    - **L1 Agent Capacity**: Agents might handle multiple tickets simultaneously, slowing resolution.  

**C. Assignment-to-Investigation Delays (Case 104)**  
- After assignment to Level-1 on **2024-03-01 09:30**, investigation began **3.5 hours later** (at 13:00).  
  - **Possible Cause**: Agent workload imbalance or delayed task pickup.  

**D. Non-Escalation in Prolonged Cases (Case 104)**  
- Despite a 19-hour investigation-to-resolution gap, no escalation occurred.  
  - **Possible Cause**: Lack of clear escalation criteria or reluctance to escalate, leading to L1 agents struggling with unresolved issues.

#### **3. Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**
**A. Optimize Escalation Workflow**  
1. **Automated Escalation Routing**: Implement an automated system to instantly assign escalated tickets to Level-2 agents, reducing handoff delays.  
2. **Priority Queues for Escalated Tickets**: Ensure Level-2 treats escalated cases as high-priority to avoid backlog.  
3. **Monitor L2 Capacity**: Track L2 agent workload and adjust staffing during peak times.  

**B. Reduce Investigation-to-Resolution Time**  
1. **Set Time Limits for Investigation**: Define thresholds (e.g., 2 hours) after which unresolved cases must escalate.  
2. **Streamline Post-Investigation Steps**:  
   - Automate approvals or notifications for common resolutions.  
   - Provide tools/resources to accelerate fixes (e.g., pre-approved scripts, access to diagnostic tools).  
3. **Cross-Train Agents**: Enable Level-1 agents to handle more complex issues, reducing reliance on slow escalation paths.  

**C. Improve Task Assignment and Monitoring**  
1. **Real-Time Agent Availability Tracking**: Assign tickets to agents based on current workload to prevent delays (e.g., Case 104’s 3.5-hour lag).  
2. **Alerts for Stalled Tickets**: Trigger notifications if a ticket remains in "Investigate Issue" or "Resolve Ticket" for unusually long periods.  

**D. Clarify Escalation Criteria**  
- **Define Clear Rules**: Escalate if investigation exceeds X hours, or if the issue requires specialized expertise.  
- **Encourage Proactive Escalation**: Train agents to escalate early rather than letting L1 investigations drag on.  

**E. Process Automation**  
- Automate routine steps (e.g., triage, assignment) to minimize manual delays.  
- Use AI to prioritize tickets based on complexity or customer impact.  

**F. Performance Metrics and Feedback**  
- Track key metrics (e.g., time per investigation phase, escalation frequency).  
- Conduct root-cause analysis for delayed cases and provide agent feedback.

### **Conclusion**
The delays stem primarily from **escalation handling inefficiencies** (Case 105), **prolonged investigation phases**, and **inconsistent agent workflows**. By automating escalations, enforcing time limits on investigation, and improving task prioritization, the average resolution time can be reduced. Addressing these issues will enhance efficiency and reduce customer wait times.
