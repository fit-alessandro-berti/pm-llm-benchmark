- The figure is a time-based event flow chart with three horizontal lanes labeled (top to bottom): “Send Fine,” “Insert Fine Notification,” and “Send for Credit Collection.”
- Each thin vertical mark in the top two lanes represents an occurrence of that event over time. The dense forest of grey lines in the top lane shows that “Send Fine” happens very frequently across the entire time span.
- The bottom lane shows slanted connections (light red lines) that link an “Insert Fine Notification” event to a later “Send for Credit Collection” event. The long, downward diagonals indicate the delay between those two steps; many lines suggest many cases progressing to collections, with varying lag times.
- The xaxis runs from 2000-01-25 to 2013-04-24, showing when events occurred. Overall, the plot visualizes the volume and timing of fines being sent, notifications inserted, and which of those ultimately go to credit collection, along with the elapsed time between notification and collection.
