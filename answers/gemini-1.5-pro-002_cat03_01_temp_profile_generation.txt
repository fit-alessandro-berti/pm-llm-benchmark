This temporal profile models a plausible Purchase-to-Pay process:

* **Times are in seconds.** This is common practice for event log data.
* **Realistic durations.**  The average times between activities reflect typical durations for these steps. For instance, goods receipt might take a week on average, while invoice approval could be quicker.
* **Standard deviations represent variability.** The standard deviations account for the fact that process execution times can fluctuate.  Larger standard deviations indicate more variability.
* **Includes direct and some indirect relationships.**  The profile includes not just directly following activities (like "Create PO" to "Goods Receipt") but also indirect relationships like  "Create Purchase Requisition" to "Payment," reflecting the overall lead time. You'd want to add more of these indirect relationships for a complete profile.


**Key improvements over simpler approaches:**

* **More Realistic:**  Using seconds and considering standard deviation makes the profile more aligned with real-world processes.
* **Deviation Detection:**  The inclusion of standard deviation enables the detection of deviations based on the `ZETA` parameter, allowing for more nuanced analysis.
* **Flexibility:** You can easily adjust the average times and standard deviations to fit specific Purchase-to-Pay process variations.



To use this profile for deviation detection, you'd calculate `AVG - ZETA * STDEV` and `AVG + ZETA * STDEV` for each activity pair and then compare the observed time in a process execution against these thresholds.  If the observed time falls outside the range, it's flagged as a deviation.
