The initial model needs to be augmented with constraints that introduce required intermediate steps or co-occurring mandatory checks when sensitive paths are involved, thereby enforcing procedural fairness.

We will define the following hypothetical activities to represent steps involving sensitive data and fairness checks:
*   **Sensitive Decision Activities:** `Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Minority`
*   **Fairness Check Activity:** `BiasMitigationCheck`
*   **Sensitive Data Collection:** `CheckApplicantRace`

Here is the updated model incorporating bias mitigation constraints:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Added existence for new fairness activities
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New Constraint 1: Coexistence - Sensitive decisions MUST trigger a formal review check.
        "Reject_Minority": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "Approve_Minority": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New Constraint 2: Response - If race is checked, a mitigation check MUST follow.
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    # New Constraint 3: Non-Succession - Prevent immediate rejection after sensitive data gathering without mitigation.
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints

The following constraints were added to the original model to mitigate potential bias related to sensitive applicant attributes:

1.  **Coexistence:**
    *   **Constraint:** `Reject_Minority` must coexist with `BiasMitigationCheck`.
    *   **Constraint:** `Approve_Minority` must coexist with `BiasMitigationCheck`.
    *   **Rationale:** This enforces that any time a decision (Accept or Reject) is made specifically considering a sensitive attribute (indicated by the suffix `_Minority`), a mandatory `BiasMitigationCheck` must be present in the overall trace. This ensures that these high-risk decisions are always accompanied by a required fairness audit step.

2.  **Response:**
    *   **Constraint:** `CheckApplicantRace` must be followed by `BiasMitigationCheck` (Response).
    *   **Rationale:** This enforces a strict ordering. If the process involves explicitly gathering or checking the applicant's race, the very next necessary step *must* be the bias mitigation check, ensuring that the sensitive information immediately triggers the required fairness review.

3.  **Non-Succession:**
    *   **Constraint:** `CheckApplicantRace` cannot immediately precede `Reject_Minority` (No immediate succession).
    *   **Rationale:** This prevents the most direct form of observable bias: immediately rejecting an applicant right after their race attribute is checked. By forbidding the direct sequence, the process is forced to include intermediate steps (like the required `BiasMitigationCheck` from constraint 2) between the attribute check and the final negative decision.
