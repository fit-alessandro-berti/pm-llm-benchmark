From the data provided, it's not possible to pinpoint exact root causes without more context and analysis. However, based on the frequencies and performances of the process variants, here are some potential data-driven considerations for further investigation:

1. Variants with higher frequency but lower performance might indicate bottlenecks in those specific process stages. For example, the first variant (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) has a higher frequency but lower performance compared to the second variant (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled). Analyzing the reasons for these discrepancies could help identify bottlenecks.
2. Variants with lower frequency but significantly higher performance might indicate inefficiencies in the processes with higher frequency. For example, the last variant (Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled) has a lower frequency but significantly higher performance than the first variant. Understanding why this variant is less frequently used but more efficient could provide insights for process improvements.
3. Variants with a high number of rejections might indicate issues with the quality of the declarations submitted by employees. Analyzing the reasons for rejections could help identify potential training needs or process improvements.
4. Variants with a high number of savings might indicate opportunities for process automation or digital transformation. For example, if the Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE variant has a high frequency but low performance, investigating the reasons for this and exploring ways to automate the saving process could improve efficiency.
5. Variants with high frequencies and significant variations in performance might indicate unpredictability in the process. Analyzing the reasons for these variations could help identify potential causes and develop strategies for improving consistency.

Again, these are just potential data-driven considerations based on the provided data. A comprehensive analysis would require more context, including the specific goals and constraints of the process, the available resources, and the specific technologies and tools being used.
