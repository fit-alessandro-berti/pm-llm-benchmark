The main differences between the treatment of the protected group and the unprotected group in the provided process variants are as follows:

  1. The protected group has more process variants than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has 38 process variants, while the unprotected group has 22 process variants.
  2. The protected group has a higher frequency of process variants than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has a frequency of 1036 for the "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property" process variant, while the unprotected group has a frequency of 2490 for the "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property" process variant.
  3. The protected group has a higher performance than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has a performance of 270000.477 for the "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Reject Prospective Tenant" process variant, while the unprotected group has a performance of 400004.640 for the "Apply for Viewing Appointment -> Set Appointment -> View The Property -> Hand In The Paperwork -> Check Paperwork -> Screen Prospective Tenant -> Reject Prospective Tenant" process variant.
  4. The protected group has more process variants with extensive screening than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has 14 process variants with extensive screening, while the unprotected group has only 4 process variants with extensive screening.
  5. The protected group has more process variants with a higher frequency than the unprotected group. For example, the protected group has 10 process variants with a frequency of 1000 or more, while the unprotected group has only 3 process variants with a frequency of 1000 or more.

Overall, the protected group appears to have more complex and extensive process variants than the unprotected group, with a higher frequency and performance.
