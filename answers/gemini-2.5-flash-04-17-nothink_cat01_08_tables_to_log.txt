**Assumptions Made:**

*   Each row in the `Order Lines` table represents a distinct "Item Picked" event, even if items for the same order are picked by different people or at slightly different times.
*   Each row in the `Delivery` table represents a distinct "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" event. If an order is delivered in multiple shipments, there will be multiple dispatch and arrival events.
*   Each row in the `Invoice` table represents a distinct "Invoice Issued" event. If an order is invoiced in multiple parts, there will be multiple invoice events.
*   Each row in the `Payments` table represents a distinct "Payment Received" event. If an invoice is paid in multiple installments, there will be multiple payment events.
*   For "Payment Received" events, the "Resource/Actor" is not explicitly provided in the `Payments` table, so it is marked as "None".
*   For events linked to deliveries (Dispatched, Arrived), the "Resource/Actor" is inferred from the `carrier_id`.
*   The chronological order of events within each case is determined by the timestamps provided in the respective tables. Where timestamps are very close, the order is based on the table and processing order (Orders -> Order Lines -> Delivery -> Invoice -> Payments).
*   Order 1004 has not yet reached the delivery, invoicing, or payment stages based on the provided data. The event log reflects the stages for which data is available.
*   The 'Other Attributes' column includes relevant identifiers and details from the source tables to provide context for each event.
