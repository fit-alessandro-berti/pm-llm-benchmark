### 1. **Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

**1.1 Analysis of Instance-Spanning Constraints Using Event Logs and Process Mining**  
Using the event log data, process mining techniques can be employed to identify and measure the impact of instance-spanning constraints:

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations**:  
  Use process mining tools to create resource heatmaps or bottleneck analyses to identify contention points. Events involving the cold-packing stations (resource IDs like `C1` and `C2`) can be filtered to evaluate how frequently multiple orders compete for these resources.  
   Impact measurement: Average waiting time for cold-packing resources, number of instances in queue, and idle time when cold-packing stations are not utilized due to sequencing issues.  

- **Batching for Shipping**:  
  Trace the group formation activities (e.g., "Shipping Label Generation," with batched orders identified by a common `Batch ID` such as `B1`). Quantify the waiting time for orders that are ready but delayed due to incomplete batch formation.  
   Impact measurement: Batch completion time, average number of orders waiting for batch formation, and time discrepancy between when the first and last orders in a batch are "ready to ship."

- **Priority Order Handling (Express Orders)**:
  Analyze how express orders influence resource allocation and flow interruptions. Apply timestamp comparisons to identify when standard orders are paused due to the arrival of express orders at shared stations (e.g., packing).  
   Impact measurement: Delay caused to standard orders, idle resource time due to task switching, and service time variance between express and standard orders.

- **Regulatory Compliance for Hazardous Materials**:  
  Filter the event log for orders containing hazardous materials and analyze timestamps to find instances where more than 10 hazardous orders are active simultaneously in critical steps (Packing and Quality Check).  
   Impact measurement: Frequency and duration of safety violations, throughput reduction due to compliance efforts, and delay metrics based on shared constraints at these steps.

**1.2 Differentiating Waiting Times (Within-Instance vs. Between-Instance)**  
- **Within-Instance Factors**: Analyze activity durations (e.g., time between start and completion of "Item Picking" for ORD-5001). These metrics represent intrinsic inefficiencies in the task, not caused by external constraints.  
- **Between-Instance Factors**: Use process mining tools like process discovery models and conformance checking to identify activities where timestamps show delays attributable to waiting for shared resources (e.g., Cold-Packing) or batching dependencies. Overlay resource allocation data and order interdependencies to isolate between-instance impacts (e.g., express orders interrupting station usage).  

Metrics: Use end-to-end cycle time breakdowns and bottleneck visualization (e.g., Gantt charts) to separate delays caused by internal (activity-specific) vs. external (resource-sharing) factors.

### 2. **Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

- **Cold-Packing and Priority Handling**:  
  An express order requiring cold-packing disrupts standard orders queued for the same stations, causing cascading delays. For example, Station `C2` being used for ORD-5002 (express) could create a backlog for standard cold-pack orders, such as an order with early completion in other steps.  

- **Batching and Hazardous Materials Limit**:  
  If a batch includes several orders with hazardous materials destined for the same region, only 10 can proceed through packing or quality checks simultaneously. This creates unnecessary bottlenecks both upstream (waiting for batch formation) and at regulated activities like packing.  

- **Resource Contention Across Constraints**:  
  Express orders requiring specialized Cold-Packing stations simultaneously increase contention and reduce batch progression speeds for standard orders. As multiple constraints overlap, inefficiencies multiply—e.g., hazardous orders could delay standard or express orders awaiting allocation.  

**Why These Interactions Matter**:  
Understanding the ripple effects caused by overlapping constraints ensures targeted optimizations prevent unintended trade-offs elsewhere. For instance, adding more cold-packing capacity might ease the cold-packing queue but worsen express-order-induced interruptions in downstream activities.

### 3. **Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

**3.1 Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations**  
- **Primary Constraint Addressed**: Cold-Packing Stations, Priority Handling.  
- **Proposed Change**: Implement a dynamic scheduling and allocation policy powered by order priority. Use historical data to predict cold-packing station demand and preemptively allocate one station exclusively for express orders during peak periods.  
- **Data Dependency**: Predictive analytics based on time-series analysis of cold-packing demand by order type (express vs. standard) and peak periods.  
- **Expected Outcome**: Decreased waiting time for cold-packing, reduced interruptions to standard orders by isolating resource usage for express orders.  

---

**3.2 Strategy 2: Adaptive Batching Criteria Based on Real-Time Data**  
- **Primary Constraint Addressed**: Batching for Shipping, Hazardous Material Limits.  
- **Proposed Change**: Redesign shipping batch triggers to be dynamically based on waiting time thresholds rather than static geographic thresholds. Additionally, track hazardous orders at batch formation to limit their clustering in downstream activities.  
- **Data Dependency**: Real-time order monitoring tools to identify when orders are delayed beyond acceptable limits, and FIFO batching logic that avoids over-representation of hazardous orders in any one batch.  
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster batch release times with compliance maintained, reduced end-to-end cycle times.  

---

**3.3 Strategy 3: Concurrent Process Decoupling**  
- **Primary Constraint Addressed**: Hazardous Material Limits, Priority Handling.  
- **Proposed Change**: Adjust process flow design to decouple hazardous order processing during peak times by scheduling Quality Checks (hazardous) outside of peak packing hours. Introduce dedicated hazardous-only processing windows leveraging idle resource capacity during non-peak times.  
- **Data Dependency**: Process simulation models to predict throughput under alternate scheduling scenarios and validate compliance.   
- **Expected Outcome**: Smoother flow despite regulatory constraints with no throughput reduction.

### 4. **Simulation and Validation**

Process simulation enables testing the proposed strategies without disrupting live operations by creating a digital twin of the fulfillment process with constraints coded into the simulation logic.

1. **Setup**: Use historical event log data to build a simulation model that accurately reflects the observed process behavior, including resource contention, batching dependencies, and regulatory limits.  
2. **Metrics for Validation**:  
   - Cold-packing station utilization rates.  
   - End-to-end duration for express vs. standard orders.  
   - Waiting times for batch formation vs. total batch cycle times.  
   - Throughput under hazardous material constraints.  
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Simulate alternate configurations for batch triggers (e.g., reduced batch sizes), resource allocation (e.g., isolating specific cold-packing stations for express orders), and scheduling shifts for hazardous materials.  

**Focus Areas**: Quantifying improvements in cycle time and throughput against a baseline (current state), ensuring compliance limits are not exceeded.

### 5. **Monitoring Post-Implementation**

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- **Cold-Packing Utilization**: Heatmaps of station usage, average queue length over time, and express order completion times.  
- **Batch Metrics**: Average batch formation time, number of 'idle' completed orders waiting for batching.  
- **Hazardous Materials Compliance**: Frequency of constraint violations, hazardous order throughput times.  
- **Standard vs. Express Order Flow**: Process duration discrepancies and variance in wait times.  

**Proposed Dashboards**:  
- **Resource Utilization Dashboard**: Real-time view of station queues and usage.  
- **Order Flow Dashboard**: Visualize batches waiting and order delays caused by batching dependencies.  
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Track hazardous material quantities processed simultaneously across critical steps.

**Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reevaluate constraints and process performance, leveraging event log augmentation (e.g., adding new attributes like predicted wait times) and process enhancement tools (what-if scenarios). This proactive monitoring ensures adaptive processes that align with evolving operational demands.
