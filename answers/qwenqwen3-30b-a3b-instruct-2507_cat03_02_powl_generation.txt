import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define individual activities (transitions)
SR = Transition(label="Service Request Verification")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup")
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization")
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure")
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment")
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit")
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval")

# Step 2: Create the loop structure: (BNC followed by optional DR), repeated until stable
# The loop is defined as: * (BNC, DR)  BNC is executed first, then optionally DR, then repeat
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 3: Create the exclusive choice: either CD or MD
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 4: Create the final partial order: QA and SA must both complete before GLA
# QA and SA can run concurrently; both must precede GLA
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA, GLA])
final_tasks.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
final_tasks.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Step 5: Assemble the full POWL model with partial order relations
# The full process:
# - SR  CS (mandatory sequence)
# - CS  (DA || ACI) (concurrent)
# - (DA and ACI)  loop_config (both must complete before loop)
# - loop_config  xor_deployment (loop ends before deployment)
# - xor_deployment  final_tasks (deployment done before final QA/SA/GLA)

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_config, xor_deployment, final_tasks])

# Add ordering constraints
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)  # SR must precede CS
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)  # CS before DA
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)  # CS before ACI
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)  # DA before loop
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)  # ACI before loop
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, xor_deployment)  # loop before deployment choice
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)  # deployment before QA
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)  # deployment before SA
# QA and SA are already linked to GLA in final_tasks, but we need to ensure xor_deployment  QA and SA
# This is already handled via the final_tasks partial order, but we must ensure xor_deployment is before both QA and SA
# Since final_tasks is a sub-POWL, we must link the root to it properly

# We need to ensure that the entire xor_deployment node is before both QA and SA
# Since QA and SA are part of final_tasks, and final_tasks is a child of root, we must add edges from xor_deployment to QA and SA
# But note: final_tasks is a separate StrictPartialOrder, so we need to ensure that xor_deployment is a predecessor of both QA and SA in the root's order

# Therefore, we add:
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, QA)
root.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, SA)

# Note: QA and SA are already ordered to GLA within final_tasks, so no further edges needed
# But we must ensure that the root includes all nodes: SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_config, xor_deployment, final_tasks

# However, final_tasks is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes QA, SA, GLA — so we must ensure the root includes it as a node
# This is already done: root.nodes includes final_tasks

# Final check: all dependencies are satisfied
# - SR  CS  DA, ACI  loop_config  xor_deployment  QA, SA  GLA
# - DA and ACI are concurrent (no edge between them)
# - QA and SA are concurrent and both before GLA (handled in final_tasks)
# - The loop and XOR are correctly nested

# The full model is now constructed and ready

# Optional: print the structure for verification
print("POWL Model constructed successfully with the following nodes:")
print([node.label if hasattr(node, 'label') else type(node).__name__ for node in root.nodes])

# Final model is `root`
# It can now be used in PM4Py for analysis, conformance checking, etc.

###  Summary of Key Features in the Model:

- **Sequential flow**: `SR  CS`  `DA` and `ACI` (concurrent).
- **Concurrent tasks**: `DA` and `ACI` have no ordering — they can run in parallel.
- **Loop structure**: `* (BNC, DR)` ensures that `BNC` is executed first, then optionally `DR`, repeating until stable.
- **Exclusive choice**: `XOR (CD, MD)` — only one deployment method is executed.
- **Partial order in final phase**:
  - `QA` and `SA` are concurrent.
  - Both must complete before `GLA`.
- **Final dependencies**:
  - `xor_deployment` must precede both `QA` and `SA`.
  - `GLA` is only possible after `QA` and `SA`.

This model accurately captures the **complex, partially ordered, looped, and choice-based** nature of the telecom corporate network provisioning process using the **POWL** formalism.
