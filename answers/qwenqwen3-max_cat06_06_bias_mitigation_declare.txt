### **Rationale for Added Constraints**

1. **Coexistence Constraints (e.g., `Approve_Minority` coexists with `ManualReview`)**  
   Ensures that whenever a decision is made for an applicant from a sensitive demographic group (e.g., racial minority, female, senior), a `ManualReview` is always performed. This prevents automated or unchecked biased decisions and enforces human oversight for fairness.

2. **Response Constraints (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace` responds to `BiasMitigationCheck`)**  
   Forces the system to trigger a `BiasMitigationCheck` whenever a sensitive attribute is accessed. This ensures that no decision logic proceeds without first activating a fairness safeguard.

3. **Precedence Constraints (e.g., `FinalDecision` must be preceded by `BiasMitigationCheck`)**  
   Guarantees that no final decision — whether `Approve` or `Reject` — can be made unless a bias mitigation step has occurred earlier in the trace. This creates a mandatory checkpoint to review for fairness before concluding.

4. **Succession Constraints (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck` must be succeeded by `Approve`/`Reject`/`RequestAdditionalInfo`)**  
   Ensures that once a bias mitigation step is taken, the process must continue to a meaningful next step — preventing the mitigation from being a token gesture and ensuring it directly influences downstream actions.

5. **Non-succession & Non-chain-succession Constraints (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace` cannot be directly succeeded by `Reject` or `Approve`)**  
   Blocks the most blatant forms of bias: making a decision immediately after viewing a sensitive attribute. This prevents “knee-jerk” biased rejections or approvals and forces intermediate deliberation or checks.

These constraints collectively enforce a “fairness-by-design” process model: sensitive attributes cannot directly trigger decisions, mitigation steps are mandatory, and oversight is required for protected groups. This reduces the risk of discriminatory outcomes in loan approvals while preserving process integrity.
