### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **`existence` of `ManualReview`**:  
   Guarantees that the `ManualReview` activity is present in every trace, establishing a baseline for human oversight—especially important for fairness-sensitive decisions.

2. **`coexistence` between sensitive decisions and `ManualReview`**:  
   Activities like `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, etc., represent outcomes for applicants from protected groups. Requiring coexistence with `ManualReview` ensures that such decisions are never made automatically without human review, reducing algorithmic bias.

3. **`response` from sensitive attribute checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`**:  
   Whenever a sensitive attribute (race, gender, age) is examined, the system must eventually perform a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This enforces a procedural safeguard that interrupts potential bias propagation.

4. **`succession` from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `FinalDecision`**:  
   Ensures that once a fairness check is performed, it leads to a final decision, preventing the check from being performed in vain and closing the fairness loop.

5. **`nonsuccession` from sensitive attribute checks to direct decisions (`Approve`/`Reject`)**:  
   Prohibits immediate transitions from reading sensitive attributes to making a final decision. This prevents "snap judgments" based on protected characteristics and forces intermediate fairness-aware steps (like `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`) to occur first.

Together, these constraints embed fairness-by-design into the process model: they do not eliminate the use of sensitive attributes (which may be needed for bias monitoring) but ensure that their presence triggers mandatory fairness safeguards before any consequential decision is made.
