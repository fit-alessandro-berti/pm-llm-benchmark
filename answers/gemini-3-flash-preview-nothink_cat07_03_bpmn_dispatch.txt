This image is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** documenting the process for the "Dispatch of goods" at a "Computer Hardware Shop."

The process is organized into three horizontal swimlanes representing different roles/departments: **Logistics**, **Secretary**, and **Warehouse**.

### Process Flow Overview

The process begins with a "Ship goods" start event, which immediately triggers a parallel gateway, splitting the workflow into two simultaneous paths.

#### 1. Warehouse Path (Bottom Lane)
*   The warehouse begins by **Packaging goods**.
*   **Timer Event:** There is a boundary timer set for **48 hours**. If the packaging takes longer than this, a sub-path is triggered to **Notify customer about delay**.
*   Once packaging is complete (and the delay notification is sent, if applicable), this path waits at a final parallel gateway to rejoin the other main branch.

#### 2. Secretary Path (Middle Lane)
*   The Secretary starts by **Clarifying the shipment method**, utilizing **Order details** (a data object) as input.
*   **Decision Point (Special Handling?):**
    *   **If Yes:** The Secretary must **Get 3 offers from logistic companies** and then **Select a logistic company and place order**.
    *   **If No:** The Secretary **Checks if insurance is required**, utilizing **Customer information** (a data store) as input.
*   **Insurance/Labeling Sub-process:** Following the insurance check, two things happen:
    *   **Always:** The Secretary will **Write package label**.
    *   **If insurance is necessary:** The process moves into the **Logistics lane** (Top) where a specialist will **Insure parcel**.
*   These sub-paths merge at an exclusive gateway before moving down to rejoin the warehouse path.

#### 3. Finalization (Warehouse Lane)
*   Once both the Secretary/Logistics tasks and the Warehouse packaging tasks are finished (meeting at the final parallel gateway), the final steps occur in the Warehouse:
*   The warehouse staff **Fill out shipment paperwork**.
*   Finally, they **Move package to pickup area**.

The process concludes with the **Shipment prepared** end event.
