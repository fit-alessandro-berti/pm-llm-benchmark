The visualization appears to be a flowchart representing a business process involving various order and invoice items. It outlines the sequence of steps in the process, with different paths for handling vendor invoices, return orders, purchase requisitions, sales orders, and purchase orders. 

**Key elements include:**

- **Start Points:** Each section begins with a 'Start' node, indicating the initiation of different processes.
- **Processes:** Several actions such as "Create Requisition," "Approve Requisition," "Send Order," "Check Stock," "Process Return," "Create Invoice," and others are detailed, with some showing overall metrics (e.g., the number of objects processed).
- **Timing Indicators:** Each step in the process includes time durations (in milliseconds), showing how long each action takes.
- **End Points:** Each pathway leads to an 'End' node, indicating the completion of various processes.

The chart illustrates complexity in the flow of processes related to order management, approvals, and invoicing, helping visualize the relationships and efficiencies within the business workflow.
