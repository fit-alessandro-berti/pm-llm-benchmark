To create the two POWL models as described, we'll define the workflows using the `pm4py` library's classes for representing activities, choices, and loops. The first model will include the potential unfairness through an XOR choice that gives preferential treatment to applicants with certain community affiliations. The second model will remove this bias by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation.

Here's how you can define these models:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Model 1: With Potential Unfairness
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
model_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_completeness,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_cultural_fit,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add edges to enforce order
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data_completeness)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(loop_data_completeness, SkillAssessment)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_cultural_fit)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(xor_cultural_fit, ManagerialReview)
model_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Model 2: Without Unfairness
model_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    DataCompletenessCheck,
    RequestMoreInfo,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add edges to enforce order
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment)
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
model_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Print models (for verification)
print("Model with Potential Unfairness:")
print(model_with_unfairness)
print("\nModel without Unfairness:")
print(model_without_unfairness)
```

### Explanation:

- **Model with Potential Unfairness**: This model includes an XOR choice after the skill assessment. One path leads to a standard cultural fit check, while the other path leads to a community affiliation check, which can give a slight advantage to certain applicants.

- **Model without Unfairness**: This model ensures that all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation process, removing the XOR choice that could introduce bias.

These models visually and logically represent the hiring process, highlighting where biases could occur and how they can be mitigated.
