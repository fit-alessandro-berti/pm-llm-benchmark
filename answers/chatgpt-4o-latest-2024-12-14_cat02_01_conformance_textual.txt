### Analysis of Cases and Deviations

#### **Case 1**
**Event Sequence:**
1. Receive order → 2. Check inventory → 3. Authorize payment → 4. Package items → 5. Ship order → 6. Close order.

**Analysis:**
- This sequence aligns with the normative process for sufficient inventory. Each activity occurs in the correct order:
  - "Check inventory" precedes "Authorize payment."
  - "Authorize payment" precedes "Package items."
  - "Package items" precedes "Ship order."
  - "Close order" is the final activity.

**Conclusion:** No violations in Case 1.

---

#### **Case 2**
**Event Sequence:**
1. Receive order → 2. Check inventory → 3. Package items → 4. Authorize payment → 5. Ship order → 6. Close order.

**Analysis:**
- **Violation 1:** "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment." This violates the rule that payment authorization should precede packaging.
- **Violation 2:** While "Check inventory" occurs first, as required, subsequent activities do not follow the expected order, introducing logical issues in the workflow.

**Conclusion:** Case 2 violates the normative process because "Package items" is done prematurely, before confirming payment authorization.

---

#### **Case 3**
**Event Sequence:**
1. Receive order → 2. Check inventory → 3. Authorize payment → 4. Cancel order → 5. Ship order → 6. Close order.

**Analysis:**
- **Violation 1:** "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment," which is illogical. A canceled order should not proceed with payment authorization.
- **Violation 2:** "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which directly violates the rule that shipping is not permissible for canceled orders.

**Conclusion:** Case 3 has multiple violations:
1. Payment authorization after cancellation is logically inconsistent.
2. Shipping a canceled order is strictly prohibited.

---

#### **Case 4**
**Event Sequence:**
1. Receive order → 2. Check inventory → 3. Cancel order → 4. Close order.

**Analysis:**
- This sequence aligns with the normative process for insufficient inventory:
  - "Check inventory" is performed before "Cancel order."
  - No fulfillment activities (e.g., packaging or shipping) occur after cancellation.
  - "Close order" is appropriately the final step.

**Conclusion:** No violations in Case 4.

---

#### **Case 5**
**Event Sequence:**
1. Receive order → 2. Check inventory → 3. Authorize payment → 4. Ship order → 5. Close order.

**Analysis:**
- **Violation 1:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items." The normative process requires that items be packaged before shipping.
- There are no issues with the other activities as they follow the correct sequence:
  - "Check inventory" is performed first.
  - "Authorize payment" occurs after inventory check.
  - "Close order" is the final activity.

**Conclusion:** Case 5 violates the normative process by skipping the "Package items" activity before shipping.

### Summary of Violations

| Case ID | Violations                                                                                                                                          |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | No violations.                                                                                                                                      |
| 2       | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the expected sequence.                                                             |
| 3       | "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment," and "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," both of which violate the normative process rules.    |
| 4       | No violations.                                                                                                                                      |
| 5       | "Package items" is missing, violating the rule that shipping must be preceded by packaging.                                                          |

### Key Observations and Rules Reinforced
1. **"Check inventory" must always occur before any other activity.**
2. **"Authorize payment" must occur after inventory check and before "Package items."**
3. **"Package items" must occur before "Ship order."**
4. **"Cancel order" is final for cancellation scenarios, and no fulfillment activities may follow.**
5. **"Close order" must always be the last activity in the process.**
