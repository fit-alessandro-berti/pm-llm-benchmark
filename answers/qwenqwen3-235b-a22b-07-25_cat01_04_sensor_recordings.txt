### **Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Event Log**

We are given a raw event log from a single machine (M1) with six sensor dimensions: **Temperature, Pressure, Vibration, Material Flow, Tool Position, and Energy Consumption**. Our goal is to identify **distinct operational phases** and assign **meaningful activity labels** based on observable patterns in the sensor data.

---

### **Step 1: Observing Trends and Grouping Events**

We analyze the data chronologically and look for **transitions in sensor behavior** that suggest changes in machine state or activity.

#### **Event-by-Event Analysis:**

| Event # | Key Observations |
|--------|------------------|
| 1–3    | All values are low/stable. No material flow. Tool at rest. Low energy. **Machine idle.** |
| 4–6    | Temperature  (2158°C), Vibration  (038 Hz), Flow starts (5 units/s), Tool moves (010 mm), Energy  (0.453.00 kWh). **Active processing begins.** |
| 7–8    | Temp  (5840°C), Vibration  (3810 Hz), Flow continues (2 units/s), Tool stabilizes at 15 mm, Energy steady (2.00). **Stable state with slow flow.** |
| 9      | Temp spikes (4080°C), Vibration  (1050 Hz), Flow stops, Tool unchanged, Energy  (2.005.00 kWh). **High-intensity operation with no flow.** |
| 10     | Temp drops sharply (8030°C), Vibration near zero, Energy  (5.001.00), Flow still zero. **Cooling/post-operation.** |
| 11–12  | Temp stabilizes (25–30°C), Vibration low (5 Hz), Flow resumes (1 unit/s), Tool moves to 20 mm, Energy ~1.5–1.6. **Gentle movement and feeding.** |
| 13–15  | All sensors return to baseline: 0 flow, 0 vibration, tool reset to 0 mm, low energy. **Machine reset/idle.** |

---

### **Step 2: Clustering Events into Phases**

We group events based on **similar sensor profiles** and **transitions**:

| Group | Events | Sensor Pattern |
|------|--------|----------------|
| A | 1–3 | Baseline: All sensors at minimum. Machine off/idle. |
| B | 4–6 | Rising temp, vibration, flow, tool movement, energy. Active processing. |
| C | 7–8 | Stable temp, low vibration, slow flow, tool stable. Holding or slow assembly. |
| D | 9    | High temp, high vibration, no flow, high energy. Intense localized operation. |
| E | 10   | Rapid cooling, low vibration, no flow. Transition phase. |
| F | 11–12 | Moderate temp, slight vibration, slow flow, tool moving. Final positioning/feeding. |
| G | 13–15 | All sensors return to idle. Machine reset. |

### **Step 3: Assigning Activity Labels with Rationale**

We now assign **intuitive manufacturing activity labels** based on typical sensor behaviors:

---

#### **Activity 1: Machine Idle / Standby**  
**Events:** 1–3  
**Rationale:**  
- All sensor values are at or near zero: no flow, no vibration, minimal energy (0.4–0.5 kWh), tool at 0 mm.
- Temperature is ambient (20–21°C).
- This is clearly a **non-operational state** — machine powered on but not active.

>  **Label: "Idle / Ready"**

---

#### **Activity 2: Cutting Metal**  
**Events:** 4–6  
**Rationale:**  
- Sharp increase in **temperature** (2158°C), **vibration** (038 Hz), and **energy** (0.453.00 kWh).
- **Material flow begins** (5 units/s), indicating material is being fed.
- **Tool position increases** (010 mm), suggesting engagement.
- These are classic signs of a **cutting operation**: high mechanical stress, heat, and energy use.

>  **Label: "Cutting Metal"**

---

#### **Activity 3: Assembling Parts (Stable Phase)**  
**Events:** 7–8  
**Rationale:**  
- Temperature drops slightly but remains elevated (40°C), **pressure increases** (1.52 bar), **vibration low** (10 Hz).
- **Material flow continues at reduced rate** (2 units/s), tool position **stabilized at 15 mm**.
- Energy consumption stable (2.00 kWh).
- Suggests a **controlled, steady-state process** — consistent with **assembly** where parts are being joined or fed slowly.

>  **Label: "Assembling Parts"**

---

#### **Activity 4: Welding**  
**Event:** 9  
**Rationale:**  
- **Temperature spikes to 80°C** (highest in log), **vibration peaks at 50 Hz**, **energy consumption jumps to 5.00 kWh**.
- **Material flow stops**, and **tool position unchanged** — indicating a **localized, high-energy operation** on a fixed point.
- Classic signature of **welding**: intense heat and energy, no movement or flow during the weld.
- Short duration suggests a **brief but intense** step.

>  **Label: "Welding"**

---

#### **Activity 5: Cooling / Post-Weld Stabilization**  
**Event:** 10  
**Rationale:**  
- Temperature drops sharply (8030°C), vibration nearly zero, energy drops to 1.00 kWh.
- No material flow, tool still at 15 mm.
- This is a **transition phase** following high-heat operation — likely **cooling** to stabilize the welded joint.

>  **Label: "Cooling / Stabilization"**

---

#### **Activity 6: Final Positioning & Feeding**  
**Events:** 11–12  
**Rationale:**  
- Temperature stabilizes at 25°C, **tool moves further (1520 mm)**, **material flow resumes (1 unit/s)**.
- Vibration slightly up (5 Hz), energy modest (1.5–1.6 kWh).
- Suggests **fine adjustment or feeding of next component**, possibly preparing for packaging or final assembly.

>  **Label: "Final Positioning & Feeding"**

---

#### **Activity 7: Machine Reset / Idle**  
**Events:** 13–15  
**Rationale:**  
- All values return to initial baseline: tool at 0 mm, no flow, no vibration, low energy.
- Temperature back to 20–21°C.
- Indicates **cycle complete**, machine reset to standby.

>  **Label: "Reset / Idle"**

### **Final Labeled Process Flow**

| Activity Sequence | Events       | Label                        |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| 1                | 1–3          | Idle / Ready                 |
| 2                | 4–6          | Cutting Metal                |
| 3                | 7–8          | Assembling Parts             |
| 4                | 9            | Welding                      |
| 5                | 10           | Cooling / Stabilization      |
| 6                | 11–12        | Final Positioning & Feeding  |
| 7                | 13–15        | Reset / Idle                 |

### **Summary of Inference Logic**

| Sensor               | Interpretation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| ** Temperature +  Vibration +  Energy** | Mechanical work (e.g., cutting, welding) |
| **High Temp + No Flow + High Energy**     | Welding or localized heating |
| **Stable Temp + Steady Flow + Low Vibration** | Assembly or feeding |
| ** Temperature +  Energy + No Flow**    | Cooling or idle transition |
| **Tool Position Changes**                 | Movement between stages |
| **Material Flow > 0**                     | Active processing or feeding |
| **All Sensors at Baseline**               | Idle or reset state |

###  **Conclusion**

Using **process mining techniques**, we inferred a **6-step manufacturing process** from raw sensor data by clustering events based on **multivariate patterns**. Despite no explicit labels, we deduced the following sequence:

> **Idle  Cutting  Assembly  Welding  Cooling  Final Feeding  Reset**

This demonstrates how **sensor-based event logs** can be transformed into **interpretable process models** using **pattern recognition and domain knowledge** — a core principle of **process mining in Industry 4.0**.
