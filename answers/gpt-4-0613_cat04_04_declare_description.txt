From the given data, we can interpret the process as follows:

1. The process starts with the activity 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' as its initialization. The presence of any other declarations like 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER', 'Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' is absent in the process flow.

2. After the employee submits the declaration, the supervisor reviews it and gives the final approval. This sequence is mandated by 'Precedence', 'Chain Precedence', 'Alternate Precedence', 'Response', 'Chain Response', 'Succession', 'Alternate Succession', 'Responded Existence', 'Co-existence' constraints. The absence of any other actions between these two activities is enforced by 'Chain Precedence', 'Chain Response', 'Chain Succession' constraints.

3. Once the declaration is approved by the supervisor, a payment request is made. This sequence is supported by 'Precedence', 'Chain Precedence', 'Alternate Precedence', 'Response', 'Chain Response', 'Succession', 'Alternate Succession', 'Responded Existence', 'Co-existence' constructs. There are no other actions allowed between these two activities as per 'Chain Precedence', 'Alternate Succession', 'Chain Succession', 'Chain Response' constraints.

4. Following the payment request, the payment is handled. This sequence is addressed in 'Precedence', 'Response', 'Succession', 'Alternate Succession', 'Chain Response', 'Chain Succession', 'Responded Existence', 'Co-existence' constructs. This suggests that 'Payment Handled' is the last step and there are no other actions possible after it.

The process ensures that each activity 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' happens exactly once as per 'Existence' and 'Exactly 1' constraints. Also, all activities mentioned must coexist in the same process instance as per 'Co-existence' constraints.

In summary, the process is: An employee submits a declaration -> Supervisor provides final approval -> Payment request is raised -> Payment Handled.
