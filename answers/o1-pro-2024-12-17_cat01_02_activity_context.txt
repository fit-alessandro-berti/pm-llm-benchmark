**Step-by-step Reasoning**

1. **Identify repeating activities and their contexts:**

   - **"Verify Documents"** appears multiple times in the same case. The first occurrence is an initial attempt at confirming identity or eligibility. Subsequent occurrences happen after new information is provided or after account adjustments have been made.
   
   - **"Call Customer"** also occurs multiple times. The first call is typically to request missing documents or clarify discrepancies. A second call often confirms that the required information is now correct or complete.

   By examining timestamps and additional contexts, we see that each repeated activity carries a different purpose depending on when it happens.

2. **Renaming logic:**

   - For **"Verify Documents"**:
     - The first verification in a case can be named "Initial Document Verification."
     - If there's another verification after changes (e.g., after receiving additional documents or adjusting the account), it can be called "Final Document Verification" or "Post-Adjustment Document Verification," depending on the scenario.
   
   - For **"Call Customer"**:
     - A call following incomplete verification to request more information can be named "Request Missing Documents Call" or "Clarification Call."
     - A subsequent call made after adjustments or to confirm resolved issues could be "Confirmation Call" or "Follow-up Call."

   Activities like **"Initiate Request"**, **"Approve Request"**, and **"Adjust Account"** occur once per case or have a consistent meaning, so they can remain the same or slightly modified for clarity. **"Submit Additional"** documents is only seen once and is already self-explanatory, so renaming isn't strictly necessary beyond clarifying it as "Submit Additional Documents."

3. **Revised Event Log:**

4. **Justification for Naming Choices:**

   - **"Initial Document Verification" vs. "Final/Post-Adjustment Document Verification":**  
     This differentiation makes it clear that the first verification is preliminary, while the subsequent one occurs after the customer provides additional documents or after internal adjustments have been made.

   - **"Request Missing Documents Call," "Clarification Call," and "Confirmation Call":**  
     These names indicate the purpose of each call. Instead of just "Call Customer," the new names show whether the call is to gather missing information, clarify an issue, or confirm that everything is now in order.

   - **"Recall Customer Call":**  
     In the branch scenario, the call is specifically to get the customer to return to the branch, which is distinct from other calls made to request documents or confirm changes.

   - **"Submit Additional Documents" and "Final Approval":**  
     These terms were already fairly self-explanatory but are now clarified to emphasize their role in the process. "Final Approval" consistently signals the end stage of the request, tying all prior verifications and adjustments together.

Overall, these changes make the log more intuitive, highlighting the evolving context of repeated activities and making the workflow easier to understand.
