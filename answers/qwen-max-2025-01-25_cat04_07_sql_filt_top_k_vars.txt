To solve the problem, we need to break it into logical steps and construct a DuckDB SQL query that adheres to the requirements. Below is the step-by-step explanation and the corresponding SQL query.

---

### Step 1: Extract Ordered Activity Sequences per Case
We need to group events by `case_id` and sort them by `timestamp` to determine the ordered sequence of activities for each case. This can be achieved using the `LISTAGG` function in DuckDB, which concatenates values into a single string while preserving order.

---

### Step 2: Identify Unique Process Variants and Count Cases
Once we have the ordered activity sequences for each `case_id`, we can group by these sequences to identify unique process variants. We then count how many cases correspond to each variant.

---

### Step 3: Filter to Top K Variants
Using the counts from Step 2, we rank the variants by their frequency and filter to retain only the top K variants.

---

### Step 4: Return Events from Cases in Top K Variants
Finally, we filter the original `event_log` table to include only events from cases that belong to the top K variants.

### DuckDB SQL Query

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Extract ordered activity sequences for each case
    SELECT
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Count cases per unique activity sequence (variant)
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
),
filtered_cases AS (
    -- Step 4: Get case_ids belonging to the top K variants
    SELECT
        os.case_id
    FROM ordered_sequences os
    INNER JOIN top_k_variants tkv
        ON os.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
-- Final result: Return events from cases in the top K variants
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN filtered_cases fc
    ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **`ordered_sequences` CTE**:
   - Groups the `event_log` by `case_id`.
   - Uses `LISTAGG` to create an ordered sequence of activities for each case, sorted by `timestamp`.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**:
   - Groups the ordered sequences to identify unique process variants.
   - Counts the number of cases (`case_count`) for each variant.

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**:
   - Orders the variants by their frequency (`case_count`) in descending order.
   - Limits the results to the top K variants using `LIMIT K`.

4. **`filtered_cases` CTE**:
   - Joins the `ordered_sequences` with the `top_k_variants` to get the `case_id`s of cases that belong to the top K variants.

5. **Final SELECT**:
   - Filters the original `event_log` table to include only events from cases that are part of the top K variants.

### Notes

- Replace `K` in the `LIMIT K` clause with the desired number of top variants.
- Ensure that the `timestamp` column is properly indexed or optimized for sorting if the dataset is large.
- The `LISTAGG` function is used here because it is efficient for concatenating ordered values in DuckDB. If you need a different format for the activity sequence (e.g., JSON), you can adjust this part accordingly.

This query is efficient and leverages DuckDB's capabilities for handling grouped aggregations and ordered operations.
