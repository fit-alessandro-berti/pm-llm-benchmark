### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average of ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation (1 hour) suggests an artificially rigid approval schedule. Such uniformity is unusual in real-world scenarios, hinting at automated or systematically enforced timescales.
   
2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** An extremely long average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation (2 days) implies inconsistent timing. This could be due to backlogs or varying priority levels, reflecting operational inefficiencies or resource allocation issues.
   
3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** A quick closure (2 hours) after assignment, without intermediate steps like Evaluate or Approve consistently appearing, suggests premature closure of claims. This could indicate procedural lapses or expedited closing without due diligence.
   
4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** Only 5 minutes between evaluation and notification is unrealistically fast, hinting at skipped steps or automated immediate transitions that might not align with business rules.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Systemic Delays or Rigid Schedules:** The low variation in the R to P transition time might indicate a rigid schedule dictated by an automated system, causing approvals to be artificially uniform.
   
2. **Operational Inefficiencies:** The variability in the P to N transition suggests possible bottlenecks or backlogs, where resources are inconsistently available or claim priority is highly variable.
   
3. **Premature Closures:** Claims closing shortly after assignment could point to procedural lapses, where claims might be prematurely marked as resolved for reasons such as meeting performance metrics, lack of required documentation, or adjuster errors.
   
4. **Automated or Skipped Steps:** The rapid transition from Evaluate to Notify may indicate automated systems bypassing necessary checks or steps, leading to immediate notifications that should typically require more time.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

#### 1. Identifying Claims with Unusual R to P Timings

```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       MIN(ce.timestamp) AS receive_time,
       MAX(ce.timestamp) AS approve_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) AS duration_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) NOT BETWEEN (90000 - 3600) AND (90000 + 3600);
```

#### 2. Analyzing P to N Delays by Region and Claims

```sql
SELECT cl.claim_id,
       cl.region,
       MIN(ce_approve.timestamp) AS approve_time,
       MIN(ce_notify.timestamp) AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(ce_notify.timestamp) - MIN(ce_approve.timestamp))) AS duration_seconds
FROM claims cl
JOIN claim_events ce_approve ON cl.claim_id = ce_approve.claim_id AND ce_approve.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events ce_notify ON cl.claim_id = ce_notify.claim_id AND ce_notify.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY cl.claim_id, cl.region
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(ce_notify.timestamp) - MIN(ce_approve.timestamp))) NOT BETWEEN (604800 - 172800) AND (604800 + 172800);
```

#### 3. Identifying Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment

```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       MIN(ce.timestamp) AS assign_time,
       MAX(ce.timestamp) AS close_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) AS duration_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) < 3600 * 3;  -- Threshold of 3 hours
```

#### 4. Evaluating Realistic E to N (Evaluate to Notify) Durations

```sql
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       MIN(ce.timestamp) AS evaluate_time,
       MAX(ce.timestamp) AS notify_time,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) AS duration_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
GROUP BY ce.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ce.activity) = 2
   AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce.timestamp) - MIN(ce.timestamp))) NOT BETWEEN (300 - 60) AND (300 + 60); -- Threshold of 5 minutes
```

These queries are designed to highlight the claims exhibiting significant deviations from expected process durations, thus aiding in diagnosing and addressing procedural anomalies.
