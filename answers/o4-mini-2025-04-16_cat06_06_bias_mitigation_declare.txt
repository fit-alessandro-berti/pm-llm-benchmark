Here is an updated DECLARE model with biasmitigating constraints added. All new constraints use support=1.0 and confidence=1.0.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication":         {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision":           {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Ensure we always apply a BiasMitigationCheck somewhere in each trace
        "BiasMitigationCheck":     {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        # Ensure ManualReview appears (coexists with any sensitive decision)
        "ManualReview":            {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication":        {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {
            "FinalDecision":         {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        # If we ever approve or reject a minority applicant, ManualReview must also occur
        "Approve_Minority": {
            "ManualReview":          {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "Reject_Minority": {
            "ManualReview":          {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {
            "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        # After checking an applicant’s race we must perform a BiasMitigationCheck
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck":   {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "precedence": {
        # Any decision (regular or “_Minority”) must be preceded by a BiasMitigationCheck
        "Approve": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck":   {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "Reject": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck":   {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "Approve_Minority": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck":   {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        },
        "Reject_Minority": {
            "BiasMitigationCheck":   {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {
            "FinalDecision":         {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    # Prevent a direct decision immediately after race check (no unchecked biased decisions)
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {
            "Reject":                {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
            "Approve":               {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
        }
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Rationale:

1. Existence("BiasMitigationCheck") and Existence("ManualReview") force every trace to include explicit fairness/audit steps.  
2. Response(CheckApplicantRace  BiasMitigationCheck) and Nonsuccession(CheckApplicantRace  {Approve, Reject}) stop any decision immediately after seeing sensitive attributes without mitigation.  
3. Precedence(decisions  BiasMitigationCheck) guarantees that every decision is justified by a prior biasmitigation step.  
4. Coexistence(Approve_Minority, ManualReview) and Coexistence(Reject_Minority, ManualReview) ensure that any decision on minority applicants is doublechecked manually.  

Together these constraints introduce “checks and balances” into the loanreview process, reducing the risk of automated or implicit bias.
