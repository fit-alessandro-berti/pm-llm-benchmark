------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ANOMALIES THAT CAN BE SEEN DIRECTLY IN THE POWL MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------------
A. “Evaluate – Approve” loop  
   • Operator.LOOP(children = [E, P]) means:  
     – Execute E at least once (body).  
     – Optionally enter the “redo” branch P, then return to the body E, and so on.  
   • Consequences:  
     – A claim can be Approved several times.  
     – After an Approval the next action is another Evaluation, i.e. an “evaluate-after-approve” cycle that makes no business sense.

B. XOR (Notify Customer  vs  SilentSkip)  
   • The branch containing N can be completely skipped, so customers might never be informed about the claim result.

C. Premature/Concurrent Close  
   • Edge A  C and the absence of a mandatory xor  C edge allow C to occur  
     – immediately after the adjuster is assigned, or  
     – in parallel with the loop and/or the XOR branch.  
   • Therefore a claim can be closed even if it was never Evaluated, Approved, or Notified.

D. Missing ordering constraints in general  
   – No explicit constraint “E before P” inside the loop (loop semantics only guarantees the first E).  
   – No explicit constraint “P before N” (because N is in a separate XOR subtree).  

------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PLAUSIBLE HYPOTHESES FOR WHY THE ANOMALIES APPEAR
------------------------------------------------------------------
H-1  Business-rule changes that were only partially modelled  
     • The company introduced a “re-evaluation” feature for disputed claims; the modeller used a LOOP but forgot to change the rest of the tree.

H-2  Miscommunication between departments  
     • IT believed customer notification is optional (marketing mails the letters later), while operations treats it as mandatory.

H-3  Technical/tool limitations or modelling error  
     • The modeller used a partial-order editor, dragged an edge from A to C for readability, unaware that it adds a true causal relation.

H-4  Intentional fast-track / exception path left too open  
     • Small-value claims may legally skip approval and notice; however the branch was offered to *all* claims.

H-5  Data-quality workaround  
     • Duplicate “Approve” events had been recorded; instead of cleaning the log the modeller allowed multiple approvals in the process model.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3. HOW TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES WITH THE DATABASE
------------------------------------------------------------------
Below are example SQL snippets (PostgreSQL dialect).  
Replace :start_date / :end_date or add further filters as needed.

--------------------------------------------------
3.1  Claims CLOSED without any E or P
--------------------------------------------------
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM   claims c
WHERE  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
               WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
                 AND e.activity = 'C')
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
                  WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
                    AND e.activity = 'E')
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e
                  WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
                    AND e.activity = 'P');

 Confirms anomaly C.  If many rows appear, premature closing is really happening.

--------------------------------------------------
3.2  Close happened BEFORE the (last) Evaluate or Approve
--------------------------------------------------
WITH stamps AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='C' THEN timestamp END) AS ts_c,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN timestamp END) AS ts_e,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN timestamp END) AS ts_p
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id, ts_c, ts_e, ts_p
FROM   stamps
WHERE  ts_c IS NOT NULL                         -- claim closed
  AND (ts_e IS NULL OR ts_c < ts_e              -- closed before first E
       OR ts_p IS NULL OR ts_c < ts_p);         -- or before first P

 Validates both the missing and the out-of-order situations.

--------------------------------------------------
3.3  Multiple approvals (loop symptom)
--------------------------------------------------
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) AS approve_cnt
FROM   claim_events
WHERE  activity = 'P'
GROUP  BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

 If rows > 0, the Evaluate-Approve loop is used in reality.

--------------------------------------------------
3.4  Approval BEFORE first Evaluation
--------------------------------------------------
WITH ord AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_e,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity='P' THEN timestamp END) AS first_p
  FROM   claim_events
  GROUP  BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id, first_e, first_p
FROM   ord
WHERE  first_p IS NOT NULL
  AND (first_e IS NULL OR first_p < first_e);

 Shows whether the loop’s “E then P” assumption is violated in data.

--------------------------------------------------
3.5  Approved claims without customer notification
--------------------------------------------------
SELECT DISTINCT ce.claim_id
FROM   claim_events ce
WHERE  ce.activity = 'P'
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce2
                  WHERE  ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id
                    AND  ce2.activity = 'N');

 Measures the real-world frequency of the optional XOR branch.

--------------------------------------------------
3.6  Re-evaluation AFTER approval (loop iteration)
--------------------------------------------------
WITH seq AS (
  SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id
                             ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_act
  FROM   claim_events)
SELECT claim_id, prev_act, activity, timestamp
FROM   seq
WHERE  prev_act = 'P' AND activity = 'E';

 Direct evidence that the “approve-then-evaluate again” path occurs.

--------------------------------------------------
3.7  Validate that every ‘Assign Adjuster’ was done by a real adjuster
--------------------------------------------------
SELECT ce.claim_id, ce.resource
FROM   claim_events ce
LEFT   JOIN adjusters a ON a.name = ce.resource
WHERE  ce.activity = 'A'
  AND  a.adjuster_id IS NULL;

 Detects data-quality problems that may have motivated edge A  C as a workaround (H-5).

------------------------------------------------------------------
NEXT STEPS AFTER ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------
• If queries reveal that anomalies rarely or never happen  model error; fix the POWL tree.  
• If they occur often but only for specific claim types or regions  refine the model with explicit fast-track branches and proper guards.  
• If they correlate with change dates in business rules  verify change-management procedures.  
• Combine the SQL checks with conformance checking in pm4py to quantify deviations and support further root-cause analysis.
