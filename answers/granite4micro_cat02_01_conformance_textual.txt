### Violations Identified

#### Case ID 3  
- **Violation:** The sequence includes a **“Cancel order”** activity before **“Package items.”**  
- **Explanation:** According to the normative process, once inventory sufficiency is confirmed (via **Check inventory**) and payment is authorized, the next step should be **to package items**. Only after packaging can the order be shipped or closed. The presence of a cancellation before packaging violates this ordering principle.

#### Case ID 4  
- **Violation:** This case contains a **“Cancel order”** activity without any preceding **“Check inventory.”** Also, there is no indication that payment was authorized before the cancellation.  
- **Explanation:** Before an order can be canceled (and thus closed), it must first have its inventory verified and its payment processed according to the standard flow: Receive  Check Inventory  Authorize Payment  Package/Ship/Cancel  Close. The lack of a preceding check indicates that this step is premature.

### Summary

- **Case 3** violates the normative sequence by canceling an order before it has been packaged, which is against the requirement that packaging occurs only after payment authorization and inventory sufficiency are confirmed.
  
- **Case 4** violates multiple steps in the process: it attempts to cancel without first confirming inventory availability or processing a valid payment authorization.

These cases illustrate deviations from the expected normative flow described in the textual description.
