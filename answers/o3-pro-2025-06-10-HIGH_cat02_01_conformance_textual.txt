Cases that violate the normative process: 2, 3 and 5.

Explanation of each deviation (references to the textual rules are quoted in italics):


Case 1  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
Conforms exactly to the “sufficient-inventory” path; no problems.


Case 2  
Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close  

Violation(s):  
• The items are packaged **before** the payment is authorised.  
  *Textual rule:* “Authorize payment should only occur after ‘Check inventory’ **and before packaging**, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known.”  
• Because the order of “Package items” and “Authorize payment” is reversed, the step “Package items” is executed in a state where payment may still be refused—contrary to the intended safeguards.


Case 3  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close  

Violation(s):  
1. Payment is authorised even though the case ultimately follows the “insufficient-inventory” branch.  
   *Textual rule:* “If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process should directly proceed to ‘Cancel order.’”  
   Authorising payment defeats the purpose of cancelling for lack of stock.  

2. The order is shipped after it has been cancelled.  
   *Textual rule:* “‘Ship order’ should only occur after packaging and **never after a cancellation**.”  

3. Shipping is performed without any prior “Package items” step.  
   *Textual rule:* “‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization and **before shipping**, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped.”  

(Any one of these defects is enough to mark the case as non-conforming.)


Case 4  
Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
Correct execution of the “insufficient-inventory” path; no violations.


Case 5  
Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close  

Violation(s):  
• The case skips “Package items” entirely and ships the order straight after payment authorisation.  
  *Textual rule:* “‘Package items’ should only occur after authorization and **before shipping** … ‘Ship order’ should only occur after packaging.”  


Summary

Conforming cases: 1 and 4  
Deviating cases (with reasons):  
• Case 2 – Packaging occurs before payment authorisation.  
• Case 3 – Payment authorised in a cancellation scenario; shipping after cancellation; shipping without packaging.  
• Case 5 – Shipping performed without prior packaging.
