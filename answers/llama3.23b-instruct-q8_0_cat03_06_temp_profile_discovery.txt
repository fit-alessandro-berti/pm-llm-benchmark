Based on the data provided, I'll attempt to extract the following information:

1. Process name: Create Fine
2. Decision points:
	* Send Fine
	* Insert Fine Notification
	* Appeal to Judge
	* Appeal to Prefecture
	* Payment
3. Alternative paths:
	* Sending Fine instead of Insert Fine Notification (3 alternatives)
	* Without appeal (5 alternatives)

Here is a generated temporal profile for the process:

**Start**

1. **Create Fine**: Initial creation of fine data

**Send Fine**

2. **Create Fine**: Forwarded to Insert Fine Notification
3. **Insert Fine Notification**: Forwarded to Alternative paths (A)

**A.1: Send Payment instead of Fine**

4. **Payment**: Trigger for payment processing

**A.2: Send Appeal to Prefecture instead of Payment**

5. **Send Appeal to Prefecture**: Prepare appeal packet

**A.3: Other alternatives...**

* 6. **Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**
* 7. **Send for Credit Collection**
* ... (multiple alternatives)

**A**

1. **Create Fine Notification**: Forwarded to Next steps
2. **Appeal to Judge**: Trigger for appeal process

**B: Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture**

4. **Add penalty**: Apply penalty to fine data

**C: Appeal to Prefecture**

1. **Send Appeal to Prefecture**: Start appeal process
2. **Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture**: Receive processing result
	* 5. **Notify Result Appeal to Offender**: Notify result to offender

3. **Add penalty**: Apply penalty to fine data

**E: Other alternative paths...**

Note that this is a simplified and abstract representation of the process, omitting some technical details and nuances. In an actual implementation, additional complexity may exist.
