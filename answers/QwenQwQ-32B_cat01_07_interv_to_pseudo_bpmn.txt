Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. I need to create a BPMN-like textual model based on the interviews provided. 

First, I'll start by reading through each interview to understand the process flow as described by different stakeholders. Mary from Accounts Payable provided the main steps: checking for a PO, logging into the system, sending to purchasing for confirmation of receipt, matching invoice with PO, then manager approval if everything checks out. But there's also the step where if there's a discrepancy, they contact purchasing again, maybe escalate to the supervisor. 

Dan from Purchasing checks if the invoice matches the PO and contacts suppliers if there are issues like missing PO numbers or discrepancies. He mentions that without a PO number, Mary needs to get that. So the purchasing department's role is to confirm that what was received matches the PO, and if there are issues, they initiate corrections. 

Carlos, the department manager, is involved after the PO confirmation. He reviews the invoice details and approves or rejects it. If he rejects, maybe it goes back for resolution? 

Rita, the supervisor, handles exceptions. If there are discrepancies that Mary can't resolve herself, she escalates them to Rita. Rita then coordinates with the suppliers or departments to resolve exceptions and might help create a retroactive PO. 

Karen, the Supplier Relationship Manager, comes in when there are supplier-related issues like missing PO numbers or pricing discrepancies. She assists in resolving these to keep the invoice moving through the process. 

Now, I need to structure all these steps into a flow with activities, gateways (decision points), roles, artifacts, and exceptions. Let's list out the key steps from the interviews.

Starting from the receipt of the invoice. 

1. Receive invoice (possibly via email).
2. **Activity:** Mary checks for a valid PO number. 
   - **Gateway:** If no PO, send back to supplier. 
   - **Gateway:** If PO exists, proceed to log into system. 

After logging, **Activity:** Forward to Purchasing. 
Dan then does a **gateway:** Check if invoice matches PO.
   - **If matches:** Send confirmation to Accounts Payable. 
   - **If discrepancies exist:** Contact supplier or suggest a corrected invoice, or maybe loop in Karen. 

Wait, Dan mentions that if there's a discrepancy, they might contact the supplier directly or ask AP to hold until corrected. But also, if the PO number is missing, Mary has to get it first. 

So the Purchasing step's output determines the next step. After purchasing confirms (matches), the next activity would be logging into the system then the manager's approval? Wait, Mary says after confirmation from purchasing and matching, she sends it to the manager. Wait, actually, Mary said after logging the invoice (which comes right after check for PO), she forwards to purchasing to confirm receipt. 

Wait, maybe I need to retrace Mary's steps precisely:

Mary's Process:
- Invoice Arrival  Check for PO number
   - If no  send back to supplier
   - If yes  Log into accounting system
Then:
    Forward to Purchasing to confirm goods/services received.
Once Purchasing confirms (that the goods were received? That they match the PO?), then Mary does a match between invoice and PO. 

Wait, this is an important point. The user mentioned that Mary's process is:
After logging it into the accounting system, she forwards it to purchasing to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. 

So the Purchase Confirms Receipt step is to confirm the goods were received. So Purchasing is not necessarily checking the invoice details against the PO at this point, but confirming that the goods were received. Then Mary does the matching part.

Wait, but according to Dan's process (Interview 2), when he gets the invoice from AP, he checks if the invoice details align with what they ordered. That's more about the details (quantities, prices, etc.), so perhaps that's part of Dan's step. 

Hmm, there's a possible conflict here between what Mary and Dan describe. Mary says after purchasing confirms to AP that "the goods/services were received", then Mary does the matching. But according to Dan's statement, after receiving the invoice from AP, his job is to compare the PO with the invoice details (like the quantities, pricing, etc.), and then send a confirmation back to AP. So perhaps in Mary's process, the Purchasing team is both confirming the receipt of goods and checking the details against the PO? 

Wait in Mary's interview, she says she sends it to purchasing "to confirm that the goods or services were actually received". So the main intent here is to check if the items were actually delivered, rather than checking the details. The line items match might be a separate step. But when she then "matches the invoice line items against the PO", that suggests that after getting confirmation from Purchasing that the goods were received, she does the matching.

But Dan, the Purchasing Officer, says that his role is to check if the invoice details line up with what was ordered (which is part of the matching). Perhaps the roles have different responsibilities here: Purchasing confirms that the goods were received and that the amount matches the PO, while Mary handles input into the system and initial logging. Wait, maybe the situation here is that the roles have overlapping parts. 

Mary's process:
1. Check for PO  (then log)
2. Send to Purchasing to confirm receipt
3. Once confirmed, Mary matches the invoice to PO (line items)
4. If match, send to manager for approval. 

Meanwhile, Dan's process is when he receives the invoice from AP, he (as Purchasing) checks the invoice details against the PO (possibly, checking not only receipt but also details). If that’s the case, then there's a discrepancy between where the comparison happens: at Purchasing or Mary. 

Alternatively, maybe "confirming receipt" is separate from the line item matching. So Purchasing's job is to confirm that the correct items were actually delivered (so they have the goods), and then Mary checks the invoice line items (quantities, pricing) against the PO. But Dan's interview states that he (purchasing) is doing that. 

Hmm. There's an inconsistency here, so according to Guidance in the problem, we should consolidate conflicting accounts by indicating uncertainty. 

So perhaps the process is that after receiving the invoice, check for PO, then on having PO, log it, send to purchasing to confirm that the items were received (i.e., delivery was correct). Purchasing does that, and perhaps also checks the line items, or maybe that step is done by Mary after. 

Mary says after purchasing confirms receipt, she matches the invoice line items against the PO. Maybe that's an extra step that Mary does. 

In any case, for the BPMN, I need to clarify these steps. Let's try to build a list of activities step by step.

First, the process starts with receiving an invoice.

Activity 1: **Receive Invoice** (Starter). Probably the first step.

Next step is Mary checks if there's a valid PO number.

Activity 2: **Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number** (done by Accounts Payable Clerk). 

Then: 

If **NO** PO number:
   - Send invoice back to supplier requesting PO details. 
      (Route back to supplier via [email].

If **YES** PO:
    Proceed to logging into the system.

Activity 3: **Log Invoice into Accounting System** (Accounts Payable Clerk)

Next step (as per Mary): forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt.

Activity 4: **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Receipt Confirmation**

Now, when this arrives in Purchasing, Dan (Purchasing Officer) must perform their part.

So Purchasing has Activity 5: **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services and Verify PO Alignment**

Here, the Purchase team checks:
- Did the goods arrive? (was this Delivered?)
- Do the invoice details match the PO? (quantities, prices, etc.)

If the verification is successful (all matches, and goods received):

Then, we return back to Mary in AP, and she proceeds to:

Activity 6: **Match Invoice Line Items with PO** (Accounts Payable Clerk)

Wait, but Dan said they handle checking for discrepancies. So maybe the Purchase step also includes matching items, so that after they confirm receipt and match, they return confirmation, so Mary just moves to approval? This is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the Match Invoice with PO is done by both Purchasing and AP. Need to reconcile.

Alternatively, as per Mary's account: the Purchase Officer confirms that the goods were received. Then, back in AP, Mary does the line-item matching (i.e., details like quantities and prices). However, according to Dan's interview, he does both the receipt check and the PO detail check. 

Since it's conflicting, I need to note this. According to Mary, the steps are: 

After Purchasing confirms they received the goods, Mary does a line item match (quantities, etc.). 

But Dan says that his role is to check if invoice details (like quantities, prices) align with the PO. 

So between the two, it's conflicting. Who does the matching? To resolve, perhaps the correct process is that Purchasing first confirms that the goods (as per PO) were received, and then Mary proceeds to check the line item details (or maybe Purchasing does it first). 

But given the transcripts, I need to make a decision and note possible variations. Let's see, perhaps:

The Process steps (using Mary's sequence):

1. Receive invoice
2. Check PO (yes/no)
3. If no, return to supplier
4. Log in system
5. Send to purchasing for confirmation of goods receipt
6. After confirmation (from purchasing), do the line-item match
7. If match, send to manager for approval
8. If discrepancy, contact purchasing to clarify, or escalate.

So that's Mary's view.

Dan says that when he receives the invoice from AP, he checks if it's correct (quantities etc). 

Thus perhaps the step at purchasing's side includes checking both receipt and details. 

Hence the process might be:

After AP submits the invoice to Purchasing, the purchasing confirms both receipt and does the PO-to-invoice reconciliation. So that activity includes both steps. 

Alternatively, whether it's split:

Step 4: Purchase confirms receipt (goods are present) THEN step 5: Purchase does PO details check (quantities, amounts). 

But Dan says his check is "line up with what we ordered", so probably in Purchasing's responsibility, before sending to Manager. 

But in Mary's account, after Purchasing confirms receipt (step 4 above?), she does the line item match. 

This inconsistency needs to be addressed. Since in BPMN, we can capture this via gateways and possible alternate paths, but let's try to represent as best as possible.

Perhaps the correct flow is:

Purchase's Step: Confirm receipt and check Purchase Order details.

Thus, when Mary sends the invoice to Purchasing for receipt confirmation, they first confirm goods were delivered, then the invoice details versus the PO.

Hence Activity 5 (Purchasing step) includes two parts:

- Confirm goods received (success  proceed)
- Verify invoice items (quantities, pricing) vs. PO.

If either of these fail, then there is a problem. 

Wait but according to Dan's description, the invoice is forwarded, and he checks the invoice details alignment with PO. If error, they may ask AP to hold until corrected. 

Thus, the flow would be, after sending the invoice to Purchasing:

They check if invoice is aligned with PO (quantities, etc.) AND confirm it's the goods were received. 

If both good, send confirmation back to AP. 

If discrepancy exists, then Purchasing contact suppliers (or via Karen) to resolve, then?

Alternatively, maybe "confirm receipt" is step 1 (check goods arrived) and the details (like amounts) are step 2?

Alternatively, let's outline the process as follows:

Let me try to build the BPMN in textual form step by step. The main start is receiving the invoice.

Start Event: Invoice Received.

Then, first task:

**Activity A:** Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number (Accounts Payable Clerk).

- **Output Artifact**: PO Number Verification Result.
  - If No PO  Send Parcel back **to Supplier**  End (with supplier needing to act). 
  - If Yes  Proceed to next steps.

Next:

**Activity B:** Log Invoice into Accounting System (Accounts Payable Clerk).

After logging, send to Purchasing. 

**Activity C:** Forward Invoice to Purchasing Department (Accounts Payable Clerk). 

Next, **Activity D:** **Confirm Goods/Service Received and Validate Invoice Against PO** (Purchasing Officer). 

Here, the Purchase is doing two things: confirming that goods were received, and verifying that the invoice's line items match the PO (quantities, pricing, delivery charges).

 **Gateway 1:** 

- **Validation Success?**
   - Yes  Proceed (next step).
   - No  **Gateway (Loop?)** Deal with discrepancies:
     - Contact Supplier via Supplier Reconciliation (Karen or AP to communicate).
     - Or Escalate if needed? 

Wait, Mary says if discrepancy in item, she contacts Purchasing and may escalate to supervisor. So the Purchasing Officer might notify AP of discrepancy, then AP handles the next steps? 

Wait, Dan's interview says that if discrepancies exist, he will either contact the supplier directly or ask AP to hold until corrected. 

So, assuming Purchasing detects discrepancy, they notify AP. So:

If there's a discrepancy, the process would loop and perhaps go to AP, who then resolver?

Hmm, perhaps the correct flow is:

After Activity C (AP sends invoice to Purchasing), Purchasing checks:

- Validation: If Successful (goods received and invoice matches PO details):

    **Activity E:** Confirm Validation (Sending confirmation to AP?)

But in Mary's process, after Purchasing confirms, next step is Mary checks the matching (or did they do that? 

Alternatively, in Mary's account, after purchasing confirms goods arrival, she does the line-item match. 

Wait, this is a contradiction that needs resolved. Let me recheck Mary's interview:

Mary says: 

After logging it into the accounting system, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system.

Ah! So the purchase confirms receipt of goods only, then Mary does the invoice vs PO matching. 

So:

Activity D: **Confirm Goods/Service Receipt** (Purchasing) - confirmed via email or note.

Then, back to Mary: 

Activity E: **Match Invoice Line Items Against PO** (Accounts Payable Clerk)

Now, after that:

- If **Match OK**:

   Activity F: **Prepare Department Manager's Approval** (send notification, documents)

   **Activity G:** **Department Manager Approval** (Carlos) 

   If approved  proceed to payment scheduling.

- If **Mismatch found**  go to Activity F (not yet: perhaps need a gateway here).

Wait, so the structure is:

After logging (B) and sending to Purchasing (C):

Activity D (Purchase check for receipt) 

If receipt is confirmed, comes back to AP clerk to conduct the line-item match (E).

If that match is OK  send to Manager (G's predecessor)

If match Fails (discrepancies):

   **Gateway:** 

   Maybe revisit the Purchase? (But no, already sent to them once). 

Alternatively, back to Purchasing for corrective action? 

Mary: "If there’s a discrepancy—like incorrect pricing or missing items—I email the purchasing team to clarify... if discrepancies can't be resolved, escalate."

So, if in the line item match there's an issue (E reports a problem):

Then the clerk sends to Purchasing to clarify.

So **Activity F:** Escalate Discrepancy (email Purchasing team)

Purchasing then may need to contact the supplier (Karen), or other steps. 

Alternatively, perhaps once a discrepancy is found in the match (E), there is a decision point: 

Gateway H: Can Discrepancy be Resolved?

Yes  Contact Purchasing for clarification.

No  Escalate to AP Supervisor.

Wait, but what's the exact route? Mary says she emails purchasing to clarify. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor Rita.

So after Activity E (match, if fails):

   **Gateway:** Is the discrepancy resolvable?

   If yes  proceed to contact purchasing (email them to clarify); then perhaps go back to E after correction? 

   OR:

   maybe after discrepancy, purchasing may submit a revised invoice, then back to E?

This is getting complex. Let me map step-by-step:

After Activity E (line-item match):

- If all ok (**Match OK?** Gateway):

   Proceed to Manager's approval.

- Else (**Discrepancy Found?**):

   Activity F: Clerk emails Purchasing to clarify discrepancy (Dan's team will check with supplier maybe via Karen).

   **Gateway:** After pursuing clarification, was discrepancy resolved?

   If yes  **Loop back to E** (do the match again?)

   Else (Could not resolve)  **Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)** (Activity FF).

      Rita might coordinate supplier (and Karen?) and finalize resolution.

      **Gateway:** After escalation, is discrepancy resolved? 

         Yes  loop back to E.

         No? Maybe rejection?

Alternatively, when escalated to Rita, she works with suppliers/department heads, then if resolved, it goes back into the process. Maybe after resolution, it goes back to Activity D? Or just to the next step?

This requires capturing loops, but in BPMN that's challenging but possible via intermediate steps.

Putting all together:

Now, for Artifacts:

- Invoice, PO number, confirmation emails, etc.

Inputs: Invoice, PO number.

Outputs: Payment Authorization, rejected/changed invoice.

Participants/Roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Departmental Manager (Carlos), AP Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen).

Now, to structure this as a textual BPMN:

Start with the starting step, then flow. Let's try:

--- 

Process: Invoice Approval Workflow 

**Start Event:** Invoice Received by Accounts Payable 

---

1. **Activity:** Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number *(Accounts Payable Clerk)*  
   - Condition: PO Number present on Invoice?  
     - **Yes:** Proceed to Log Invoice.

2. **Activity:** Log Invoice into Accounting System *(Accounts Payable Clerk)*  
   - Output Artifact: *Logged Invoice Record*.  

3. **Activity:** Forward Invoice for Receipt Confirmation *(Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Department)*  
   - Passes Invoice to **Purchasing**.

             **Yes Path:** Proceed to Approval.  
             **No Path:**  
                - **Activity:** Discrepancy Communication *(Accounts Payable Clerk  Purchasing Officer)*  
                - Purchasing evaluates & may contact Supplier (potentially via Supplier Relationship Manager).  

                 **Gateway [EXCLUSIVE]:** Can Discrepancy be Resolved?  
                  - **Yes Path:** Update Invoice/Purchase Order  Loop back to *Verify Line Items*.  
                  - **No Path:**  
                      **Activity:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor *(Accounts Payable Clerk  AP Supervisor)*  
                      - AP Supervisor intervenes to resolve or create retroactive PO.  
                      
                       **Gateway [EXCLUSIVE]:** After Escalation, Issue Resolved?  
                          - **Yes:** Return to upstream (Verify Line Items again).  
                          - **No:** Process halted; manually flagged for further review (artifact: *Invoice Hold Notice*).  

      **No Path (Receipt Not Confirmed):**  
        - **Activity:** Contact Accounts Payable for Clarification  
        -  Loop back to receipt confirmation after issue is resolved.  

5. **Activity:** Department Manager's Approval *(uplifted documents to Department Manager)*  
   - **Input Artifacts:** Validated PO, Invoice, Receipt Confirmation.  
   - **Gateway [EXCLUSIVE]:** Is Approval Granted?  

      - **Yes:** Proceed to Scheduling.  
      - **No:**  
         - **Activity:** Manager's Rejection Communication *(Department Manager  Accounts Payable)*  
         -  Returns to resolve discrepancy or correct invoice  loop back to upstream steps.  

6. **Activity:** Schedule Payment *(Accounts Payable)*  
   - Output: Payment Authorization.  

**End Event:** Payment Scheduling Completed  

---

Wait, maybe I should structure this in a more step-by-step gateways. Also, some parts need to be clearer.

Alternatively, a clearer textual BPMN description:

---

**Process Flow:**

**Start:** Invoice Received  

1. **Check PO Number** (AP Clerk)  
   - No PO  Reject (send back to supplier).  
   - Yes  Next.  

2. **Log Invoice in System** (AP).  

3. **Forward to Purchasing for Receipt Check** (AP  Purchasing).  

4. **Purchasing Confirms Receipt** (Purchasing Officer)  
   - **Outcome:**  
     - Receipt Verified  Proceed.  
     - **Discrepancy (delay in delivery):**  
       Output issue to AP  Escalate? (Vendor via Karen?)  
       (Wait, according to Dan’s account, Purchasing may handle delay.)  

5. **AP Matches PO to Invoice** (AP Clerk)  
   - Verified alignment  Proceed.  
   - **Mismatch:**  

       **Gateway [Gateway 1]:**  
       A. Discrepancy in **PO-vs-Invoice Match** (quantities, pricing, etc.)   
           - **Activity:** Contact Purchasing (email) for clarification.  

               **Gateway [1a]:**  
               - Purchasing resolves/discrepancy  Repeat **PO-Invoice Matching** (Step 5).  
               - **Unresolved**  **Escalate to Supervisor** (to Rita).  

                   **Gateway [1b]:**  
                   - After escalation, resolution possible  Repeat Step 5.  
                   - **Still Unresolved**  **Reject Invoice** (maybe…?)  

6. **Purchasing Validation Approval Returned**  (Wait, not sure)

Assuming Step 5 passes:

7. **Forward to Department Manager for Final Approval** (AP).  

8. **Mgr Approval** (Carlos)  
   - **Approved**  Payment Scheduling (AP).  
   - **Rejected**   
       - **Activity:** Resolve Rejection Reasons (Back to AP, recheck steps 4-6).  

9. **Schedule Payment** (AP  completed process).  

---

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Let me try to formalize it with activities linked with gateways.

**BPMN Textual Description:**

---

**Invoice Approval Process Workflow**

**Start Event:** Invoice Received  

1. **Activity:** *Check for Valid Purchase Order (PO) Number*  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Input Artifact:** Invoice  
   - **Output Artifact:** PO Validation Report (Yes/No)  

   - **Gateway [Exlusive]:** **No PO Found?**  
     - Yes  **Activity:** *Return Invoice for Missing PO* (send request to supplier via email).  
          End Sub-Process (until corrected invoice is received).  
     - No  Proceed.  

2. **Activity:** *Log Invoice into Accounting System*  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Output Artifact:** Registered Invoice ID

   - **Outcome Artifact:** *Validation Conclusion* (Success/Failure)  

   **Gateway:** *Purchasing Validation Complete?*  
      Yes (both steps ok)   
          - **Activity:** *Return Validation Success* to AP (via email confirmation).  

      No   
          - **Activity:** *Identify/Diagnose Issue* (Purchasing)  
              - Options:  
                  i. Partner communication via Karen to resolve (e.g., missing PO#, wrong quantity).  
                  ii. Wait, purchasing might loop with AP to resolve...)  

          - ** Gateway:** *Issue Resolved by Purchasing?*  
              Yes  Loop to Step 4a.  
              No  **Output:** Escalation to AP (specific error notice).  

5. **Activity (AP):** *Receive and Process Purchasing Validation Result*  

   **Gateway:** *Was Validation Successful?*  
      Yes  Proceed.  
      No   

          **Activity:** * Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)* if unresolved,  
              OR send back to purchasing/purchasing/ supplier for action.  

          - **Gateway [Gateway 2]:** *Issues Resolved via Escalation?*  
              Yes  Loop back to *Purchasing Validation Process* (Step 4).  
              No  **Activity:** *Invoice Rejection* (terminate path).  

6. **Activity:** *Forward to Department Manager for Approval*  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable  Department Manager  
   - **Input Artifacts:** Invoice, PO, Validation Results  

7. **Gateway:** *Manager’s Approval Received?*  
   - Yes  *Schedule Payment* (Final step by AP, process Ends).  
   - No   
           **Activity:** *Resolve Manager’s Rejection* (Determine root cause  loop to relevant steps).  
              - (e.g., return to Purchasing if discrepancies, request further docs.)  

**End Event:** Payment Scheduled  

---

I think this captures most steps, including gateway decisions, roles, and possible exceptions. Need to ensure clearly mentioning exception paths. Let me revise with better landmark steps:

Perhaps the textual description should list each step with its conditions and possible forks.

Final attempt incorporating all points:

**Structured BPMN-like text model**:

--- 

**Process: Accounts Payable Invoice Approval Workflow**

**1. Start Event:** Invoice is received by Accounts Payable.

---

**2. Input Handling Phase:**

**Activity:** **Verify Purchase Order (PO) Number Attached** (Accounts Payable Clerk)  
   - Input: Invoice.  
   - Condition Check: PO number is valid and referenced on invoice?  
     - **NO ** **Route:** *Return to Supplier* – Send email requesting PO details. (Process Ends here until corrected invoice arrives).  
     - **YES ** Proceed.  

**Activity:** **Log Invoice in Accounting System** (AP Clerk)  
   - Records invoice details into the system.  

---

**3. Confirmation and Validation Phases:**

**Activity:** **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Delivery Confirmation** (AP  Purchasing Department).  

**Sub-Process:** **Purchasing Validation**  
   **Roles:** Purchasing Officer, Supplier Relationship Manager (if needed)  

   a. **Activity:** *Confirm Goods/Services Receipt* (Purchasing Officer checks if goods match PO in terms of delivery and quantity).  

   b. **Activity:** *Validate Invoice vs. PO Line Items* (Verify pricing, quantities, service details match PO).  

   **Gateway [Exclusive]:** *Validation Complete?*  
     - **Successful Validation (both steps confirmed):**  
          **Activity:** *Confirmation Sent to AP* (e.g., email).  
     - **Discrepancy Found/Validation Failed:*  
          **Activity:** *Identify Root Cause (e.g., PO mismatch, missing item)*.  
          **Gateway [Exclusive]:** *Remedial Option:*  
              - Purchasing can:  
                  **1.** *Contact Supplier Directly* (via Karen if needed) to resolve discrepancies.  
                  **2.** Inform AP Clerk to defer invoice until issue resolved.  

              **Outcome:**  
                  - If resolved  **Loop to *Validation Steps a-b***.  
                  - If unresolved  **Forward issue details to Accounts Payable for escalation**.  

---

**4. Final Checks and Manager Review:**

**Activity:** **Invoice Reassessment by AP Clerk After Validation** (AP/Clerk)  
   *Cross-checks final alignment of PO, delivery confirmaton, and invoice.*  

**Activity:** **Prepare Manager’s Approval Request** (AP  Department Manager)  
   Attachments: Validated PO & Invoice docs.  

**Activity:** **Manager’s Final Approval** (Department Manager)  
   - **Output:** *Approval Grant/Rejection*.  
   - **Gateway [Exclusive]:**  
       **Approved  Proceed to Payment Scheduling.**  
       **Rejected  *Resolve Rejection*:**  
           - Send back to relevant prior step (e.g., Purchasing, AP) for adjustment.  

---

**5. Payment Processing:**

**Activity:** **Schedule Payment for Release** (Accounts Payable)  
   - Input: Approved Invoice.  
   - Output: Payment authorization processed via accounting system.  
   - Any delay/exception here would trigger further audit but typically employs standard paths.  

**End Event:** Payment Process Initiated.  

---

**Exception/Irregular Pathways**:

a. **Supplier Delay/Missing PO:** (Back to step 2 via loop).  
b. **AP-Clerk Escalations:** If discrepancies persist post-Purchasing review   

   **Activity:** *Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor* (Rita).  
   Rita may:  
      - Coordinate with consumers/departments to create retroactive PO.  
      - Overrule discrepancies if justified  re-engages steps 3 & 4.  

c. **Unclear Rejection by Manager:**  
   - Manager may flag over-budget expenses  alerts Finance dept, delays payment.  

---

**Key Artifacts:**  
- **Invoice (Physical/Digital copy) with PO reference.**  
- **PO document with order details** (quantities, pricing).  
- **System confirmation email** of receipt (issued by Purchasing).  
- **Approval Grant emails/Flutter signatures**.  

**Roles/Participants:**  
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Primary operational).  
2. **Purchasing Officer** (Delivery & PO checks).  
3. **Department Manager** (Approval authority).  
4. **AP Supervisor** (Dispute resolution).  
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Intervention on clear disputes).  
6. **Vendors/Suppliers** (External to the process steps).

This structure should cover all tasks, gateways, roles, etc. indicated in the interviews, incorporating exceptions and alternate routes while noting gaps where accounts disagree (like PO vs invoice validation steps). It's structured to be converted into a BPMN diagram with clear decisions and loops.

**BPMN-like Textual Process Model for Invoice Approval Workflow**  

---

### **Process: Accounts Payable Invoice Approval Workflow**  

---

#### **1. Start Event:** Invoice is received by Accounts Payable.  

---

#### **2. Input Handling Phase**  
**Activity:** **Verify Purchase Order (PO) Number Attached**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
- *Input Artifact:* Invoice.  
- **Condition:** Is a valid PO number attached to the invoice?  
  - **No ** **Route:** *Return to Supplier* via email (request PO details; process terminates until revision).  
  - **Yes ** Proceed.  

**Activity:** **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk  
- *Output:* Registered invoice record in system (ID, timestamp, attachments).  

---

#### **3. Confirmation and Validation Phases**  
**Activity:** **Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Delivery Confirmation**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk  *To:* Purchasing Department.  

**Sub-Process:** **Purchasing Validation**  
- **Roles:** Purchasing Officer (primary), Supplier Relationship Manager (as requested).  

1. **Activity:** **Confirm Goods/Services Receipt** (Purchasing Officer):  
   - Verify if the goods/services were delivered and quantity matches PO.  

2. **Activity:** **Validate Invoice vs. PO Line Items** (Purchasing Officer):  
   - Compare invoice details (quantities, pricing, etc.) with PO terms.  

**Gateway [Exclusive]:** **Validation Complete Successfully?**  
- **Yes ** **Output:** Send confirmation to AP (via email).  
- **No ** **Action:**  
   - **Activity:** *Identify & Escalate Discrepancy* (e.g., missing items, pricing error).  
   - **Gateway [Exclusive]:** Choose remediation path:  
     - *A1. Purchasing contacts Supplier directly* (via Supplier Relationship Manager, Karen, if needed)  Update invoice or correct PO.  
     - *A2. Inform AP Clerk for delay*  Halts invoice until resolution.  

   - **Upon Resolution:** Loop to **Validation Steps (a–b)** to retry.  
   - **Unresolvable?  FORWARD DISCREPANCY TOAccounts Payable Clerk FOR FURTHER ACTION.**  

---

#### **4. AP Clerk Reassessment**  
**Activity:** **Verify Line Item Match After Validation**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk.  
- *Condition:* Ensure PO, receipt, and invoice align post-purchase validation.  

---

#### **5. Manager’s Final Approval**  
**Activity:** **Forward Invoice to Department Manager for Approval**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable  *To:* Department Manager.  
- *Inputs:* Validated PO, invoice, and receipt confirmation.  

**Gateway [Exclusive]:** **Is Manager’s Approval Received?**  
- **Yes ** Proceed to **Schedule Payment**.  
- **No **  
  - **Activity:** *Resolve Rejection* (Spell out reason):  
    - If valid (e.g., item not budgeted), loop to corrected invoice path.  
    - If invalid, escalates to AP Supervisor for override.  

---

#### **6. Payment Scheduling**  
**Activity:** **Schedule Payment Release**  
- *Role:* Accounts Payable.  
- *Output:* Payment authorization (automated or manual).  

**End Event:** Process terminates after payment is queued.  

---

#### **Exception/Irregular Pathways**  

1. **Supplier Missing/Invalid PO Number** (Step 2):  
   - Invoice returned for revision; wait for corrected submission.  

2. **Escalations to Accounts Payable Supervisor** (Rita):  
   - *Triggered if:* Discrepancies persist post-Purchasing review.  
   - **Resolution Actions:**  
     - Negotiate remediation with suppliers.  
     - Create retroactive PO for untraceable invoices.  
     - Re-engages validation steps (Back to **Purchasing Validation**).  

3. **Manager’s Rejection of Invoice:**  
   - Failure reason fed into root cause analysis (RCA)  Loop to prior checkpoint (e.g., validation or AP check).  

---

#### **Critical Artifacts**  

| **Artifact** | **Description** | **Owner** |  
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|  
| Invoice | Original invoice with vendor details | External Supplier |  
| Purchase Order (PO) | Contract linking delivery/service to vendor | Accounts Payable/Purchasing |  
| Receipt Confirmation | Formal acknowledgment of delivery match | Purchasing Officer |  
| Approval Notifications | Digital/email signatures | Department Manager |  

---

#### **Roles/Participants**  
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Primary workflow executor).  
2. **Purchasing Officer** (Delivery & PO validation).  
3. **Department Manager** (Approval authority).  
4. **AP Supervisor** (Dispute escalation point).  
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** (External coordination).  

---

#### **Explanation of Flow Decisions**  
1. **Validation Split:** While stakeholders differ slightly on responsibility (matching PO vs. receipt confirmation details), this version assumes Purchasing handles *both* (receipt and PO details), with AP acting as administrator.  
2. **Loops/Retries:** Escalations ensure non-blocking resolution cycles.  
3. **Uncertainties Noted:** Ambiguities remain on precise task ownership (e.g., PO vs. receipt checks are resolved via Purchasing’s Sub-Process).
