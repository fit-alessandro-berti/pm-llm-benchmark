# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Assembly Line

## Event Grouping & Activity Labels

Based on pattern analysis of the sensor readings, I have identified **5 distinct activities** across the 15 events:

---

## **Activity 1: Idle/Standby**
**Events: 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15**

| Metric | Reading |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature | ~20–21°C |
| Pressure | 1 bar |
| Vibration | 0 Hz |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 0 mm |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh |

**Rationale:** All sensor readings are at baseline/minimal levels. The machine is powered on but not actively processing. Tool position is at origin (0 mm), no vibration, no material movement, and minimal energy consumption suggests the system is waiting for the next operation or between shift cycles.

## **Activity 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events: 4, 5, 6**

| Metric | Reading |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature | 50–58°C |
| Pressure | 1–1.5 bar |
| Vibration | 30–38 Hz |
| Material Flow | 5 units/s |
| Tool Position | 5–10 mm (increasing) |
| Energy | 2.00–3.00 kWh |

**Rationale:** 
- **Rising temperature** (5058°C) indicates friction from cutting action
- **High vibration levels** (30–38 Hz) are characteristic of rotary or reciprocating cutting tools engaging material
- **Steady material flow** (5 units/s) suggests material is being actively fed through the cutting zone
- **Increasing tool position** (510 mm) indicates progressive depth of cut
- **Energy consumption spike** (up to 3.00 kWh) reflects the mechanical work of cutting

## **Activity 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events: 7, 8**

| Metric | Reading |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature | 40°C (stable) |
| Pressure | 2 bar |
| Vibration | 10 Hz (low) |
| Material Flow | 2 units/s (reduced) |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (static) |
| Energy | 2.00 kWh (consistent) |

**Rationale:**
- **Moderate, stable temperature** (40°C) suggests low-heat assembly work, not cutting
- **Low vibration** (10 Hz) indicates precise, controlled positioning rather than aggressive machining
- **Reduced material flow** (2 units/s vs. 5 in cutting) suggests smaller, discrete part insertion
- **Static tool position** (15 mm) indicates the tool has moved to an assembly station and is holding position
- **Steady energy consumption** reflects maintaining hydraulic/pneumatic pressure for part clamping/joining
- **Elevated pressure** (2 bar) suggests hydraulic or pneumatic clamping of assembled components

## **Activity 4: Welding**
**Events: 9**

| Metric | Reading |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature | 80°C (peak) |
| Pressure | 2 bar |
| Vibration | 50 Hz (highest) |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s |
| Tool Position | 15 mm (fixed) |
| Energy | 5.00 kWh (maximum) |

**Rationale:**
- **Highest temperature recorded** (80°C) is characteristic of the intense heat from arc welding or resistance welding
- **Peak vibration** (50 Hz) reflects the electromagnetic or mechanical dynamics of the welding process
- **Zero material flow** indicates no fresh material feed—working on already-positioned parts
- **Maximum energy consumption** (5.00 kWh) reflects high-power electrical current for welding
- **Static tool position** (15 mm) indicates the weld torch/electrode is locked in position over the joint
- **Elevated pressure** maintains positioning during thermal stresses

## **Activity 5: Quality Inspection/Cooling Down**
**Events: 10, 11, 12**

| Metric | Reading |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature | 8025°C (decreasing) |
| Pressure | 1 bar (normalized) |
| Vibration | 15 Hz (low) |
| Material Flow | 01 units/s |
| Tool Position | 1520 mm (final position) |
| Energy | 1.00–1.60 kWh (reduced) |

**Rationale:**
- **Rapid temperature decrease** (8025°C) reflects the cooling phase after welding, allowing the joint to solidify safely
- **Normalized pressure** (back to 1 bar) and **reduced energy** indicate the primary process has completed
- **Minimal vibration** (1–5 Hz) suggests low-speed scanning or measurement equipment moving across the weld bead
- **Slight material flow** (1 unit/s) could represent coolant/inspection fluid or part movement to inspection station
- **Tool position change** (1520 mm) indicates repositioning for final quality measurement or moving part to next station
- This phase ensures weld integrity before the part continues

## **Process Flow Summary**

```
Idle (Events 1-3)
    
Cutting Metal (Events 4-6) — Material shaped to specification
    
Assembling Parts (Events 7-8) — Components positioned and clamped
    
Welding (Event 9) — Components joined with high heat
    
Quality Inspection/Cooling (Events 10-12) — Joint cooled and verified
    
Idle (Events 13-15) — System returns to standby
```

## **Key Deduction Methods**

| Sensor | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| **Temperature** | Heat-intensive operations (cutting friction, welding arc) |
| **Vibration** | Active mechanical engagement (cutting, welding electromagnetic forces) |
| **Material Flow** | Active material processing (high in cutting, zero in welding) |
| **Tool Position** | Transition between stations and depth of cut |
| **Energy Consumption** | Process intensity (peaks during cutting and welding) |
| **Pressure** | Clamping/positioning requirements (elevated during assembly and welding) |
