### Analyzing Instance-Spanning Constraints Using Process Mining

#### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Using Event Log Data for Identification:**

Process mining allows us to extract valuable insights from raw event logs, which provide granular details on each order's journey through the fulfillment process. The provided log includes essential attributes like timestamps, resources used (e.g., pickers or stations), order types (standard vs express), destination regions, and special flags for cold-packing requirements and hazardous materials.

**Steps to Identify Constraints:**

- **Temporal Analysis:** By analyzing the start and end times of activities within each case (order), we can identify periods where resources are held up longer than necessary. For instance, if orders frequently wait at Station S7 during packing, this indicates a potential bottleneck due to resource contention.
  
- **Resource Utilization Metrics:** We calculate metrics such as average waiting time per station and the utilization rate of each shared cold-packing station over time. High utilization rates or consistently long queues could signal constraints in those areas.

- **Compliance Metrics for Hazardous Materials:** Track how often more than 10 hazardous orders are present concurrently across all packing/quality check stations. This metric helps quantify regulatory constraint violations and their potential impact on overall throughput.

**Metrics to Measure Impact:**

1. **Resource Waiting Time:** Calculate the cumulative waiting time due to resource contention (e.g., cold-packing station delays). This differentiates between actual order processing delays caused by shared resources versus purely internal process inefficiencies.
   
2. **Batch Completion Delays:** Track how long orders in a batch wait for subsequent orders to finish, especially at shipping label generation or packing stations when multiple orders share these tasks.

3. **Priority Order Penetration Delay:** Measure the additional time standard orders are delayed due to express orders requiring resources (like cold-packing). This metric highlights interactions between priority handling and shared resource constraints.

4. **Hazardous Material Compliance Overheads:** Quantify the instances where regulatory limits on simultaneous hazardous processes were breached, noting how often they occur and their duration.

**Differentiating Within-Instance vs Between-Instance Factors:**

- **Within-Instance Delays:** These are due to prolonged activity durations within a single order instance (e.g., unusually long packing time for an express order).
  
  *Example:* A standard order taking significantly longer than usual at the cold-packing station, possibly indicating inefficiency or resource exhaustion.

- **Between-Instance Delays:** These arise from external factors like shared resource unavailability, batch waiting periods, or regulatory limits affecting multiple orders simultaneously.
  
  *Example:* Multiple hazardous orders queued for packing due to a limit of ten active processes, leading to delays not tied directly to any single order’s processing time.

#### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Interactions Between Constraints:**

- **Express Orders and Cold-Packing:** When an express order requires cold-packing, it can block access for standard orders even if the latter doesn’t need that resource immediately. This direct interaction creates a bottleneck in the shared station queue.
  
  *Example:* If Express Order ORD-5002 needs to use Station S7 due to perishable goods but must wait while Standard Order ORD-5001 finishes, it indirectly delays other standard orders waiting for cold-packing availability.

- **Batching vs Hazardous Material Limits:** Batching might inadvertently group hazardous orders destined for the same region. If regulatory limits restrict simultaneous processing of hazardous orders beyond ten, the batch formation algorithm may need adjustment to avoid exceeding compliance thresholds.
  
  *Example:* A batch containing multiple hazardous orders must wait until other non-hazardous items are processed or additional temporary stations become available.

- **Priority Handling and Resource Allocation:** Express orders often have tighter delivery windows that might force standard processes to be paused. If a high-priority order also needs cold-packing resources, it could delay not just itself but any subsequent standard orders using the same station.
  
  *Example:* An express order arrives during packing of a standard order requiring cold-packing; the process must halt until either clears its bottleneck or another worker is reallocated.

**Importance for Optimization:**

Understanding these interactions reveals complex dependencies that traditional resource allocation strategies might overlook. By recognizing how one constraint (e.g., hazardous material limits) can cascade through other areas (e.g., batch formation and priority handling), we can devise holistic optimization strategies addressing root causes rather than just surface symptoms.

#### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Stations**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Shared packing stations, especially cold-packing.
  
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Implement a real-time resource allocation algorithm that dynamically assigns available pickers to the nearest available station based on priority (express orders first).
  - Utilize historical data to predict demand surges for specific resources (e.g., increased requests for cold-packing during peak seasons) and proactively reserve additional staff or temporary stations.
  
- **Data/Analysis Leveraged:**
  - Use clustering techniques on event log timestamps to identify patterns in resource usage spikes (e.g., heightened activity at cold-packing just before major holidays).
  - Predictive analytics can forecast when a station is likely to become free, enabling preemptive reassignments.

- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced waiting times for both standard and express orders needing shared resources by optimizing allocation based on real-time demand forecasts. Improved throughput as resource contention decreases, leading to lower average order processing times.

**Strategy 2: Dynamic Batching Logic**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Batch formation delays influenced by hazardous material limits.
  
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Develop a dynamic batching algorithm that assesses the composition of orders in real-time. It would temporarily split batches if adding an additional order (e.g., another hazardous item) risks exceeding regulatory limits or causing excessive wait times for other orders within the batch.
  - Integrate compliance checks as part of batch formation, allowing the system to automatically adjust groupings based on current resource constraints and regulatory status.
  
- **Data/Analysis Leveraged:**
  - Analyze historical batching data to identify thresholds where delays frequently occurred (e.g., batches containing >7 hazardous orders with multiple regions).
  - Use decision trees or rule-based systems to evaluate batch feasibility in real-time, considering both the number of hazardous items and destination region diversity.

- **Expected Outcomes:** Decreased waiting times for non-hazardous orders by preventing unnecessary batching that violates compliance. Enhanced flexibility in adjusting batches dynamically as conditions change during processing.

**Strategy 3: Priority Scheduling with Regulatory Compliance Filters**

- **Primary Constraint Addressed:** Balancing express order priorities against regulatory limits on hazardous material processing.
  
- **Proposed Changes:**
  - Introduce a two-tier scheduling system where express orders are processed first *within* their compliance constraints. If an express order requires cold-packing, the system would temporarily halt less critical standard processes until either the express order completes or another suitable resource becomes available without violating regulatory limits.
  - Implement ‘Compliance Windows’ during which only non-express (standard) orders with low hazard counts are allowed to occupy certain resources, ensuring that high-urgency express tasks get precedence without jeopardizing compliance.
  
- **Data/Analysis Leveraged:**
  - Use case analysis to identify patterns where regulatory limits were breached due to aggressive priority handling. Apply statistical process control charts to detect when deviations from optimal throughput occurred under specific conditions (e.g., many hazardous orders in the same region).
  - Model decision trees that evaluate the trade-offs between express urgency and compliance constraints, adjusting scheduling rules accordingly.

- **Expected Outcomes:** Improved on-time delivery rates for express orders while maintaining regulatory compliance. Reduced overloads at critical resources during peak periods by dynamically adjusting processing priorities based on real-time data analysis.

#### 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Techniques:**

Before implementing any changes in the live environment, simulation models can provide a risk-free testing ground to evaluate proposed strategies:

1. **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Utilize historical event log data as input parameters to simulate various scenarios under new resource allocation or batching rules. By running thousands of simulations with random variations (e.g., fluctuating demand for cold-packing), we can estimate the probability distribution of key performance indicators (KPIs) like total processing time and compliance adherence rates.

2. **Discrete Event Simulation (DES):** Build a model that captures temporal aspects such as order arrivals, resource availability changes, and regulatory limit constraints. This allows us to visualize how dynamic adjustments in strategy affect queue lengths, waiting times, and overall system throughput over time.

**Focus Areas for Simulation Models:**

- **Resource Contention:** Model scenarios where multiple orders compete for scarce cold-packing stations or hazardous material processing capacity.
  
- **Batching Delays:** Simulate batch formations with varying compositions (hazardous vs non-hazardous) to observe impacts on wait times and regulatory compliance.
  
- **Priority Interactions:** Test the effect of express order interruptions on downstream processes, particularly when mixed with cold-packing or hazardous material orders.

**Evaluation Metrics in Simulation:**

- End-to-end delivery time for both standard and express orders.
- Compliance rate adherence (percentage of batches meeting hazardous material limits).
- Throughput improvement percentage compared to baseline metrics from the event log analysis.

#### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics & Dashboards:**

To ensure ongoing effectiveness post-implementation, establish a robust monitoring framework:

1. **Resource Utilization Dashboard:** Track real-time utilization rates of shared packing stations and hazardous material processing units. This dashboard should highlight overloads or underutilizations in near-real time.

2. **Batch Formation Efficiency Tracker:** Monitor batch sizes, compositions (hazardous vs non-hazardous), and completion times to ensure batches are neither too small nor too large relative to regulatory constraints.

3. **Priority Order Impact Monitor:** Keep a log of how express orders wait or get expedited during process interruptions, providing insights into whether priority handling remains effective under new strategies.

4. **Compliance Adherence Tracker:** Continuous monitoring of regulatory compliance metrics (e.g., number of times more than ten hazardous processes are active simultaneously) to ensure no violations occur due to dynamic adjustments.

**Continuous Improvement Approach:**

- Set up automated alerts for deviations beyond predefined thresholds (e.g., sudden spikes in waiting times at cold-packing stations).
  
- Conduct regular retrospective reviews using process mining dashboards to assess whether the new strategies have led to sustained improvements or if further refinements are needed.
  
- Integrate feedback loops where operational staff can provide insights into real-world challenges faced during implementation, ensuring that data-driven decisions remain contextually relevant.

By implementing these monitoring tools and maintaining an agile approach to strategy refinement based on continuous data analysis, the fulfillment center can adapt proactively to changing demands while effectively managing complex dependencies across order instances. This structured post-implementation monitoring ensures long-term success in meeting delivery deadlines efficiently despite operational challenges.
