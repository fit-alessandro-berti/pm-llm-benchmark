Based on the provided declarative constraints, there are a few anomalies to identify:

1. The constraint 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' appears with occurrences of 0 and also as an activity before 'Request Payment'. However, it is expected that 'Request Payment' should be directly followed by 'Payment Handled', not before 'Rejected by MISSING'. So, this order does not conform to the Directly-Follows constraint.

2. There's no direct relationship between 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Request Payment'. The correct sequence should be that the employee submitting the payment has to be the same for both occurrences of 'Rejected by MISSING', as this is a required activity before requesting payment again.

3. There's no direct relationship between 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR' and 'Payment Handled'. The correct sequence should be that the employee submitting the payment has to be the same for both occurrences of 'Rejected by MISSING', as this is a required activity before requesting payment again, which in turn requires a second occurrence of 'Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR' at some later point.

These anomalies do not conform with the Directly-Follows constraint and suggest that there's an inconsistency or missing information in the process model.
