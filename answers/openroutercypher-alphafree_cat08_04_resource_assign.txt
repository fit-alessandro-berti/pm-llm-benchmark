**Resource Assignment Optimization Using Process Mining for TechSolve Solutions**

***

### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To optimize TechSolve's resource assignments, we will employ process mining techniques to uncover the actual operational behavior using the provided event log data. The analysis will span:

#### Agent Performance Metrics

**Individual Agents**

*  **Utilization:** Calculate each agent's active work time as a percentage of logged-in availability. Identify underutilized (B14: 28%) vs. overloaded agents (A03: 84%) through utilization heat maps.
*   **Average Handling Time (AHT):** Track across priority levels and categories. Analyze outliers, for example, P2 Network tickets in L2 averaging 153 mins (B09) vs. 96 mins (B10).
*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR):** Calculate for L1 agents to identify skill gaps. Compare Agent A02's FCR for P3 Hardware (18%) vs. overall rate (35%).

**Support Tiers**

*  **Queue Length Trends:** Visualize how many tickets await processing in each tier. Detect persistent L2/L3 backlogs, e.g., L2 CRM-related averaging 12 tickets while L1 averages 6.
*  **Inter-Tier Escalation Patterns:** Analyze handoff delays and patterns. Identify L2 specialists (B12) getting 54% of escalated 'Application-CRM' vs. expected 25% workload by skill.

#### Process Mining Techniques

*  **Role Discovery:** Compare defined (L1, L2, L3) vs. actual roles in ticket assignments, revealing hidden 'pseudo-L2' agents handling P2 issues at L1.
*   **Sequence Clustering:** Identify common ticket escalation pathways, e.g., A05  B14  C03 for Software-App/Access Management P2 incidents.
*   **Handoff Analysis:** Use social network diagrams to visualize cross-tier interactions and find agents causing >30% of reassignments (Agent B11: 64 reassigned cases).

#### Skill Utilization Analysis

*  **Direct Matching:** Count exact skill-to-requirement matches (e.g., App-CRM) and mismatched escalations (42% of CRM tickets escalated unnecessarily beyond L2).
*  **Proximity Analysis:** Identify agents whose skills *nearly* match via skill ontology/taxonomy. For example, SQL specialists (14 agents) being assigned 67% of Database-related incidents but only 32% of total queries.
*  **Skill Gap Detection:** Use decision mining to understand if skills gaps lead to escalations (9/10 times L1 Basic-Troubleshooting to L2 App-CRM escalation indicates a possible training area).

### 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

Pinpointing specific resource issues begins with correlating performance metrics:

*  **Skill-Based Bottlenecks:** Identify 4:1 demand-availability imbalance for Network-Firewall skills. Visualize how Agent C02's 150+ mins handling time (L3 avg) creates a downstream bottleneck for P1 Network tickets.   
*  **Reassignment Delays:** Calculate per-reassignment delay by quantifying Agent B16's assignment-reassignment cycle (avg. 75 mins) vs. direct assignments by B07 (avg. 45 mins). Aggregate average delay caused per reassignment = 21 mins per P2 ticket.
*  **Initial Assignment Accuracy:** Analyze P2 'Security-IAM' tickets: 76% get rerouted from initial L1 agents to L2 within 2 hours, suggesting mis-categorization in 30% of initial dispatches.  
*  **Overloaded Agents:** Compare high-utilization agents (>75%) with workload distribution. Identify Agent A07 carrying L1 'Software-OS' workload 30% higher than average during peak hours.
*  **SLA Breach Correlation:** Correlate SLA breaches (P2/P3) with agent-specific handling times. Show 54% of breached P2 tickets were escalated from Agent A04 without proper skill alignment.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Multiple factors contribute to the resource assignment inefficiencies:

*  *Deficient Assignment Rules:* Confirm through variant analysis that 80% of successful Software-App P3 cases followed skill-based routing (B12  B15) whereas round-robin led to a 34% escalation rate.
*  *Skill Profile Inaccuracies:* Identify discrepancies between recorded skills (DB-SQL) and actual assignments (DB-Oracle), suggesting mismatched profiles for 17% of specialists.
*  *Poor Categorization:* Use decision mining to show that inaccurate initial ticket categorization leads to 45% unnecessary escalations, particularly for Network/Firewall P3 cases.
*  *Visibility Limitations:* Map L1 agent workload during escalation patterns and demonstrate how 76% of escalations happen when L1 agents had >3 active tickets.
*  *Insufficient L1 Empowerment:* Analyze high-FCR L1 agents' skill profiles and correlate with self-resolved complex incidents like Agent A08 (FCR 46% vs. avg. 33%)

### 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

1.  **Data-Driven Skill-Based Routing:**

    *   **Issue Addressed:** Reduces skill mismatch escalations
    *   **Implementation:** Ontology-based skills matching with proficiency weighting (e.g., 'CRM-Application': proficiency level 1-5)
    *   **Data Required:** Updated skill profiles, proficiency scores, historical assignment data
    *   **Expected Benefits:** 25% reduction in L2 escalations, 15% decrease in SLA breaches    

2.  **Workload-Aware Assignment Algorithm:**

    *   **Issue Addressed:** Misallocation due to inconsistent workload distribution
    *   **Implementation:** Real-time workload metric monitoring with dynamic assignment based on queue length and agent availabilities
    *   **Data Required:** Agent status logs, real-time ticket queue data, historical handling time distributions
    *   **Expected Benefits:** 20% decrease in assignment delays, 10% improvement in agent utilization balance    

3.  **Predictive Assignment Based on Ticket Characteristics:**

    *   **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial ticket classification
    *   **Implementation:** Natural language processing (NLP) model analyzing incident descriptions to predict required skills and severity
    *   **Data Required:** Historical ticket text data, incident resolution pathways
    *   **Expected Benefits:** 35% reduction in P2/P3 misroutings, more accurate initial assignments

### 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

*  **Simulation:** Create scenario simulations with configurable assignment rule variations to test skill-based routing vs. workload distribution impacts. For instance, simulating the skill-based routing strategy in a busy period could demonstrate a 15% reduction in SLA breaches.
*  **Monitoring:** 

    1.  **Resource Utilization:** Visual dashboards showing agent utilization rates, average handling times, and workload trends to detect hot zones
    2.  ***Handover Heatmaps:*** Visualize frequency and patterns of reassignments and escalations to identify friction points 
    3.  **Skill Gap Monitor:** Show unfilled skill demand to reallocate training or cross-training programs
