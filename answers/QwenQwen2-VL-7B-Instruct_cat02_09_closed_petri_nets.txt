Sure, here are the opposite concepts and more general concepts, along with their explanations, for the given list of concepts in the Petri nets field:

* **Source Place**: The opposite concept to a source place is a *sink place*. A sink place is a place that has no outgoing transitions and is used to represent a system's termination or a final state.
  * **Bounded Net**: The opposite concept to a bounded net is an *unbounded net*. An unbounded net has no limits on the number of tokens that can be present in any place.
  * **Live Transition**: The opposite concept to a live transition is a *dead transition*. A dead transition is a transition that cannot fire because it has no tokens in its input places.
  * **Free Choice Net**: The opposite concept to a free choice net is a *concurrent net*. A concurrent net has multiple arcs connecting the same two places, allowing multiple transitions to fire simultaneously.
  * **Immediate Transition**: The opposite concept to an immediate transition is a *timed transition*. A timed transition has a delay associated with its firing, allowing the system to evolve over time.

These are just some examples of opposite and more general concepts that can be defined for Petri nets. The specific opposite and more general concepts depend on the context and the specific properties of the Petri nets being considered.
