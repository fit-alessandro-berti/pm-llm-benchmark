To create a comprehensive event log suitable for process mining, we need to integrate the data from the provided tables. Below is the step-by-step process to achieve this, followed by the final event log in Markdown format.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify Cases**: Use `order_id` as the case identifier.
2. **Derive Activities**:
   - **Order Created**: From the `Orders` table.
   - **Items Picked**: From the `Order Lines` table.
   - **Order Dispatched**: From the `Delivery` table.
   - **Order Arrived**: From the `Delivery` table.
   - **Invoice Issued**: From the `Invoice` table.
   - **Payment Received**: From the `Payments` table.
3. **Map Timestamps**: Ensure each event has a timestamp.
4. **Combine Data**: Link each event using the keys provided.
5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: Include the resource or actor responsible for the event.

### Assumptions Made
- **Order Arrival**: For orders with multiple deliveries, each delivery arrival is recorded as a separate event.
- **Invoice Issued**: Multiple invoices for the same order are recorded as separate events.
- **Payment Received**: Multiple payments for the same invoice are recorded as separate events.
- **Items Picked**: Each item picking is recorded as a separate event to maintain granularity.

This event log provides a comprehensive view of the order lifecycle from creation to payment, including all relevant activities and timestamps.
