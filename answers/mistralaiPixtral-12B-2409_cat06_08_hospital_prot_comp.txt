To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their execution times. Here are the main differences based on the provided data:

### Differences in Process Variants:

1. **Initial Registration:**
   - **Protected Group:** Registers at either ER (Emergency Room) or FD (First Department).
   - **Unprotected Group:** Primarily registers at FD and undergoes an "Expert Examination" more frequently.

2. **Expert Examination:**
   - **Protected Group:** Expert Examination is more common but not as prevalent as in the unprotected group.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Expert Examination is a standard part of the process for a significant number of individuals, often followed by a thorough examination.

3. **Thorough Examination:**
   - **Protected Group:** Thorough Examination is part of several process variants.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Thorough Examination is even more prevalent and often follows an Expert Examination.

4. **Diagnosis and Treatment:**
   - **Protected Group:** Diagnosis and treatment are standard, but there are more variants involving unsuccessful treatments requiring repeated diagnosis and treatment.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Diagnosis and treatment are standard, but there are fewer variants involving repeated unsuccessful treatments.

5. **Discharge:**
   - **Protected Group:** Discharge is a common endpoint, but there are more instances of unsuccessful treatments before discharge.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Discharge is a common endpoint, but fewer instances of unsuccessful treatments before discharge.

### Differences in Execution Times:

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Protected Group:** The performance metrics are generally lower than those of the unprotected group, indicating potentially longer or more complex processes.
   - **Unprotected Group:** The performance metrics are generally higher, indicating potentially shorter or less complex processes.

2. **Successful vs. Unsuccessful Treatments:**
   - **Protected Group:** More frequent instances of unsuccessful treatments leading to repeated diagnosis and treatment before discharge.
   - **Unprotected Group:** Fewer instances of unsuccessful treatments, suggesting a more straightforward path to discharge.

### Unfair Differences:

1. **Initial Registration and Expert Examination:**
   - The unprotected group undergoes Expert Examination more frequently, which might indicate a more rigorous initial assessment. This could lead to earlier identification of complex cases, potentially resulting in more efficient treatment.

2. **Thorough Examination:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of thorough examinations, which might suggest a more comprehensive diagnostic process. This could result in more accurate diagnoses and better treatment outcomes.

3. **Unsuccessful Treatments:**
   - The protected group has more instances of unsuccessful treatments requiring repeated diagnosis and treatment. This could indicate disparities in the quality of initial treatment or diagnostic accuracy.

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - The higher performance metrics for the unprotected group suggest that their processes are more efficient. This could be due to better resource allocation, more streamlined processes, or more effective treatment protocols.

### Conclusion:

The main unfair differences lie in the initial registration and examination processes, the frequency of thorough examinations, and the number of unsuccessful treatments. The unprotected group appears to have more rigorous initial assessments, more comprehensive diagnostic processes, and fewer instances of unsuccessful treatments, leading to potentially more efficient and effective treatment outcomes. These differences could point to systemic disparities in the healthcare processes for the protected and unprotected groups.
