To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their execution times. Here are the main differences based on the provided data and domain knowledge:

1. **Expert Examination**:
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of processes starting with "Register at ER" or "Register at FD" followed by "Expert Examination" compared to the 'unprotected' group.
   - The 'protected' group also has more process variants involving "Expert Examination" before "Thorough Examination" or "Diagnosis".
   - The 'unprotected' group has a significantly higher frequency of processes starting with "Expert Examination" followed by "Thorough Examination" and then "Diagnosis" and "Treatment".

2. **Thorough Examination**:
   - The 'protected' group has more process variants involving "Thorough Examination" before "Diagnosis" and "Treatment" compared to the 'unprotected' group.
   - The 'unprotected' group has a higher frequency of processes starting with "Thorough Examination" followed by "Diagnosis" and "Treatment".

3. **Treatment unsuccessful**:
   - The 'protected' group has a higher frequency of process variants involving "Treatment unsuccessful" followed by "Diagnosis" and "Treatment" again, compared to the 'unprotected' group.
   - The 'unprotected' group has more process variants involving multiple "Treatment unsuccessful" events before reaching a "Treatment successful" outcome.

4. **Discharge**:
   - The 'protected' group has more process variants where "Discharge" occurs after "Treatment successful", while the 'unprotected' group has more variants where "Discharge" occurs without a preceding "Treatment successful" event.

5. **Frequency and performance**:
   - The 'protected' group has a lower overall frequency of process variants compared to the 'unprotected' group.
   - The 'protected' group has a wider range of performance times, while the 'unprotected' group has more process variants with similar performance times.

These differences suggest that the 'protected' group may receive more thorough examinations and have more opportunities for unsuccessful treatments before achieving a successful outcome. In contrast, the 'unprotected' group may have a more streamlined process with fewer examinations and treatments. However, it is essential to consider the context and potential biases in the data when interpreting these differences.
