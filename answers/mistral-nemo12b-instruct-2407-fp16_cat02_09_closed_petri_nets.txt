Sure, I'd be happy to help explore these concepts in Petri nets and suggest their opposites and more general concepts.

1. **Source Place** - A place with no incoming arcs.
   - *Opposite*: Sink Place (a place with no outgoing arcs)
   - *More General*: Input Place (a place that can have incoming arcs, but not necessarily none)

2. **Immediate Transition** - A transition whose firing does not depend on the current marking (always ready to fire).
   - *Opposite*: Inhibitor Arc (an arc with a negative weight, inhibiting the transition from firing)
   - *More General*: Timed Transition (a transition that has an associated time delay before it can fire)

3. **Live Transition** - A transition that is always enabled in some reachable marking.
   - *Opposite*: Dead Transition (a transition that cannot be fired in any reachable marking)
   - *More General*: Persistent Transition (a transition that remains enabled for an infinite number of steps, but not necessarily at all times)

4. **Bounded Net** - A net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded.
   - *Opposite*: Unbounded Net (a net where there are places with an unbounded number of tokens)
   - *More General*: Safe Net (a net where the number of tokens in each place does not exceed 1, which includes bounded nets)

5. **Free Choice Net** - A net where every branching is unstructured and every transition has the same preset.
   - *Opposite*: Structured Net (a net with some structured branchings or transitions with different presets)
   - *More General*: Well-Structured Net (a net that can be decomposed into a series of free-choice nets and simple nets, which includes free choice nets)

Here's a brief explanation of each:

- A **Sink Place** is the opposite of a source place because it has no outgoing arcs, while a source place has no incoming arcs. An **Input Place**, on the other hand, can have incoming arcs but is not restricted to having none.

- An **Inhibitor Arc** opposes an immediate transition by inhibiting its firing based on the current marking, while an immediate transition can always fire regardless of the marking. A **Timed Transition** is more general because it introduces a time delay before firing, which isn't present in immediate transitions.

- A **Dead Transition** is the opposite of a live transition because it cannot be fired in any reachable marking, whereas a live transition can always be fired. A **Persistent Transition** is more general as it only requires being enabled for an infinite number of steps, not at all times like a live transition.

- An **Unbounded Net** opposes a bounded net by allowing places to have an unbounded number of tokens, while a bounded net restricts the number of tokens in each place. A **Safe Net** is more general as it only requires that the number of tokens does not exceed 1, which includes bounded nets.

- A **Structured Net** opposes a free choice net by having some structured branchings or transitions with different presets, while a free choice net has unstructured branchings and every transition has the same preset. A **Well-Structured Net** is more general as it can be decomposed into a series of free-choice nets and simple nets, which includes free choice nets.
