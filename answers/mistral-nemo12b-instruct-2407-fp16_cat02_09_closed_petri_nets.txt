Sure, here are the opposite and more general concepts for each of the given Petri net terms:

1. **Source Place:**
   - Opposite: **Sink Place (or Trap)**
     A sink place is a place with no outgoing arcs, meaning no transitions can fire to remove tokens from it. It's the opposite of a source place, which has no incoming arcs.
   - More General: **Place**
     A source place is a special type of place in Petri nets that has no incoming arcs.

2. **Immediate Transition:**
   - Opposite: **Delayed Transition (or Timed Transition)**
     While immediate transitions can fire as soon as they are enabled, delayed or timed transitions have an associated time delay and can only fire after this delay has passed.
   - More General: **Transition**
     An immediate transition is a specific type of transition in Petri nets that fires without any delay.

3. **Live Transition:**
   - Opposite: **Dead Transition (or Unreachable Transition)**
     A dead transition cannot be fired in any firing sequence, while a live transition can always be fired.
   - More General: **Transition**
     Live transitions are those that can always be fired given sufficient tokens; it's a property of transitions.

4. **Bounded Net:**
   - Opposite: **Unbounded Net (or K-bounded with K>)**
     In an unbounded net, there is no upper bound on the number of tokens in any place, whereas in a bounded net, this upper bound exists and is finite.
   - More General: **Petri Net**
     A bounded net is a specific type of Petri net where token counts are bounded.

5. **Free Choice Net:**
   - Opposite: **Non-free Choice Net (or Structured Net)**
     In free choice nets, any transition enabled by one place is enabled by all places connected to it, which is not the case in non-free choice nets.
   - More General: **Petri Net**
     A free choice net is a type of Petri net with a specific structural property.
