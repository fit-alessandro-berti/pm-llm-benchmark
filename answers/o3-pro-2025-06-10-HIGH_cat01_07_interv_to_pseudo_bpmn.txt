BPMN-like Textual Model  
Process Name: “Invoice Receipt-to-Payment Scheduling”

------------------------------------------------------------
POOLS & LANES
1. Supplier (external)  
2. Organisation  
   2.1 Accounts Payable – Clerk (Mary)  
   2.2 Accounts Payable – Supervisor (Rita)  
   2.3 Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   2.4 Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
   2.5 Department Manager (Carlos)  
3. Accounting System (automated services / message events)  
------------------------------------------------------------
DATA / ARTIFACTS
• Invoice (e-mail PDF)  
• Purchase Order (PO)  
• Goods / Services-Received Confirmation  
• Discrepancy Note  
• Corrected / Revised Invoice  
• Retrospective PO (for non-PO services)  
• Manager Approval Record  
------------------------------------------------------------
FLOW (each step prefixed with an ID so it can be drawn unambiguously)

S0  Start Event  “Invoice received by Accounts Payable (e-mail)”

A1  Task (APClerk)  “Check invoice for valid PO number”

G1  Exclusive Gateway  “PO number present?”  
 -–No–>  A2  “Request PO / additional details from Supplier” (e-mail)  
           Wait Intermediate Event “Corrected invoice returned”  back to A1  
 -–Yes–> continue

A3  Task (APClerk)  “Log invoice in Accounting System”  [creates ‘Invoice record’]

A4  Task (APClerk)  “Forward invoice to Purchasing for goods-receipt confirmation”  
      (implemented as system message)

B1  Task (Purchasing Officer)  “Validate invoice vs PO (qty, price, charges)”

G2  Exclusive Gateway  “Invoice consistent with PO?”  
   -–No-Discrepancy–> B2  “Place invoice ON HOLD & contact Supplier OR instruct AP to hold”  
                         Intermediate Event “Corrected / updated invoice received”  back to B1  
   -–No-PO-missing–>  B3  “Notify AP Clerk that PO is missing”  
                          (implicit) returns to A1 path G1-No  
   -–Yes–> B4  “Send confirmation e-mail to AP Clerk”  [attaches ‘Goods-Received Confirmation’]

A5  Task (APClerk)  “3-way match in Accounting System (Invoice-PO-Receipt)”

G3  Exclusive Gateway  “Match successful?”  
   -–Yes–> continue  
   -–No–>  A6  “Seek clarification from Purchasing”  
              Intermediate Gateway “Resolved?” (inclusive)  
                a) If resolved  back to A5  
                b) If NOT resolved within SLA  A7  “Escalate to AP-Supervisor”

C1  Task (AP-Supervisor)  “Investigate & co-ordinate resolution”  
      • may contact Supplier directly  
      • may involve Supplier Relationship Manager in parallel  
      • may arrange retrospective PO with Dept. Head for service invoices

G4  Exclusive Gateway  “Outcome of investigation?”  
   -–Resolved–> back to A5  
   -–Retrospective-PO created–> back to A5 (match re-attempt)  
   -–Reject–>  End Event  “Invoice Rejected / Closed”

A8  Task (AP-Clerk)  “Trigger Manager approval request”  
      (system automatically e-mails Department Manager)

D1  Task (Department Manager)  “Review & approve / reject invoice”

G5  Exclusive Gateway  “Manager decision?”  
   -–Approve–> continue  
   -–Reject or Hold–> D2  “Return to AP Clerk for further investigation”  loop to A5 or A7

A9  Task (AP-Clerk)  “Schedule invoice in next payment run”

S1  End Event  “Invoice scheduled for payment”

------------------------------------------------------------
PARALLEL / OPTIONAL SUB-PROCESS
• Any time a supplier-side clarification is required (paths B2, A6, C1),  
  an optional Call Activity “Engage Supplier Relationship Manager” starts in lane 2.4:  
     K1  “Validate contract terms / contact supplier”  
          returns information to whichever role requested it, then ends.

------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES & UNCERTAINTIES
• Interview 1 implies A5 (three-way match) happens after Purchasing confirmation (B4); Interview 2 is silent on exact order. Model assumes Mary always performs A5 before requesting manager approval (A8).  
• For non-PO service invoices the path “G1-No  C1” is used to create a retrospective PO; frequency not quantified.  
• Manager rejection frequency is “once every couple of months” (Interview 3); loop shown but occurrence rate uncertain.  
• Payment execution itself (ERP payment run) is out of scope; model ends once invoice is queued for payment.
