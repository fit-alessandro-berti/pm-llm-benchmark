The provided visualization consists of three parts, each illustrating different aspects of a lab visit and testing process using process diagrams and a table.

1. **Diagram (a): Two procelt classes connected through two channels**
   - This part shows a detailed process flow diagram for a lab visit and subsequent lab tests.
   - **Order Entry:** The process starts with a doctor ordering a test, followed by a lab assistant taking a blood sample.
   - **Order System:** The order is sent to the order system, which communicates with the Hospital Information System (HIS).
   - **Perform Test:** The chemical analyst performs the test and makes a report.
   - **Receive Result:** The lab assistant receives the result and judges it. If everything is fine, the process moves forward; otherwise, additional tests are performed.
   - **Updated Results:** If further tests are needed, the updated results are sent back through the system, and the process repeats until the results are satisfactory.
   - **Finish Lab Test:** Once the tests are complete, the lab test is finished, and the final report is sent.

   The diagram uses different shapes to represent actions (rounded rectangles), decisions (diamonds), and message flows (arrows). It also includes multiplicity indicators (e.g., 1..1, 1..*) to show the number of instances involved in each step.

2. **Diagram (b): Class diagram containing the two procelt classes**
   - This part is a simplified class diagram showing the relationship between two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test."
   - The diagram indicates that a lab visit requires one or more lab tests (1..1 to 1..*).

3. **Table (c): Example of a performative**
   - This table provides an example of a performative message exchanged in the system.
   - **Time:** The message was sent at 11:00.
   - **Channel:** The message was sent through the Order system.
   - **Sender:** The sender is the Lab visit - John.
   - **Receivers:** The receiver is the Lab test - HGB John.
   - **Action:** The action is to create a request for performing a Hemoglobin (HGB) test.
   - **Content:** The content of the message is a question asking if a HGB test can be performed for John.
   - **Scope:** The scope of the message is private.
   - **Direction:** The direction of the message is OUT (outgoing).

In summary, the visualization provides a comprehensive overview of the workflow and communication involved in conducting lab tests during a lab visit, detailing the process flow, class relationships, and an example of a performative message.
