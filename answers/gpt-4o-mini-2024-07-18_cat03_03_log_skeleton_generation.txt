Here's how you can construct the Log Skeleton for the described order fulfillment process using the specified constraints:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Receive Order': {1},
        'Check Availability': {1},
        'Reserve Items': {1},
        'Pick Items': {1},
        'Quality Check': {0, 1},  # Quality Check may not always be performed
        'Pack Order': {1},
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},
        'Dispatch': {1},
        'Invoice Customer': {1},
        'Record Payment': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        ('Receive Order', 'Check Availability'),
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch'),
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer'),
        ('Invoice Customer', 'Record Payment')
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Constraints:

- **Equivalence**: The reservation of items is directly linked to the picking of items, and both generating a shipping label and dispatching are effectively paired activities. This reflects that if one occurs, the other does too.

- **Always Before**: Each step in the process must occur in a defined order from receiving the order to recording payment.

- **Always After**: This emphasizes that certain activities occur in a sequence, which is common for processing activities.

- **Never Together**: In the order fulfillment process, certain activities like Quality Check should not coexist with Packing as it can imply an issue if items are packed if they fail quality inspection.

- **Activity Occurrences**: This defines the expected frequency of each activity, ensuring that certain tasks must occur exactly once, while others may vary depending on the situation (like Quality Check).

- **Directly Follows**: This ensures that if one activity occurs, it leads immediately to the next, enforcing the process flow. 

This structure not only adheres to the Log Skeleton framework but also presents a clear picture of the activities and constraints in the order fulfillment process.
