Okay, let's analyze the event log against the normative process description.

**Case 1:**

* **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
* **Analysis:** This case perfectly follows the "normal" sequence for sufficient inventory as described. All activities occur in the correct order.
* **Violation:** None

**Case 2:**

* **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
* **Analysis:** This case violates the normative process. The "Authorize payment" activity occurs *after* "Package items", when it should happen before. The description clearly states that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging, since payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known."
* **Violation:** Payment authorization occurs after packaging, violating the prescribed sequence.

**Case 3:**

* **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
* **Analysis:**  This case contains multiple violations. First, payment should not be authorized if inventory is insufficient and the path should be to cancel the order directly. Furthermore, the "Ship order" activity occurs *after* "Cancel order", which is explicitly prohibited by the description. It states, "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation."
* **Violation:** Payment authorization occurs when it shouldn't on the cancellation path, and shipping occurs after order cancellation.

**Case 4:**

* **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
* **Analysis:** This case follows the correct cancellation path. After checking the inventory, the order is cancelled, and then the process ends with "Close order".
* **Violation:** None

**Case 5:**

* **Sequence:** Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
* **Analysis:** This case violates the normative process because "Package items" is missing before shipping. The description says "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping". This case skips this step, proceeding from authorization to shipping.
* **Violation:** Missing the "Package items" step before shipping.

**Summary of Violations:**

* **Case 2:**  "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items".
* **Case 3:** "Authorize payment" occurs on a cancellation path, and "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order".
* **Case 5:** The "Package items" step is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order".

**In conclusion:** Cases 2, 3 and 5 violate the normative process, as described. Cases 1 and 4 do not.
