To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Identify cases that have the **exact sequence** of:
   - `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`
   - `'Create Order'`
   - `'Confirm Order'`
   
   in **immediate succession** (no other events in between).

2. Among those cases, further check whether the **time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'** is **more than 5 days**.

3. **Exclude all events** from such cases in the final output.

We’ll use **window functions** to order events by timestamp within each `case_id`, and then use **LEAD** to look ahead and detect sequences. Then, we’ll flag cases that meet both the sequence and timing condition, and finally **filter out** all events from those cases.

Here is the **DuckDB SQL query**:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        -- Get next two activities and their timestamps
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_matches AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        case_id
    FROM ordered_events
    WHERE 
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND next_next_timestamp > next_timestamp + INTERVAL 5 DAY
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    EXCEPT
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequence_matches
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
INNER JOIN filtered_cases f
    ON e.case_id = f.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

###  Explanation:

- **`ordered_events` CTE**:
  - Orders events by `timestamp` within each `case_id`.
  - Uses `LEAD()` to peek at the next and next-next activities and timestamps.
  - This allows us to detect sequences of three consecutive events.

- **`sequence_matches` CTE**:
  - Filters rows where the current activity is `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, followed immediately by `'Create Order'`, then `'Confirm Order'`.
  - Also checks that the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` (`next_timestamp` to `next_next_timestamp`) is **greater than 5 days**.
  - Extracts distinct `case_id`s that meet **both** the sequence and timing condition.

- **`filtered_cases` CTE**:
  - Gets all `case_id`s **except** those in `sequence_matches`.

- **Final `SELECT`**:
  - Returns **all events** from `event_log` that belong to cases **not excluded** by the criteria.

---

###  Notes:

- DuckDB supports `INTERVAL '5 days'` or `INTERVAL 5 DAY` — both work, but we used `INTERVAL 5 DAY`.
- The use of `EXCEPT` ensures clean removal of unwanted `case_id`s.
- The result includes **all events** from **non-matching cases**, preserving full trace data.

This query is efficient and logically correct for the specified filtering task.
