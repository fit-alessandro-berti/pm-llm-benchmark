1. **Initial Document Verification**: This name reflects the first instance of document verification in each case, which is the initial check.
2. **Re-verify Documents after Submission**: This name indicates a re-verification process after additional documents have been submitted.
3. **Re-verify Documents after Adjustment**: This name indicates a re-verification process after account adjustments have been made.
4. **Call to Request Missing Documents**: This name specifies the purpose of the call, which is to request missing documents.
5. **Call to Clarify Account Discrepancy**: This name specifies the purpose of the call, which is to clarify discrepancies in the account.
6. **Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments**: This name specifies the purpose of the follow-up call, which is to confirm account adjustments.
7. **Call to Have Customer Return**: This name specifies the purpose of the call, which is to have the customer return to the branch.

These renamed activities clearly reflect their contextual differences and roles in the process flow.
