This visualization shows a high-level model of how a “Lab Visit” process interacts with a “Lab Test” process (sometimes called “proctet” classes) through specific communication channels. In other words, it is illustrating how two related processes (or “classes”) work together, exchange messages, and move through different states to complete lab work. Below is a breakdown of each part of the figure:

---

### 1. The Main Diagram (labeled “(a)” in the figure)
- **Two proctet classes:**  
  - **Lab Visit** (on the left)  
  - **Lab Test** (on the right)  
- **States and transitions:**  
  Each box within these proctet classes (e.g., “Order entry,” “Judge results,” “Perform test,” “Make report,” etc.) represents a state in the process. The arrows between these boxes represent transitions triggered by messages or events.  
- **Roles and external systems:**  
  - You can see references to “lab assistant,” “lab specialist,” or external systems like “HIS” (Hospital Information System) or an “Order system.” These show who or what is responsible for sending or receiving messages at different points.  
- **Message flow (the dotted arrows):**  
  The dotted lines with arrowheads depict channels through which the two processes communicate. For example:
  1. **Lab Visit** sends a request for a test to the **Lab Test** process.  
  2. The **Lab Test** process performs the necessary steps (receiving the request, running the test, creating a report).  
  3. **Lab Test** then sends back results or an updated report.  
  4. If the results are incomplete or suspicious, the **Lab Visit** process can request new tests (“Do tests again”).  
  5. Finally, once the results are acceptable (“Everything is fine”), **Lab Visit** finishes by sending a final report.  

In short, the main diagram illustrates the sequence of interactions between the two processes and shows how they transition from one state to another based on the messages exchanged.

### 2. The Class Diagram (labeled “(b)”)
- This small diagram shows **Lab Visit** and **Lab Test** as two separate classes (or “proctet classes”) with a relationship:
  \[
    \text{Lab visit} \; 1..* \; \text{requires} \; 1..* \; \text{Lab test}.
  \]
  - This notation means a single Lab Visit can be associated with one or more Lab Tests, and each Lab Test is associated with at least one Lab Visit.  
- Essentially, it is a static view of how these two classes are related, whereas the main diagram (in part (a)) is a dynamic view of how they communicate and move through their states.

### 3. The Example of a Performative (labeled “(c)”)
- This table provides a concrete example of a single message or “performative” exchanged between the two proctet classes. The columns typically include:
  - **Time**: When the message is sent.  
  - **Channel**: Which communication channel is used (e.g., “Order system → Lab visit”).  
  - **Sender / Receivers**: Who is sending and who is receiving the message (e.g., “HGB John” might be the test or the patient context).  
  - **Action**: The action being performed by the message, such as “Create” (i.e., create a new lab test request).  
  - **Content**: The main content of the message (e.g., “Can you perform an HGB test?”).  
  - **Scope** and **Direction**: Additional metadata about how the message is shared (private/public, incoming/outgoing, etc.).  

This table shows how each message is formally described in the system—helpful for both technical implementation and auditing/logging.

## Putting It All Together
1. **Processes/Proctets**: You have two main processes—“Lab Visit” and “Lab Test.” Each one has its own states and internal steps.  
2. **Interactions**: These processes communicate via well-defined channels to request tests, perform tests, send reports, and confirm results.  
3. **Relationship**: The class diagram clarifies that one or more tests belong to a single lab visit.  
4. **Performative Example**: The table shows a typical message instance, including who sends it, what it contains, and how it is routed.  

Overall, the visualization is a blueprint for how a lab system might handle a patient visit (the “Lab Visit” side) and the corresponding laboratory tests (the “Lab Test” side). It captures both the static relationship (class diagram) and the dynamic message flow (the proctet diagram plus the performative example).
