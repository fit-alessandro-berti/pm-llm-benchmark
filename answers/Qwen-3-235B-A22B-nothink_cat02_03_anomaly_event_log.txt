### **Analysis of the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log for Anomalies**

The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process typically follows a standard sequence of events:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Any deviation from this sequence may indicate a **process anomaly**, such as missing steps, out-of-order execution, or skipped controls. Below is an analysis of each case and the anomalies identified.

---

## **Case 1002: Out-of-Order Execution and Missing Controls**

### **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Purchase Order Issued Before Requisition Approval**
   - **Sequence:** Create PR (8:30)  Issue PO (8:40)  Approve PR (next day at 8:00)
   - **Problem:** The Purchase Order was issued **before** the Purchase Requisition was approved. This is a **violation of standard controls**, as issuing a PO should only happen **after** proper approval. This creates a risk of **unauthorized procurement** and potential budget overruns.

2. **Invoice Received and Payment Released Before Goods Receipt**
   - **Sequence:** Vendor Invoice Received (7:00)  Release Payment (7:15)  Approve Requisition (8:00)  Receive Goods (next day at 9:00)
   - **Problem:** Payment was released **before** the goods were received. This is a **significant risk** because the company is paying for goods it has not yet confirmed receipt of. This can lead to **fraud, financial loss, or disputes** with vendors.

3. **Invoice Matching Occurred After Payment**
   - **Sequence:** Payment Released (7:15)  Match Invoice to PO (Feb 5)
   - **Problem:** Invoice matching (which ensures that the invoice matches the PO and goods received) occurred **after** payment was released. This violates the **three-way matching control**, which should be completed **before** payment to ensure accuracy and prevent overpayment or payment for undelivered goods.

## **Case 1003: Payment Released Before Invoice or Goods Received**

### **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Payment Released Before Invoice or Goods Receipt**
   - **Sequence:** Issue PO (10:00)  Release Payment (Feb 8, 11:00)  Invoice Received (Feb 9)  Goods Received (Feb 10)
   - **Problem:** Payment was released **before** the invoice was received and **before** the goods were received. This is a **major control failure**. Paying in advance without verification exposes the company to **fraud, incorrect delivery, or overpayment**.

2. **Invoice Received After Payment**
   - **Sequence:** Payment (Feb 8)  Invoice Received (Feb 9)
   - **Problem:** As with Case 1002, the invoice was received **after** payment was made, violating the **three-way matching requirement**. This can lead to unverified or incorrect payments.

---

## **Case 1004: PO Issued After Goods Receipt**

### **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued**
   - **Sequence:** Approve PR (10:15)  Receive Goods (9:00 next day)  Issue PO (9:15 same day)
   - **Problem:** Goods were received **before** the PO was issued. This is a **reversal of the proper sequence**. Goods should only be received **after** a formal PO has been issued and accepted by the vendor. This can lead to **unauthorized deliveries**, **reconciliation issues**, and **audit problems**.

---

## **Summary of Anomalies by Case**

| Case ID | Anomaly | Description | Risk |
|--------|---------|-------------|------|
| 1002   | PO issued before approval | PO issued before PR approval | Unauthorized procurement |
|        | Payment before receipt | Payment released before goods or invoice received | Financial loss, fraud risk |
|        | Invoice matched after payment | Invoice matching occurred after payment | Risk of incorrect payment |
| 1003   | Payment before invoice/goods | Payment released before invoice or goods received | Financial exposure, fraud |
|        | Invoice received after payment | Invoice received post-payment | Loss of control over payment accuracy |
| 1004   | Goods received before PO | Goods received before PO issued | Unauthorized delivery, audit issues |

---

## **Conclusion**

The anomalies identified in Cases **1002, 1003, and 1004** represent **significant deviations** from standard Procure-to-Pay best practices. These issues indicate **broken controls** in procurement, invoicing, and payment processes, which can lead to:

- **Financial risks** (overpayment, fraud)
- **Operational inefficiencies** (discrepancies, disputes)
- **Compliance violations** (missing audit trails, unauthorized actions)

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Implement automated workflow controls** to enforce proper sequence of activities.
2. **Enforce three-way matching** (PO, goods receipt, invoice) before releasing payments.
3. **Review and audit anomalous cases** to identify root causes (e.g., human error, system gaps, or fraud).
4. **Provide training** to procurement and finance staff on P2P controls and compliance.

By addressing these anomalies, the organization can strengthen internal controls and reduce financial and operational risks.
