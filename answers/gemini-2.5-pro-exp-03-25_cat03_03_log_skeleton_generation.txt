# --- Populate Constraints based on Scenario ---

# 1. Activity Occurrences (activ_freq)
# Assuming RO is the trigger and always occurs once per case (order).
# Other activities might not occur if the process is aborted or fails at some stage.
# Let's assume most standard activities occur 0 or 1 time in a typical flow.
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][RO] = {1}
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][CA] = {0, 1}
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][RI] = {0, 1}
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][PI] = {0, 1}
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][QC] = {0, 1} # Quality Check might be optional or conditional
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][PO] = {0, 1}
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][GSL] = {0, 1}

log_skeleton['activ_freq'][IC] = {0, 1} # Invoicing might happen
log_skeleton['activ_freq'][RP] = {0, 1} # Payment might or might not be recorded in this trace

# 2. Always Before / Always After (Precedence)
# Basic flow: RO -> CA -> RI -> PI -> QC -> PO -> GSL -> D
# Financial flow: IC -> RP (often parallel or after D)

# If CA occurs, RO must have happened before. If RO occurs, CA should happen after (unless aborted early).
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((CA, RO))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((RO, CA))

# If RI occurs, CA must have happened before. If CA occurs (and succeeds), RI should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((RI, CA))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((CA, RI))

# If PI occurs, RI must have happened before. If RI occurs, PI should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((PI, RI))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((RI, PI))

# If QC occurs, PI must have happened before. If PI occurs, QC should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((QC, PI))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((PI, QC))

# If PO occurs, QC must have happened before (assuming QC is mandatory step after PI).
# If QC occurs (and passes), PO should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((PO, QC))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((QC, PO))
# Also, PO requires PI fundamentally, even if QC was skipped (if that's possible)
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((PO, PI))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((PI, PO))


# If GSL occurs, PO must have happened before. If PO occurs, GSL should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((GSL, PO))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((PO, GSL))

# If D occurs, GSL must have happened before. If GSL occurs, D should happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((D, GSL))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((GSL, D))

# If IC occurs, RO must have happened before. If RO occurs, IC should happen at some point.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((IC, RO))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((RO, IC))

# If RP occurs, IC must have happened before. If IC occurs, RP might happen after.
log_skeleton['always_before'].add((RP, IC))
log_skeleton['always_after'].add((IC, RP))

# 3. Equivalence
# If an order is Packed (PO), it's reasonable to assume it must get a Shipping Label (GSL)
# and subsequently be Dispatched (D). And vice-versa, if dispatched, it must have been labeled and packed.
# This suggests equivalence between PO, GSL, and D.
log_skeleton['equivalence'].add((PO, GSL))
log_skeleton['equivalence'].add((GSL, D))
# Note: Equivalence is transitive, so (PO, D) is implied.

# 4. Never Together
# In this described process flow, there are no obvious activities that are mutually exclusive.
# This set remains empty unless specific alternative paths (e.g., 'Cancel Order') were introduced.
# log_skeleton['never_together'] = set() # Already initialized

# 5. Directly Follows
# This is a stricter constraint. Assumptions need to be made.
# - Maybe reserving items immediately follows checking availability in the system?
log_skeleton['directly_follows'].add((CA, RI))
# - Maybe quality check immediately follows picking?
log_skeleton['directly_follows'].add((PI, QC))
# - Maybe packing immediately follows quality check?
log_skeleton['directly_follows'].add((QC, PO))
# - Maybe label generation immediately follows packing at the same station?
log_skeleton['directly_follows'].add((PO, GSL))

# Convert defaultdict back to dict for cleaner output if desired

**Explanation of Choices:**

1.  **`activ_freq`**: `Receive Order` is set to `{1}` as it initiates the process. All others are `{0, 1}` to allow for flexibility – an order might be cancelled, items might be unavailable after `CA`, QC might fail, payment might not be recorded within the trace window, or QC might be an optional step.
2.  **`always_before` / `always_after`**: These capture the main sequence dependencies (e.g., you must Pick before Packing, you must Pack before Labeling). The financial steps (`IC`, `RP`) are linked to `RO` and each other.
3.  **`equivalence`**: Assumed that `Pack Order`, `Generate Shipping Label`, and `Dispatch` form a tightly coupled sequence – if one happens, the others must also happen exactly once for a successfully shipped order.
4.  **`never_together`**: Left empty as no mutually exclusive activities were described in the scenario.
5.  **`directly_follows`**: These represent stronger assumptions about immediate succession. The chosen pairs (`CA`->`RI`, `PI`->`QC`, `QC`->`PO`, `PO`->`GSL`) reflect points where automation or co-location might make immediate follow-up likely. These are interpretations and could be different based on more detailed process knowledge.
