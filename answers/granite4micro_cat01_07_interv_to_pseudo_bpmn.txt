**BPMN-like Process Model Description**

1. **Activities/Tasks:**
   - **Receive Invoice:** The invoice is received by Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) via email.
   - **Check for Valid PO Number:** Mary checks if the invoice has a valid Purchase Order (PO) number.
     - *If No:* Request additional details from the supplier and loop back to step 1.
     - *If Yes:* Log the invoice into the accounting system.
   - **Confirm Goods Receipt:** Confirm with Purchasing Department that goods/services have been received.
     - *If No:* Resolve discrepancies or request corrected invoice, then loop back to step 3.
     - *If Yes:* Proceed with matching invoice line items against PO in the system.
   - **Match Invoice Line Items to PO:** Verify quantities, prices, and charges align with the PO.
     - *If Discrepancies Found:* Contact Purchasing or Supplier for clarification; escalate to Supervisor if unresolved.
     - *If No:* Confirm with Manager that all details are correct.
   - **Manager Approval:** Manager reviews invoice in the system and approves it.
   - **Schedule Payment:** Payment is scheduled after manager's approval.

2. **Sequence Flow:**
   - The process starts when an invoice arrives at Mary's desk.
   - It proceeds through a series of checks and confirmations involving both Accounts Payable and Purchasing departments.
   - The Manager reviews the final details before payment scheduling.

3. **Gateways/Decision Points:**
   - **Does Invoice Have Valid PO Number?** (Yes/No)
     - *If No:* Loop back to Request Details from Supplier or end process with rejection if unresolved.
     - *If Yes:* Proceed to Step 2.
   - **Have Goods/Services Been Received?** (Yes/No)
     - *If No:* Resolve discrepancies and loop back to this step.
     - *If Yes:* Confirm receipt and proceed to matching steps.
   - **Do Invoice Line Items Match PO?** (Yes/No)
     - *If No:* Clarify with Purchasing or Supplier, then resolve and confirm again.
     - *If Yes:* Proceed to Manager Approval.

4. **Roles/Participants:**
   - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)
   - Purchasing Officer (Dan)
   - Department Manager (Carlos)
   - Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)
   - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

5. **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**
   - Inputs: Invoice, Purchase Order details
   - Outputs: Confirmation emails between departments, finalized invoices ready for payment

6. **Exceptions/Variations:**
   - Discrepancies in invoice details requiring clarification or escalation.
   - Missing PO numbers prompting communication with Suppliers.
   - Special cases where services are invoiced without a formal PO (handled by Department Heads).

**Note:** The model reflects the typical flow of the invoice approval process, highlighting key decision points and roles involved. Ambiguities such as alternative paths due to supplier communications or exceptional situations have been noted for clarity in implementation.
