### Brief Explanation of Added Constraints:
1. **Existence Constraints:**
   - Added `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` to ensure these activities are part of the process. This helps in manually verifying applications from sensitive demographics and performing bias mitigation checks.

2. **Init Constraints:**
   - Added `CheckApplicantRace` to ensure that the process starts with a check for sensitive attributes like race.

3. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - Enforced that `ManualReview` must coexist with decision steps involving minority applicants (`Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`). This ensures fairness and proper review for minority applications.

4. **Response Constraints:**
   - Ensured that `BiasMitigationCheck` must follow `CheckApplicantRace` to introduce a layer of fairness in handling sensitive attributes.

5. **Succession Constraints:**
   - Ensured that `FinalDecision` must follow `BiasMitigationCheck` to prevent biased outcomes without proper mitigation steps.

6. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - Prevented direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `FinalDecision` to avoid immediate biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

These constraints collectively aim to mitigate potential biases in the loan application review process by ensuring fairness and thorough review, particularly for applicants from sensitive demographics.
