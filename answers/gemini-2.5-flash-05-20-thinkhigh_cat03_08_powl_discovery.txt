To model the complex manufacturing and distribution process using POWL, we need to identify the key activities, their sequences, choices, and loops as observed in the provided event log.

**Key Observations and POWL Model Components:**

1.  **Sequential Activities:**
    *   `OR` (Order Received)
    *   `MS` (Material Sourcing)
    *   `QS` (Quality Screening)
    *   `PK` (Packaging)
    *   `DP` (Distribution Planning)
    *   `D` (Dispatch)
    These activities appear to always follow a strict sequential order.

2.  **In-line Quality Check (IQC) and Assembly (AS) Loop:**
    *   `AS` (Assembly) always occurs.
    *   `IQC` (In-line Quality Check) can occur after `AS`.
    *   `IQC` itself can be repeated multiple times (e.g., `AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS`).
    *   After one or more `IQC` activities, `AS` can be re-executed (e.g., `AS -> IQC -> AS`).
    *   `AS` can also proceed directly to `TST` without any `IQC` (Case 4).
    This structure suggests a loop where `AS` is the primary activity. After `AS`, a sub-process involving `IQC` may occur, which can then lead back to `AS`. The `IQC` activity itself can also be repeated.
    *   Let's define an inner loop for `IQC` repetition: `*(IQC, SilentTransition())`. This means `IQC` is executed, and a `SilentTransition` acts as the trigger to re-execute `IQC` or exit this inner loop.
    *   Then, an outer loop combining `AS` and the `IQC` repetition: `*(AS, IQC_repetition_loop)`. This means `AS` is executed, then either the loop exits (e.g., to `TST`), or the `IQC_repetition_loop` is executed (which can be one or more `IQC`s), and then `AS` is executed again.

3.  **Testing (TST) and Re-Testing (RT) Loop:**
    *   `TST` (Testing) always occurs after the `AS/IQC` phase.
    *   `RT` (Re-Testing) can follow `TST`. If `RT` occurs, `TST` is repeated (e.g., `TST -> RT -> TST`).
    This is a classic loop structure: `*(TST, RT)`.

4.  **Labeling (LB) Optional Choice:**
    *   `LB` (Labeling) can occur after `PK`, but it is optional (Case 2 skips `LB`).
    This is an exclusive choice: `X(LB, SilentTransition())`.

**POWL Model Construction:**

We will define individual activity `Transition` nodes, then build the nested `OperatorPOWL` structures for choices and loops, and finally assemble them into a top-level `StrictPartialOrder`.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all atomic activities as Transitions
OR_T = Transition(label="OR")
MS_T = Transition(label="MS")
QS_T = Transition(label="QS")
AS_T = Transition(label="AS")
IQC_T = Transition(label="IQC")
TST_T = Transition(label="TST")
RT_T = Transition(label="RT")
PK_T = Transition(label="PK")
LB_T = Transition(label="LB")
DP_T = Transition(label="DP")
D_T = Transition(label="D")

# Define silent transitions for loop conditions and optional paths
# This silent transition is used within the IQC repetition loop, acting as the 'B' that causes IQC to repeat
skip_IQC_cond = SilentTransition()
# This silent transition is used when LB is skipped
skip_LB = SilentTransition()

# 2. Build the IQC repetition loop: *(IQC, skip_IQC_cond)
# Definition: execute IQC_T, then either exit this loop, or execute skip_IQC_cond and then IQC_T again.
# This captures sequences like IQC, IQC -> IQC, IQC -> IQC -> IQC, etc.
IQC_repetition_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[IQC_T, skip_IQC_cond])

# 3. Build the AS and IQC main loop: *(AS, IQC_repetition_loop)
# Definition: execute AS_T, then either exit this loop, or execute IQC_repetition_loop and then AS_T again.
# This captures the patterns observed in the log:
# - AS -> TST (loop exits after initial AS)
# - AS -> IQC -> AS -> TST (IQC_repetition_loop executes IQC once, then causes AS to repeat)
# - AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> TST (IQC_repetition_loop executes IQC twice, then causes AS to repeat)
AS_IQC_main_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS_T, IQC_repetition_loop])

# 4. Build the TST and RT loop: *(TST, RT)
# Definition: execute TST_T, then either exit this loop, or execute RT_T and then TST_T again.
# This captures:
# - TST -> PK (loop exits after initial TST)
# - TST -> RT -> TST -> PK (RT_T causes TST_T to repeat)
TST_RT_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST_T, RT_T])

# 5. Build the LB choice: X(LB, skip_LB)
# Definition: execute LB_T OR execute skip_LB (meaning LB is skipped).
LB_choice_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB_T, skip_LB])

# 6. Define the root StrictPartialOrder model
# The overall process flow is sequential, connecting the major process blocks.
# There are no explicit concurrent activities based on the log.
root_nodes = [
    OR_T,
    MS_T,
    QS_T,
    AS_IQC_main_loop,  # Represents the AS and IQC logic
    TST_RT_loop,       # Represents the TST and RT logic
    PK_T,
    LB_choice_xor,     # Represents the optional LB
    DP_T,
    D_T
]

root_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=root_nodes)

# Add edges to define the sequential flow between the main process blocks
root_process.order.add_edge(OR_T, MS_T)
root_process.order.add_edge(MS_T, QS_T)
root_process.order.add_edge(QS_T, AS_IQC_main_loop)
root_process.order.add_edge(AS_IQC_main_loop, TST_RT_loop)
root_process.order.add_edge(TST_RT_loop, PK_T)
root_process.order.add_edge(PK_T, LB_choice_xor)
root_process.order.add_edge(LB_choice_xor, DP_T)
root_process.order.add_edge(DP_T, D_T)

# The 'root_process' object now contains the complete POWL model
# This object can be used for further analysis or visualization within pm4py.
