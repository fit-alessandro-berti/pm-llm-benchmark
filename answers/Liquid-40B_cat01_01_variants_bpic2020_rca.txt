Based on the provided process variants, the root causes for the performance issues in the process can be identified as follows:

1. Multiple Approval Steps: The process has multiple approval steps, which can lead to delays and bottlenecks. For example, in the first process variant, there are four approval steps (Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Request Payment, and Payment Handled). This can cause delays in the overall process.

2. Rejection Steps: The presence of rejection steps in the process can also contribute to performance issues. For example, in the second process variant, there are two rejection steps (Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION and Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE). These steps can cause delays and require additional effort to resolve.

3. Missing Approval Steps: In some process variants, there are missing approval steps, which can lead to confusion and delays. For example, in the third process variant, there is no approval step after Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, which can cause delays in the overall process.

4. Inefficient Data Handling: The process variants show that there is a lack of efficient data handling, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the fourth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

5. Lack of Automation: The process variants show that there is a lack of automation, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the fifth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

6. Inconsistent Process Variants: The process variants show that there is a lack of consistency in the process, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the sixth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

7. Lack of Data Validation: The process variants show that there is a lack of data validation, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the seventh process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

8. Lack of Process Monitoring: The process variants show that there is a lack of process monitoring, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the eighth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

9. Lack of Process Improvement: The process variants show that there is a lack of process improvement, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the ninth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.

10. Lack of Process Automation: The process variants show that there is a lack of process automation, which can lead to performance issues. For example, in the tenth process variant, there is a missing approval step after Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, which can cause delays in the overall process.
