Let's break this down:

1. Anomalies in the POWL model:
   
   a. Loop between Evaluate (E) and Approve (P): This loop allows claims to be repeatedly evaluated and approved, which seems unusual. We would typically expect a claim to be evaluated once, then either approved or rejected.

   b. XOR between Notify (N) and Skip: This choice allows the customer notification step to be omitted entirely. In a well-designed claims process, we would expect the customer to always be notified of the outcome.

   c. Partial ordering allows closing the claim (C) before evaluation (E) or approval (P): Due to the edges R -> A -> C, it appears possible to close a claim right after assigning an adjuster, without necessarily waiting for evaluation and approval to complete. This could lead to claims being closed prematurely.

2. Hypotheses for these anomalies:
   
   a. The loop between E and P could exist due to changes in business rules, where claims now require multiple rounds of evaluation and approval. However, this change may have been only partially implemented in the process model.

   b. The XOR that skips customer notification may have been introduced due to miscommunication between the claims processing and customer service departments. Perhaps there was an incorrect assumption that notification is optional.

   c. The ability to close claims prematurely could be a technical error in the workflow system, where the proper constraints were not enforced when updating the process. It could also stem from inadequate controls in the process modeling tool that allowed this invalid structure.

3. Verifying hypotheses using the database:
   
   a. To identify claims closed without proper evaluation or approval:

      ```sql
      SELECT c.claim_id
      FROM claims c
      LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id
      WHERE e.activity IN ('E', 'P')
      GROUP BY c.claim_id
      HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'C' THEN 1 END) > 0
         AND COUNT(CASE WHEN e.activity IN ('E', 'P') THEN 1 END) = 0
      ```

      This query looks for claims that have a 'C' (close) event but no 'E' (evaluate) or 'P' (approve) events.

   b. To locate claims that were approved multiple times:

      ```sql
      SELECT claim_id
      FROM claim_events
      WHERE activity = 'P'
      GROUP BY claim_id
      HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
      ```

      This query identifies claims with more than one 'P' (approve) event.

   c. To check if customer notification is frequently skipped:

      ```sql
      SELECT 
        COUNT(CASE WHEN n.claim_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS notified,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN n.claim_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_notified
      FROM claims c
      LEFT JOIN claim_events n ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
      ```

      This query counts the number of claims with and without an 'N' (notify) event. If the `not_notified` count is high, it suggests notification is often skipped.

By running these kinds of queries against the actual event data, we can verify whether the anomalies in the model are manifesting in practice, and gather evidence to support or refute our hypotheses about their origins. This can guide efforts to correct the process model and improve the real-world execution of the claims handling workflow.
