This is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting an order fulfillment process across four organizational swim lanes:

## **Swim Lanes (Departments):**

1. **Seller** (top lane) - Handles customer orders and invoicing
2. **Production** - Manages manufacturing processes  
3. **Procurement** - Responsible for materials ordering and checking
4. **Warehouse** (bottom lane) - Handles product shipping

## **Process Flow:**

**Seller Lane:**
- Starts with "Monday morning" trigger event
- Proceeds to "Check order for completeness"
- Contains a decision gateway checking if customer exists in database
- Includes a subprocess "Check customer's order" with database operations
- Ends with "Send order details" and "Draft invoice" tasks

**Production Lane:**
- Receives order details
- Includes "Plan production" and "Manufacture product" tasks
- Has decision gateways for process control
- Notes "Material not faulty" condition

**Procurement Lane:**
- Features a "Material Compensation Subprocess" containing:
  - Order materials process
  - Return materials loop for defective items
- Includes "Check materials" verification step

**Warehouse Lane:**
- Simple flow from "Product complete" trigger
- "Send product" task
- Ends with "Product sent" completion

The diagram uses dashed lines to show information flow between departments, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the order fulfillment process across organizational boundaries.
