In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are those that relate to an individual's identity and are protected by law or ethical considerations. These attributes should not be used as a basis for decision making to prevent discrimination.

Based on the provided event log, the following attributes could be considered sensitive for fairness:

* `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is a citizen or not. Using this information to make decisions about job applications could potentially lead to discrimination based on nationality or immigration status.
* `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of the applicant. Using this information to make decisions about job applications could potentially lead to gender-based discrimination.
* `case:german speaking`: While not a traditional sensitive attribute, this attribute could potentially be used to discriminate against individuals who are not fluent in German. However, if fluency in German is a legitimate job requirement, it may be appropriate to consider this attribute in the decision-making process.
* `case:religious`: This attribute indicates whether the applicant is religious or not. Using this information to make decisions about job applications could potentially lead to religious discrimination.

It is important to note that even if a sensitive attribute is not explicitly used in decision making, it may still be possible to infer sensitive information from other attributes in the event log. For example, an applicant's name or address could potentially be used to infer their race, ethnicity, or national origin. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of all attributes on fairness.
