In the record there are only three unique “patients” ( = cases) that can be distinguished unambiguously by the constant demographic attributes
• patient_age  
• patient_gender  
plus the fact that each of the three follow a coherent, selfcontained process path (ER visit A, ER visit B, scheduled surgery C).  

Using these clues the events split naturally as follows:


Case 1(Patient: 45 years, M – ER fracture visit)
  1. 20240315 08:05:13Register patient – ER  
  4. 20240315 08:10:50Initial triage – ER  
  7. 20240315 08:15:42Xray imaging – Radiology  
 12. 20240315 08:23:10Doctor consultation – ER (diagnosis = hairline fracture)  
 15. 20240315 08:30:05Patient discharged – ER  


Case 2(Patient: 62 years, F – ER infection visit)
  2. 20240315 08:07:02Register patient – ER  
  5. 20240315 08:12:29Initial triage – ER  
  8. 20240315 08:16:10Lab test requested – ER  
 10. 20240315 08:20:27Lab test completed – Laboratory  
 11. 20240315 08:22:54Doctor consultation – ER (diagnosis = minor infection)  
 14. 20240315 08:27:00Prescription created – ER  
 17. 20240315 08:35:29Patient discharged – ER  


Case 3(Patient: 28 years, M – scheduled knee surgery)
  3. 20240315 08:07:15Register patient – Surgery dept.  
  6. 20240315 08:13:00Doctor consultation – Surgery (preop check)  
  9. 20240315 08:16:45Surgery preparation – Surgery  
 13. 20240315 08:25:19Surgery performed – Surgery  
 16. 20240315 08:31:37Recovery room – Surgery  
 18. 20240315 08:40:13Patient discharged – Surgery  


Why this grouping is sound
1. Static attributes (age + gender) never repeat across the three sets, so they act as implicit case keys.  
2. Each group shows a logical care pathway in correct temporal order without overlaps that would be impossible for a single person (e.g., you cannot be in triage while also under anaesthesia).  
3. Resources/departments also align with typical clinical flows:  
   – ER patients are triaged, imaged/labtested, consulted, then discharged.  
   – The surgery patient stays entirely in the surgical stream (consult  prep  OR  recovery  discharge).

Therefore the inferred case IDs (you may label them CASE_45M, CASE_62F, CASE_28M, or 123 as above) are:

• Case 1: events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15  
• Case 2: events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17  
• Case 3: events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
