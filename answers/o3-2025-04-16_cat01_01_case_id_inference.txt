In the event log we actually see three distinct “patient journeys”.  
The clearest separators are the stable demographic attributes (age + gender) together with a plausible clinical flow and the fact that each journey starts with a “Register patient” activity and ends with “Patient discharged”.


CASE 1(we will label it “C-01”)  
Patient: 45-year-old male, came to the ER for a leg injury / fracture.

1.  2024-03-15 08:05:13  Register patient(ER, 45 M)  
4.  2024-03-15 08:10:50  Initial triage     (ER, 45 M)  
7.  2024-03-15 08:15:42  X-ray imaging      (Radiology, 45 M)  
12. 2024-03-15 08:23:10  Doctor consultation (ER, 45 M)  
15. 2024-03-15 08:30:05  Patient discharged  (ER, 45 M)


CASE 2(“C-02”)  
Patient: 62-year-old female, ER visit for minor infection.

2.  2024-03-15 08:07:02  Register patient(ER, 62 F)  
5.  2024-03-15 08:12:29  Initial triage     (ER, 62 F)  
8.  2024-03-15 08:16:10  Lab test requested (ER, 62 F)  
10. 2024-03-15 08:20:27  Lab test completed (Laboratory, 62 F)  
11. 2024-03-15 08:22:54  Doctor consultation (ER, 62 F)  
14. 2024-03-15 08:27:00  Prescription created (ER, 62 F)  
17. 2024-03-15 08:35:29  Patient discharged  (ER, 62 F)


CASE 3(“C-03”)  
Patient: 28-year-old male, scheduled knee arthroscopy in Surgery.

3.  2024-03-15 08:07:15  Register patient        (Surgery, 28 M)  
6.  2024-03-15 08:13:00  Doctor consultation     (Surgery, 28 M)  
9.  2024-03-15 08:16:45  Surgery preparation     (Surgery, 28 M)  
13. 2024-03-15 08:25:19  Surgery performed       (Surgery, 28 M)  
16. 2024-03-15 08:31:37  Recovery room           (Surgery, 28 M)  
18. 2024-03-15 08:40:13  Patient discharged      (Surgery, 28 M)


Why these groupings make sense

1. Demographics are constant inside a case and never clash across cases (45 M, 62 F, 28 M).  
2. Each group follows a clinically plausible sequence (registration  triage/consultation/tests  discharge).  
3. Timestamps inside each case are strictly increasing, even though the different cases interleave.  
4. No activity from another age/gender combination breaks the logical flow of a case.

Thus the 18 interleaved events map to three inferred case IDs as shown above.
