Based on analyzing the provided data, it appears that there are some key differences in the sequences of actions taken by tenants when they cancel an apartment rental transaction. Here's a summary:

1. **Number and Order of Actions**:
   - Tenants often cancel their agreements at various points throughout the process, with "Tenant Cancels Appartment" appearing frequently.
   - The variations include additional or fewer steps such as extensive screening, signing contracts, moving in, and paying rent.

2. **Sequence Differences**:
   - Some sequences involve more actions (like multiple payments of rent) before cancellation, suggesting a potential delay in the process which may have led to the tenant deciding not to proceed further.
   
3. **Detailed Actions Taken Before Cancellation**:
   - Tenants who choose to cancel usually go through at least "Hand In The Paperwork" and "Check Paperwork". 
   - Some additional steps before cancellation include extensive screening, signing contracts, moving in, paying rent (multiple times), or performing both an extended screening followed by the signing of a contract.

4. **Frequency**:
   - Some sequences are repeated multiple times (e.g., 268 for the first scenario).
   - The frequency and performance values highlight how often certain steps might lead to cancellation in different scenarios.

The primary differences lie in the specific sequence of actions taken by tenants before they decide to cancel their agreements. These variations can help identify critical points where adjustments or better communication could improve tenant satisfaction and reduce cancellation rates. 

In essence, while most tenants follow a similar pattern up until the decision to cancel, there are clear steps that lead directly to cancellation. Understanding these steps can provide insights for improving the rental process.
