From comparing both sets of process variants, we can identify several key differences and similarities that could provide insights into variations in healthcare delivery between ER (Emergency Room) and FD (Facility or Department). Here are some main points:

1. **Frequency and Performance Variance**:
   - ER processes seem to have a higher frequency of occurring compared to FD ones.
   - The overall performance figures are quite high, indicating that both types of processes require substantial resources or time, likely due to their medical nature.

2. **Process Complexity**:
   - Some process variants involve more steps (e.g., "Expert Examination", "Thorough Examination") in ER and FD settings compared to the simpler variant without these examinations.
   - This complexity might reflect different levels of patient urgency or acuity handled by each department, with ER typically dealing with a wider range of conditions that require immediate attention.

3. **Discharge Events**:
   - The process ending with 'Discharge' has been captured in both sets but varies significantly in terms of frequency and performance between ER and FD processes.
   - This suggests differences in the overall patient throughput, length of stay (LOS), or the efficiency of discharge procedures managed within each environment.

4. **Treatment Outcomes**:
   - There is a notable variation in treatment outcomes based on whether treatments were successful ('Treatment successful') or not ('Treatment unsuccessful').
   - The higher frequency and performance associated with successful treatments indicate that both ER and FD aim to achieve positive patient outcomes, possibly influenced by factors such as diagnosis accuracy and the quality of care provided.

5. **Sequence Variability**:
   - The presence of examination steps like 'Thorough Examination' and 'Expert Examination' before or after basic processes indicates a differentiation in diagnostic rigor between ER and FD.
   - This could suggest that certain conditions require more detailed assessment, especially those seen first at the ER which may have more severe or less commonly encountered symptoms.

6. **Failure Modes**:
   - Some process variants include steps such as 'Treatment unsuccessful' and subsequent retries ('Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful'), reflecting potential failures in treatment or diagnosis that require additional intervention.
   - This indicates a learning loop for improvement within healthcare processes, suggesting the need for adjustments based on outcomes.

In summary, the main differences between ER and FD process variants appear to lie in their complexity (involving more examinations), frequency of occurrence, patient urgency, and the intricacy of treatment outcomes management. These variations could be influenced by factors such as resource allocation, staff expertise, patient flow dynamics, or specific healthcare policies designed for each setting.
