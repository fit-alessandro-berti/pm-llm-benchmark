**POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model captures the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions and highlights where bias can be introduced through a XOR branching in the cultural fit evaluation step. The unfair advantage is granted to applicants who indicate community affiliations or local educational backgrounds.

**Explanation of Model Components:**

- **ReceiveApplication:** Initial point where applications are received.
- **DataCompletenessCheck (Loop):** Ensures all required information is provided; loops back if any data is missing.
- **SkillAssessment:** Applicants pass a skill test. Those failing this step exit the process.
- **CulturalFitCheck:**
  - **XOR Operator:** Provides two paths:
    - **Standard CulturalFitEvaluation:** Applied uniformly to all candidates (intended fair route).
    - **CommunityAffiliationAdvantage:** Introduces bias by favoring applicants with community affiliations or local educational backgrounds. This branch is the unfair tilt.
- **ManagerialReview & FinalDecision:** The final stage where a manager makes the hiring decision.

**POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model removes any bias by providing a uniform cultural fit evaluation to all candidates, regardless of background.

**Explanation of Model Components:**

- **ReceiveApplication:** Initial point where applications are received.
- **DataCompletenessCheck (Loop):** Ensures all required information is provided; loops back if any data is missing.
- **SkillAssessment:** Applicants pass a skill test. Those failing this step exit the process.
- **CulturalFitEvaluation (Same for All):** A single, uniform evaluation path applied to every candidate without consideration of community affiliations or background. This ensures fairness and removes the bias present in the first model.

### Key Differences

1. **Bias Handling:**
   - *First Model:* Uses an XOR branching in CulturalFitCheck that offers different treatment based on community affiliation.
   - *Second Model:* Provides a single path for all candidates, ensuring equitable evaluation without favoring any group.

2. **Process Flow:**
   - *First Model:* Contains two divergent paths (Standard CFT and CommunityAffiliationAdvantage) from CulturalFitCheck, allowing bias to manifest in the managerial review stage.
   - *Second Model:* Lacks such bifurcations; all candidates proceed through the same cultural fit evaluation, eliminating unfair treatment.

By comparing these models, one can see how subtle biases embedded in process design—specifically through conditional branches (XOR) or choice nodes—can lead to unfair hiring practices. Removing these conditions by creating a uniform workflow ensures a more equitable and transparent hiring process.
