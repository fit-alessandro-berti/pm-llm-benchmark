**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**  

### **Pools & Roles**  
- **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk**: Mary, Rita (supervisor).  
- **Purchasing Department**: Dan (purchasing officer).  
- **Department Manager**: Carlos.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)**: Karen (indirect role).  
- **Supplier**: External entity.  

### **Process Flow**  

1. **Start Event**: Invoice received by AP Clerk (e.g., via email).  

2. **Activity**: *Check PO validity* (AP Clerk).  
   - **Decision Gateway**:  
     - **No valid PO**: Send invoice back to Supplier with request for PO details  **End (rejected)**.  
     - **Valid PO**: Log invoice in accounting system  Proceed.  

3. **Activity**: *Forward to Purchasing for validation* (AP Clerk  Purchasing).  
   - **Decision Gateway**:  
     - **All details match PO**: Purchasing sends confirmation email back to AP Clerk  Proceed.  
     - **Discrepancy (price/quantity/items missing)**:  
       - *Resolve discrepancy* (Purchasing + AP Clerk):  
         - Contact Supplier (Karen may assist if unresolved)  Retry matching.  
         - **If unresolved**: Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita) for exception handling.  
           - **Supervisor actions**:  
             - Work with departments to create retrospectively (e.g., informal contract  PO)  Send back to Purchasing.  
             - Reject invoice  **End (rejected)**.  

4. **Activity**: *Match invoice to PO* (AP Clerk + System).  
   - **Parallel Gateway?**: Confirm both:  
     - Receipt of goods/services (implicit in Purchasing confirmation).  
     - Line-item match between invoice and PO.  
   - **Decision Gateway**:  
     - **Match successful**: Send invoice to Department Manager  Proceed.  
     - **Still mismatch**: Loop back to *Resolve discrepancy* (as above).  

5. **Activity**: *Manager approval* (Department Manager).  
   - **Input**: Invoice details, PO, confirmation from Purchasing.  
   - **Decision Gateway**:  
     - **Approved**: Send to AP Clerk  Proceed.  
     - **Rejected/Questionable**:  
       - Notify AP Clerk (Clarification needed or hold investigation).  
       - Loop back to *Resolve discrepancy* (if needed).  

6. **Activity**: *Schedule payment* (AP Clerk).  
   - **Output**: Invoice added to payment run  **End Event**.  

### **Artifacts (Data Objects)**  
- **Invoice (email/email attachment)**  Logged in system.  
- **Purchase Order (PO)**  Referenced throughout.  
- **Confirmation emails**: Sent between AP, Purchasing, Manager.  

### **Alternative Paths/Exceptions**  
- **Missing PO on invoice**: Immediate rejection or supplier outreach via Karen.  
- **Discrepancies**: Multiple rework loops between AP, Purchasing, Supplier.  
- **Informal contracts**: Escalate to Rita (AP Supervisor)  Create PO or reject.  
- **Manager queries invoice**: Rejected, held, or returned for clarification before rework.  

### **Consolidated Ambiguities/Variations**  
- **After Purchasing confirmation**: Mary says "send to manager" (standard); Dan says "assumes AP moves it" — no conflict.   
- **Superior Approval**: Only Manager Carlos explicitly noted; unclear if additional approvals exist, but interviews suggest end-process.  
- **Exceptions ramp-up**: Rita only handles stuck invoices, per Rita; Karen only facilitates resolution externally.

**Final Note for Modeler**: This textual model can be directly translated into a BPMN diagram, with standard flow objects (tasks, gateways, events) assigned per section above. Use pools/lanes to denote roles, and annotate ambiguities (e.g., "Only if discrepancy unresolved here must loop back") to preserve intended uncertainty.
