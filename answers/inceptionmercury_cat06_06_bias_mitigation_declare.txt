# Rationale for added constraints:

# 1. Coexistence Constraints:
#    - `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority` are introduced as specific decision activities for minority applicants.
#    - The coexistence constraint between these activities and `ManualReview` ensures that a manual review is always performed when a decision is made for a minority applicant. This helps to prevent automated biases from influencing the final decision.

# 2. Response Constraint:
#    - A response constraint is added between `RequestAdditionalInfo` and `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures that after requesting additional information, a bias mitigation check is performed before making a final decision. This helps to identify and mitigate potential biases in the additional information collected.

# 3. Succession Constraint:
#    - A succession constraint is added between `BiasMitigationCheck` and `FinalDecision`. This ensures that a bias mitigation check is performed before making a final decision. This helps to identify and mitigate potential biases in the decision-making process.

# 4. Non-succession Constraint:
#    - A non-succession constraint is added between `CheckApplicantRace` and `Reject`. This prevents a direct succession from checking the applicant's race to rejecting the application. This helps to prevent immediate biased outcomes based on the applicant's race.

**Explanation of Bias Mitigation:**

The added constraints work together to reduce bias in the loan application process by ensuring that sensitive attributes are not used directly or indirectly to influence decisions without proper checks and balances.

*   **Coexistence with Manual Review:** By requiring `ManualReview` to coexist with decisions specifically targeting minority applicants (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), we introduce a human element that can override potentially biased automated decisions. This forces a more nuanced evaluation of the application.

*   **Bias Mitigation Checks:** The `BiasMitigationCheck` activity is now required to be performed after requesting additional information and before making a final decision. This ensures that any potential biases identified during the information collection phase are addressed before a decision is made.

*   **Preventing Immediate Biased Outcomes:** The non-succession constraint between `CheckApplicantRace` and `Reject` prevents a direct link between checking an applicant's race and rejecting their application. This forces the process to include intermediate steps (like `BiasMitigationCheck`) that can help to identify and mitigate potential biases.

By introducing these constraints, the DECLARE model enforces a more fair and equitable loan application process, reducing the likelihood of biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.
