To tackle this problem, we need to perform several steps in DuckDB SQL to analyze the event log and identify the top K process variants based on their frequency. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Determine the Sequence of Activities for Each Case

First, we need to create a sequence of activities for each `case_id` based on the order of their `timestamp`. We can achieve this by ranking the activities within each case by their timestamps and then aggregating them into a list or array.

### Step 2: Group Cases by Their Activity Sequence

Once we have the sequences, we can group the cases by these sequences to identify unique process variants.

### Step 3: Count the Frequency of Each Variant and Determine the Top K

We then count the number of cases for each variant and select the top K variants based on their frequency.

### Step 4: Retrieve Events Belonging to the Top K Variants

Finally, we filter the original event log to include only the events from cases that belong to these top K variants.

### Solution Query

```sql
WITH ranked_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM
        event_log
),
case_sequences AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY rn) AS activity_sequence
    FROM
        ranked_events
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM
        case_sequences
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM
        variant_counts
    ORDER BY
        frequency DESC
    LIMIT
        K  -- Replace K with the desired number
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN
    top_k_variants tkv ON cs.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
ORDER BY
    el.case_id,
    el.timestamp;
```

### Explanation

1. **ranked_events**: Assigns a unique rank to each activity within a `case_id` based on the `timestamp`.
2. **case_sequences**: Aggregates the activities for each `case_id` into an array ordered by their rank, creating the activity sequence.
3. **variant_counts**: Counts the frequency of each unique activity sequence (variant).
4. **top_k_variants**: Selects the top K variants based on their frequency.
5. **Final SELECT**: Joins the original event log with the sequences and top K variants to filter and retrieve only the events from the top K variants.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify and filter the event log based on the most frequent process variants.
