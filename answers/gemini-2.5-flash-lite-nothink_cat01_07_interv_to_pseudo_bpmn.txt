                                35. **End Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment

**Notes on Ambiguities and Variations:**

*   **Invoice Receipt:** Primarily email, but other methods are not excluded.
*   **PO Missing:** The process explicitly shows requests to the supplier. The exact handoff for this is sometimes between Mary, Karen, or Dan.
*   **Discrepancy Handling:** Multiple roles (Mary, Dan, Rita, Karen) can be involved in resolving discrepancies. The escalation path to Rita for complex issues is clear.
*   **Informal Services:** Rita's role in creating retrospective POs is noted as an exception path.
*   **Line Item Matching:** Mary performs the initial match. Discrepancies can lead to communication with Purchasing (Dan) and potentially escalation to Rita if unresolved.
*   **Manager Review:** Carlos can reject or request further investigation, which implies a potential loop back into the process.
*   **Process Restart/Looping:** After resolving discrepancies or obtaining missing information, the process often returns to an earlier matching or confirmation step.
*   **System Notifications:** Automatic system emails trigger manager approval, and Mary likely uses the system for logging and scheduling.
