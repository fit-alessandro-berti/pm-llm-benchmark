**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Start Event:**
   - **Purpose:** The initiation point of the process triggered by a customer request.

2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request":**
   - **Purpose:** To formally accept and log the customer's request into the company's system.
   - **Activities Involved:**
     - Customer service receives the request via email, phone, or an online form.
     - Details of the request are recorded for further processing.

3. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type":**
   - **Meaning:** An **Exclusive OR (XOR) Gateway** where only one path can be taken based on the condition.
   - **Purpose:** To determine whether the customer's request is for a standard product/service or requires customization.
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - If the request matches existing offerings without modifications, it is **Standard**.

      - **Activities:**
        - Draft a polite and professional rejection explaining the reasons.
        - Offer alternatives if possible.
      - **Path to End Event:** The process concludes for unfeasible custom requests.

6. **After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed:**

   - **Convergence Point:** Regardless of the path (standard or custom), the process flows together here if not terminated.

7. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?":**
   - **Meaning:** An **Exclusive OR (XOR) Gateway** to decide if managerial approval is required.
   - **Decision Criteria:**
     - Approval may be needed for large orders, significant discounts, special terms, or high-risk customers.

8. **[If Yes] Path:**

   a. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval":**
      - **Purpose:** To seek authorization from a higher authority within the company.
      - **Activities:**
        - Present the case/details to the manager.
        - Justify the reasoning for the proposed terms.

   b. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?":**
      - **Decision Criteria:**
        - **Yes:** Proceed to generate the invoice.
        - **No:** Re-evaluate and adjust the conditions.

   c. **[If Yes] Task G: "Generate Final Invoice":**
      - **Purpose:** To create a formal invoice reflecting all agreed-upon terms.
      - **Activities:**
        - Finalize pricing.
        - Include payment instructions.

   d. **[If No] Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions":**

      - **Activities:**
        - Adjust pricing, terms, or specifications.
        - Consider alternative solutions.

   e. **Loop Back to Previous Tasks:**

      - **For Custom Path:** Loop back to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**.
        - **Purpose:** To revise the custom quotation based on managerial feedback.
      - **For Standard Path:** Loop back to **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**.
        - **Purpose:** To adjust delivery schedules or other conditions.

      - **Meaning of Loop Back:**
        - Enables iterative improvement until approval is secured or a decision is made to halt the process.

9. **[If No Approval Needed] Path:**

   - **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice":**
     - **Purpose:** Proceed directly to invoice generation without additional approvals.

**Explanation of Gateways and Process Flow:**

- **XOR Gateways (Exclusive OR):**
  - Represent decision points where only one outgoing path can be taken based on specific conditions.
  - **Examples in Process:**
    - Determining request type (standard or custom).
    - Assessing customization feasibility.
    - Deciding if approval is needed or granted.

- **AND Gateways:**
  - Indicate that multiple paths are to be executed in parallel and later synchronized.
  - **Example in Process:**
    - Running credit and inventory checks simultaneously to save time.

- **Convergence of Paths:**
  - After completing either the standard or custom paths (provided the custom path didn't end with rejection), the process converges at the approval decision point.
  - Ensures that all requests undergo a final check before proceeding to invoice generation.

- **Loop Backs:**
  - Occur when managerial approval is not granted.
  - Allow the process to return to previous steps to modify proposals or conditions.
  - **Purpose:**
    - To improve or adjust the offer in order to meet approval criteria.
    - To prevent rejecting orders outright without attempting to resolve issues.

**Differences Based on Request Type:**

- **Standard Requests:**
  - Follow a predefined process with established validation steps.
  - Emphasize efficiency through parallel processing (credit and inventory checks).
  - Usually require less scrutiny unless flagged for other reasons.

- **Custom Requests:**
  - Require additional analysis to assess feasibility.
  - Involve more complex considerations (technical capabilities, cost implications).
  - May result in additional steps (preparing custom quotations, seeking approvals).

---

**Conditions Triggering Approvals or Rework Steps:**

- **Approval Needed When:**
  - The request exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., high-value orders).
  - Special terms or discounts are applied.
  - The customer has a high-risk profile based on the credit check.
  - Customizations involve significant resources or deviations from standard offerings.

- **Rework Steps Triggered When:**
  - Managerial approval is not granted.
  - The initial proposal does not meet internal policies or strategic objectives.
  - The feedback suggests changes are necessary to proceed.

- **Re-evaluation Process:**
  - The team revisits the proposal to make necessary adjustments.
  - Engages in problem-solving to align the offer with both customer expectations and company capabilities.
  - May involve renegotiation with the customer.

**Conclusion:**

This business process is designed to handle customer requests efficiently while ensuring compliance with company policies. By incorporating decision points and allowing for both parallel processing and iterative loops, the company can:

- Provide timely responses to customers.
- Differentiate between standard and custom requests to allocate resources appropriately.
- Ensure that all necessary checks and approvals are completed prior to finalizing orders.
