It's great you're thinking about fairness in your process model!  Here's a breakdown of the attributes you provided and why some might be sensitive for fairness:

**Potentially Sensitive Attributes (Could lead to bias):**

* **case:citizen:** This attribute distinguishes between citizens and non-citizens.  Discrimination based on citizenship status is a serious fairness concern.
* **case:gender:**  Gender is a protected characteristic, and differences in treatment or outcomes based on gender could indicate bias.
* **case:german speaking:** Language spoken could be a proxy for cultural background or ethnicity.  Treating individuals differently based on their language abilities could perpetuate unfairness.
* **case:private_insurance:**  Access to healthcare and treatment outcomes are often influenced by insurance status.  If individuals with private insurance receive preferential treatment, it creates a fairness issue.
* **case:underlying_condition:**  Pre-existing health conditions can significantly impact treatment.  However, it's crucial to ensure that individuals with underlying conditions are not systematically disadvantaged in terms of access to care or quality of treatment.

**Attributes Less Likely to be Directly Sensitive:**

* **activity:** This attribute describes the steps in the process itself and is less likely to be directly related to protected characteristics.
* **resource:**  While the type of healthcare professional involved might indirectly relate to fairness (e.g., if certain groups have less access to specialized care), it's not a direct proxy for a protected characteristic.
