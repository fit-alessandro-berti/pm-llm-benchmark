Here's the DuckDB SQL query that meets all the specified requirements:

```sql
WITH sequence_candidates AS (
    -- Find cases that have the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1
    JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id 
        AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
    JOIN event_log e3 ON e1.case_id = e3.case_id 
        AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      -- Ensure no other events exist between e1 and e2, or between e2 and e3
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 
          FROM event_log e_mid 
          WHERE e_mid.case_id = e1.case_id 
            AND e_mid.timestamp > e1.timestamp 
            AND e_mid.timestamp < e2.timestamp
      )
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 
          FROM event_log e_mid 
          WHERE e_mid.case_id = e1.case_id 
            AND e_mid.timestamp > e2.timestamp 
            AND e_mid.timestamp < e3.timestamp
      )
      -- Check that time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days
      AND (e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAYS
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_candidates)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation of the approach:**

1. **Sequence Detection**: The CTE `sequence_candidates` identifies cases that contain the exact sequence `'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order'` in direct succession.

2. **Direct Succession Enforcement**: The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries ensure there are no intervening events between the three activities in the sequence. This guarantees they appear consecutively within the case.

3. **Timing Condition**: The condition `(e3.timestamp - e2.timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAYS` filters for cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.

4. **Exclusion Logic**: The main query returns all events from `event_log` where the `case_id` is NOT in the set of problematic cases identified in the CTE.

5. **Ordering**: Results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for consistent output, though this doesn't affect the filtering logic.

This query efficiently handles the complex requirements by first identifying the problematic cases that match both the sequence and timing criteria, then excluding all events from those cases from the final result set.
