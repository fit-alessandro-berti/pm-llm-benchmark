1. **Cases with significantly longer resolution times**

Compute total cycle time from **Receive Ticket  Close Ticket**:

- **Case 101:** 2024-03-01 08:00  10:15 (same day)  **2.25 hours**
- **Case 103:** 2024-03-01 08:10  09:30 (same day)  **1.33 hours**

These are your “normal” / fast cases.

- **Case 102:** 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15  **25.2 hours**
- **Case 104:** 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30  **24.2 hours**
- **Case 105:** 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30  **49.1 hours**

**Outliers:**  
**Cases 102, 104, and 105** take ~1–2 days (or more) vs. ~1–2 hours for 101 and 103. These are clearly the problematic cases.


2. **Where the delays happen (root-cause hints)**

Below are the key waiting times in the long cases, compared to the fast ones.

---

### Baseline pattern (fast cases 101 and 103)

Typical step timings:

**Case 101**
- Receive  Triage: 10 min  
- Triage  Assign L1: 10 min  
- Assign L1  Investigate: 40 min  
- Investigate  Resolve: 60 min  
- Resolve  Close: 15 min  

**Case 103**
- Receive  Triage: 5 min  
- Triage  Assign L1: 15 min  
- Assign L1  Investigate: 15 min  
- Investigate  Resolve: 30 min  
- Resolve  Close: 15 min  

Rough “normal” behavior:
- Everything happens within **same hour block** or at most a **1-hour gap**.
- No escalations.
- No overnight waits.

Use this as the reference.

### Case 102 (25 hours)

Path: Receive  Triage  Assign L1  **Escalate to L2**  Investigate  Resolve  Close

Key waits:

- Receive (08:05)  Triage (08:30): **25 min** (ok-ish)
- Triage  Assign L1 (09:00): **30 min** (longer than baseline but not huge)
- Assign L1 (09:00)  Escalate to L2 (11:30): **2.5 hours**
- Escalate (11:30)  Investigate (14:00): **2.5 hours**
- Investigate (14:00)  Resolve (next day 09:00): **19 hours**
- Resolve  Close: 15 min

**Main issues in Case 102:**
- Extra handoff: escalation to L2 adds two extra queue steps.
- Long **queue time before L2 acts**:
  - 2.5 h for escalation to be raised
  - 2.5 h for L2 to start investigation
- Very long **overnight wait** between Investigate and Resolve (19 h).

---

### Case 104 (24 hours, no escalation)

Path: Receive  Triage  Assign L1  Investigate  Resolve  Close

Key waits:

- Receive (08:20)  Triage (09:00): **40 min** (slower triage vs. ~5–10 min baseline)
- Triage (09:00)  Assign L1 (09:30): **30 min**
- Assign L1 (09:30)  Investigate (13:00): **3.5 hours**
- Investigate (13:00)  Resolve (next day 08:00): **19 hours**
- Resolve  Close: 30 min

**Main issues in Case 104:**
- Sluggish start (Receive  Triage  Assign all slower).
- Very long **queue before first investigation** (3.5 h after assignment).
- Another **overnight wait** from Investigate to Resolve (19 h), similar to Case 102.

This shows that **even without escalation**, large idle times before Investigate and between Investigate and Resolve can blow up cycle time.

---

### Case 105 (49 hours, longest case, with escalation and two investigations)

Path: Receive  Triage  Assign L1  Investigate (L1)  Escalate to L2  Investigate (L2)  Resolve  Close

Key waits:

- Receive (08:25)  Triage (08:35): **10 min**
- Triage  Assign L1 (09:00): **25 min**
- Assign L1  Investigate (09:10): **10 min** (good)
- Investigate (L1, 09:10)  Escalate (10:00): **50 min** (L1 tries but then escalates)
- **Escalate (10:00 day 1)  L2 Investigate (14:00 day 2): 28 hours** (huge)
- L2 Investigate (14:00 day 2)  Resolve (09:00 day 3): **19 hours**
- Resolve  Close: 30 min

**Main issues in Case 105:**
- Extremely long **queue after escalation** (28 hours) before L2 even starts investigating.
- Another long **wait from L2 Investigate to Resolve** (19 hours).
- The combination of escalation + multiple long idle periods makes this almost **2 full days longer** than fast cases.

3. **Patterns / root causes across delayed cases**

From all three slow cases (102, 104, 105), clear patterns emerge:

1. **Escalation to Level-2 correlates with long delays**
   - Cases 102 and 105 (escalated) have much longer cycle times than the non-escalated fast cases.
   - In 105, escalation leads to a **28-hour delay** before L2 even begins investigating.
   - 102 also shows substantial waiting around escalation (2.5 h before escalation and 2.5 h after).

    **Root cause:** L2 queue is likely overloaded, under-staffed, or not prioritized, so escalated tickets sit idle for long periods.

2. **Large queue times before or after “Investigate Issue”**
   - Case 104: 3.5 h from Assign L1 to Investigate.
   - All long cases: ~19 h from Investigate to Resolve (102, 104, 105).
   - In contrast, fast cases resolve within 30–60 minutes after Investigate.

    **Root cause:** After an investigation is started, follow-up work or resolution is often deferred (e.g., to the next day), possibly due to:
   - Limited working hours / shift end.
   - Waiting on additional input (customer, third party) that is not logged in detail.
   - Low prioritization to finish cases already investigated.

3. **Overnight “dead time”**
   - 102: Investigate at 14:00  Resolve next day at 09:00.
   - 104: Investigate at 13:00  Resolve next day at 08:00.
   - 105: L2 Investigate at 14:00 day 2  Resolve at 09:00 day 3.

   These 19-hour gaps are not seen in fast cases.

    **Root cause:** Work largely stops after mid-afternoon; unresolved tickets often roll over to the next day, adding a full day to cycle time.

4. **Slower early stages in some cases**
   - Case 104 has noticeably slower Receive  Triage  Assign compared with 101/103.
   - Not the main driver compared to the overnight waits, but it contributes.

    **Root cause:** Triage and assignment workload or prioritization might be uneven, causing some tickets to sit longer at the front of the pipeline.

---

4. **How these factors increase cycle time**

- **Additional steps (escalations)** introduce new handoffs and queue points; each handoff can add hours or days if the receiving team does not respond quickly.
- **Queue delays before Investigate and Resolve** mean that the “active work” (which seems relatively short: tens of minutes to an hour) is surrounded by long idle periods where the ticket is simply waiting.
- **Overnight waits** turn what could be a same-day resolution into a 1- or 2-day cycle, even if actual handling time is low.
- **Variable triage and assignment speeds** mean some tickets are disadvantaged early, starting their lifecycle later than others.

The actual hands-on work per ticket seems low (a couple of hours at most); **most of the cycle time is pure waiting**.

---

5. **Recommendations to address bottlenecks**

**A. Improve handling of escalated tickets (Level-2)**

- Set and monitor **SLA for “Escalate  L2 Investigate”** (e.g., within 2 hours).
- Create a **dedicated L2 queue** with clear priority rules so escalated tickets jump ahead of new, less critical work.
- Balance **L2 staffing and coverage** to avoid long periods where no one is working escalations (especially around end-of-day).

**B. Reduce overnight rollover of in-progress tickets**

- Introduce a rule: tickets that have already reached **Investigate** should be prioritized to reach **Resolve** the same day, where possible.
- Near shift end, proactively review tickets in “Investigate” state and **reassign or extend coverage** instead of letting them wait until the next day.
- Consider extending support hours or introducing an **on-call rotation** for L2 if overnight delays are not acceptable.

**C. Monitor and control queue times at each stage**

Implement KPIs like:
- Receive  Triage time  
- Triage  Assign L1 time  
- Assign  First Investigate time  
- Escalate  L2 Investigate time  
- Investigate  Resolve time  

Set thresholds (e.g., >1 hour or >2 hours), trigger alerts when exceeded, and put these on dashboards so bottlenecks are visible in real time.

**D. Capture and distinguish “waiting-for” states**

Right now, long gaps appear simply as silence in the log. Add explicit statuses/events such as:
- “Waiting for customer response”
- “Waiting for vendor/third party”
- “Waiting for maintenance window”

This will help you distinguish:
- **External delays** (legitimate, but should be managed) from  
- **Internal process delays** (queues, prioritization, staffing).

**E. Strengthen triage and first-time resolution**

- Ensure complex tickets are recognized early and either:
  - Escalated immediately with all needed info, or  
  - Given to more experienced L1 agents who can resolve without escalation.
- Provide L1 with better knowledge base and decision support so fewer tickets need L2 involvement, reducing pressure on the L2 bottleneck.

---

In summary:  
**Cases 102, 104, and 105** are the problematic long cases. They are driven mainly by **escalations to L2**, **long queue times before or after “Investigate Issue”**, and **overnight waiting** where work essentially stops. Addressing L2 capacity and prioritization, preventing overnight rollovers of investigated tickets, and monitoring inter-step waiting times should significantly reduce total resolution times.
