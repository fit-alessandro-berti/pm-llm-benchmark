**Formulating DuckDB query for top variant sequences**

I知 building a DuckDB SQL query to extract ordered activity sequences per case, count their occurrences, pick the top K variants, and retrieve all events belonging to those top variants. I知 using string_agg to maintain timestamp order in sequences and parameterizing the top K limit; finally, I値l join back to the events ensuring sorting by variant, case, and timestamp. I知 considering tie-breakers on timestamp and activity for stable ordering.

Here's a DuckDB SQL query that fulfills all the requirements. Replace `{{top_k}}` with the number of most frequent variants you want to keep (for example, `5`).

```sql
WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant_sequence
    ORDER BY case_count DESC, variant_sequence
    LIMIT {{top_k}}
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT cv.case_id, cv.variant_sequence
    FROM case_variants AS cv
    JOIN top_variants AS tv
      ON cv.variant_sequence = tv.variant_sequence
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN top_cases AS tc
  ON e.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY
    tc.variant_sequence,
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

What the query does:
1. Builds the ordered activity sequence (`variant_sequence`) for each case by sorting events by `timestamp`.
2. Counts how many cases follow each distinct sequence and retains the top `K` most frequent ones.
3. Filters the original event log to include only the events from cases belonging to those top variants.

This result set contains only events from the cases that follow the top `K` process variants, preserving the original event details.
