The provided visualization is a flowchart that represents the process of handling orders in an e-commerce system. The flowchart includes various stages and activities involved in processing orders, along with the number of objects (in millions) associated with each stage.

Here's a breakdown of the flowchart:

1. **Start**:
   - PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)
   - SalesOrderItem (3.5M objects)
   - PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)

2. **Create Requisition** (Overall: 3.0M):
   - This is the initial step where requisitions are created for purchase, sales, and purchase orders.

3. **Approve Requisition** (Overall: 5.7M):
   - This step involves approving the requisitions created in the previous step.

4. **Send Order** (Overall: 5.2M):
   - This step involves sending out orders to vendors or suppliers.

5. **Check Stock** (Overall: 1.0M):

11. **Confirm Delivery** (Overall: 1.7M):
    - This step confirms the delivery of the goods to customers.

12. **Close Order** (Overall: 1.7M):
    - This step closes the order once all the above steps are completed.

Each step is represented by an oval shape, and the arrows indicate the flow of the process. The numbers next to the arrows represent the time taken for each step in milliseconds.
