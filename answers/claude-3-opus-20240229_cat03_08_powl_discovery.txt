Based on the given event log, here's a POWL model that represents the complex manufacturing and distribution process:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
skip = SilentTransition()
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")

AS_IQC_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])
TST_RT_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])
LB_skip_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[OR, MS, QS, AS_IQC_loop, TST_RT_loop, PK, LB_skip_xor, DP, D])

root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, AS_IQC_loop)
root.order.add_edge(AS_IQC_loop, TST_RT_loop)
root.order.add_edge(TST_RT_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, LB_skip_xor)
root.order.add_edge(LB_skip_xor, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

Explanation:
1. Each activity is represented as a `Transition` with its respective label.
2. A silent transition (`skip`) is introduced to model the optional labeling activity.
3. The repetitive pattern of AS and IQC is modeled as a loop (`AS_IQC_loop`) using the `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`.
4. Similarly, the repetitive pattern of TST and RT is modeled as another loop (`TST_RT_loop`).
5. The optional labeling activity is modeled as an exclusive choice (`LB_skip_xor`) between LB and the silent transition using the `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`.
6. The overall process is represented as a `StrictPartialOrder` with the defined nodes.
7. The order of execution is defined by adding edges between the nodes using `root.order.add_edge()`.

The resulting POWL model captures the following process flow:
- Order Received (OR) is followed by Material Sourcing (MS).
- Material Sourcing (MS) is followed by Quality Screening (QS).
- Quality Screening (QS) is followed by the Assembly-IQC loop (AS_IQC_loop).
- The Assembly-IQC loop (AS_IQC_loop) is followed by the Testing-Re-Testing loop (TST_RT_loop).
- The Testing-Re-Testing loop (TST_RT_loop) is followed by Packaging (PK).
- Packaging (PK) is followed by the choice between Labeling (LB) and skipping it (LB_skip_xor).
- The choice between Labeling and skipping (LB_skip_xor) is followed by Distribution Planning (DP).
- Distribution Planning (DP) is followed by Dispatch (D).

This POWL model represents the complex manufacturing and distribution process while capturing the loops, optional activities, and the overall flow of the process based on the provided event log.
