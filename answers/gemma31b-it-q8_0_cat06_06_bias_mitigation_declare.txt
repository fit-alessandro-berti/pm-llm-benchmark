# Add new constraints to mitigate bias
# 1. Coexistence: If a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant (e.g., `Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), ensure a `ManualReview` activity always coexists in the trace.
# 2. Response or Succession Constraints: Ensure that certain decision steps (`Approve`, `Reject`) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) without first performing a `BiasMitigationCheck`.
# 3. Non-succession Constraints: Prevent a direct succession from a sensitive attribute event (e.g., `CheckApplicantRace`) to a decision event (`Reject`) to avoid immediate biased outcomes.

# Explanation of Bias Mitigation
# The added constraints significantly reduce bias by ensuring that decisions are made based on fair and consistent criteria.
# Specifically:
# - Coexistence ensures that a `ManualReview` is always present before a `Reject` decision, preventing immediate biased outcomes.
# - Response and Succession constraints prevent immediate follow-up of sensitive attributes, promoting fairness.
# - Non-succession constraints prevent a direct succession from sensitive attributes to decision events, reducing the risk of biased outcomes.
# These constraints collectively contribute to a more equitable and unbiased loan application review process.
