Sure! Below is an example Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for the global supply chain process described in your scenario. The average times and standard deviations are estimated based on typical durations for each stage of such a complex manufacturing process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (24*3600, 8*3600),           # Supplier Selection to Order Placement: Averaging 1 day with a standard deviation of about 2 days.
    ('SS', 'RC'): (7*24*3600, 5*24*3600),      # Supplier Selection to Receive Components: Averaging 7 days with a standard deviation of about 5 days.
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1.5*24*3600, 1*24*3600),    # Order Placement to Quality Inspection: Averaging 1.5 days with a standard deviation of about 1 day.
    ('RC', 'CA'): (0.5*24*3600, 0.5*24*3600),  # Receive Components to Component Assembly: Averaging 12 hours with a standard deviation of about 12 hours.
    ('QI', 'PK'): (7*24*3600 + 8*3600, 5*24*3600 + 4*3600), # Quality Inspection to Packaging: Averaging a week plus some extra time with variability.
    ('CA', 'WS'): (1.5*24*3600, 1*24*3600),   # Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage: Averaging 1.5 days with a standard deviation of about 1 day.
    ('PK', 'DT'): (2*24*3600 + 8*3600, 3*24*3600 + 4*3600), # Packaging to Distribution: Averaging 2 days plus some extra time with variability.
    ('WS', 'AS'): (15*24*3600, 7*24*3600),     # Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support: Averaging 15 days with a standard deviation of about 7 days.
}
```

This dictionary includes activity pairs that are separated by multiple steps, adding complexity. For instance, the pair `('SS', 'RC')` captures the time from when a supplier is selected until components are received at the warehouse, which might take an average of 7 days with significant variability due to different suppliers' lead times.

The inclusion of standard deviations helps account for variations in process execution times that can arise from factors such as unexpected delays, quality issues, or operational disruptions.
