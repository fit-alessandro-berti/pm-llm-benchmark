The visualization provided is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting a "Credit Scoring" process. It's broken down into three pools, representing different actors or systems involved in the process. Let's analyze each pool and the flow of the process:

**1. Credit Scoring Frontend (Bank):**

*   **Start Event:** Represented by a simple circle, this marks the initiation of the process, likely triggered by a customer request for a loan or credit.
*   **Message Flow to Bank:**  The dashed arrow indicates a message (the request) being sent to the "Credit Scoring (Bank)" pool.

**2. Credit Scoring (Bank):**

*   **Message Start Event:** This signifies the receipt of the "scoring request" from the frontend.
*   **Task "request credit score":**  The bank processes the request and initiates the process to retrieve a credit score.
*   **Exclusive Gateway:** The diamond shape indicates a decision point or branching. In this case, it likely determines whether the score should be retrieved asynchronously or synchronously, leading to different paths.
*   **Message Catch Event "delay information received":**  This signifies receiving information about a potential delay in getting the credit score.
*   **Task "report delay":** The bank processes the delay information and possibly informs the customer.
*   **Message Catch Event "credit score received":**  The bank receives the credit score from the "Scoring Service".
*   **Another Exclusive Gateway:** This gateway manages the flow based on whether the score was received directly or after a delay.
*   **Task "send credit score":**  The bank sends the received credit score back to the frontend.
*   **End Event:**  The filled circle represents the successful completion of the process for the bank. It signifies that the "scoring request" has been "handled."
*   **Intermediate Message Catch Event "credit score received":**  This shows an alternative path where the credit score is received without a prior delay report.

**3. Scoring Service:**

*   **Message Start Event:**  This indicates the service receiving the request to compute a credit score.
*   **Task "compute credit score (level 1)":** The service attempts to compute the credit score using a faster, potentially simpler, method (Level 1).
*   **Exclusive Gateway:** This gateway checks if the score is available using Level 1.
*   **Path 1 (Yes - Score Available):**
    *   **Task "send credit score":** If the score is readily available, it's sent back to the bank.
    *   **End Event:** The process completes successfully.
*   **Path 2 (No - Score Not Available):**
    *   **Task "report delay":** If the score isn't available with Level 1, a delay is reported (potentially to the bank).
    *   **Task "compute credit score (level 2)":** A more complex computation (Level 2) is initiated, potentially involving more data or time.
    *   **Task "send credit score":** Once Level 2 computation is complete, the score is sent back to the bank.
    *   **End Event:** The process completes successfully.
*   **Annotation:** "inkl. ID for message queueing" suggests that an identifier is used for queuing messages related to the delayed computation (Level 2), indicating asynchronous processing.

**Overall Process Flow:**

1. A customer initiates a credit scoring request through the frontend.
2. The bank receives the request and tries to obtain a credit score from the Scoring Service.
3. The Scoring Service attempts to compute the score using a quicker method (Level 1).
4. If the score is available, it's sent back to the bank.
5. If the score is not readily available, a delay is reported, and a more complex computation (Level 2) is initiated.
6. The bank may receive a delay notification and then the credit score after the delayed computation is completed.
7. Finally, the bank sends the credit score back to the frontend, completing the process.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The process handles both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios for obtaining a credit score.
*   The Scoring Service has two levels of computation for credit scores, indicating different processing times and complexity.
*   The process includes steps for reporting delays, enhancing transparency and customer experience.
*   The use of message events suggests communication between different systems or components.

This visualization provides a clear overview of the Credit Scoring process, outlining the roles of different actors and the flow of information and tasks. It's a valuable tool for understanding and potentially optimizing the process.
