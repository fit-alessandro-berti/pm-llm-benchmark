Here's a breakdown of the event log, grouped into meaningful high-level process steps, along with the rationale and proposed names:

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

Based on the provided event log, I've identified four distinct high-level process steps.

---

### 1. Material Preparation & Initial Setup

**Rationale for Grouping:**
These events focus on getting the raw material (metal sheet) ready for subsequent processing. They involve the initial handling, identification, positioning, and pre-processing (preheating) of the material. They are typically performed by initial operators or automated systems and precede any major transformation or assembly. The activities are all related to preparing the workpiece.

**Low-Level Events Included:**
*   `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
*   `Scan barcode`
*   `Place metal sheet on table`
*   `Align metal sheet`
*   `Preheat metal sheet`

---

### 2. Core Assembly/Transformation

**Rationale for Grouping:**
This stage represents the primary manufacturing operation where the raw material undergoes a significant transformation – in this case, welding. The events are sequential, directly contributing to the structural integrity or functional aspect of the product. They involve specialized tools and skilled operations (manual or automated). The "Pick up welding tool" acts as a clear precursor to the welding activities.

**Low-Level Events Included:**
*   `Pick up welding tool`
*   `Weld corner A`
*   `Weld corner B`

---

### 3. Surface Treatment & Initial Quality Check

**Rationale for Grouping:**
This grouping encompasses activities that occur *after* the core assembly/transformation but *before* a final quality sign-off. It includes both a critical quality assurance step (measuring weld integrity) and subsequent surface treatment (applying and drying coating). While quality checks can happen at various stages, this specific check immediately follows the welding and is followed by a protective treatment, suggesting a distinct post-assembly, pre-final inspection phase.

**Low-Level Events Included:**
*   `Measure weld integrity`
*   `Apply protective coating`
*   `Dry coating`

---

### 4. Final Quality Assurance & Handover

**Rationale for Grouping:**
This step signifies the final verification of the product before it moves to the next major stage (e.g., packaging, shipping, next assembly line). The "Visual check" is typically a comprehensive final inspection that ensures the product meets all specifications, concluding the current manufacturing sequence for that item.

**Low-Level Events Included:**
*   `Visual check`
