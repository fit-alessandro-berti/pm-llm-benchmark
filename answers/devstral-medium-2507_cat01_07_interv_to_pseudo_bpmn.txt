### BPMN-like Textual Process Model

#### Activities/Tasks:
1. **Receive Invoice**
2. **Check for Valid PO**
3. **Log Invoice into System**
4. **Forward to Purchasing**
5. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Resolve Discrepancies**
8. **Escalate to Supervisor**
9. **Manager Approval**
10. **Schedule for Payment**
11. **Handle Exceptions**

#### Sequence Flow:
1. **Receive Invoice**
   - **Check for Valid PO**
     - If PO is missing, **Send Back to Supplier**
     - If PO is valid, **Log Invoice into System**
2. **Log Invoice into System**
   - **Forward to Purchasing**
3. **Forward to Purchasing**
   - **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
4. **Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services**
   - **Match Invoice to PO**
5. **Match Invoice to PO**
   - If everything matches, **Manager Approval**
   - If discrepancies exist, **Resolve Discrepancies**
6. **Resolve Discrepancies**
   - If resolved, **Manager Approval**
   - If not resolved, **Escalate to Supervisor**
7. **Escalate to Supervisor**
   - **Handle Exceptions**
8. **Handle Exceptions**
   - If resolved, **Manager Approval**
   - If not resolved, **Reject Invoice**
9. **Manager Approval**
   - **Schedule for Payment**

#### Gateways/Decision Points:
1. **Check for Valid PO**
   - Decision: PO present?
     - Yes: **Log Invoice into System**
     - No: **Send Back to Supplier**
2. **Match Invoice to PO**
   - Decision: Everything matches?
     - Yes: **Manager Approval**
     - No: **Resolve Discrepancies**
3. **Resolve Discrepancies**
   - Decision: Discrepancies resolved?
     - Yes: **Manager Approval**
     - No: **Escalate to Supervisor**
4. **Handle Exceptions**
   - Decision: Exceptions resolved?
     - Yes: **Manager Approval**
     - No: **Reject Invoice**

#### Roles/Participants:
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**

### Notes:
- The process flow is generally linear but includes several decision points where the flow can diverge based on conditions.
- The roles of different participants are clearly defined, with specific tasks assigned to each.
- Artifacts such as invoices, POs, and confirmation emails are critical to the process flow.
- Exceptions and variations are handled through escalation and resolution steps, ensuring that the process can adapt to different scenarios.
