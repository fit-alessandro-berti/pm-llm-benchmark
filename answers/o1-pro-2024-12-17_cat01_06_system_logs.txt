Below is a sample event log table derived from the provided system log. Each row corresponds to an event in a process instance (case). Cases were chosen to represent the user’s interaction with specific documents or emails. Low-level system actions were translated into higher-level activities meaningful for process analysis. Timestamps are retained, and standardized activity names are used.

**Explanation of the Logic:**

- **Case Identification:** Each case represents the user’s interaction with a specific resource (e.g., a Word document, an Excel spreadsheet, an email thread, or a PDF file). By examining the window titles and applications, we grouped all events related to a single document or email into one case. For instance, all events on “Document1.docx” form one case, while all events related to the “Annual Meeting” email form another.

- **Activity Naming:** Low-level system actions (FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLICK, SCROLL) were translated into higher-level, standardized activities that reflect meaningful steps in a typical business process. For example:
  - **FOCUS/SWITCH** → "Open Document," "Open Spreadsheet," "Open PDF," or "Access Email System," depending on the resource.
  - **TYPING** in Word or Excel → "Edit Document" or "Edit Spreadsheet."
  - **SCROLL** in a PDF or email → "Review PDF" or "Review Email."
  - **CLICK (Open Email)** → "Open Email."
  - **HIGHLIGHT** in PDF → "Annotate PDF."
  - **SAVE** actions → "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."
  - **CLOSE** actions → "Close Document."

- **Telling a Coherent Narrative:** By focusing on documents and emails as cases, the event log now reads as a series of user work sessions: opening a file, editing it, saving changes, and eventually closing it. For the email, the sequence includes accessing the email system, opening the email, reviewing and replying, and finally sending the message. This structured narrative is more suitable for standard process mining tools, enabling clearer insights into how the user progresses through their work.
