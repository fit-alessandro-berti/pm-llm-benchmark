In the context of fairness in process mining, sensitive attributes are those attributes that could potentially influence or bias the process outcomes, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups. Fairness in process mining ensures that different groups (defined by sensitive attributes) are treated equitably throughout the process. To identify sensitive attributes, we typically look for characteristics that could be related to discrimination or bias. Here are the attributes from your event log that might be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates the citizenship status of the case (True or False). It could be sensitive because it might affect how cases are handled, leading to potential unfair treatment based on citizenship.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute signifies the gender of the case (True or False). Gender can be a sensitive attribute because it can influence how processes are conducted, potentially leading to bias against specific genders.

3. **case:german speaking**: This attribute indicates whether the case involves someone who speaks German (True or False). Language proficiency could be a sensitive attribute, especially if it affects communication and understanding during the process, potentially resulting in unfair treatment.

These attributes can be used to analyze fairness in the process by comparing how different groups (defined by these attributes) experience the process. For example:
- Do cases involving citizens (True/False) take longer to process?
- Are there differences in the number of activities or types of activities performed for different genders?
- Does language proficiency impact the likelihood of loan approval or rejection?

By examining these sensitive attributes, you can identify any disparities in process treatment and take steps to ensure fairness.
