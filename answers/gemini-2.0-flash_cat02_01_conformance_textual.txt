**Analysis of Event Log Cases:**

**Case 1: Compliant**

*   Sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order
*   Analysis: This case follows the expected flow for sufficient inventory, adhering to all constraints.

**Case 2: Violation**

*   Sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   Violation: "Authorize payment" should occur *before* "Package items," according to the normative description. The description states, "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping." In this case, payment is authorized *after* the items are packaged, which is a violation.

**Case 3: Violation**

*   Sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order
*   Violation: Multiple violations are present in this case:

    *   "Authorize payment" *before* a confirmed path to fulfillment.  While not explicitly forbidden, the authorization occurred when the inventory may not have been sufficient. Given the "Cancel order" happening soon after, the payment should not have been authorized. This violates the spirit, if not the letter, of the normative process.
    *   "Ship order" *after* "Cancel order." The description states that shipping should never occur after cancellation. Once an order is canceled, it is illogical and explicitly forbidden to proceed with shipping.

**Case 4: Compliant**

*   Sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order
*   Analysis: This case follows the expected flow for insufficient inventory, adhering to all constraints.

**Case 5: Violation**

*   Sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order
*   Violation: This case is missing the "Package items" activity. The normative description states that "Package items" should occur between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." Skipping this step violates the expected flow.
