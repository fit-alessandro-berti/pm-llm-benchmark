Here's an analysis of the event log against the normative process description, identifying violations and explaining them:

**Case 1:** No Violation. This case follows the standard flow: Receive Order -> Check Inventory -> Authorize Payment -> Package Items -> Ship Order -> Close Order.

**Case 2:** Violation. The "Package items" activity occurs *before* the "Authorize payment" activity.  The normative description explicitly states that payment authorization must precede packaging. This case violates this rule.

**Case 3:** Violation. This case represents a cancellation scenario. While the "Cancel order" activity occurs after "Check inventory" (as expected), the process then proceeds to "Ship order." This is a clear violation. The normative description states that shipping should *never* occur after an order is canceled.  Furthermore, "Package items" is missing, which should not happen for a "Ship order".

**Case 4:** No Violation. This case correctly represents a cancellation scenario: Receive Order -> Check Inventory -> Cancel Order -> Close Order.

**Case 5:** Violation.  The "Ship order" activity occurs without a preceding "Package items" activity. The normative description mandates that items must be packaged before they can be shipped.  While "Authorize payment" occurs before "Ship order," the missing "Package items" step still constitutes a violation.
