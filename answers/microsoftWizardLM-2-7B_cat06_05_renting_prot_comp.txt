To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group in the context of rental property tenant screening and application processes, we can analyze the process variants provided. Here are the key differences based on the data:

1. **Extensive Screening Frequency**:
   - The protected group has a significantly higher frequency of 'Extensive Screening' steps in their process variants compared to the unprotected group. This indicates that tenants in the protected group undergo more rigorous background checks or evaluations.

2. **Rejection Rate**:
   - The protected group has a higher percentage of 'Reject Prospective Tenant' outcomes, particularly in variants without 'Extensive Screening'. This suggests that there may be a higher threshold or different criteria for approval within the protected group.

3. **Paperwork Handling**:
   - There are more instances where the protected group processes 'Paperwork' after setting an appointment and before viewing the property. This could imply a more thorough documentation and verification process.

4. **Tenant Cancellation**:
   - The protected group has a variant where the tenant cancels the apartment after paying rent multiple times, suggesting a higher level of engagement or commitment that continues even after moving in.

5. **Rent Payment Frequency**:
   - The unprotected group has process variants where rent is paid multiple times before the tenant cancels the apartment, indicating a possible difference in tenancy agreements or payment schedules.

6. **Eviction Process**:
   - The protected group has one variant that includes an 'Issue Warning' and 'Evict Tenant' process, which is not present in the unprotected group. This could suggest a more formal and documented process for addressing non-payment or other issues within the protected group.

7. **Length of Tenancy**:
   - The protected group has several variants with a longer sequence of rent payments before the tenant cancels the apartment. This may indicate a longer average tenancy duration or a different tenant turnover rate.

8. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The execution time for the protected group's process variants, particularly those involving extensive screening and multiple rent payments, is significantly higher than those of the unprotected group. This could reflect more comprehensive screening processes and/or more complex tenancy management.

9. **Missed Rent Payment**:
   - There is one instance in the unprotected group where a missed rent payment leads to a warning and eventually eviction, which is not present in the protected group's variants. This could indicate a difference in how missed payments are handled.

10. **Move-In and Cancellation**:
   - There are instances in the unprotected group where the tenant moves in and then cancels the apartment after multiple rent payments, which is also seen in the protected group but with a shorter sequence of payments. This could reflect a difference in the tenants' decision-making process or the flexibility of the leasing agreement.

Based on these observations, it appears that the protected group undergoes a more stringent approval process with more extensive background checks, has a higher rejection rate, and maintains a longer tenancy duration with more formalized documentation and handling of rent payments. Additionally, the execution time for their process variants is longer, potentially indicating a more thorough and time-consuming tenant screening and management process.

It is important to note that these differences could be due to various factors, including but not limited to legal requirements, corporate policies, or organizational practices designed to protect the interests of the protected group. To fully understand the reasons behind these differences, further investigation into the policies, procedures, and the rationale behind them would be necessary.
