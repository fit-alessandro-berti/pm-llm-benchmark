**Analysis:**

**1. Relation to the standard Hire-to-Retire process:**

The standard Hire-to-Retire process involves the following sequence of activities: posting a job advertisement, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding a new employee, adding the employee to the payroll system, and closing the case.

**2. Anomalies in each model:**

**Model 1:**
- The screening of candidates and conducting interviews are happening in parallel, which is not the normative sequence. Typically, candidates are screened first, and only then are interviews conducted with the selected candidates.
- Although this anomaly does not fundamentally violate the essence of the process, it is less efficient and can lead to confusion and inefficiencies.

**Model 2:**
- The silent transition (skip) in the exclusive choice operator for adding to the payroll (xor_payroll) implies that, in some instances, employees might not be added to the payroll system. This is a severe anomaly as it fundamentally violates the essence of the process, as every hired employee should be added to the payroll system.
- The LOOP operator around onboarding new employees (loop_onboarding) suggests that the onboarding process might be repeated multiple times for a single employee. While it's not uncommon for parts of the onboarding process to be repeated (e.g., training), a complete loop could indicate inefficiencies or issues with the onboarding process.

**3. Model comparison:**

Model 1 aligns more closely with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process compared to Model 2. Although Model 1 has an anomaly in the parallel execution of screening candidates and conducting interviews, this does not fundamentally violate the essence of the process. In contrast, Model 2 has a severe anomaly with the possibility of not adding employees to the payroll system and a less severe anomaly with the repetition of the entire onboarding process.

Therefore, Model 1 is a better representation of a normative Hire-to-Retire process than Model 2, despite its less severe anomaly.
