The provided image represents a detailed flowchart of a shipping or logistics process. This flowchart outlines the step-by-step procedures involved in preparing and shipping goods, including decision-making points and actions related to customer information, packaging, and shipping logistics. Here’s an explanation of the processes illustrated in the flowchart:

1. **Combination of Orders in Secretary**: The flowchart begins in the "Combination of orders in secretary" lane where the initial activities include:
   - **Ship goods** (with action or decision points to clarify the shipment method, possibly deciding if special handling like insurance is required).

2. **Logistics**: The flowchart then transitions to activities in the "Logistics" lane which are focused on handling insurance, contracts with logistic companies, and preparing the shipment:
   - If insurance is required, then "insure parcel" process is followed.
   - In parallel, the package label is written.
   - Three offers are obtained from logistic companies, after which one is selected, and an order is placed with them.

3. **Warehouse**: In parallel, under the "Warehouse" lane:
   - Goods are packaged.
   - If there's a delay (beyond 48 hours), the customer is notified about the delay.
   - Fill out the necessary shipment paperwork.
   - Move the package to a pickup area indicating shipment preparation is complete.

Throughout the flowchart, you can see several decision points marked by diamond shapes, which determine the direction of the process based on conditions such as whether insurance is required or if special handling is needed. Plus symbols likely represent a merging or intersection in process flows. Overall, this flowchart is designed to ensure clarity and efficiency by defining each necessary step and decision in the shipping process.
