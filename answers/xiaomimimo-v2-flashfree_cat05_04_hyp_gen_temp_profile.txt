### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile

1.  **Receive to Approve (R  P):**
    *   **Anomaly:** The average duration is approximately 25 hours (90,000 seconds), which is reasonably fast, but the standard deviation is extremely low (3,600 seconds or 1 hour). In a complex insurance process involving evaluation and approval, one would expect significant variance in processing times based on claim complexity, adjuster workload, and documentation quality. A tight distribution suggests the process is either highly automated or artificially constrained, rather than organic.

2.  **Approve to Notify (P  N):**
    *   **Anomaly:** There is a massive average delay of 7 days (604,800 seconds) with a high standard deviation of 2 days (172,800 seconds). While approval processing might be fast, a week-long gap before informing the customer is a significant service failure. The high deviation indicates this delay is inconsistent, suggesting some claims get stuck in a backlog while others are processed immediately.

3.  **Assign to Close (A  C):**
    *   **Anomaly:** The average time between assigning an adjuster and closing the claim is only 2 hours (7,200 seconds). This is exceptionally fast, especially if standard steps like "Evaluate" (E) are expected in between. It suggests that many claims are being closed almost immediately after assignment, potentially without proper investigation or processing.

4.  **Evaluate to Notify (E  N):**
    *   **Anomaly:** The average time between evaluation and notification is 5 minutes (300 seconds). While digital processes are fast, 5 minutes implies the notification is fired automatically the moment evaluation is logged, leaving no time for review, final approval logic (unless P is skipped), or manual intervention.

### Hypotheses on Anomaly Causes

1.  **Process Skipping / Data Integrity Issues (RP, AC, EN):**
    *   The extremely short intervals and low deviations (RP, EN) or the lack of expected intermediate steps (AC) suggest that users or systems might be logging "completion" events (like P or C) to clear queues without actually performing the work. This could be a metric-gaming behavior where adjusters mark claims as closed to maintain performance KPIs, or a system configuration that auto-advances states.

2.  **Systemic Bottlenecks / Human Factors (PN):**
    *   The 7-day delay between Approval and Notification is highly suspicious for a digital workflow. It suggests that while the *Approval* logic (perhaps automated) happens quickly, the subsequent step is manual, resource-constrained, or deprioritized. It could also indicate a "pending payment" queue where claims sit until funds are released or a batch process for notifications runs weekly rather than daily.

3.  **Resource Allocation & Specialization Mismatches:**
    *   The anomalies might be correlated with specific adjusters or regions. For example, one region might have a culture of closing claims immediately (AC) to keep their stats low, while another region strictly follows the process. Conversely, the long PN delay might be caused by a central notification team that is under-resourced.

### Verification Approaches using SQL

#### 1. Verify the "Approve to Notify" (PN) Bottleneck
This query identifies claims where the time between approval and notification exceeds the business expectation (e.g., 24 hours), and correlates them with the adjuster and claim type to see if specific groups are affected.

```sql
SELECT 
    ce_n.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    ce_p.timestamp AS approved_at,
    ce_n.timestamp AS notified_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_to_notify,
    ce_p.resource AS approved_by_resource,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region
FROM 
    claim_events ce_p
JOIN 
    claim_events ce_n ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
JOIN 
    claims c ON ce_p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN 
    claim_events ce_a ON ce_a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN 
    adjusters a ON ce_a.resource::integer = a.adjuster_id -- Assuming resource stores adjuster_id
WHERE 
    ce_p.activity = 'P' 
    AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
    AND ce_p.timestamp < ce_n.timestamp
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp)) > 86400 -- More than 24 hours
ORDER BY 
    hours_to_notify DESC;
```

#### 2. Identify Premature Closures (AC)
This query looks for claims that were closed almost immediately after assignment, skipping the Evaluation and Approval steps. This helps test the hypothesis that claims are being closed without work.

```sql
-- Find claims closed very quickly after assignment
WITH ClaimLifecycle AS (
    SELECT 
        claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) as assign_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as close_time,
        bool_or(activity = 'E') as has_evaluation,
        bool_or(activity = 'P') as has_approval
    FROM 
        claim_events
    GROUP BY 
        claim_id
)
SELECT 
    cl.claim_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    cl.assign_time,
    cl.close_time,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.close_time - cl.assign_time)) / 60 AS minutes_to_close,
    cl.has_evaluation,
    cl.has_approval,
    a.name AS adjuster_name
FROM 
    ClaimLifecycle cl
JOIN 
    claims c ON cl.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN 
    claim_events ce_a ON cl.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN 
    adjusters a ON ce_a.resource::integer = a.adjuster_id
WHERE 
    cl.assign_time IS NOT NULL 
    AND cl.close_time IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cl.close_time - cl.assign_time)) < 7200 -- Less than 2 hours
    AND (cl.has_evaluation IS FALSE OR cl.has_approval IS FALSE) -- Missing intermediate steps
ORDER BY 
    minutes_to_close ASC;
```

#### 3. Analyze Variance in "Receive to Approve" (RP)
To verify the suspiciously low standard deviation (rigidity), we calculate the standard deviation of R-to-P times per adjuster. If the hypothesis is correct that this is artificial, we might see specific adjusters or automated resources with near-zero variance.

```sql
WITH ApprovalTimes AS (
    SELECT 
        ce_r.claim_id,
        ce_r.resource AS receiving_resource,
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce_p.activity = 'P' THEN ce_p.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
        MIN(CASE WHEN ce_r.activity = 'R' THEN ce_r.timestamp END) AS receive_time
    FROM 
        claim_events ce_r
    JOIN 
        claim_events ce_p ON ce_r.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id
    WHERE 
        ce_r.activity = 'R' 
        AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
    GROUP BY 
        ce_r.claim_id, ce_r.resource
)
SELECT 
    receiving_resource,
    COUNT(*) as claim_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time))) as avg_seconds,
    STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time))) as std_dev_seconds
FROM 
    ApprovalTimes
WHERE 
    approve_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    receiving_resource
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 10 -- Ensure statistical significance
ORDER BY 
    std_dev_seconds ASC;
```
