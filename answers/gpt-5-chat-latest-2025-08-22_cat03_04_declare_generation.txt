Got it! Let’s carefully build a **DECLARE model dictionary** in Python to represent the product design and launch process.  

We’ll encode logical process relationships in terms of **constraints** such as *initial step*, *existence rules*, *response constraints*, and *succession*.  

---

### Key DECLARE relationships in this scenario:
- **Init**: The process always starts with *Idea Generation (IG)*.  
- **Existence**: Some activities must happen at least once: *Design Draft (DD)*, *Final Launch (FL)*.  
- **Exactly-One**: The *Final Launch (FL)* happens exactly once.  
- **Response**:  
  - If *Design Draft (DD)* happens  *Technical Feasibility Check (TFC)* must follow.  
  - If *TFC* happens  *Cost Evaluation (CE)* must follow.  
  - If *Approval Gate (AG)* occurs  *Prototype Creation (PC)* must follow.  
  - If *PC* occurs  must eventually lead to *Laboratory Testing (LT)*.  
  - If *LT* occurs  must eventually lead to *User Testing (UT)*.  
  - If *UT* occurs  *Approval Gate (AG)* must follow.  
  - If *Marketing Plan (MP)* occurs  must eventually lead to *Final Launch (FL)*.  
- **Precedence**:  
  - *Final Launch (FL)* is always preceded by *Marketing Plan (MP)*.  
  - *Marketing Plan (MP)* is always preceded by *Approval Gate (AG)*.  
- **Succession**: Ensures bidirectional consistency for certain phases (e.g., *Lab Testing  User Testing*).  
- **Absence** (optional): Activities like *Final Launch (FL)* happen at most once (covered with exactly_one).  
- **Noncoexistence**: You don’t have *Final Launch (FL)* without an earlier *Approval Gate (AG)* and *MP*.

        "DD": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {
        "FL": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },

    },
    "nonsuccession": {},
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

 This dictionary encodes all the **process constraints** in DECLARE formalism for the multi-department product design and launch pipeline.  

Would you like me to also **visualize this as a DECLARE model graph (Petri net style or constraint diagram)** for clarity?
