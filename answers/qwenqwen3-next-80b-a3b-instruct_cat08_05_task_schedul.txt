### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**

To transform raw MES event logs into actionable operational intelligence, I employ a multi-stage **process mining pipeline** leveraging **event log reconstruction**, **conformance checking**, **performance analysis**, and **variant discovery**. The goal is to move from descriptive reporting to diagnostic and predictive understanding.

#### **Process Reconstruction & Flow Analysis**
- **Case Identification**: Each `Case ID (Job ID)` defines a unique process instance. Events are ordered by `Timestamp` and grouped by job to reconstruct the *actual* job routing, including deviations from planned routings (e.g., rework loops, skipped steps).
- **Activity Mapping**: Each `Activity/Task` (e.g., “Task Start (Cutting)”) is mapped to a state in the process model. Transition events (e.g., “Queue Entry”  “Setup Start”  “Task Start”) define the workflow.
- **Resource Mapping**: `Resource (Machine ID)` and `Operator ID` are linked to activities to enable resource-centric analysis.

#### **Key Metrics Derived via Process Mining**
| Metric | Technique | How It’s Calculated |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Job Flow Time** | *Process Discovery (Alpha, Heuristics Miner)* + *Performance Annotation* | Time from “Job Released” to “Job Completed” (last task end). Distribution analyzed via histogram, percentiles (P90, P95) to identify outliers. |
| **Lead Time** | *Temporal Analysis* | Time from order entry (if logged) to completion. If not, use “Job Released” as proxy. |
| **Makespan** | *Global Process View* | Time from first job release to last job completion across entire shop. |
| **Task Waiting Time (Queue Time)** | *Activity Duration Analysis* | Time between “Queue Entry” and “Setup Start” (or “Task Start” if no setup). Aggregated per machine/work center. Box plots reveal variability. |
| **Resource Utilization** | *Resource Pool Analysis* | <br> - **Productive Time**: Sum of `Task Duration (Actual)` per machine.<br> - **Setup Time**: Sum of `Setup Duration` (from “Setup Start” to “Setup End”).<br> - **Idle Time**: Total time minus productive + setup time.<br> - **Utilization Rate**: (Productive + Setup) / Total Available Time. |
| **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times** | *Transition Pattern Mining* | For each machine, extract sequences of job pairs: `(Job-A  Job-B)`. For each pair, compute setup time. Cluster similar job pairs by material, geometry, tooling, or job family (inferred from job attributes). Build a **setup time matrix** (e.g., Job Type X  Job Type Y: avg setup = 28 min). |
| **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness** | *Conformance Checking + Due Date Comparison* | For each job: Tardiness = max(0, Completion Time – Due Date). Calculate % tardy jobs, average tardiness, and tardiness distribution. Use **bottleneck funnel analysis** to see if delays cluster at specific machines. |
| **Impact of Disruptions** | *Event Correlation + Anomaly Detection* | Correlate “Breakdown Start” and “Priority Change” events with downstream delays. Use **prefix-based conformance** to compare job progress before/after disruption. Compute: “Delay attributable to breakdown” = actual delay minus expected delay without disruption. |

> **Example Insight**: Analysis reveals that 68% of setup time variability on CUT-01 is explained by the *previous job’s material hardness*. Jobs following a hardened steel job require 35% longer setup than those following aluminum. This is invisible in static rules.

### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Process mining exposes systemic inefficiencies by comparing *actual* flows against ideal or expected behavior. Key pathologies identified:

#### **Pathology 1: Bottleneck Mismanagement at CUT-01 and MILL-03**
- **Evidence**: Resource utilization heatmap shows CUT-01 at 92% utilization (vs. 65% average). Queue time at CUT-01 has a P95 of 8.2 hours — far exceeding other stations.
- **Impact**: 73% of late jobs show >4h delay at CUT-01. MIL-03 has 40% higher queue time than expected due to downstream dependency on CUT-01 output.

#### **Pathology 2: High-Priority Job Neglect**
- **Evidence**: Variant analysis comparing “On-Time” vs. “Late” job traces shows that 82% of “High” priority jobs (e.g., JOB-7005) were scheduled *after* medium-priority jobs that arrived earlier — even when due dates were 3–5 days sooner.
- **Evidence**: “Priority Change” events are not propagated to machine-level dispatchers. Jobs with new “High” priority often wait 6–12 hours before being rescheduled.

#### **Pathology 3: Excessive Setup Time Due to Poor Sequencing**
- **Evidence**: Setup time matrix reveals that switching between dissimilar materials (e.g., steel  titanium) incurs 45–60 min setups, while similar materials (steel  steel) are 15–20 min. Current scheduling randomly sequences jobs, resulting in 32% of setups being “high-cost” transitions.
- **Evidence**: Clustering of job types shows that 12 job families account for 78% of volume — yet no batching or family-based sequencing policy exists.

#### **Pathology 4: Downstream Starvation of Grinding & Inspection**
- **Evidence**: Milling (MILL-03) has long queues, but Grinding (GRIND-02) shows 40% idle time. This indicates upstream bottlenecks are starving downstream capacity — a classic **push system failure**.
- **Evidence**: WIP between Milling and Grinding is 14.7 jobs on average — far above the theoretical minimum of 2–3.

#### **Pathology 5: Bullwhip Effect in WIP**
- **Evidence**: Process mining reveals that when CUT-01 experiences a 2h delay, WIP at Milling increases by 3.8 jobs on average — indicating that local delays are amplified upstream due to lack of synchronization.

> **Diagnostic Tools Used**:  
> - **Bottleneck Analysis** (via resource utilization + queue time heatmaps)  
> - **Variant Analysis** (comparing traces of on-time vs. late jobs using **Dotted Chart** and **Conformance Checking**)  
> - **Correlation Analysis** (linking breakdown events to downstream delays)  
> - **WIP Flow Analysis** (using **Process Tomography** to visualize inventory accumulation between stages)

### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

The current dispatching rules (FCFS + EDD) fail because they are **static, local, and myopic**. Process mining reveals the deeper root causes:

| Root Cause | Evidence from Process Mining | Differentiation: Scheduling vs. Capacity |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Static Dispatching Rules** | Jobs with earlier due dates are frequently delayed because they are buried behind longer jobs in FCFS. EDD is applied per machine, not globally. | *Not a capacity issue*: Machines are underutilized overall, but *locally overloaded* due to poor sequencing. |
| **No Real-Time Visibility** | Priority changes (e.g., JOB-7005) are logged at MES but not pushed to machine controllers. Queue status is not shared across work centers. | *Scheduling logic failure*: System knows the priority, but doesn’t act on it. |
| **Inaccurate Duration Estimations** | Planned vs. Actual task durations show 22% average deviation. Setup times are assumed constant. | *Data-driven estimation failure*: Actual durations vary by ±35% based on job family and operator — ignored in planning. |
| **Ignored Sequence-Dependent Setups** | Setup time varies 3x depending on prior job — yet no scheduling logic uses this. | *Not a machine limitation*: Same machine could handle 20% more jobs if setups were optimized. |
| **Poor Disruption Response** | Breakdowns cause cascading delays. No recovery policy (e.g., job resequencing, rescheduling buffers). | *Not a maintenance issue*: The *response* to breakdowns is reactive, not predictive. |
| **Work Center Silos** | No coordination between machines. Each center optimizes locally (e.g., MILL-03 minimizes its own queue, ignoring GRIND-02’s idle time). | *Systemic coordination failure*: Local optima = global suboptima. |

> **Key Insight from Mining**:  
> - **80% of delays** are caused by **scheduling logic failures** (poor sequencing, lack of priority propagation, no setup optimization).  
> - Only 20% are due to **true capacity constraints** (e.g., only 2 machines can do heat treatment).  
>  **Solution Focus**: Optimize *how* jobs are sequenced, not just *how many* machines exist.

### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

#### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Multi-Criteria Dispatching with Predictive Setup Estimation**

- **Core Logic**: Replace EDD/FCFS with a **weighted scoring rule** at each machine queue, updated every 15 minutes:
  ```
  Score = w1*(Due Date Proximity) + w2*(Priority Weight) + w3*(Remaining Processing Time) + w4*(Downstream Load Penalty) + w5*(Estimated Setup Cost)
  ```
  - **Due Date Proximity**: Days until due date (normalized).
  - **Priority Weight**: High=1.0, Medium=0.6, Low=0.3.
  - **Remaining Processing Time**: Sum of *predicted* durations of all remaining tasks (based on historical distributions).
  - **Downstream Load Penalty**: Based on queue length at next machine (e.g., if next machine has >5 jobs, penalty = 0.8).
  - **Estimated Setup Cost**: From mined setup matrix: `SetupCost(Job_i, Job_j) = avg(setup time for sequence ji)`.

- **Process Mining Input**:  
  - Setup time matrix from transition analysis.  
  - Task duration distributions by job family, operator, and material.  
  - Downstream queue lengths from real-time MES integration.

- **Addresses Pathologies**:  
  - Reduces tardiness by prioritizing near-due jobs *and* minimizing setup costs.  
  - Reduces WIP by avoiding pushing jobs into already congested downstream stations.  
  - Improves setup efficiency by favoring job sequences that minimize transitions.

- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Tardiness  35–45%  
  - Average setup time  25%  
  - WIP  20–30%  
  - Utilization  8–12% (due to better flow)

---

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Monte Carlo Simulation & Proactive Buffering**

- **Core Logic**:  
  Use **machine learning models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) trained on historical logs to predict:
  - Task duration: `Duration ~ JobFamily + Material + Operator + MachineHistory`
  - Breakdown probability: `P(Breakdown) ~ MachineAge + HoursRun + TempVariance + MaintenanceLog`
  - Setup time: `SetupTime ~ PreviousJobType + CurrentJobType + ToolingChange`

  Generate **multiple probable futures** for each job using Monte Carlo simulation (1000 scenarios). For each machine, select the job that minimizes expected tardiness across *all scenarios*, including disruption risks.

- **Proactive Buffering**:  
  - If a machine has >70% predicted utilization in next 8h, preemptively hold back 1–2 jobs to create a “buffer.”
  - If a disruption is predicted (e.g., 80% chance MILL-02 fails in 3h), reroute pending jobs to alternative machines or reschedule.

- **Process Mining Input**:  
  - Historical duration distributions by context.  
  - Breakdown frequency and duration patterns.  
  - Correlation between operator and performance (e.g., OP-105 has 15% faster setups than OP-107).

- **Addresses Pathologies**:  
  - Mitigates impact of disruptions before they occur.  
  - Reduces surprises by replacing fixed estimates with probabilistic forecasts.  
  - Enables “what-if” scheduling for urgent jobs.

- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Lead time predictability  50% (narrower confidence intervals).  
  - Tardiness  25% even during disruption spikes.  
  - Customer satisfaction  due to reliable delivery promises.

#### **Strategy 3: Setup-Aware Job Batching and Sequencing Optimization (SABSO)**

- **Core Logic**:  
  At bottleneck machines (CUT-01, MILL-03), implement a **batching and sequencing algorithm** inspired by the **Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSPTW)**:
  - Group jobs into “families” using clustering (k-means on job attributes: material, complexity, tooling).
  - For each batch of 3–5 jobs, compute the optimal sequence to **minimize total setup time**.
  - Use **Simulated Annealing** or **Genetic Algorithm** to find near-optimal sequences within 2-min computation time.
  - Only execute batch when queue reaches threshold (e.g., 3 jobs) or time window (e.g., 4h window for setup cost amortization).

- **Process Mining Input**:  
  - Job family clustering from historical job attributes.  
  - Setup time matrix (as in Strategy 1).  
  - Batch effect analysis: “How much setup time is saved if we sequence 5 steel jobs consecutively?”

- **Addresses Pathologies**:  
  - Directly targets the #1 source of setup waste (32% high-cost transitions).  
  - Reduces number of setups by 25–40% without increasing queue time.  
  - Improves operator efficiency by reducing tool changes.

- **Expected Impact**:  
  - Setup time  30–40% on bottlenecks.  
  - Machine throughput  18–22%.  
  - WIP  due to fewer job starts/stops.

> **Integration Note**: SABSO is applied only to top 3 bottleneck machines — cost-effective and high-impact.

### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

#### **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Framework**
- **Tool**: Use **AnyLogic** or **Simio** with MES-derived parameters:
  - Task durations: Log-derived distributions (Weibull, Gamma) per job family.
  - Setup times: Matrix from process mining.
  - Breakdowns: Poisson process with mean time between failures (MTBF) and repair time from logs.
  - Priority changes: Event stream replayed from historical data.
  - Routing: Actual job paths mined (not assumed).
- **Scenarios Tested**:
  1. **Baseline**: Current EDD/FCFS.
  2. **Strategy 1**: Dynamic Dispatching.
  3. **Strategy 2**: Predictive + Buffering.
  4. **Strategy 3**: SABSO.
  5. **Hybrid**: SABSO + Dynamic Dispatching + Predictive Buffering (recommended).
- **KPIs Tracked**: Tardiness %, Avg. Lead Time, WIP Level, Machine Utilization, Setup Time %, Throughput.
- **Validation**: Run 50 replications of 30-day simulations under high-load (120% capacity) and disruption-heavy (2 breakdowns/day) conditions.
- **Result**: Hybrid strategy reduces tardiness by 52% vs. baseline, WIP by 38%, and setup time by 35% — statistically significant (p<0.01).

#### **Continuous Monitoring & Adaptive Learning Framework**
- **Real-Time Process Mining Dashboard**:  
  Deploy **ProM** or **Celonis** with live MES feed. Monitor:
  - Real-time queue lengths per machine.
  - Setup time deviations from predicted.
  - Tardiness trend (rolling 7-day).
- **Drift Detection**:  
  Use **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** on KPIs. If tardiness exceeds control limits for 3 consecutive days  trigger alert.
- **Adaptive Learning Loop**:  
  ```
  [Monitor]  [Detect Anomaly]  [Re-run Process Mining]  [Update Setup Matrix / Duration Models]  [Re-optimize Dispatch Rules]  [Deploy New Rule Set]
  ```
- **Feedback Mechanism**:  
  Every Friday, the scheduler runs a “what-if” simulation with last week’s actual data to validate rule performance. If hybrid strategy underperforms by >5%, retrain ML models and re-optimize weights.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**:  
  Allow scheduler to override rules for critical jobs — but log the override and its impact for future model refinement.
