### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **Receive (R) to Approve (P)**: The average time is approximately 25 hours with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hour). This suggests an unnaturally rigid and uniform approval timeline, inconsistent with real-world variability in claim complexity or resource availability.

2. **Approve (P) to Notify (N)**: The average delay is 7 days with a very high standard deviation (2 days), indicating extreme inconsistency—some claims are notified immediately after approval, while others wait over two weeks. This points to a potential systemic bottleneck or manual intervention gap.

3. **Assign (A) to Close (C)**: The average time is only 2 hours, which is implausibly short given that intermediate steps (Evaluate, Approve, Notify) are required. This suggests claims may be closed without completing all necessary activities, or events are being logged incorrectly.

4. **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N)**: A 5-minute average interval with minimal variation (1-minute STDEV) is unrealistic for a process that typically requires manual review, documentation, and customer communication. This may indicate automated notifications triggered without actual human evaluation or event logging errors.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R  P (Rigid Approval Timeline)**:  
   An automated approval system may be enforcing a fixed 25-hour window regardless of claim complexity, or junior staff are bypassing evaluation steps by manually backdating or skipping events. This could also reflect a system-generated “approval” event that is not tied to actual human review.

2. **P  N (Extended and Inconsistent Notification Delay)**:  
   Notification may be handled by a separate, under-resourced team with inconsistent workflows. Delays could stem from manual email/SMS triggers, lack of integration between systems, or claims being held for audit before notification. The high variance suggests some claims are prioritized while others are forgotten.

3. **A  C (Premature Closure)**:  
   Claims may be closed without evaluation or approval due to system errors (e.g., duplicate or erroneous events), or adjusters are closing claims prematurely to meet KPIs. Alternatively, low-value claims may be auto-closed via a rule engine that doesn’t log intermediate steps.

4. **E  N (Implausibly Fast Notification)**:  
   Notification may be triggered automatically upon evaluation without human oversight, or the “Notify” event is being logged prematurely—e.g., when an email is queued rather than sent. This could also indicate that “Notify” is being misused to log internal system alerts rather than customer communication.

### Verification Queries Using SQL

#### 1. Identify claims with R  P timing outside expected range (25h ± 1h = 24–26h)
```sql
WITH r_p_intervals AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' 
      AND ce2.activity = 'P'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce3 
          WHERE ce3.claim_id = ce1.claim_id 
            AND ce3.timestamp > ce1.timestamp 
            AND ce3.timestamp < ce2.timestamp 
            AND ce3.activity IN ('A', 'E')
      )
)
SELECT 
    claim_id,
    duration_seconds,
    TO_TIMESTAMP(ce1.timestamp) AS receive_time,
    TO_TIMESTAMP(ce2.timestamp) AS approve_time
FROM r_p_intervals
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON r_p_intervals.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON r_p_intervals.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
WHERE duration_seconds < 86400 OR duration_seconds > 93600;  -- Outside 24–26h
```

#### 2. Find claims with P  N delays exceeding 10 days (7d + 3  13 days)
```sql
WITH p_n_intervals AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' 
      AND ce2.activity = 'N'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    pni.claim_id,
    pni.duration_seconds / 86400.0 AS days_delay,
    c.customer_id,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type,
    ce1.resource AS approve_resource,
    ce2.resource AS notify_resource
FROM p_n_intervals pni
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON pni.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON pni.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON pni.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE pni.duration_seconds > 864000;  -- >10 days
```

#### 3. Detect claims closed immediately after assignment (A  C < 4 hours) without intermediate steps
```sql
WITH a_c_direct AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' 
      AND ce2.activity = 'C'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
      AND NOT EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce3 
          WHERE ce3.claim_id = ce1.claim_id 
            AND ce3.timestamp BETWEEN ce1.timestamp AND ce2.timestamp 
            AND ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P', 'N')
      )
)
SELECT 
    acd.claim_id,
    acd.duration_seconds / 3600.0 AS hours_to_close,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region,
    a.specialization,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount
FROM a_c_direct acd
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON acd.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
JOIN claims c ON acd.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE acd.duration_seconds < 14400;  -- <4 hours
```

#### 4. Identify E  N intervals under 10 minutes (5min ± 1min  suspect if <300s)
```sql
WITH e_n_intervals AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' 
      AND ce2.activity = 'N'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    eni.claim_id,
    eni.duration_seconds,
    ce1.resource AS evaluator,
    ce2.resource AS notifier,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.claim_type
FROM e_n_intervals eni
JOIN claim_events ce1 ON eni.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
JOIN claim_events ce2 ON eni.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON eni.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE eni.duration_seconds < 300;  -- Less than 5 minutes
```

#### 5. Correlate anomalies with adjuster or region (e.g., high PN delays by region)
```sql
WITH p_n_delays AS (
    SELECT 
        ce1.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS duration_seconds,
        a.region,
        a.name AS adjuster_name
    FROM claim_events ce1
    JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
    JOIN adjusters a ON ce1.resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' 
      AND ce2.activity = 'N'
      AND ce2.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
)
SELECT 
    region,
    COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN duration_seconds > 864000 THEN 1 END) AS high_delay_count,
    AVG(duration_seconds / 86400.0) AS avg_days_delay,
    MAX(duration_seconds / 86400.0) AS max_days_delay
FROM p_n_delays
GROUP BY region
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN duration_seconds > 864000 THEN 1 END) > 5
ORDER BY avg_days_delay DESC;
```

These queries enable targeted investigation into the root causes of anomalies—whether they stem from systemic issues, individual adjuster behavior, regional disparities, or data integrity problems.
