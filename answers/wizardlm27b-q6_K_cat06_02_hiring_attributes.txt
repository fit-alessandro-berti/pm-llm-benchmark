 In the context of data provided, several attributes can be considered sensitive for fairness depending on the jurisdiction and the specific fairness criteria being applied. Here are the attributes that are typically sensitive from a fairness perspective:

1. **case:citizen**: This attribute indicates whether an individual is a citizen or not. Citizenship status can affect access to certain rights, benefits, and employment opportunities, making this attribute a sensitive factor for fairness.

2. **case:gender**: Gender is a protected characteristic in many jurisdictions due to its potential impact on hiring, pay, and other employment-related decisions. It's important to ensure that gender does not unfairly influence outcomes.

3. **case:german speaking**: Language proficiency can be a sensitive attribute if it correlates with nationality or ethnic background. If speaking German is a requirement for the job and is used in a way that disadvantages non-German speakers, this could lead to unfair treatment based on ethnicity or national origin.

4. **case:religious**: Religious beliefs are protected characteristics in many countries. Employment decisions should not be influenced by an individual's religion, as this would constitute discrimination.

5. **resource**: The resource attribute describes the person with whom the activity was conducted (e.g., HR-dummy, Senior Partner, Coding Interviewer). This could indirectly reflect socioeconomic status or position within an organization, which can be a sensitive factor for fairness if it influences decision-making processes.

6. **start_timestamp**: The timing of when an activity begins can be sensitive if it correlates with other factors such as work hours, shifts, or access to resources. If certain activities start at times that are less accessible to individuals due to their personal circumstances (e.g., family responsibilities, religious observances), this could introduce bias.

7. **time** and **time:timestamp**: These attributes reflect the duration of an activity. While time itself is not inherently sensitive, if longer or shorter durations correlate with discrimination—for example, if certain individuals are consistently scheduled for longer or shorter times due to stereotypes about their work ethic or reliability—then this could become a sensitive fairness issue.

When evaluating fairness in data, it's important to consider both direct attributes like gender, race, or citizenship and indirect attributes that might be proxies for these direct attributes. Fairness in machine learning and employment practices involves ensuring that decisions are made without unjust or unlawful discrimination and that all individuals have equal access to opportunities. This requires careful analysis of the data used for decision-making and the implementation of fairness measures to mitigate biases.
