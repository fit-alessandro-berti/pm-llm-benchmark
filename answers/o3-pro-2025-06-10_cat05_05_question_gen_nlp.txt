1. How do variations in lead times among the different component suppliers impact overall production scheduling, and what strategies can mitigate associated risks?  

2. In what ways could geopolitical tensions or trade policy changes affect the procurement of critical components, and how might the company build resilience against such disruptions?  

3. How can machine-learning–based demand forecasting be integrated with supplier production planning to minimize both stockouts and excess inventory across diverse markets?  

4. What quality assurance practices could be implemented upstream (at the supplier level) to reduce defects detected on the Malaysian assembly line?  

5. How might the company balance just-in-time replenishment for high-demand markets with the need for safety stock in regions prone to logistical delays?  

6. Which KPIs best capture the environmental footprint of each supply-chain stage, and how could those metrics drive greener sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution decisions?  

7. How can supplier relationship management be enhanced to encourage collaborative innovation without compromising cost competitiveness?  

8. What contingency plans are in place for sudden capacity constraints at the Malaysian assembly plant, and how could alternative manufacturing sites be qualified quickly?  

9. How might currency fluctuations across multiple countries influence total landed cost calculations, and how can financial hedging strategies be optimized?  

10. In what ways could advanced automation and robotics improve throughput and quality on the assembly line while addressing labor considerations?  

11. How can real-time visibility tools be expanded to give stakeholders end-to-end transparency, and what data-governance challenges might arise?  

12. What role do regional regulatory differences (e.g., data privacy, labor laws, environmental standards) play in determining distribution center locations and operating procedures?  

13. How could the company leverage circular-economy principles—such as refurbishing, recycling, or modular design—to extend product life cycles and reduce waste?  

14. What scenarios would trigger a large-scale product recall, and how can traceability systems ensure rapid identification of affected units?  

15. How might shifting consumer preferences toward sustainability influence sourcing decisions for components like OLED screens and batteries?  

16. What methods can be used to quantify and reduce the carbon emissions associated with air freight versus ocean shipping for different market segments?  

17. How can collaborative forecasting with major retailers and e-commerce platforms improve demand accuracy and diminish bullwhip effects?  

18. What cybersecurity measures are necessary to protect sensitive supply-chain data exchanged among international partners?  

19. How could predictive analytics be applied to proactive warranty and after-sales support, thereby feeding insights back into product design and supplier quality programs?  

20. In anticipation of emerging technologies (e.g., 6G, foldable displays), how should the supply chain evolve to handle new component requirements and shorter product life cycles?
