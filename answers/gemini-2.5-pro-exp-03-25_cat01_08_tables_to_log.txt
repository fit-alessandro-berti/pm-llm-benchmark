Okay, let's construct the event log step-by-step by integrating the data from the provided ERP tables.

**Assumptions Made:**

1.  Each row in the `Order Lines` table represents a distinct "Item Picked" event.
2.  Each row in the `Delivery` table generates two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
3.  Each row in the `Invoice` table represents an "Invoice Issued" event.
4.  Each row in the `Payments` table represents a "Payment Received" event. The `order_id` for payment events is derived by joining `Payments` with `Invoice` on `invoice_id`.
5.  The `Resources` table will be used to map resource IDs to names and roles for better readability.
6.  Events are sorted primarily by `Case ID` (order\_id) and secondarily by `Timestamp`.
7.  For the "Payment Received" event, there isn't a specific internal resource performing the action (it's initiated externally), so the Resource/Role fields will be left blank for these events, but `payment_method` is included as an attribute.

**Step 1: Generate "Order Created" Events**
*(From Orders Table)*

| Case ID | Activity Name   | Timestamp             | Resource      | Resource Role | Customer ID | Customer Type | Order Priority |
| :------ | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :------------ | :------------ | :---------- | :------------ | :------------- |
| 1001    | Order Created   | 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z  | Alice Brown   | Sales Person  | CUST-ABC    | Retail        | High           |
| 1002    | Order Created   | 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z  | Bob Smith     | Sales Person  | CUST-XYZ    | Wholesale     | Medium         |
| 1003    | Order Created   | 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z  | Bob Smith     | Sales Person  | CUST-AAA    | Retail        | High           |
| 1004    | Order Created   | 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z  | Charlie Kim   | Sales Person  | CUST-BBB    | Government    | Low            |

**Step 2: Generate "Item Picked" Events**
*(From Order Lines Table)*

| Case ID | Activity Name | Timestamp             | Resource      | Resource Role   | Item ID  | Quantity |
| :------ | :------------ | :-------------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :------- | :------- |
| 1001    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z  | David Lin     | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-001 | 2        |
| 1001    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z  | Eva Johnson   | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-002 | 1        |
| 1002    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z  | Eva Johnson   | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-003 | 4        |
| 1002    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z  | David Lin     | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-005 | 2        |

| 1003    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-05T15:45:00Z  | David Lin     | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-006 | 3        |
| 1004    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z  | Eva Johnson   | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-001 | 5        |
| 1005    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-06T09:30:00Z  | Frank Miller  | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-007 | 10       |
| 1005    | Item Picked   | 2024-01-06T09:45:00Z  | Eva Johnson   | Warehouse Staff | ITEM-002 | 2        |

**Step 3: Generate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" Events**
*(From Delivery Table)*

| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp             | Resource        | Resource Role | Delivery ID | Delivery Note               |
| :------ | :---------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :---------- | :-------------------------- |
| 1001    | Order Dispatched  | 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z  | GlobalTransport | Carrier       | DLV-5001    | Normal route                |
| 1001    | Order Arrived     | 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z  | GlobalTransport | Carrier       | DLV-5001    | Normal route                |
| 1002    | Order Dispatched  | 2024-01-04T07:20:00Z  | FastShip        | Carrier       | DLV-5002    | Requires signature          |
| 1002    | Order Dispatched  | 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z  | GlobalTransport | Carrier       | DLV-5003    | Partial backorder           |
| 1002    | Order Arrived     | 2024-01-07T16:10:00Z  | FastShip        | Carrier       | DLV-5002    | Requires signature          |
| 1002    | Order Arrived     | 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z  | GlobalTransport | Carrier       | DLV-5003    | Partial backorder           |
| 1003    | Order Dispatched  | 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z  | AirExpress      | Carrier       | DLV-5004    | Expedited delivery          |
| 1003    | Order Arrived     | 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z  | AirExpress      | Carrier       | DLV-5004    | Expedited delivery          |
| 1005    | Order Dispatched  | 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z  | FastShip        | Carrier       | DLV-5005    | Fragile items, handle with care |
| 1005    | Order Arrived     | 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z  | FastShip        | Carrier       | DLV-5005    | Fragile items, handle with care |

**Step 4: Generate "Invoice Issued" Events**
*(From Invoice Table)*

| Case ID | Activity Name  | Timestamp             | Resource    | Resource Role | Invoice ID | Invoice Amount |
| :------ | :------------- | :-------------------- | :---------- | :------------ | :--------- | :------------- |
| 1001    | Invoice Issued | 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z  | Gina Carter | Billing Clerk | INV-1001   | 250.00         |
| 1002    | Invoice Issued | 2024-01-08T10:15:00Z  | Harry Lee   | Billing Clerk | INV-1002   | 400.00         |
| 1002    | Invoice Issued | 2024-01-10T11:00:00Z  | Harry Lee   | Billing Clerk | INV-1003   | 100.00         |

**Step 5: Generate "Payment Received" Events**
*(From Payments Table, joined with Invoice Table to get order_id)*

| Case ID | Activity Name    | Timestamp             | Resource | Resource Role | Invoice ID | Payment ID | Payment Method | Payment Reference |
| :------ | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| 1001    | Payment Received | 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z  |          |               | INV-1001   | PAY-2001   | Credit Card    | REF-CC-123        |
| 1002    | Payment Received | 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z  |          |               | INV-1002   | PAY-2002   | Wire Transfer  | REF-WT-XYZ        |
| 1002    | Payment Received | 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z  |          |               | INV-1003   | PAY-2003   | Check          | REF-CH-789        |
| 1003    | Payment Received | 2024-01-11T10:30:00Z  |          |               | INV-1004   | PAY-2004   | Credit Card    | REF-CC-456        |
| 1005    | Payment Received | 2024-01-15T12:00:00Z  |          |               | INV-1005   | PAY-2005   | Credit Card    | REF-CC-789        |

**Step 6: Combine and Sort All Events**

Now, we combine all the generated events into a single log and sort them by `Case ID` and then `Timestamp`. Attributes not relevant to a specific event type are left blank.

**Final Event Log:**

| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp             | Resource        | Resource Role   | Customer ID | Customer Type | Order Priority | Item ID  | Quantity | Delivery ID | Delivery Note               | Invoice ID | Invoice Amount | Payment ID | Payment Method | Payment Reference |
| :------ | :---------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------ | :------------- | :------- | :------- | :---------- | :-------------------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------------- |
