We need to construct a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for the scenario. The description says keys: list of constraint types. For each constraint type, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule.

But for binary constraints (like response, precedence, etc.) they involve pairs of activities. The description says "as keys the activities" but likely they mean pairs? However we can follow the description: for each key, the value is a dict where keys are activities (or activity pairs) and values are dict with 'support' and 'confidence'.

We need to produce a plausible model: include some constraints for each type. Provide support/confidence values (maybe 1.0 and 0.9 etc). Provide example constraints: existence of IG, absence of something, exactly_one of something, init maybe IG is init. For binary constraints: response IG->DD, precedence IG->DD, etc.

We'll construct dictionary with all keys, each containing some constraints.

We'll format as Python code block.

Make sure to follow formatting rules: code formatted with Prettier width 80. Use proper indentation.

We'll include comments maybe.

Let's craft.

Below is a **complete DECLARE model** for the product‑design‑and‑launch scenario.  
Each top‑level key corresponds to a DECLARE constraint type.  
The value of every key is a dictionary whose **inner keys are the activities (or activity‑pairs)** that the constraint refers to, and whose **inner values are the support and confidence** measured for that rule (here we use illustrative numbers – in a real analysis they would be derived from the event log).

```python

### How to read the dictionary
* **Unary constraints** (`existence`, `absence`, `exactly_one`, `init`) map a *single* activity to its support/confidence.
* **Binary constraints** map a **tuple** `(source, target)` to the same metric pair.
* **Negative constraints** (`noncoexistence`, `nonsuccession`, `nonchainsuccession`) express that the two activities should *not* appear together (or in the specified order).

Feel free to adjust the support/confidence values or add/remove constraints to match the actual event‑log statistics of your organization.
