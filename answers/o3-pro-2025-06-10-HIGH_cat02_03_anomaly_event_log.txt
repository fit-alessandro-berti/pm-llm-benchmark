Typical “happy-path” for Procure-to-Pay

1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve PR  
3. Issue / transmit Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Supplier ships goods or provides services  
5. Receive Goods / Service Entry  
6. Supplier sends Invoice  
7. 3-way Match (PO + Goods Receipt + Invoice)  
8. Release / execute Payment  
9. Close the case

Ordering may vary slightly (e.g., invoice can arrive before the goods), but steps 1-3 must precede any physical receipt or payment, and step 7 must precede step 8 in almost every well-controlled organisation.

Case-by-case inspection
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Case 1001 – Conforms to best practice  
   PR  Approval  PO  Goods receipt  Invoice  3-way match  Payment  Close

2. Case 1002 – Several red flags  
   • PO issued before the PR is approved  
     - 08:40 PO vs. 08:00 PR approval only on 2024-02-03 08:00  
     - Indicates bypassing of spending authorisation.  
   • Invoice received and payment released before requisition approval and before goods receipt  
     - Payment: 2024-02-03 07:15  
     - Goods receipt not until 2024-02-04  
     - 3-way match only on 2024-02-05 (after money already left).  
   • Risks: Unauthorised purchase, over-payments, paying for goods never received, SOX / audit finding.

3. Case 1003 – Early payment / pre-payment without controls  
   • Payment (2024-02-08) occurs:  
     - Before invoice is even logged (2024-02-09)  
     - Before goods are received (2024-02-10)  
     - Before 3-way match (2024-02-11)  
   • Although pre-payments can be legitimate, they normally require a special “advance payment” workflow with explicit approval and a different matching logic. None is recorded here.  
   • Risks: Cash-flow impact, supplier default, inability to reclaim VAT, control violation.

4. Case 1004 – Goods received before a PO exists  
   • Goods receipt: 2024-02-06 09:00  
   • PO only created 15 minutes later (09:15)  
   • Indicates “maverick buying” – supplier ships without a formal order; buyer back-creates PO to legitimise it.  
   • Very compressed timeline: invoice and payment follow the next morning, suggesting minimal or no inspection of goods or invoice.  
   • Risks: Contractual liability without terms, inaccurate inventory, potential fraud.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Why these patterns are problematic

• Break the authorisation chain – spending occurs before someone with the proper delegation of authority approves it (cases 1002 & 1004).  
• Violate 3-way-match control – payment goes out before verifying that (a) the supplier actually delivered and (b) the invoice equals the agreed price/quantity (cases 1002 & 1003).  
• Undermine segregation of duties – one individual could potentially create, approve and pay without independent checks when steps are collapsed into minutes.  
• Create audit and compliance exposure – SOX, ISO 9001, internal audit and external auditors typically flag any payment made before matching documentation exists.  
• Financial risk – paying too early harms cash position and makes recovery difficult if goods are defective or never arrive.  
• Operational risk – receiving goods with no PO complicates inventory valuation and hampers spend analytics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of anomalies

• Case 1001: No anomaly.  
• Case 1002: PO before PR approval; payment before goods, invoice-match, and even before PR approval.  
• Case 1003: Payment before invoice, goods receipt, and match (uncontrolled pre-payment).  
• Case 1004: Goods received before PO existed; extremely fast invoice-to-payment cycle.

Each of these sequence violations breaks one or more standard P2P controls and should be investigated and remedied.
