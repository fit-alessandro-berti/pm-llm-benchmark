Generating a realistic temporal profile for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process requires understanding the typical stages involved in such a process and making educated estimates about the average time durations and standard deviations between these stages. Since actual times can vary greatly depending on the organization, industry, technology, and geographic location, the provided example will be highly generalized. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a simplified P2P process with a generated temporal profile:

### Simplified Purchase-to-Pay Process Stages:

1. **Request Creation** (RC) - An employee creates a purchase request.
2. **Approval** (A) - The request is approved by a manager or designated approver.
3. **Purchase Order Creation** (POC) - A purchase order is generated based on the approved request.
4. **Supplier Dispatch** (SD) - The purchase order is sent to the supplier.
5. **Goods Receipt** (GR) - The ordered goods are received by the purchasing organization.
6. **Invoice Receipt** (IR) - The invoice for the goods is received from the supplier.
7. **Payment Processing** (PP) - The payment for the invoice is processed.

### Generated Temporal Profile Example:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('RC', 'A'): (7200, 1800),  # Request Creation to Approval: Avg=2 hours, STDEV=30 minutes
    ('A', 'POC'): (3600, 600),   # Approval to PO Creation: Avg=1 hour, STDEV=10 minutes
    ('POC', 'SD'): (1800, 300),  # PO Creation to Supplier Dispatch: Avg=30 minutes, STDEV=5 minutes
    ('SD', 'GR'): (604800, 120960),  # Supplier Dispatch to Goods Receipt: Avg=7 days, STDEV=2 days
    ('GR', 'IR'): (86400, 43200),    # Goods Receipt to Invoice Receipt: Avg=1 day, STDEV=0.5 days
    ('IR', 'PP'): (28800, 7200)      # Invoice Receipt to Payment Processing: Avg=8 hours, STDEV=2 hours
}
```

### Explanation of the Estimates:

- **Short intervals** (e.g., `('RC', 'A')`, `('A', 'POC')`, `('POC', 'SD')`) are assumed to be largely automated or quick turnaround processes within an organization, hence shorter average times and standard deviations.
  
- **Supplier Dispatch to Goods Receipt (`('SD', 'GR')`)**: This interval is significantly longer due to the external dependency on shipping times, which can vary greatly depending on the location and shipping method. Thus, a larger standard deviation reflects this variability.

- **Goods Receipt to Invoice Receipt (`('GR', 'IR')`)** and **Invoice Receipt to Payment Processing (`('IR', 'PP')`)**: These are assumed to have moderate processing times, with some buffer for potential delays or manual handling, reflected in their standard deviations.

### Using ZETA for Deviation Detection:

- **Example with ZETA=2** (commonly used in statistics to cover about 95% of the data points for normally distributed data):
  
    - For `('RC', 'A')`:
        - Lower deviation threshold = `7200 - 2*1800` = `3600` seconds (or 1 hour)
        - Upper deviation threshold = `7200 + 2*1800` = `10800` seconds (or 3 hours)

    This means any time between Request Creation and Approval that falls outside of the 1-3 hour window would be considered a deviation.
