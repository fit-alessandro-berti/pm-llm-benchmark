Here is a concise comparison of the two models, the anomalies each exhibits, and which one is closer to a normative HiretoRetire workflow.

1. Anomalies in Model 1  
– Missing “Interview  Decide” dependency  
• In the partial order we have  
Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  {Conduct_Interviews, Make_Hiring_Decision}  
• Because there is no edge Interview  Make_Hiring_Decision, the model allows a hiring decision (and even onboarding) to happen before or entirely without interviews.  
– Onboarding without interviews  
• Onboard_Employee only depends on Make_Hiring_Decision, so you could onboard someone who was never interviewed.  
Overall impact: a single, but severe, controlflow omission that lets you hire (and onboard) without ever interviewing candidates.

2. Anomalies in Model 2  
a) Screening and interviewing are independent  
• Both Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews depend only on Post_Job_Ad, so you can interview before, during or after screening.  
• Make_Hiring_Decision depends on the interview but not on screening—so you can decide on a hire without ever screening.  
b) Unbounded/repeated onboarding  
• LOOP(Onboard_Employee, skip) forces at least one Onboard_Employee, but then you can “redo” the loop any number of times (Onboard  skip  Onboard  …).  
• In practice you only ever want to onboard once.  
c) Optional payroll  
• XOR(Add_to_Payroll, skip) makes “Add_to_Payroll” optional—so some hires would never be paid.  
Overall impact: multiple deviations from normal practice—screening can be skipped or reordered, onboarding can repeat, and payroll can be omitted entirely.

3. Which model is more normative?  
Model 1 is much closer to a standard HiretoRetire process. It has a single misplaced dependency (decision should wait on interviews) that can be fixed by simply adding the edge Interview  Make_Hiring_Decision.  
Model 2, by contrast, has a cascade of anomalies—parallel screening vs. interviewing, a nonsensical onboarding loop, and optional payroll—that fundamentally violate the essence of hiring and payroll operations.  

Therefore, Model 1 aligns far more closely with a correct, integritypreserving HiretoRetire workflow.
