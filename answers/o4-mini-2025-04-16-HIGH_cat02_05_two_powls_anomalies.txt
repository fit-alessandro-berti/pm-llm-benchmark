Below is a structured comparison of the two models against the “ideal” Hire-to-Retire sequence:

1. The “Normative” Hire-to-Retire Sequence  
   Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision   
   Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case  

2. Anomalies in Model 1  
   • Missing ordering between Conduct_Interviews and Make_Hiring_Decision  
     – As written, Decide and Interview are both children of Screen but have no precedence relation.  
     – This allows “Make_Hiring_Decision” to fire before any interviews have taken place (or interviews to happen after the decision).  
   • No other deviations: the rest of the chain (PostScreenDecideOnboardPayrollClose) is correct.  

   Severity of anomaly:  
   – Fairly significant (you shouldn’t hire without interviewing) but localized: a single missing constraint.  

3. Anomalies in Model 2  
   a) Screening vs. Interviewing are parallel  
      – Both Screen_Candidates and Conduct_Interviews depend only on Post_Job_Ad.  
      – You can interview a candidate without ever screening them (or screen after interviewing).  
   b) Onboarding in a LOOP  
      – Operator.LOOP(Onboard, skip) implies you can Onboard_Employee repeatedly (or exit at any point).  
      – In reality onboarding is a one-off activity.  
   c) Payroll as an XOR with “skip”  
      – Operator.XOR(Add_to_Payroll, skip) makes “Add_to_Payroll” optional.  
      – You could close the hire case without ever adding the new employee to the payroll system.  
   d) Silent transition misuse  
      – The skip branches introduce silent decision points that undermine traceability of essential activities.

   Severity of anomalies:  
   – Fundamental violations of process integrity. You both bypass screening/interviews and make payroll optional, and can onboard multiple times.  

4. Comparative Judgment  
   • Model 1 deviates only in the single missing precedence constraint between interviewing and decision-making. All other activities follow the expected linear flow.  
   • Model 2 contains multiple, more severe logical errors:  
     – Parallelizing screening and interviews (so you might never screen)  
     – Repeating (or skipping) onboarding  
     – Making payroll optional  
     – Introducing silent hops that obscure whether critical tasks happened  

Conclusion: Model 1 is far closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process. Its lone anomaly (the missing order edge between “Conduct_Interviews” and “Make_Hiring_Decision”) can be remedied by simply adding that edge. Model 2, by contrast, would require extensive restructuring to restore basic hiring semantics.
