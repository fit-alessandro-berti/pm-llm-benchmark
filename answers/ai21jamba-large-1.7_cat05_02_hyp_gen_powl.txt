### 1. **Identifying Anomalies in the Given POWL Model**

**Anomalies:**

1. **Loop Between Evaluation and Approval (E  P  E):**
	- This creates a cycle that allows a claim to be repeatedly evaluated and approved, which could lead to inconsistencies or inefficiencies in the process.
2. **XOR That May Skip Customer Notification (N | skip):**
	- The XOR structure provides an option to skip customer notification entirely, which deviates from the expected process flow.
3. **Partial Ordering Allowing Premature Claim Closure (A  C):**
	- The partial ordering doesn't enforce a strict sequence between evaluation/approval and claim closure, meaning a claim could be closed before it's fully evaluated or approved.

### 2. **Hypotheses on Why These Anomalies Might Exist**

1. **Changes in Business Rules That Were Partially Implemented:**
	- The business might have introduced a new rule allowing certain claims to bypass specific steps (e.g., customer notification), but the process model was not correctly aligned with the updated rules.
2. **Miscommunication Between Departments Leading to Incomplete Process Design:**
	- Different departments managing stages like evaluation, approval, and customer service may have had conflicting understandings of how the process should function, leading to discrepancies in the model.
3. **Technical Errors in the Workflow System:**
	- There might be a bug or misconfiguration in the system that allows out-of-order execution or skips essential steps.
4. **Inadequate Constraints or Controls in the Process Modeler's Tool:**
	- The tool used to design the process model may lack sufficient constraints to enforce proper sequence and prevent anomalies.

### 3. **Proposed Database Queries to Verify Hypotheses**

**Using the claims, adjusters, and claim_events tables, the following queries can help identify real-world occurrences of these anomalies.**

#### **1. Identify Claims Closed Without Proper Evaluation or Approval:**

Look for claims that have a "Close" activity in `claim_events` but lack a preceding "Evaluate" and "Approve" activity.

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C' -- Close Claim
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events e
      WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id
        AND e.activity = 'E' -- Evaluate Claim
  )
  OR NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events p
      WHERE p.claim_id = c.claim_id
        AND p.activity = 'P' -- Approve Claim
  );
```

**Expected Output:** Claims where "Close" happens without prior "Evaluate" or "Approve."

#### **2. Locate Claims Approved Multiple Times:**

Search for claims that have multiple "Approve" activities in `claim_events` to check for redundant approval.

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'P' -- Approve Claim
GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING COUNT(ce.activity) > 1;
```

**Expected Output:** Claims with more than one "Approve" activity.

#### **3. Check if Customer Notification Steps Are Frequently Skipped:**

Find claims that have gone through the "Approve" step but do not have a subsequent "Notify Customer" activity.

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, ce.timestamp
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'P' -- Approve Claim
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM claim_events n
      WHERE n.claim_id = c.claim_id
        AND n.activity = 'N' -- Notify Customer
  );
```

**Expected Output:** Claims where "Notify Customer" is missing after approval.

### **Conclusion:**

These queries will help identify specific instances where anomalies occur, which can inform further investigation into process inconsistencies and inform necessary fixes or changes to the process model.
