## 1) Cases with significant performance issues (end-to-end lead time)

Lead time measured from **Submit Claim  Close Claim**:

| Case | Region | Complexity | # “Request Additional Documents” | Lead time |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 2001 | A | Low | 0 | **1h 30m** |
| 2004 | B | Low | 0 | **1h 25m** |
| 2002 | B | Medium | 1 | **~25h 55m** |
| 2003 | A | High | 2 | **~48h 20m** |
| 2005 | B | High | 3 | **~77h 05m** |

**Significantly longer cases:** **2002, 2003, 2005** (especially **2003** and **2005**).

Baseline for “healthy” cases here is the Low-complexity path (2001/2004) at ~**1.5 hours**.

## 2) Attribute-driven root cause analysis

### A. Complexity is the strongest driver (clear correlation)
- **Low complexity (2001, 2004):** no document requests, finishes in ~1.5h.
- **Medium (2002):** 1 document request, jumps to ~26h.
- **High (2003, 2005):** 2–3 document requests, jumps to **2–3+ days**.

This points to **rework/looping around “Request Additional Documents”** as the main structural cause of long durations.

**Where the time is lost (examples):**
- **Case 2002:**  
  - Request Docs (Apr1 14:00)  Approve (Apr2 10:00) = **~20h** (dominant delay)
- **Case 2005:**  
  - Req1  Req2 = **~29h 30m**  
  - Req2  Req3 = **~22h**  
  - Req3  Approve = **~19h**  
  These gaps dominate the 77h cycle time and strongly suggest **waiting for customer/third-party documents** and/or **piecemeal document collection**.

**Interpretation:** high complexity claims are not “slow” because core internal steps take long; they are slow because they trigger **multiple document collection iterations** with long waiting times between them.

### B. Resource patterns (possible contributor)
**Adjuster_Lisa** is involved in **all** cases that have document requests (2002, 2005) and also handles a fast case (2004). So it’s not “Lisa is always slow”, but rather:

- Complex work handled by **Adjuster_Lisa** shows **more document-request iterations**, especially **case 2005 (3 requests)**.
- **Adjuster_Mike** also requests documents (case 2003) but with fewer iterations (2 requests) than 2005.

**Potential resource-related root cause:** for complex claims, some adjusters may be:
- requesting documents in **multiple waves** (ask for some docs, then later realize more are needed),
- using **inconsistent checklists**, or
- dealing with **higher workload**, causing slower follow-ups.

**Manager_Bill** approves only the **High** cases (2003, 2005). Approvals occur ~19–23h after last request event—this might be:
- normal waiting for documents (most likely), and/or
- a managerial queue/batching effect (approvals done once per day).

**Finance_Alan** pays case 2003 **~17h after approval**, while Finance_Carl pays within minutes/hours in other cases. That suggests an additional delay source:
- **payment cut-off times / batch runs**, or
- **region-specific finance handling** (Alan appears in Region A only here).

---

### C. Region patterns (weak-to-moderate signal; likely indirect)
- Region **B** contains both a very fast case (2004) and the worst case (2005). So region alone doesn’t explain delays.
- However, **both Region B non-low cases (2002, 2005)** have document requests and long waits.

**Likely explanation:** Region differences may reflect:
- customer population differences (slower response / harder-to-obtain documentation),
- local policy/regulatory requirements increasing documentation needs,
- staffing/workload differences (queues).

But the log most strongly supports **complexity + document loop** as primary, with region as a secondary factor.

## 3) Explanations + mitigation suggestions

### Root cause 1: Rework loop around “Request Additional Documents”
**Why it causes delay:** each request introduces an external waiting period; multiple requests multiply that waiting and create stop-start flow.

**Mitigations**
- **Front-load documentation**: dynamic submission forms/checklists by claim type/complexity to reduce missing items.
- **One-and-done requesting**: standard “document bundle” per scenario so adjusters request everything needed in a single interaction.
- Add explicit events in the process log: **“Receive Documents”** and **“Documents Complete”** to separate:
  - customer waiting time vs internal processing time.
- Automated reminders/escalations if documents not received within X hours/days; offer self-service upload links.

---

### Root cause 2: Resource/work allocation and handling practices for complex cases
**Why it causes delay:** complex cases may be assigned to staff with inconsistent practices or overloaded queues, increasing iteration and follow-up time.

**Mitigations**
- Route **High complexity** claims to a **specialized team** with tighter playbooks.
- Compare adjusters on metrics like:
  - average # document requests per claim,
  - time from Evaluate  first Request,
  - time from last docs received  Approve (once “Receive Documents” exists).
- Coaching/standardization for complex-claim handling to reduce multi-wave requests.

---

### Root cause 3: Downstream batching/hand-off delays (Approve  Pay)
**Why it causes delay:** case 2003 shows a large approve-to-pay gap (~17h), consistent with end-of-day cutoffs.

**Mitigations**
- Align SLAs and staffing so **approved claims queue** is processed continuously (or add an extra batch run).
- If batching is required, make it explicit and predictable (communicate cutoffs; prioritize older approvals).

---

### Practical “next analyses” (to confirm)
- Compute average lead time by **Complexity × Region × Adjuster × Manager**.
- Track **# document request iterations** as a KPI (it’s the clearest predictor in this data).
- Add/collect “Receive Documents” timestamps to quantify external vs internal delay.

If you want, I can also extract a per-case “where time is spent” breakdown (stage-by-stage durations) to pinpoint the dominant waiting segments numerically for each case.
