Here is a process tree for the given scenario, crafted to balance fitness, precision, and simplicity, capturing the main sequence with the loop for repeated requests of missing info and re-validation:

```
-> (
    'RA',
    -> (
        'VF',
        -> (
            'AE',
            * (
                'VF',
                'RMI'
            ),
            -> (
                'AD',
                -> (
                    'SC',
                    'AC'
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

- The entire process is a sequence (`->`) from receiving the application (`RA`)...
- Then validating the form initially (`VF`).
- Then assessing eligibility (`AE`).
- After that, there is a **loop** (`*`) where the process either exits the loop or:
  - executes `RMI` (Request Missing Info),
  - and then executes `VF` (Validate Form) again,
  - and repeats as many times as needed.
- Once exiting the loop, the sequence continues with:
  - Approval Decision (`AD`),
  - followed by sending confirmation (`SC`),
  - and finally archiving the case (`AC`).

This structure succinctly captures the behavior observed:
- The initial sequential flow of RA -> VF -> AE
- Optional and repeated cycles of (RMI -> VF)
- The concluding sequence AD -> SC -> AC

### Key points:

- The loop operator `* (A, B)` means "execute A, then either exit or execute B then A repeatedly".  
- Here, `A` of the loop is `VF` (since each loop cycle begins with validating the form again), and `B` is `RMI` (request missing info triggers a re-validation).  
- This matches behavior where the form validation happens before checking eligibility the first time, then if missing info is requested, the form is validated again (loop body), potentially multiple times.

If you want, I can also render this process tree in a Python-like data structure format for direct use. Let me know!
