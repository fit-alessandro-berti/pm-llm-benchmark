Here's the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints added to mitigate potential biases:

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "ManualReview": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},

    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},

```

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **ManualReview** and **BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensuring that both `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` coexist with `FinalDecision` ensures that every decision step is reviewed for bias before being finalized.
   - **CheckApplicantRace**: This ensures that if an applicant has a sensitive attribute (e.g., `ApplicantRace: Minority`), there should be a `ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck` activity following it to prevent automatic rejection.

2. **Response/Succession Constraints:**
   - **ManualReview** and **BiasMitigationCheck**: Ensuring that `ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck` precedes `FinalDecision` prevents automatic decisions without thorough review.
   - **CheckApplicantRace**: Ensuring that `CheckApplicantRace` does not directly lead to `FinalDecision` without an intervening `ManualReview` or `BiasMitigationCheck` helps prevent immediate biased outcomes.

These constraints help ensure that the loan application process is fair and unbiased by requiring manual intervention and bias mitigation checks when sensitive attributes are involved. This reduces the likelihood of decisions being influenced by discriminatory factors such as race, gender, or age.
