Certainly! Below is a comprehensive DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes all four tasks outlined in your benchmark prompt. This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the steps clearly and efficiently.

**Assumptions:**
- Replace `K` in the `LIMIT` clause with the desired number of top variants you wish to retrieve.

```sql
-- Replace 'K' with the desired number of top variants
WITH
    -- Step 1: Construct the ordered sequence of activities for each case_id
    case_sequences AS (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
    ),

    -- Step 2: Group cases by their activity sequence to identify unique variants and count them
    variant_counts AS (
        SELECT
            variant_sequence,
            COUNT(*) AS case_count
        FROM
            case_sequences
        GROUP BY
            variant_sequence
        ORDER BY
            case_count DESC
        LIMIT
            K  -- Replace K with the number of top variants you want
    ),

    -- Step 3: Identify case_ids that belong to the top K variants
    top_cases AS (
        SELECT
            cs.case_id
        FROM
            case_sequences cs
            INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant_sequence = vc.variant_sequence
    )

-- Step 4: Retrieve all events from the original event_log for the top K variants
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
    INNER JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id
ORDER BY
    el.case_id,
    el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation of Each Step:**

1. **Constructing Activity Sequences (`case_sequences` CTE):**
    - **Purpose:** For each `case_id`, concatenate the `activity` names in the order of their `timestamp` to form a unique activity sequence (`variant_sequence`).
    - **Function Used:** `STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp)` concatenates activities separated by '->' maintaining chronological order.

2. **Identifying and Counting Unique Variants (`variant_counts` CTE):**
    - **Purpose:** Group the cases by their `variant_sequence` to identify unique process variants and count how many cases belong to each variant.
    - **Ordering and Limiting:** The variants are ordered by `case_count` in descending order, and only the top `K` variants are retained using the `LIMIT` clause.

3. **Selecting Cases Belonging to Top K Variants (`top_cases` CTE):**
    - **Purpose:** Join the `case_sequences` with `variant_counts` to extract `case_id`s that are part of the top `K` most frequent variants.

4. **Retrieving Relevant Events from `event_log`:**
    - **Purpose:** Select all events from the original `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the `top_cases` list, effectively filtering out cases not part of the top `K` variants.
    - **Ordering:** The final result is ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for clarity.

**Usage Notes:**

- **Setting the Value of K:**
    - Replace `K` in the `LIMIT` clause of the `variant_counts` CTE with the desired number of top variants you wish to analyze. For example, to get the top 5 variants, replace `K` with `5`.

- **Example with K = 5:**
    ```sql
    LIMIT
        5
    ```

- **Performance Considerations:**
    - Ensure that the `event_log` table is indexed appropriately, especially on the `case_id` and `timestamp` columns, to optimize the performance of aggregation and join operations.

- **Result Interpretation:**
    - The final `SELECT` statement returns all events (`el.*`) that are part of the top `K` most frequent process variants. Each event retains its original columns (`case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`).

Feel free to adjust the delimiter `'->'` in the `STRING_AGG` function if a different separator is preferred for representing activity sequences.
