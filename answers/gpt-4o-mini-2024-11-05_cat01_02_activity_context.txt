### Justification for Renaming

1. **Verify Documents**:
   - This activity occurs multiple times with different contexts across different cases.
   - **C001, C002, and C003**: Initially, the "Verify Documents" activity involves a first-time verification of documents. After receiving additional documents or clarifications, it takes on a different meaningâ€”either final verification or re-checking based on corrections.
   - Renamed as:
     - **Verify Documents (Initial)**: The first verification step of submitted documents.
     - **Verify Documents (Final)**: When the verification is completed after receiving missing documents.
     - **Verify Documents (Recheck)**: A re-checking of documents after an internal adjustment is made.

2. **Call Customer**:
   - The term "Call Customer" appears multiple times with distinct purposes:
     - **C001**: It refers to a call initiated by an agent to ask the customer to submit missing documents.
     - **C002**: The call is to clarify an account discrepancy.
     - **C003**: The call is to request the customer to return to the branch after stepping out.
   - Renamed as:
     - **Request Missing Documents**: To clarify that this is a call to ask for missing documents.
     - **Clarify Account Discrepancy**: To indicate that the call aims to clarify a discrepancy with the customer's account.
     - **Request Customer to Return**: To specify that the call is a request for the customer to return to the branch after stepping out.

3. **Adjust Account**:
   - The term "Adjust Account" occurs twice but refers to different types of adjustments:
     - **C002**: Refers to adjusting account details after a customer service call.
     - **C003**: Refers to an internal correction due to missing information, requiring an update.
   - Renamed as:
     - **Adjust Account Details**: To reflect the internal adjustment after the clarification in C002.
     - **Adjust Account (Internal)**: To specify an internal correction after verifying documents or missing information in C003.

4. **Approve Request**:
   - This activity is straightforward and occurs at the end of each case, signifying the final approval of the request.
   - No change was necessary for the activity name.

The revised names better clarify the specific actions taken at each step, reflecting the different contexts in which the same activity name appeared.
