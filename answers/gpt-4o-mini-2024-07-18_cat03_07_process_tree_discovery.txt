Here is a structured process tree representation based on the given event log, capturing the sequential flow of activities, with a loop for handling missing information and re-validation:

```
-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)', 
   * ( 
       -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)', 
           -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', 
               X ( 
                   -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 
                       -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)' ) 
                   ), 
                   -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)' ) 
               )
           )
       ),
       -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
           -> ( 'Archive Case (AC)' )
       )
   )
)
```

### Explanation of the structure:

1. **Receive Application (RA)**: The process begins with receiving an application.
   
2. **Loop for Validation and Eligibility Assessment**: 
   - **Validate Form (VF)** is done next.
   - Then, **Assess Eligibility (AE)** follows.
   - A choice is made:
     - If missing info is requested (**Request Missing Info (RMI)**), it leads to **Validate Form (VF)** again to re-check the details.
     - Alternatively, it can lead to **Approval Decision (AD)**.

3. **Post Approval Actions**: 
   - After the approval, the process continues to **Send Confirmation (SC)**.
   - Finally, the case is archived with **Archive Case (AC)**.

### Key Features:
- The loop captures the possibility of re-validation after requesting missing information.
- The exclusive choice indicates that after assessing eligibility, either missing information can be requested (and validated again) or the approval can be granted directly.
- The overall flow maintains a clear path leading to the finalization of the case, ensuring fitness to the event log observations while balancing precision and simplicity.
