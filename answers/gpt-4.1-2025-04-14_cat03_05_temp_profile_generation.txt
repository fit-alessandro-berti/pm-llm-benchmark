Certainly! Here is a **representative temporal profile** for the described global supply chain process.  
For realism, average times (`average_time`, in seconds) and their standard deviations (`standard_deviation`, in seconds) are estimated based on plausible durations and variabilities typical of such operations. The pairs include both directly consecutive and "eventually following" activity pairs—that is, not only adjacent but also activities separated by multiple steps in the process.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly sequential pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'):  (2 * 3600,      0.5 * 3600),     # Supplier selection to order placement (2h avg, 0.5h std)
    ('OP', 'RC'):  (3 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),  # Order to receiving components (3d avg, 1d std)
    ('RC', 'QI'):  (4 * 3600,      1 * 3600),       # Receive components to inspection (4h avg, 1h std)
    ('QI', 'CA'):  (8 * 3600,      2 * 3600),       # Inspection to assembly (8h avg, 2h std)
    ('CA', 'PT'):  (1 * 24 * 3600, 6 * 3600),       # Assembly to testing (1d avg, 6h std)
    ('PT', 'PK'):  (3 * 3600,      1 * 3600),       # Testing to packaging (3h avg, 1h std)
    ('PK', 'WS'):  (2 * 3600,      0.5 * 3600),     # Packaging to warehouse (2h avg, 0.5h std)
    ('WS', 'DT'):  (2 * 24 * 3600, 1 * 24 * 3600),  # Warehouse to distribution (2d avg, 1d std)
    ('DT', 'AS'):  (7 * 24 * 3600, 3 * 24 * 3600),  # Distribution to after-sales support (1w avg, 3d std)

    # Non-adjacent, eventually-follows pairs
    ('SS', 'RC'):  (3 * 24 * 3600 + 3 * 3600, 1.1 * 24 * 3600),  # Includes order delay + supply + buffer
    ('OP', 'CA'):  (3 * 24 * 3600 + 5 * 3600, 1.3 * 24 * 3600),  # Order to assembly (receive + inspect + prep)
    ('QI', 'PT'):  (1 * 24 * 3600 + 8 * 3600, 0.5 * 24 * 3600),  # Inspection to testing (assembly in between)
    ('RC', 'DT'):  (2 * 24 * 3600 + 12 * 3600, 1.5 * 24 * 3600), # Receive to distribution (through assembly, etc.)
    ('CA', 'DT'):  (3 * 24 * 3600,      1 * 24 * 3600),           # Assembly to distribution (test, pack, warehse)
    ('DT', 'AS'):  (8 * 24 * 3600,      3.5 * 24 * 3600),         # Distribution to after-sales (full process+support)

    # Long-range pairs (start to end)
    ('SS', 'AS'):  (13 * 24 * 3600,     4 * 24 * 3600),           # Full chain: supplier selection to after-sales resp.
    ('OP', 'AS'):  (12 * 24 * 3600,     4 * 24 * 3600),           # Order to after-sales
    ('RC', 'AS'):  (9 * 24 * 3600,      3.5 * 24 * 3600),         # Receive to after-sales

    # Other interesting pairs
    ('PT', 'WS'):  (4 * 3600,           1 * 3600),                # Testing to warehouse storage (packaging gap)
    ('QI', 'PK'):  (1 * 24 * 3600,      4 * 3600),                # Inspection to packaging (via assembly & test)
    ('OP', 'DT'):  (7 * 24 * 3600,      2.5 * 24 * 3600),         # Order to distribution (includes all manuf steps)
}
```

**Notes:**

- **Time calculations:** `3600` = seconds in an hour; `24 * 3600` = seconds in a day.
- **Average and Standard Deviations** are rough approximations for illustration, reflecting possible real-world complexity and variability.
- **Not all possible pairs** are listed (as there are 45 in total for 10 activities), but this dictionary covers a rich cross-section—including direct, one-intermediate, and full-chain distances.

This profile could be used to detect deviations in process execution time between any two activities, as per the logic described in your prompt.
