## Process Mining Analysis of Manufacturing Event Log

After analyzing the sensor patterns in the event log, I've identified six distinct manufacturing activities based on the characteristic patterns in the numerical readings. Here's my analysis:

### Activity Identification and Labeling

#### **Activity 1: Machine Idle/Standby (Events 1-3)**
- **Temperature:** 20-21°C (ambient)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (baseline)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm
- **Energy:** 0.40-0.50 kWh

**Rationale:** These events show the machine in a standby state with minimal energy consumption, no material processing, and all mechanical components at rest. This represents the machine waiting for the next job or preparing to start operations.

#### **Activity 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4-6)**
- **Temperature:** 50-58°C (rising)
- **Pressure:** 1-1.5 bar
- **Vibration:** 30-38 Hz (high)
- **Material Flow:** 5 units/s (consistent)
- **Tool Position:** 5-10 mm (advancing)
- **Energy:** 2.00-3.00 kWh (increasing)

**Rationale:** The combination of rising temperature, high vibration levels, steady material flow, and advancing tool position strongly suggests a cutting operation. The increasing energy consumption and heat generation are typical of metal cutting processes where friction creates heat.

#### **Activity 3: Assembling Parts (Events 7-8)**
- **Temperature:** 40°C (stable)
- **Pressure:** 2 bar (elevated)
- **Vibration:** 10 Hz (moderate)
- **Material Flow:** 2 units/s (reduced)
- **Tool Position:** 15 mm (stable)
- **Energy:** 2.00 kWh (steady)

**Rationale:** The stable, moderate conditions with reduced material flow suggest a more controlled operation like assembly. The elevated pressure could indicate pneumatic or hydraulic systems used for part positioning or pressing components together.

#### **Activity 4: Welding (Event 9)**
- **Temperature:** 80°C (spike)
- **Pressure:** 2 bar
- **Vibration:** 50 Hz (very high)
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
- **Tool Position:** 15 mm
- **Energy:** 5.00 kWh (peak)

**Rationale:** The dramatic temperature spike to 80°C combined with very high vibration and peak energy consumption, but zero material flow, is characteristic of welding. The absence of material flow indicates the process is joining existing pieces rather than processing new material.

#### **Activity 5: Quality Inspection (Events 10-12)**
- **Temperature:** 25-30°C (cooling down)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (baseline)
- **Vibration:** 1-5 Hz (minimal)
- **Material Flow:** 0-1 units/s (minimal)
- **Tool Position:** 20 mm
- **Energy:** 1.00-1.60 kWh (low)

**Rationale:** After the high-intensity welding, the system cools down while maintaining minimal operations. The low vibration and energy consumption with slight material movement suggest inspection activities where the part is being examined or measured, possibly with some minor adjustments or packaging preparation.

#### **Activity 6: Machine Shutdown/Reset (Events 13-15)**
- **Temperature:** 20-21°C (ambient)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm (reset)
- **Energy:** 0.40-0.50 kWh

**Rationale:** The machine returns to its initial idle state, with the tool returning to home position (0 mm). This represents the completion of the manufacturing cycle and reset for the next production run.

### Process Flow Summary

The discovered manufacturing process follows this sequence:

1. **Machine Idle**  
2. **Cutting Metal** (material shaping)  
3. **Assembling Parts** (component joining)  
4. **Welding** (permanent bonding)  
5. **Quality Inspection** (verification)  
6. **Machine Reset**

This represents a complete manufacturing cycle for producing a fabricated metal part, from raw material processing through final inspection.
