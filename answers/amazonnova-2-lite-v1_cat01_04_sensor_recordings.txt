### **Process Mining Analysis & Activity Labeling**

---

## **Overview**

The task involves analyzing a numerical event log from a manufacturing assembly line to **identify and label distinct manufacturing activities**. Using process mining techniques, we’ll group events into **phases** based on sensor patterns and assign intuitive labels such as *Cutting Metal*, *Assembling Parts*, *Welding*, *Quality Inspection*, or *Packaging*.

We’ll analyze changes in the following sensors to infer activities:
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Pressure (bar)**
- **Vibration Level (Hz)**
- **Material Flow (units/s)**
- **Tool Position (mm)**
- **Energy Consumption (kWh)**

## **Step 1: Identify Patterns / Phases**

Let’s examine the event log in segments and identify **distinct phases** based on sensor behavior.

### **Phase 1: Idle / Reset State**
**Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** ~20–21°C (room temperature)
- **Pressure:** 1 bar (baseline)
- **Vibration:** 0 Hz
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s
- **Tool Position:** 0 mm
- **Energy:** ~0.4–0.5 kWh (very low)

**Interpretation:**
- The machine is **idle or resetting**.
- No active operation is occurring.
- This is a **baseline / idle state**.

**Assigned Label:** `Idle / Reset`

---

### **Phase 2: Cutting Metal**
**Events:** 4, 5, 6  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** Rises rapidly from 50°C to 58°C
- **Pressure:** Increases from 1 to 1.5 bar
- **Vibration:** High (30–38 Hz)
- **Material Flow:** Steady at 5 units/s
- **Tool Position:** Increases from 5 mm to 10 mm
- **Energy:** Increases from 2.00 to 3.00 kWh

**Interpretation:**
- **High temperature + high vibration + increasing tool position** strongly suggests a **mechanical cutting operation**.
- The **material flow** is active and consistent, indicating material being fed into the cutter.
- **Rising energy use** indicates active machinery (e.g., cutting torch or blade).

**Assigned Label:** `Cutting Metal`

---

### **Phase 3: Assembling Parts**
**Events:** 7, 8  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** Drops to 40°C (cooling down from cutting)
- **Pressure:** Increased to 2 bar (may indicate clamping or press)
- **Vibration:** Low (10 Hz) – consistent with precise movements
- **Material Flow:** Reduced to 2 units/s – slower feed for assembly
- **Tool Position:** Stabilized at 15 mm – likely a fixed fixture or jig
- **Energy:** Stable at 2.00 kWh – moderate usage

**Interpretation:**
- After cutting, the machine **stabilizes** and performs **assembling**.
- Lower vibration and steady tool position suggest **precision assembly**, such as fitting or aligning parts.
- **Moderate pressure** may indicate clamping.

**Assigned Label:** `Assembling Parts`

---

### **Phase 4: Welding**
**Events:** 9  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** Spikes to 80°C – **very high**
- **Pressure:** Remains at 2 bar – possibly to secure parts
- **Vibration:** Jumps to 50 Hz – **very high**, typical of welding arc or torch
- **Material Flow:** Drops to 0 – no new material being fed
- **Tool Position:** Fixed at 15 mm – torch or weld tool in place
- **Energy:** Peaks at 5.00 kWh – **maximum energy usage**

**Interpretation:**
- **High temperature + high vibration + no material flow** is classic for **welding**.
- The **energy spike** aligns with the high power needed for welding arcs.
- The tool is stationary, indicating a **fixed weld point**.

**Assigned Label:** `Welding`

---

### **Phase 5: Quality Inspection / Packaging Prep**
**Events:** 10  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** Drops to 30°C – cooling down
- **Pressure:** Returns to 1 bar – system pressure normalized
- **Vibration:** Very low (1 Hz) – quiet operation
- **Material Flow:** 0 units/s – no material movement
- **Tool Position:** Still at 15 mm – possibly holding the welded piece
- **Energy:** Drops to 1.00 kWh – low energy use

**Interpretation:**
- The system is **cooling down** and **stabilizing** after welding.
- Low vibration and energy suggest **inspection** or **preparing for next stage**.
- Could also be a **pause before packaging**.

**Assigned Label:** `Quality Inspection / Packaging Prep`

---

### **Phase 6: Packaging**
**Events:** 11, 12  

**Sensor Characteristics:**
- **Temperature:** Stable at ~25°C
- **Pressure:** Back to 1 bar
- **Vibration:** Low but detectable (5 Hz) – movement of packaged items
- **Material Flow:** Resumes at 1 unit/s – slow, controlled flow
- **Tool Position:** Moves to 20 mm – possibly placing item into package
- **Energy:** Moderate increase (1.50  1.60 kWh)

**Interpretation:**
- **Slow material flow + low vibration + tool movement** indicates **packaging**.
- The machine is **preparing the finished product for storage or shipment**.

**Assigned Label:** `Packaging`

## **Step 2: Summary of Labeled Activities**

| Activity Name               | Events         | Key Sensor Indicators                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`Idle / Reset`**         | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | Low temperature (~20°C), zero vibration, zero flow, zero tool position, low energy   |
| **`Cutting Metal`**        | 4, 5, 6        | Rapid temp rise (50–58°C), high vibration (30–38 Hz), high flow (5 units/s), increasing tool position, rising energy |
| **`Assembling Parts`**     | 7, 8           | Moderate temp (40°C), moderate pressure (2 bar), low vibration (10 Hz), reduced flow (2 units/s), fixed tool position |
| **`Welding`**              | 9              | Very high temp (80°C), very high vibration (50 Hz), zero flow, fixed tool position, peak energy (5 kWh) |
| **`Quality Inspection / Packaging Prep`** | 10       | Temp drops (30°C), pressure normalizes (1 bar), very low vibration (1 Hz), zero flow, low energy |
| **`Packaging`**            | 11, 12         | Stable temp (~25°C), low vibration (5 Hz), slow flow (1 unit/s), tool moves to 20 mm, moderate energy |

## **Step 3: Rationale for Labels**

### **`Idle / Reset`**
- The machine shows **no activity**: no material flow, no vibration, tool at 0 mm.
- Used as a **baseline** before and after the cycle.

### **`Cutting Metal`**
- **High vibration + rising temperature + increasing tool position** are signatures of a **mechanical or thermal cutting process** (e.g., plasma cutter, laser cutter, or saw).
- **Material flow is active**, indicating raw material being fed into the cutter.

### **`Assembling Parts`**
- After cutting, the system **stabilizes** with **moderate pressure**, **low vibration**, and **fixed tool position**—indicative of **clamping and assembly**.
- **Reduced material flow** suggests parts are being fitted together.

### **`Welding`**
- **Temperature spikes dramatically**, **vibration peaks**, and **energy consumption is at its highest**.
- **No material flow** and **fixed tool position** indicate a **stationary weld point**, typical of **TIG, MIG, or spot welding**.

### **`Quality Inspection / Packaging Prep`**
- The system **cools down** and **stabilizes** after welding.
- **Low vibration and energy** suggest **inspection** or **preparing for packaging** (e.g., checking weld integrity).

### **`Packaging`**
- **Slow, controlled material flow** and **tool movement** suggest **placing the finished product into a container or pallet**.
- **Low but nonzero vibration** may reflect **conveyor or packaging machinery**.
