Which log is biased?
•	The Group B log (un-protected applicants) shows a favorable bias; the Group A log (protected applicants) shows the corresponding adverse bias.

How the bias manifests
1.	Use of “LocalResident” and “CommunityGroup”
   •	Every Group B case is marked LocalResident = TRUE.  
   •	Two of the three Group B cases also belong to the “Highland Civic Darts Club” CommunityGroup, whereas no Group A case has any CommunityGroup membership.
   •	The combination “LocalResident = TRUE AND CommunityGroup  None” is the only circumstance in which a ScoreAdjustment is applied.

2.	ScoreAdjustment column
   •	Group A: ScoreAdjustment is always 0.  
   •	Group B: Whenever CommunityGroup is present a “+10 (Community Boost)” is added to the applicant’s score.
   •	This adjustment effectively raises the applicant’s “credit-worthiness” without any change in the underlying risk factors reflected in PreliminaryScore.

3.	Consequences for final decisions
   •	Equal preliminary scores, different outcomes  
     –	P001 (Protected, PreliminaryScore = 720) vs. U001 (Un-protected, PreliminaryScore = 720)  
       Both are approved, but U001 enjoys an unwarranted 10-point increase.  
     –	P002 (710) vs. U003 (695)  
       P002 is rejected even though its raw score (710) is higher than U003’s (695). After the +10 “community boost,” U003 reaches 705 and is approved—showing that the boost, not merit, determines the outcome.
   •	Threshold inference  
       From Group A we infer an implicit approval cut-off somewhere above 710 and at or below 720 (710 is rejected, 720 approved). Group B applicants with boosts are allowed to clear or even fall below this threshold and still be approved.

4.	Systematic pattern
   •	Approval rates  
     –	Group A: 2 approved / 3 cases = 67 %  
     –	Group B overall: 2 approved / 3 cases = 67 %  
     –	But within the CommunityGroup subgroup of Group B: 2 approved / 2 cases = 100 %  
       The boost completely offsets a lower underlying score.
   •	Disparate treatment & disparate impact  
       The decision rule explicitly uses attributes correlated with protected status (LocalResident, CommunityGroup) to confer a benefit available only to the un-protected group, creating both differential treatment and an adverse impact on the protected group.

Summary
The process embedded in the Group B log applies an ex-ante favorable adjustment (+10 points) solely to applicants who are local residents and members of a specific community group—conditions that none of the protected applicants satisfy. This artificially inflates their effective credit score and lowers the de-facto approval threshold for them, enabling approvals that equally or better-qualified protected applicants do not receive. Consequently, the system is biased against the protected group and in favor of the un-protected group.
