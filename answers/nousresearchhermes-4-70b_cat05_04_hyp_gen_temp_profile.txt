We are given a temporal profile model that shows average time intervals and standard deviations between activities in an insurance claim handling process. The activities are: R (Receive), A (Assign), E (Evaluate), P (Approve), N (Notify), C (Close).

The model is:
('R', 'A'): (3600, 600)          # 1 hour between Receive and Assign
('R', 'E'): (86400, 28800)       # 1 day between Receive and Evaluate
('R', 'P'): (90000, 3600)        # ~25 hours between Receive and Approve (STDEV only 1 hour)
('A', 'C'): (7200, 3600)         # 2 hours between Assign and Close
('E', 'N'): (300, 60)            # 5 minutes between Evaluate and Notify
('E', 'C'): (3600, 3000)         # 1 hour between Evaluate and Close (STDEV 50 minutes)
('P', 'N'): (604800, 172800)     # 7 days between Approve and Notify
('N', 'C'): (1800, 300)          # 30 minutes between Notify and Close

Anomalies we can identify:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve)**: 
   - Average time is about 25 hours (90000 seconds) with a standard deviation of only 1 hour (3600 seconds). 
   - This suggests a very rigid timeline for approval, which is unusual because the approval typically follows several steps (including evaluation). 
   - It might indicate that the approval is happening without the intermediate steps, or that the steps are being recorded in a non-sequential order, or that there is an automation that approves claims at a fixed time.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify)**:
   - The average time is 7 days (604800 seconds) with a standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds). 
   - This is a very long time for notification after approval and with high variability. It could indicate a backlog in the notification step or resource constraints.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close)**:
   - The average time is only 2 hours (7200 seconds) from Assign to Close. 
   - Typically, after assignment, there should be evaluation and approval before closing. 
   - This suggests that some claims are being closed immediately after assignment without going through the required steps, which is a process deviation.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify)**:
   - Only 5 minutes (300 seconds) on average between evaluation and notification. 
   - This is extremely short and might indicate that the system is automatically sending a notification immediately after evaluation, which might be premature if approval is still pending.

Now, we generate hypotheses for these anomalies:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve) with very low STDEV**:
   - Hypothesis 1: There is an automated system that approves claims exactly 25 hours after receiving, regardless of the evaluation step. This might be a scheduled batch job.
   - Hypothesis 2: The evaluation and approval steps are being recorded at the same time (or within an hour) for most claims, making the time between Receive and Approve appear consistent.
   - Hypothesis 3: The data might be missing intermediate steps (like evaluation) for these claims, so the approval is directly recorded after assignment.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify) with long average and high STDEV**:
   - Hypothesis 1: The notification step is a manual process that is under-resourced, leading to a backlog and variable wait times.
   - Hypothesis 2: There might be a requirement for a cooling-off period before notification, but sometimes it is bypassed, leading to variability.
   - Hypothesis 3: The notification system may have a batch process that runs weekly, causing a fixed wait of about a week but with the possibility of early notification in some cases.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close) being too short**:
   - Hypothesis 1: Adjusters are closing claims without performing the evaluation and approval steps, possibly because the claims are deemed invalid or fraudulent at assignment.
   - Hypothesis 2: The system might be closing claims automatically when an assigner marks them as "no action required" without going through the full process.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short**:
   - Hypothesis 1: The evaluation step is incorrectly recorded before the approval step, so the notification is sent immediately after what is recorded as evaluation, but actually the approval happens after evaluation and then notification quickly.
   - Hypothesis 2: The notification is automated to be sent as soon as the evaluation is done, but the approval might be happening after, which is out of order.

Now, we propose verification approaches using SQL queries on the `claim_events` table. We assume that the `claim_events` table has the following columns: `event_id`, `claim_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource`, and `additional_info`.

We will focus on writing queries that:
- Identify claims with negative anomalies (i.e., time intervals that are too short or too long).
- Try to correlate these anomalies with adjusters, claim types, or resources.

### Verification Queries

1. **For R to P (Receive to Approve) anomaly**:
   We want to find claims where the time between 'R' and 'P' is between 24 and 25 hours (to see if it's rigidly fixed). Also, we can check if there are claims where 'P' occurs before 'E' (evaluation) or immediately after assignment without evaluation.

   ```sql
   -- Find claims where the approval (P) happens too quickly after receive (within 25 hours) and without an evaluation step in between?
   WITH claim_events_time AS (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS r_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('R', 'A', 'E', 'P')
     GROUP BY claim_id
   )
   SELECT 
     claim_id,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) AS rp_seconds,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a_time - r_time)) AS ra_seconds,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - a_time)) AS ap_seconds,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - e_time)) AS ep_seconds  -- This will be NULL if no evaluation event
   FROM claim_events_time
   WHERE p_time IS NOT NULL AND r_time IS NOT NULL
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) BETWEEN 86400 - 3600 AND 86400 + 3600;  -- Between 23 and 25 hours
   ```

   We can also check for claims that have an approval without an evaluation event:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     c.claim_id,
     CE.count_eval,
     CE.count_approve
   FROM claims c
   JOIN (
     SELECT claim_id, 
            SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_eval,
            SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_approve
     FROM claim_events
     GROUP BY claim_id
   ) CE ON c.claim_id = CE.claim_id
   WHERE CE.count_approve > 0 AND CE.count_eval = 0;
   ```

2. **For P to N (Approve to Notify) anomaly**:
   We look for claims where the time between 'P' and 'N' is longer than 7 days (or also very short, which might indicate automation).

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     claim_id,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) AS pn_seconds
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
     GROUP BY claim_id
   ) t
   WHERE pn_seconds > 604800;  -- 7 days in seconds
   ```

   We can also group by region or adjuster to see if the delay is associated with specific resources:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     a.region,
     a.adjuster_id,
     COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time))) AS avg_pn_seconds,
     PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time))) AS median_pn_seconds
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       ce_p.timestamp AS p_time,
       ce_n.timestamp AS n_time,
       a.adjuster_id,
       a.region
     FROM claims c
     JOIN claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
     JOIN claim_events ce_n ON c.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.activity = 'N' AND ce_n.timestamp > ce_p.timestamp
     JOIN adjusters a ON c.customer_id = a.customer_id  -- Note: This is not correct. We need to link adjuster to claim via events? 
     -- But note: adjusters table has adjuster_id and the claim_events has resource (which might be adjuster_id) but not clear.
   ) t
   GROUP BY a.region, a.adjuster_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;  -- Only consider adjusters with at least 10 claims
   ```

   However, note that the `adjusters` table is linked to claims via the `claim_events` only through the `resource` field (if the resource is the adjuster) but the `claims` table does not have an adjuster_id. We might need to join via the `claim_events` for the assignment event to get the adjuster.

   Alternatively, we can do:

   ```sql
   WITH assign_events AS (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       resource AS adjuster_id,
       timestamp AS a_time
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity = 'A'
   )
   SELECT 
     a.adjuster_id,
     a.name,
     COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time))) AS avg_delay
   FROM (
     SELECT 
       c.claim_id,
       ce_p.timestamp AS p_time,
       ce_n.timestamp AS n_time,
       ae.adjuster_id
     FROM claims c
     JOIN claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
     JOIN claim_events ce_n ON c.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.activity = 'N' AND ce_n.timestamp > ce_p.timestamp
     JOIN assign_events ae ON c.claim_id = ae.claim_id
   ) t
   JOIN adjusters a ON t.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
   GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;
   ```

3. **For A to C (Assign to Close) being too short**:
   We look for claims where the time between 'A' and 'C' is less than, say, 1 hour (or even immediately) and without the required steps (E, P) in between.

   ```sql
   WITH claim_lifecycle AS (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS a_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS c_time,
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,
       MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS p_time
     FROM claim_events
     GROUP BY claim_id
   )
   SELECT 
     claim_id,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_time - a_time)) AS ac_seconds,
     e_time IS NOT NULL AS has_e,
     p_time IS NOT NULL AS has_p
   FROM claim_lifecycle
   WHERE c_time IS NOT NULL AND a_time IS NOT NULL
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_time - a_time)) < 7200;  -- Less than 2 hours
   ```

   We can also check if these claims have a specific claim type or region:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     c.claim_type,
     COUNT(*) AS count_short,
     AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (lc.c_time - lc.a_time))) AS avg_short
   FROM claim_lifecycle lc
   JOIN claims c ON lc.claim_id = c.claim_id
   WHERE lc.c_time IS NOT NULL AND lc.a_time IS NOT NULL
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (lc.c_time - lc.a_time)) < 7200
   GROUP BY c.claim_type;
   ```

4. **For E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short**:
   We look for claims where the time between 'E' and 'N' is less than 10 minutes (300 seconds) and check if there is an approval (P) that occurs after E but before N? If approval happens after, then it might be that the notification is premature.

   ```sql
   WITH e_n_events AS (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS e_time,
       MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS n_time
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity IN ('E', 'N')
     GROUP BY claim_id
   ),
   approval_events AS (
     SELECT 
       claim_id,
       MIN(timestamp) AS p_time
     FROM claim_events
     WHERE activity = 'P'
     GROUP BY claim_id
   )
   SELECT 
     e_n.claim_id,
     EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.n_time - e_n.e_time)) AS en_seconds,
     ae.p_time IS NOT NULL AND ae.p_time > e_n.e_time AND ae.p_time < e_n.n_time AS has_approval_after_e_before_n
   FROM e_n_events e_n
   LEFT JOIN approval_events ae ON e_n.claim_id = ae.claim_id
   WHERE e_n.n_time IS NOT NULL AND e_n.e_time IS NOT NULL
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e_n.n_time - e_n.e_time)) < 600;  -- Less than 10 minutes
   ```

   This query will show claims where evaluate and notify are very close and whether there was an approval in between (which would indicate that the approval was done after evaluation but before notification, so it's not premature). If `has_approval_after_e_before_n` is false, then the notification might have been sent before approval.

   We can also check the resource that is doing the evaluation and the notification to see if it's the same resource or if there's a pattern.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
     ce_e.resource AS eval_resource,
     ce_n.resource AS notify_resource,
     COUNT(*) AS count
   FROM claim_events ce_e
   JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_e.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.timestamp > ce_e.timestamp
     AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
     AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
     AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_e.timestamp)) < 600  -- 10 minutes
   GROUP BY ce_e.resource, ce_n.resource;
   ```

These queries should help in verifying the anomalies and understanding the underlying causes.

### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve) Anomaly**  
   - **Observation**: Average time is 25 hours (90,000 seconds) with an extremely low standard deviation (1 hour).  
   - **Issue**: The process from *Receive* to *Approve* is highly rigid, deviating from typical fluid workflows. Approvals usually involve intermediate steps (e.g., evaluation), but the low variance suggests automated/enforced timing, bypassing normal business rules.

2. **A to C (Assign to Close) Anomaly**  
   - **Observation**: Average time is 2 hours (7,200 seconds).  
   - **Issue**: Claims are closed *immediately* after assignment, skipping critical steps like *Evaluate* and *Approve*. This implies premature closure or undocumented shortcuts.

3. **P to N (Approve to Notify) Anomaly**  
   - **Observation**: Average time is 7 days (604,800 seconds) with high standard deviation (2 days).  
   - **Issue**: Excessive delays between approval and customer notification, indicating bottlenecks (e.g., resource shortages) or inconsistent processes like manual backlog handling.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) Anomaly**  
   - **Observation**: Average time is 5 minutes (300 seconds).  
   - **Issue**: Notification occurs *immediately* after evaluation, likely violating business rules requiring approval (*P*) before notification (*N*). This suggests automation errors or skipped steps.

---

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve) Rigid Timing**  
   - **Hypothesis 1**: Automated batch approvals at fixed intervals (e.g., nightly jobs) override manual evaluation.  
   - **Hypothesis 2**: "Ghost" evaluation steps (not recorded) occur simultaneously with approval, masking the true process.  

2. **A to C (Assign to Close) Premature Closure**  
   - **Hypothesis**: Adjusters are closing duplicate/fraudulent claims at assignment without formal evaluation, violating audit trails.  

3. **P to N (Approve to Notify) Delays**  
   - **Hypothesis 1**: Notifications are manually batched weekly, causing sporadic delays.  
   - **Hypothesis 2**: System-level backlogs exist in the notification interface, exacerbated by low resource allocation.  

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify) Skipping Approval**  
   - **Hypothesis**: Notifications auto-trigger upon evaluation completion, bypassing approval due to workflow engine misconfiguration.

### SQL Verification Queries

#### 1. Validate R to P Rigid Timing
```sql
-- Find claims where approval occurred 26 hours after receipt (tight window)
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS rp_duration_sec
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events r 
  ON c.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = 'R'
JOIN claim_events p 
  ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) BETWEEN 86400 - 3600 AND 86400 + 3600;  -- 23-25 hours
```

#### 2. Identify Premature A to C Closures
```sql
-- Claims closed 2 hours after assignment (missing E/P steps)
WITH claim_steps AS (
  SELECT
    claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time,
    BOOL_OR(activity = 'E') AS has_evaluate,
    BOOL_OR(activity = 'P') AS has_approve
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) AS ac_duration_sec,
  c.claim_type
FROM claim_steps cs
JOIN claims c ON cs.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE cs.close_time IS NOT NULL 
  AND cs.assign_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (cs.close_time - cs.assign_time)) <= 7200  -- 2 hours
  AND NOT cs.has_evaluate AND NOT cs.has_approve;  -- Missing E/P steps
```

#### 3. Analyze P to N Notification Delays
```sql
-- Claims with approval-to-notification delays >7 days
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  c.claim_type,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS pn_duration_sec,
  a.region
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events p 
  ON c.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P'
JOIN claim_events n 
  ON c.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN adjusters a 
  ON p.resource = a.adjuster_id  -- Map resource to adjuster
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800;  -- 7 days
```

#### 4. Investigate E to N Skipping Approval
```sql
-- Claims where notify occurs 10 minutes after evaluate (bypassing P)
SELECT 
  c.claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS en_duration_sec,
  p.activity IS NOT NULL AS has_approval_before_notify
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n 
  ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id 
  AND n.timestamp > e.timestamp
  AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) <= 600  -- 10 minutes
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN claim_events p 
  ON e.claim_id = p.claim_id 
  AND p.activity = 'P' 
  AND p.timestamp BETWEEN e.timestamp AND n.timestamp;  -- Approval in between?
```

#### 5. Correlate Anomalies with Adjusters/Regions
```sql
-- Adjusters with frequent premature A to C closures
WITH premature_claims AS (
  SELECT 
    claim_id,
    resource AS adjuster_id
  FROM claim_events
  WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
  GROUP BY claim_id, resource
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) <= INTERVAL '2 hours'
)
SELECT 
  a.adjuster_id,
  a.name,
  a.region,
  COUNT(pc.claim_id) AS premature_count
FROM premature_claims pc
JOIN adjusters a ON pc.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.region
ORDER BY premature_count DESC;
```

#### 6. Identify Suspicious Claim Types
```sql
-- High rates of anomalies per claim type
SELECT 
  c.claim_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_p.timestamp - ce_r.timestamp)) BETWEEN 86400-3600 AND 86400+3600 THEN ce_r.claim_id 
  END) AS rigid_approvals,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE 
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) <= 7200 
      AND ce_e.claim_id IS NULL AND ce_p_step.claim_id IS NULL 
      THEN ce_a.claim_id 
  END) AS premature_closures
FROM claims c
-- Cross-join all relevant events (simplified; use subqueries in practice)
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_r ON c.claim_id = ce_r.claim_id AND ce_r.activity = 'R'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_a ON c.claim_id = ce_a.claim_id AND ce_a.activity = 'A'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_c ON c.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce_e ON c.claim_id = ce_e.claim_id AND ce_e.activity = 'E'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
ORDER BY rigid_approvals + premature_closures DESC;
```

### Key Insights from Queries
- **R to P Rigidity**: Claims in automated workflows (e.g., auto-approvals) or specific claim types (e.g., "auto_insurance") may show this pattern.  
- **A to C Premature Closures**: Correlate with high-volume adjusters or fraud-prone claims (e.g., "low amount" claims).  
- **P to N Delays**: Check if delays cluster by region (e.g., under-staffed regions) or adjuster workloads.  
- **E to N Skipping Approval**: Verify if specific resources/claim types trigger flawed automation (e.g., "home_insurance" evaluations).  

These queries reveal systemic issues like automation errors, resource misallocation, or non-compliance, enabling targeted process improvements.
