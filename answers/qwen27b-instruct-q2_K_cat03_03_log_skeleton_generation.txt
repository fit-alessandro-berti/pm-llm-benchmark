Certainly! Let's assume we're modeling the purchase-to-pay process for accounting purposes in a business setting. We'll create a simplified process that involves different stages such as ordering goods/services, receiving invoices, payment processing and confirmation receipt.

```python
from collections import Counter

# A Python dictionary representing Log Skeleton model constraints
log_skeleton_model = {
    'equivalence': {
        ('order_to_order', 'invoice_received'), 
        ('invoice_received', 'payment_processed'),
    },
    'always_before': {
        ('place_order', 'order_to_order'),
        ('receive_invoice', 'invoice_received'),
        ('process_payment', 'payment_processed')
    },
    'always_after': {
        ('cancel_order', 'order_to_order'),  
        ('confirm_invoice', 'invoice_received'),
        ('post_voucher', 'payment_processed'),  
    },
    'never_together': {
        ('place_order', 'receive_invoice'),
        ('process_payment', 'confirm_invoice')
    },  
    'activ_freq': {
        'order_to_order': {0},
        'invoice_received': {1},  
        'payment_processed': {1},
        'confirm_invoice': {1},
        'cancel_order': {0},
        'receive_invoice': {1},
        'post_voucher': {1},
    }
}

# Explanation of the Log Skeleton dictionary content:
# 'equivalence' section says that one occurrence of activity pairs ('order_to_order', 'invoice_received') 
# must always co-exist together inside cases.
#
# 'always_before' section states that the first activities listed must always occur before second ones listed. 
#
# 'always_after' section states that the first activities listed must always occur after second ones listed internally within cases.
#
# 'never_together' section indicates pairs of activities where one cannot exist inside a case alongside with the other one simultaneously.
#
# 'activ_freq' section dictates frequency (number of times activities are allowed to occur) for each activity involved in the process.

This Log Skeleton model outlines constraints that ensure consistency between related activities throughout various stages during purchase-to-pay process execution scenarios:

For example:
- 'equivalence': If an order is placed ('order_to_order'), then receipt of corresponding invoice must necessarily follow ('invoice_received').
  
- 'always_before': The action to place orders must precede the processing of invoices.
   
This model serves as foundational reference for further development stages considering the intricacies involved with purchasing processes from a firm's internal operations perspective.
