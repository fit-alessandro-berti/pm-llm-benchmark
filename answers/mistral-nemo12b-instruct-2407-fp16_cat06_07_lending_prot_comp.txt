Based on the provided process variants and their frequencies, here are the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group (Group 1) and the 'unprotected' group (Group 2):

1. **Additional Steps for Group 1:**
   - Group 1 has several process variants that involve additional steps not seen in Group 2, such as:
     - Making multiple visits to assess collateral: This step is present in many Group 1 variants but only appears a few times in Group 2.
     - Requesting a co-signer on the loan: This step is more frequent in Group 1 than Group 2.
   - These additional steps could indicate that Group 1 applicants are considered higher risk and thus require more scrutiny.

2. **Loan Denial Rates:**
   - Group 1 has a higher overall loan denial rate compared to Group 2. In Group 1, out of the total 3,056 process variants, 2,497 resulted in loan denial (81.7%). In contrast, Group 2 had 2,835 process variants with only 1,265 resulting in loan denial (44.6%).
   - This significant difference suggests that Group 1 applicants are more likely to have their loans denied.

3. **Process Complexity:**
   - Group 1 has a wider variety of process variants, indicating more complex and varied processes compared to Group 2.
   - For example, the longest process variant in Group 1 involves nine steps (Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Make Visit to Assess Collateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied), while the longest in Group 2 involves seven steps.

4. **Performance Time:**
   - The performance time for Group 1 is generally higher than that of Group 2, indicating longer processing times for Group 1 applicants.
   - This could suggest that Group 1 applicants are subject to more thorough or time-consuming evaluations.

5. **Appointment Denial:**
   - Group 2 has a higher frequency of 'Appointment Denied' (363 instances) compared to Group 1 (599 instances). This could indicate that Group 2 applicants face more barriers at the initial stages of the process.

These differences suggest that Group 1 (the protected group) is subject to more rigorous and time-consuming processes, potentially due to being considered higher risk. However, this also raises questions about fairness and potential biases in the lending process. It's essential to consider these factors when evaluating the treatment of both groups.
