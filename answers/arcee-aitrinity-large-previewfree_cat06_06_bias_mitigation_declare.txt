**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence - `FinalDecision_Sensitive` with `ManualReview`:** Ensures that any final decision involving a sensitive applicant is always paired with a manual review, preventing automated, potentially biased decisions from standing alone.

2. **Response Constraints from Sensitive Attribute Checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`:** Forces the process to perform a bias mitigation check immediately after any sensitive attribute is observed, ensuring that the decision-making process pauses to evaluate fairness before proceeding.

3. **Succession Constraints Preventing Direct Sensitive Attribute to Rejection:** Blocks immediate transitions from sensitive attribute checks directly to a rejection decision, requiring an intervening bias check or additional review to reduce the risk of discriminatory outcomes.

Together, these constraints enforce that sensitive attributes trigger additional scrutiny and oversight before any potentially biased decision is finalized, thereby reducing the risk of discriminatory outcomes in the loan application process.
