# Process Mining Analysis: Manufacturing Event Log

## Step 1: Raw Pattern Identification

Before assigning labels, I first scan for natural "breaks" in the sensor data where multiple readings shift simultaneously — these inflection points signal activity transitions.

```
Events  1– 3   All readings flat at baseline
Events  4– 6   Sudden multi-sensor spike (temp, vibration, flow, energy)
Events  7– 8   Partial cooldown; readings stabilize at intermediate level
Event       9   Sharp single-event spike to extreme values; flow drops to zero
Events 10–12   Rapid decay; low-level residual activity
Events 13–15   Full return to baseline (tool resets to 0 mm)
```

## Step 2: Detailed Phase-by-Phase Analysis

###  Phase 1 — **Idle / Machine Startup** (Events 1–3)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 20–21 °C | Ambient room temperature — no heat being generated |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Atmospheric baseline — no active force applied |
| Vibration | 0 Hz | No mechanical motion whatsoever |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s | Nothing moving through the system |
| Tool Position | 0 mm | Tool is at the home/rest position |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh | Standby power draw only (control systems on) |

**Label: `IDLE / MACHINE STARTUP`**

> **Rationale:** Every sensor is at its absolute minimum or ambient baseline. The tool is parked at position 0 mm and there is zero material flow or vibration. This is the characteristic "ready state" of a machine waiting to begin a job cycle. The tiny energy draw (~0.45 kWh) reflects only the controller and sensors being powered on.

###  Phase 2 — **Cutting Metal** (Events 4–6)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 50  55  58 °C | Rapid, *progressive* rise from friction/heat generation |
| Pressure | 1  1.5 bar | Slight increase as tool presses into material |
| Vibration | 30  35  38 Hz | High and *rising* — consistent with blade/tool engaging workpiece |
| Material Flow | 5 units/s | Active, steady feed of raw material into the cutting zone |
| Tool Position | 5  7  10 mm | Tool is **actively advancing** through material |
| Energy | 2.00  2.50  3.00 kWh | Rapidly increasing as cut deepens |

**Label: `CUTTING METAL`**

> **Rationale:** The simultaneous, progressive rise across *all* sensors is the telltale signature of a cutting operation. High vibration (30–38 Hz) is physically caused by the blade/tool oscillating against metal resistance. The steadily advancing tool position (5  10 mm) confirms the cutter is moving through the workpiece. Continuous material flow (5 units/s) shows raw stock being fed in. The monotonically increasing energy draw reflects the growing mechanical load as the cut deepens. Temperature rises from friction but stays moderate because the cut is relatively brief.

###  Phase 3 — **Assembling Parts** (Events 7–8)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 40 °C | *Dropped* from cutting peak — residual warmth, no new heat source |
| Pressure | 2 bar | **Elevated and held steady** — a clamping/pressing force is being applied |
| Vibration | 10 Hz | Moderate, *stable* low-frequency vibration (e.g., press or fixture actuation) |
| Material Flow | 2 units/s | Reduced, controlled flow — parts/fasteners being placed |
| Tool Position | 15 mm | Tool has **stopped advancing** — held at a fixed position |
| Energy | 2.00 kWh | Stable moderate draw — sustained work without escalation |

**Label: `ASSEMBLING PARTS`**

> **Rationale:** The key differentiators here are *stability* and *elevated pressure*. Unlike cutting (where all values were rising), both events show identical, locked-in readings — classic for a machine holding parts in a fixture or pressing components together. The elevated pressure (2 bar) without a corresponding spike in temperature suggests a mechanical force/clamping action rather than thermal processing. Moderate, *constant* vibration (10 Hz) is consistent with a press or pneumatic actuator cycling. Material flow dropping to 2 units/s suggests sub-components (e.g., fasteners, brackets) are being fed and placed, not raw stock being cut.

###  Phase 4 — **Welding** (Event 9)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | **80 °C** | **Highest temperature** in the entire log — intense, localized heat |
| Pressure | 2 bar | Maintained — parts held firmly in place for the weld |
| Vibration | **50 Hz** | **Peak vibration** — welding arc/torch creates high-frequency oscillation |
| Material Flow | **0 units/s** | **Zero flow** — no material being fed; weld is fusing existing parts |
| Tool Position | 15 mm | **Stationary** — torch/electrode held fixed at the joint |
| Energy | **5.00 kWh** | **Peak energy in entire log** — welding arcs are extremely power-intensive |

**Label: `WELDING`**

> **Rationale:** This single event stands out dramatically as the most energy- and heat-intensive moment in the log. The combination of maximum temperature (80 °C), maximum energy (5.00 kWh), maximum vibration (50 Hz), and **zero material flow** is the definitive signature of a welding operation. The zero flow is critical — it means no new material is entering; instead, existing parts are being fused by intense, localized thermal energy. The tool stays fixed (15 mm), consistent with a welding torch dwelling at a single joint. The pressure remaining at 2 bar confirms parts are clamped together — a necessary precondition for a good weld.

###  Phase 5 — **Quality Inspection** (Events 10–12)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 30  25  25 °C | Rapidly cooling — welding heat dissipating; no new thermal input |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Released back to atmospheric — clamps have opened |
| Vibration | 1  5  5 Hz | Near-zero, very low activity — gentle probe/sensor movement only |
| Material Flow | 0  1  1 units/s | Minimal, slow flow — finished part being gently conveyed to inspection station |
| Tool Position | 15  20  20 mm | Small, **deliberate advancement** — inspection probe/gauge moving to measurement position |
| Energy | 1.00  1.50  1.60 kWh | Low, slightly increasing — sensors, cameras, or measurement equipment powering up |

**Label: `QUALITY INSPECTION`**

> **Rationale:** After the intense welding event, all values fall sharply, but not all the way to zero — distinguishing this from idle. The defining clues are: (1) the tool advances a small, precise amount (15  20 mm) suggesting a probe or gauge being positioned on the finished part; (2) minimal material flow (1 unit/s) consistent with the part being slowly moved under a sensor or scanner; (3) low but *slightly rising* energy (1.0  1.6 kWh) consistent with optical, dimensional, or ultrasonic inspection equipment activating; and (4) near-zero vibration, which is essential for accurate measurement. The combination of post-process cooling, careful tool positioning, and low-level electrical activity strongly indicates a non-destructive inspection step.

###  Phase 6 — **Idle / Cycle Complete** (Events 13–15)

| Sensor | Value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Temperature | 20–21 °C | Back to ambient — full cooldown complete |
| Pressure | 1 bar | Atmospheric baseline restored |
| Vibration | 0 Hz | Zero — complete mechanical standstill |
| Material Flow | 0 units/s | No material in the system |
| Tool Position | **0 mm** | **Tool has RETURNED to home position** — cycle reset |
| Energy | 0.40–0.50 kWh | Identical standby draw to Phase 1 |

**Label: `IDLE / CYCLE COMPLETE`**

> **Rationale:** All readings are essentially identical to Phase 1, confirming the machine has returned to its standby state after completing one full production cycle. Crucially, the tool position resets to **0 mm** (from 20 mm in inspection), confirming an automated home-return sequence has completed. The machine is ready to begin the next part's production cycle.

## Step 4: Cross-Sensor Decision Logic Summary

The table below shows which sensor combinations were most diagnostic for each activity:

| Activity | Temp | Pressure | Vibration | Flow | Tool Move | Energy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idle |  Low |  Low |  Zero |  Zero |  Stationary |  Min |
| Cutting |  Rising |  Moderate |  High+Rising |  High |  Advancing |  Rising |
| Assembling |  Moderate |  **Elevated** |  Moderate |  Low+Steady |  Fixed |  Stable |
| Welding |  **Peak** |  Elevated |  **Peak** |  **Zero** |  Fixed |  **Peak** |
| Inspection |  Cooling |  Low |  Near-zero |  Minimal |  Small advance |  Low |

> **Key Insight:** No single sensor alone identifies an activity — it is the *combination and trajectory* of multiple sensors that uniquely fingerprints each process step. Welding, for instance, could be confused with cutting on temperature alone, but the **zero material flow** and **peak energy** together make it unambiguous.
