**Designing a standardized process sequence**

I’m analyzing the current process tree’s flaws—mainly how concurrency allows paying invoices before goods receipt—which underfits the domain logic. To fix this, I plan to propose a straightforward sequential model following the typical procure-to-pay flow, ensuring receive_goods and receive_invoice happen before matching and paying. I’ll explain the issues with the original and provide a clear updated sequence with rationale in bullet points.

**1. Issues with the current model**

- After “Create Purchase Order” the five remaining activities are inside a PARALLEL block.  
- In an AND/parallel block every child may start immediately and may interleave freely.  
- This means “Receive Goods”, “Receive Invoice”, “Match Invoice to PO”, and “Pay Invoice” can all happen in any order (or even simultaneously) and without waiting for the preceding steps to finish.  
- Consequently the model allows behaviors that are not acceptable for a Procure-to-Pay process, such as paying the invoice before receiving the goods or the invoice, or matching the invoice before both required inputs are available.

**2. Corrected process-tree model**

Replace the parallel block with a sequence that reflects the domain-prescribed order of the steps:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Fixed structure: a strict sequence reflecting the normal Procure-to-Pay order
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])
```

**3. Why the corrected tree enforces proper behavior**

- The SEQUENCE operator forces each activity to wait until its predecessor completes.  
- “Receive Goods” and “Receive Invoice” must both occur before “Match Invoice to PO”, ensuring the three-way match is performed with complete information.  
- “Pay Invoice” cannot start until the match is completed, preventing paying for unverified or undelivered goods.  
- “Close Case” only occurs after payment, mirroring the actual completion logic.  

Altogether, this sequence eliminates the inappropriate concurrency and guarantees that only the standard, domain-compliant Procure-to-Pay traces are allowed.
