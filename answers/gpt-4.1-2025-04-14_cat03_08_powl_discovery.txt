Based on the given event log, here is a **POWL model** that captures the full complexity of the described global manufacturing and distribution process:

---

### **Analysis and Model Rationale**

#### **Main Patterns in the Log**
- **Order Received (OR)  Material Sourcing (MS)  Quality Screening (QS)  Assembly/IQC Loop**
    - After QS, assembly (AS) and in-line quality check (IQC) can repeat alternately (example: AS  IQC  AS  IQC ...), possibly multiple times.
- **After Assembly/IQC Loop, Testing (TST) and Re-Testing (RT) may also loop**:
    - TST is done, but if testing fails, RT is performed, then TST again, potentially multiple RT/TST cycles.
- **Labeling (LB) is optional after Packaging (PK).**
- **After PK/(LB), Distribution Planning (DP) and Dispatch (D) happen in strict order.**
- **Some variants skip IQC/RT entirely (see Case 4).**

---

### **POWL Components**

#### **SHORTHAND for Model Assembly:**
- **Activity labels:**
  - OR = 'Order Received'
  - MS = 'Material Sourcing'
  - QS = 'Quality Screening'
  - AS = 'Assembly'
  - IQC = 'In-line Quality Check'
  - TST = 'Testing'
  - RT = 'Re-Testing'
  - PK = 'Packaging'
  - LB = 'Labeling'
  - DP = 'Distribution Planning'
  - D = 'Dispatch'
- **skip** = silent (tau) transition (`SilentTransition()` in code)

---

#### **1. ASSEMBLY–IQC LOOP SUBMODEL**
- **Repeats:** *(AS  IQC)*, then finally AS with *option* to break out after any IQC, as seen in cases 3 and 5.
- **POWL:**
    ```text
    A_IQC_LOOP = * (
        AS,  # A
        IQC  # B: after executing IQC, you can either break out, or go back to another AS
    )
    ```
- **In cases without IQC, only a single AS occurs (i.e., loop executes only once).**

#### **2. TEST/RETEST LOOP SUBMODEL**
- **Repeats:** TST  (RT  TST)* (i.e., after a test, if fail, do re-test, then test again, potentially multiple times)
- **Equivalent POWL:**
    ```text
    TST_LOOP = * (
        TST,         # A: at least one TST happens
        StrictPartialOrder(
            nodes = [RT, TST],
            order = {RT --> TST}
        )
        # B: after TST, if product fails, you do RT then TST again; repeat as many times as needed
    )
    ```

#### **3. PACKAGING & LABELING CHOICE**
- **LB is optional after PK:** (some cases have LB, others skip)
- **Exclusive choice (XOR) between PK  LB and PK only**
- **POWL:**
    ```text
    PK_LB = StrictPartialOrder(
        nodes=[PK, OperatorPOWL(
            operator=XOR,
            children=[LB, skip]
        )],
        order={PK --> OperatorPOWL(...)}
    )
    ```
    *But to fit the semantics, it’s simpler as:*
    ```text
    PK_LB = StrictPartialOrder(
        nodes = [PK, LB],
        order = {PK --> LB}
    )
    # But with an explicit XOR for optional LB:
    PK_and_optional_LB =
      PK -->
        X (
            LB,  # labeling occurs
            skip # labeling skipped
        )
    ```

#### **4. FULL PROCESS: Compose All Submodels**

##### **Steps in Order**
- OR  MS  QS  [Assembly-IQC Loop]  [Test/Retest Loop]  PK ( LB optional)  DP  D

- The control flow for optional skips and loops fits naturally by nesting the submodels above.

### **COMPLETE POWL MODEL (PSEUDOCODE & STRUCTURE)**

Here is the **hierarchical structure** in POWL notations:

```text
root = StrictPartialOrder(
  nodes = [
    OR, MS, QS,
    A_IQC_LOOP,      # * ( AS, IQC )
    TST_LOOP,        # * ( TST, [RT --> TST] )
    PK, PK_LB_X,     # packaging and optional labeling
    DP, D
  ],
  order = {
    OR --> MS,
    MS --> QS,
    QS --> A_IQC_LOOP,
    A_IQC_LOOP --> TST_LOOP,
    TST_LOOP --> PK,
    PK --> PK_LB_X,
    PK_LB_X --> DP,
    DP --> D
  }
)
# where
A_IQC_LOOP = * ( AS, IQC )
TST_LOOP = * ( TST, StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RT, TST], order={RT --> TST}) )
PK_LB_X = X ( LB, skip )
```

### **FORMALIZED POWL (IN PM4PY OBJECT TERMS)**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities (transitions)
OR = Transition(label="OR")    # Order Received
MS = Transition(label="MS")    # Material Sourcing
QS = Transition(label="QS")    # Quality Screening
AS = Transition(label="AS")    # Assembly
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")  # In-line Quality Check
TST = Transition(label="TST")  # Testing
RT = Transition(label="RT")    # Re-Testing
PK = Transition(label="PK")    # Packaging
LB = Transition(label="LB")    # Labeling
DP = Transition(label="DP")    # Distribution Planning
D = Transition(label="D")      # Dispatch
skip = SilentTransition()

# 1. Assembly/IQC Loop
# * (AS, IQC): do AS, then, as long as desired, do IQC and return to AS.
assembly_iqc_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[AS, IQC]
)

# 2. Test/Retest Loop (* (TST, RT --> TST))
test_retest_loop = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.LOOP,
    children=[
        TST,
        StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RT, TST])
    ]
)
test_retest_loop.children[1].order.add_edge(RT, TST)

# 3. Labeling is optional after PK (XOR)
labeling_optional = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[LB, skip]
)

# 4. PACKAGE + (optional) LABELING as strict order (PK --> X(...))
package_and_label = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[PK, labeling_optional]
)
package_and_label.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_optional)

# 5. Final model
root = StrictPartialOrder(
    nodes=[OR, MS, QS, assembly_iqc_loop, test_retest_loop, package_and_label, DP, D]
)
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_iqc_loop)
root.order.add_edge(assembly_iqc_loop, test_retest_loop)
root.order.add_edge(test_retest_loop, package_and_label)
root.order.add_edge(package_and_label, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

## **TEXTUAL POWL SUMMARY**

```text
POWL MODEL:

OR --> MS --> QS -->
    * ( AS, IQC ) -->
        * ( TST, RT --> TST ) -->
            PK -->
                X ( LB, tau ) -->
                    DP --> D

Where:
- * (A, B)  means do A, then as long as you choose, do B then A again (loop semantics)
- X (A, B) means exclusive choice (here, LB is optional after packaging)
- tau is the silent/skip transition
- RT --> TST means RT must precede TST when looping (as in retest/test cycles)
- All dependencies are strict orders (no concurrency in this specific process)
```

---

## **MODEL CAPTURES:**
- Loops in assembly/IQC and test/retest, including zero or multiple repetitions
- Optional LB after PK
- Path variants (cases with or without IQC and LB, varying numbers of repeats, or skipping cycles)
- The model fits all possible traces shown in your log and allows for their observed variability.
