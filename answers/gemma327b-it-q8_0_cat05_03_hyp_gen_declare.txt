## Anomaly Analysis of the DECLARE Model

### Anomalies Identified

1. **Contradiction between `existence` and `noncoexistence`:** The model states that 'C' (Close Claim) *must* exist, yet 'E' (Evaluate Claim) and 'C' cannot coexist. This implies that all claims *must* be closed, but *cannot* be evaluated before closing, which is illogical in a typical claim process.

2. **Weak Precedence Constraint:** The `precedence` constraint stating 'C' requires 'R' is overly simplistic. Closing a claim logically requires *multiple* preceding steps (R, A, E, P, N), not just receiving it. This constraint is insufficient to enforce a proper claim workflow.

3. **Unrealistic `noncoexistence` Constraint:** The constraint prohibiting 'E' and 'C' from coexisting is highly restrictive and likely incorrect. Evaluation often occurs *before* a claim is closed, even if the evaluation leads to a denial or partial approval.

4. **Missing Dependencies:** The model lacks constraints defining dependencies between other crucial activities. For example, there's no constraint stating 'A' (Assign Adjuster) must precede 'E' (Evaluate Claim).



### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **Incremental Model Evolution:** The DECLARE model may have been built incrementally over time, with new constraints added without fully considering their impact on existing rules. This could lead to inconsistencies and contradictions.

2. **Misinterpretation of Business Rules:** The individuals responsible for defining the DECLARE constraints may have misinterpreted the actual business rules governing the claim process. For example, they might have incorrectly assumed that some claims can be closed without evaluation.

3. **Data Quality Issues:** The initial data used to derive the DECLARE constraints might have contained errors or biases, leading to inaccurate rules.

4. **Focus on Completion Metrics:** There might have been a pressure to demonstrate a high rate of claim closure, leading to constraints that prioritize completion over adherence to a proper evaluation process. This could explain the overly strong constraint against evaluation before closing.

5. **Simplified Representation:** The model might be a deliberately simplified representation of the claim process, intended to capture only the most essential steps. However, this simplification may have resulted in the omission of crucial dependencies and the introduction of contradictions.



### Verification Approaches (SQL Queries)

1. **Claims Closed Without Evaluation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM claims c
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
   )
   AND EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
   );
   ```
   This query identifies claims that were closed ('C') without a preceding evaluation ('E').

2. **Coexistence of Evaluation and Closing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM claim_events ce1
   JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
   WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   AND ce1.timestamp < ce2.timestamp;
   ```
   This query checks if evaluation ('E') occurs before closing ('C') for any claim, violating the `noncoexistence` constraint.

3. **Evaluation Without Assigned Adjuster:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM claim_events ce
   WHERE ce.activity = 'E'
   AND NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce2
       WHERE ce2.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'A'
   );
   ```
   This query identifies evaluations ('E') that occurred without a prior assignment ('A') of an adjuster.

4. **Claims Closed Without Full Workflow:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM claims c
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'R'
   )
   OR NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'A'
   )
   OR NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'E'
   )
   OR NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'P'
   )
   OR NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'N'
   )
   AND EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events ce
       WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = 'C'
   );
   ```
   This query identifies claims that were closed ('C') without having gone through the complete expected workflow (R, A, E, P, N).
