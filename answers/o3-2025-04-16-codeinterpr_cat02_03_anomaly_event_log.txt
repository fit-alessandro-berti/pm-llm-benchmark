Below is a short reminder of what a “clean” Procure-to-Pay (P2P) run normally looks like, followed by the anomalies that appear in each case in the log and the practical risks they introduce.

Typical, control-compliant P2P order  
1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR)  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Goods / services delivered  
5. Goods Receipt (GR) recorded  
6. Vendor Invoice received  
7. Three-way match (PO-GR-Invoice)  
8. Release / schedule payment  
9. Close the case  

Key control ideas  
• Nothing may be ordered before the PR is approved.  
• Goods should not be received before a PO exists.  
• Payment may only be released after the three-way match.  
• Invoice should normally arrive before or very shortly after the goods.  
• The sequence prevents fraud, duplicate or wrong payments, and strengthens auditability.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case-by-case analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CASE 1001   – No anomaly  
Sequence is exactly the canonical flow (PR  approval  PO  GR  Invoice  Match  Payment  Close).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1002   – Multiple serious control breaks
1. PO before PR approval  
   • 08:40 PO is issued although the requisition has not been approved (approval occurs two days later on 2024-02-03 08:00).  
   • Violates the basic segregation-of-duties rule: no purchasing commitment may be made before authorization.

2. Invoice and PAYMENT before both approval and goods receipt  
   • 07:00 Invoice received; 07:15 Payment released – both **two days before** the PR is approved and one day before goods are received.  
   • Payment is made without (a) proof that goods were delivered, (b) an approved requisition, or (c) the three-way match.

3. Three-way match executed **after** payment  
   • Matching on 2024-02-05 occurs after the money is already out.  
   • If a discrepancy is discovered, cash has already left the company.

Why it is problematic  
• High risk of purchasing items that were never authorized.  
• Potential duplicate or fraudulent payments (no match, no receipt yet).  
• Violates SOX-style internal-control frameworks; would be flagged immediately in an audit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1003   – “Pre-payment” without supporting controls
1. Payment released before invoice and goods  
   • 2024-02-08 Payment released  
   • 2024-02-09 Invoice arrives  
   • 2024-02-10 Goods received  

2. Three-way match after payment  
   • Same weakness as in Case 1002, though goods and invoice do ultimately arrive.

Interpretation & risks  
• Could be an intentional advance payment, but the log shows no special “Advance Payment Approved” activity or workflow; therefore it looks like a control violation.  
• Exposure to supplier default (cash paid, nothing yet delivered).  
• Weak audit trail—auditor will question basis for paying before legal liability (invoice) even existed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
CASE 1004   – Logistics before commitment (“GR before PO”)
1. Goods received **before** a purchase order is issued  
   • 09:00 GR recorded; 09:15 PO created.  
   • Operationally inverted: receiving dock books the goods without a formal purchasing contract.

Possible explanations & risks  
• Could be an emergency or consignment delivery that was regularized afterwards, but as a rule the PO is the commercial contract reference.  
• Without a PO the receiving clerk cannot verify quantity/price; acceptance might be accidental, leading to excess or wrong goods and later disputes.  
• Auditors treat “Goods before PO” as a red-flag for maverick buying / retroactive paperwork.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of detected anomalies
1. PO before PR approval: Case 1002.  
2. Goods receipt before PO: Case 1004.  
3. Invoice before goods or PO approval: Case 1002.  
4. Payment before three-way match: Cases 1002 and 1003.  
5. Payment before invoice (strictly even before liability exists): Case 1003.  
6. Three-way match executed after payment: Cases 1002 and 1003.

Why this matters  
• Breaches standard internal-control frameworks (SOX, COSO, ISO internal controls).  
• Increases risk of fraud, duplicate payment, supplier disputes, inventory inaccuracies, and misstated liabilities.  
• Will be flagged by any process-mining or audit tool, prompting corrective action (workflow redesign, enforced hard stops, escalation rules, or additional approvals).
