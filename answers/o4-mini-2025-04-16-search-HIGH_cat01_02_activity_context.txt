**1. Recurring Activities and Contextual Variations**  
- **Verify Documents**  
  - First occurrence in each case: an *initial* identity check (agent confirms submitted ID).  
  - Second occurrence (where present): a *re-check* after the customer has supplied missing information or after an internal adjustment.  
- **Call Customer**  
  - Calls occur at different points for distinct purposes:  
    - To request missing documents.  
    - To clarify an account discrepancy.  
    - To confirm that requested adjustments have been made.  
    - To ask a walk-in customer to return to the branch.

**3. Naming Justification**  
- **Initial Document Verification**  
  - Differentiates the *first* check of submitted documents from any subsequent re-checks.  
  - Triggered immediately after “Initiate Request.”  
- **Follow-Up Document Verification**  
  - Marks a *second* verification step, occurring only after additional input (ID scan) or an internal account adjustment.  
- **Call Customer – Missing Documents Request**  
  - Context: “Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs.”  
- **Call Customer – Account Discrepancy Clarification**  
  - Context: “Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.”  
- **Call Customer – Confirm Adjustments**  
  - Context: “Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.”  
- **Call Customer – Return to Branch Request**  
  - Context: “Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return.”  
- **Initiate Walk-In Request**  
  - Clarifies that this request originated from an in-branch walk-in (versus online).  

These revised activity names disambiguate identical labels by embedding the precise purpose and timing gleaned from the additional-context descriptions and process sequence.
