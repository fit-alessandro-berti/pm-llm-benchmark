After analyzing the event log, I've identified several anomalies in cases 1002, 1003, and 1004. Case 1001 follows the standard P2P process flow correctly.

## **Case 1002 - Multiple Critical Process Violations:**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Purchase Order issued without approval** (PO at 08:40, Approval at 08:00 next day)
2. **Payment released before goods receipt** (Payment at 07:15, Goods at 09:00 next day)
3. **Payment released before invoice matching** (Payment at 07:15, Matching at 08:00 two days later)
4. **Purchase Requisition approved AFTER the PO was issued and payment made**

**Why problematic:**
- **Lack of authorization control**: Issuing POs without proper approval bypasses spending controls
- **High fraud risk**: Paying before receiving goods or verifying invoices opens the door to fraudulent payments
- **No verification**: The 3-way match (PO, goods receipt, invoice) is meant to ensure you're paying for what was ordered and received
- **Audit and compliance failure**: This violates basic internal controls and segregation of duties

## **Case 1003 - Premature Payment:**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Payment released before goods receipt** (Payment on Feb 8, Goods on Feb 10)
2. **Payment released before invoice receipt** (Payment on Feb 8, Invoice on Feb 9)
3. **Invoice matching performed after payment** (Payment on Feb 8, Matching on Feb 11)

**Why problematic:**
- **Financial risk**: Paying before receiving goods means you might pay for items never delivered
- **No invoice verification**: Without an invoice, there's no way to verify the payment amount is correct
- **Potential vendor favoritism or collusion**: Such irregular payment timing could indicate inappropriate relationships

## **Case 1004 - Goods Before Purchase Order:**

**Anomalies identified:**
1. **Goods received before Purchase Order issued** (Goods at 09:00, PO at 09:15)

**Why problematic:**
- **Commitment without authorization**: Receiving goods creates a financial obligation before proper approval
- **Maverick buying**: This suggests someone bypassed the procurement process
- **Budget control issues**: Departments might overspend if they can receive goods without POs
- **Legal risks**: Without a PO, contract terms, pricing, and delivery conditions aren't formally established

## **Summary of Risks:**

These anomalies represent serious control weaknesses that could lead to:
- Financial losses through fraud or error
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Budget overruns
- Legal disputes with vendors
- Damaged vendor relationships
- Audit findings and potential penalties

Organizations should implement system controls to prevent such process violations, including mandatory approval workflows, system blocks on payments without proper documentation, and regular process mining to detect anomalies.
