## 1) Normative “Hire-to-Retire” logic (reference)
A typical (simplified) Hire-to-Retire ordering is:

**Post job  Screen candidates  Interview(s)  Make hiring decision  Onboard employee  Add to payroll  Close case**

Commonly:
- *Interviewing is based on screened candidates* (screening precedes interviews).
- *Onboarding and payroll* happen **only after** a positive hiring decision.
- Payroll is normally **not optional** if the case represents an actual hire (unless the model also includes a “reject/no hire” end path).

## 2) Anomalies per model

### POWL Model 1 (Partial order with edges)
**Structure highlights**
- Post  Screen
- Screen  Decide **and** Screen  Interview
- Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
- **No edge between Interview and Decide** (they are only both after Screen)

**Anomalies**
1. **Hiring decision can occur before interviews (severe process-logic anomaly).**  
   Because there is no constraint `Interview  Decide`, the model allows:
   - Post, Screen, **Decide**, Onboard, Payroll, Close, and *only then* Interview (or Interview never constrained to happen before deciding).
   This violates typical hiring logic where the decision is informed by interviews.

2. **Interview becomes “informationally disconnected” from the decision (moderate-to-severe).**  
   Interviews can happen, but the model does not require them to influence the decision timing. In a standard process, interviews are either mandatory before deciding or are part of an explicit alternative path (e.g., “screen-only hire” for internal transfers), which is not modeled here.

3. **No explicit “no-hire” branch (minor, depending on scope).**  
   Model 1 always proceeds to onboarding/payroll/close after Decide, implying every case results in a hire. That can be acceptable if the log/process is defined only for *successful hires*, but it’s a limitation otherwise.

**What Model 1 gets right**
- Payroll precedes Close.
- Onboarding precedes Payroll.
- Core downstream order (Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close) is coherent.

### POWL Model 2 (Partial order + loop + XOR)
**Structure highlights**
- Post  Screen
- Post  Interview (i.e., Interview can start right after posting, in parallel with screening)
- Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close
- `loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)` effectively allows **Onboard at least once, possibly repeated** (because the “redo” part is skip, the loop is somewhat degenerate but still permits repetition semantics depending on the formal interpretation).
- `xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)` makes payroll **optional**.

**Anomalies**
1. **Interviews can occur before screening (moderate anomaly).**  
   Since Interview only depends on Post (not on Screen), the model allows:
   - Post  Interview  Decide while screening is still pending (or at least not required to finish first).  
   This is atypical: screening usually selects interviewees.

2. **Payroll is optional (severe anomaly for a “hire completed” case).**  
   The XOR allows skipping “Add_to_Payroll” and still closing the case. For a successfully hired employee, skipping payroll is usually a serious compliance/operational failure.  
   (It would only make sense if there is an explicit “candidate rejected / offer declined” path—yet the model still forces onboarding before payroll choice, which contradicts that interpretation.)

3. **Onboarding loop is strange / potentially ill-defined (moderate anomaly).**  
   Repeating onboarding can happen in reality (redo steps, corrections), but modeling it as an unconstrained loop without clear rework trigger is suspicious. Also, using `LOOP(Onboard, skip)` makes the “redo” part empty; depending on the exact semantics, this can create odd behavior (e.g., repeated onboarding without intervening work), which is not a realistic rework pattern.

**What Model 2 gets right**
- It *does* enforce **Interview  Decide**, which fixes Model 1’s most fundamental issue.
- Downstream ordering Decide  Onboard  (Payroll?)  Close is mostly coherent.

## 3) Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire process?

**Model 2 is closer to the normative process overall**, primarily because it enforces the critical dependency **Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision**. In hiring, making a decision before interviewing (Model 1 allows this) is a more fundamental violation of the process’s meaning than “interviews too early” (Model 2 allows interviewing before screening).

That said, Model 2 contains a **very serious anomaly**: **making payroll optional** while still closing the case. If the modeled cases are “successful hires,” skipping payroll is a major integrity/compliance break. If the intended scope includes “not hired” outcomes, then the model is still inconsistent because it forces onboarding before the payroll/no-payroll choice.

**Summary judgment**
- **Model 1’s key flaw**: decision can precede interviews  undermines the decision’s basis (core semantic error).
- **Model 2’s key flaws**: interview can precede screening (less fundamental), onboarding loop oddness (modeling issue), and payroll optionality (operational/compliance-critical).

If you interpret “Hire-to-Retire” as *cases that end with an employee hired*, then **Model 2 needs payroll to be mandatory** to be fully normative; but **Model 1 still fails more basically** by permitting a hire decision without (or before) interviews. Hence, **Model 2 is the closer of the two**, though neither is fully correct.
