# Description of the Visualization

This image presents a **proclet-based workflow model** for a medical laboratory process, composed of three parts:

---

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels

### Left Proclet – *Lab Visit*
| Actor | Activity |
|-------|----------|
| Doctor | Order entry |
| Lab assistant | Take blood sample |
| Lab assistant | Receive result  Judge results |
| | Decision: **"Everything fine"**  Send report |
| | Decision: **"Do tests again"**  Receive updated result |

### Right Proclet – *Lab Test*
- Involves a **chemical analyst**
- Flow: Perform test  Make report  **Finish lab test**
- Alternate path: Perform test again  Provide updated report

### Communication Channels
- **Order system** channel (with multiplicities like `[*,1]`, `[1,1]`)
- **HIS** (Hospital Information System) channel (with multiplicities `[1,*]`, `[1,?]`, `[1,2]`)

---

## (b) Class Diagram
Shows a UML relationship:
- **Lab visit** `1..1` *requires* `1..*` **Lab test**
- One visit requires **one or more** lab tests

---

## (c) Example Performative Message
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Time | 11:00 |
| Channel | Order system |
| Sender | Lab visit – John |
| Receiver | Lab test – HGB – John |
| Action | Create |
| Content | *"Can you perform a HGB test for John?"* |
| Scope/Direction | Private / OUT |

---

**Summary:** The diagram models inter-process communication in a hospital workflow using **proclet theory**, showing how lab visits and lab tests coordinate through structured message-passing.
