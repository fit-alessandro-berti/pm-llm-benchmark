To create an event log suitable for process mining from the provided ERP tables, we'll integrate the data to generate a comprehensive table where each row represents an event. This involves identifying cases, deriving activities, mapping timestamps, combining data, and enriching with resources and attributes where possible. Here is the structured event log:

```markdown
| Case ID | Activity Name  | Timestamp                | Resource/Actor | Additional Attributes              |

### Assumptions:
- **Order Dispatched and Arrived**: For `order_id` 1004, no dispatch or arrival details are available, hence these are not recorded.
- **Order Created**: The activity is linked to the sales person through the sales_person_id.
- **Resource/Actor**: Where not specified in business logic, the resource is left empty.
- Data from each table is integrated based on `order_id` to ensure all associated events are captured for each process instance in the order they occur.
