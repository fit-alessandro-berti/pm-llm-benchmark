Below is one example of how you might construct an accepting Petri net for the described insurance claim process. In this design, we create places that mark the progress between the activities and transitions labeled with the activity names. In particular, note that:

- After claim registration (CR) the token is in the “registered” place.
- The Document Verification (DV) transition moves the token to a “dv_done” place. From there the process may take one of two routes:
  - If the documents are incomplete, the Re‑Document Submission (RDS) transition “loops” the token back to the registered state so that DV can be performed again.
  - If the documents are acceptable, the Fraud Check (FC) transition fires to move the token forward.
- In the “fraud_checked” place the token may loop via the In‑depth Investigation (II) transition any number of times before the Claim Assessment (CA) transition fires.
- The process then continues with Approval (AP), Payment (P), Notification (N) and finally Closure (CL).  
- The initial marking places a token in the start place, and the final marking is reached when the claim is “closed.”

Below is the complete Python code using the PM4Py objects:

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create a new Petri net
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# === Define Places ===
# p0: start (a new claim arrives)
p0 = PetriNet.Place("start")
# p1: claim has been registered
p1 = PetriNet.Place("registered")
# p2: document verification has been performed (outcome available)
p2 = PetriNet.Place("dv_done")
# p3: fraud check has been performed (and may loop with investigation)
p3 = PetriNet.Place("fraud_checked")
# p4: claim has been assessed
p4 = PetriNet.Place("assessed")
# p5: claim has been approved (if needed)
p5 = PetriNet.Place("approved")
# p6: claim has been paid
p6 = PetriNet.Place("paid")
# p7: customer has been notified
p7 = PetriNet.Place("notified")
# p8: claim is closed (final state)
p8 = PetriNet.Place("closed")

# Add all places to the net
net.places.add(p0)
net.places.add(p1)
net.places.add(p2)
net.places.add(p3)
net.places.add(p4)
net.places.add(p5)
net.places.add(p6)
net.places.add(p7)
net.places.add(p8)

# === Define Transitions ===
# Transition for Claim Registration (CR)
t_CR = PetriNet.Transition("t_CR", "Claim Registration")
# Transition for Document Verification (DV)
t_DV = PetriNet.Transition("t_DV", "Document Verification")
# Transition for Re-Document Submission (RDS)
t_RDS = PetriNet.Transition("t_RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
# Transition for Fraud Check (FC)
t_FC = PetriNet.Transition("t_FC", "Fraud Check")
# Transition for In-depth Investigation (II)
t_II = PetriNet.Transition("t_II", "In-depth Investigation")
# Transition for Claim Assessment (CA)
t_CA = PetriNet.Transition("t_CA", "Claim Assessment")
# Transition for Approval (AP)
t_AP = PetriNet.Transition("t_AP", "Approval")
# Transition for Payment (P)
t_P = PetriNet.Transition("t_P", "Payment")
# Transition for Notification (N)
t_N = PetriNet.Transition("t_N", "Notification")
# Transition for Closure (CL)
t_CL = PetriNet.Transition("t_CL", "Closure")

# Add all transitions to the net
net.transitions.add(t_CR)
net.transitions.add(t_DV)
net.transitions.add(t_RDS)
net.transitions.add(t_FC)
net.transitions.add(t_II)
net.transitions.add(t_CA)
net.transitions.add(t_AP)
net.transitions.add(t_P)
net.transitions.add(t_N)
net.transitions.add(t_CL)

# === Add Arcs between Places and Transitions ===

# Start with a new claim arriving
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p0, t_CR, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CR, p1, net)

# Document Verification: from a registered claim, perform DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p1, t_DV, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_DV, p2, net)

# At the DV result, two possibilities:
# 1. If the documents are incomplete, perform Re-Document Submission (RDS)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p2, t_RDS, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_RDS, p1, net)
# 2. If documents are acceptable, continue with Fraud Check (FC)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p2, t_FC, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_FC, p3, net)

# At the fraud check state, if doubts arise, perform In-depth Investigation (II) (this may repeat)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p3, t_II, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_II, p3, net)

# Once the fraud check (and any needed investigations) are complete, assess the claim
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p3, t_CA, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CA, p4, net)

# Approval step (e.g., required for high claims)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p4, t_AP, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_AP, p5, net)

# Payment is made after approval
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p5, t_P, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_P, p6, net)

# Notify the customer about the payment and resolution
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p6, t_N, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_N, p7, net)

# Finally, close the claim
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p7, t_CL, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CL, p8, net)

# === Define Initial and Final Markings ===

# The initial marking: a token in the start place
im = Marking()
im[p0] = 1

# The final marking: a token in the closed place
fm = Marking()
fm[p8] = 1

# For verification purposes you might print out some info:
print("Accepting Petri net for the Insurance Claim Process constructed.")
print("Initial marking:", im)
print("Final marking:", fm)
```

### Explanation

1. **Places and Transitions:**  
   Each activity is modeled as a transition, and the places between transitions capture the state of the claim (e.g., *registered*, *dv_done*, *fraud_checked*, etc.).

2. **Loops:**  
   - The **RDS** transition (Re-Document Submission) loops the token from the result of document verification (`p2`) back to the registered state (`p1`), allowing the document verification to be repeated.  
   - The **II** transition (In-depth Investigation) is a self-loop on the fraud-checked place (`p3`), allowing multiple investigations.

3. **Markings:**  
   The **initial marking** places a token in the `start` place (indicating a new claim has arrived) and the **final marking** places a token in the `closed` place (indicating the claim process is complete).

This code builds an accepting Petri net (a Petri net with designated initial and final markings) that models the described insurance claim management process. You can adjust the details (such as adding alternative transitions for bypassing approval if not needed) to suit further nuances of your process.
