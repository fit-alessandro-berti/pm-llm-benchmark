**Answer:**

**Cases that violate the normative process:** 2, 3, and 5.

**Explanation of Violations:**

**Case 1: (No Violation)**  
**Event Sequence:** Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Package Items → Ship Order → Close Order  
**Analysis:** This sequence exactly matches the intended “inventory-sufficient” path described:  
- After receiving and checking inventory, the order proceeds to payment authorization.  
- Once payment is authorized, items are packaged and then shipped, followed by closing the order.  
**Conclusion:** Fully compliant with the normative description.

**Case 2: (Violation)**  
**Event Sequence:** Receive → Check Inventory → Package Items → Authorize Payment → Ship Order → Close Order  
**Normative Expectation (Inventory Sufficient Path):** Receive → Check Inventory → **Authorize Payment** → **Package Items** → Ship Order → Close Order  
**Violation Identified:** “Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment.” According to the normative process, payment must be authorized before any packaging occurs. The sequence here reverses that order, thus violating the rule that payment authorization should precede the preparation of goods for shipment.

**Case 3: (Violation)**  
**Event Sequence:** Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Cancel Order → Ship Order → Close Order  
**Normative Expectations:**  
- If inventory is sufficient: Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Package Items → Ship Order → Close Order.  
- If inventory is not sufficient: Receive → Check Inventory → Cancel Order → Close Order.  

**Violations Identified:**  
1. **Authorize Payment before Cancellation in a Cancel Scenario:** If the inventory check leads to cancellation, there should be no payment authorization step at all. The presence of "Authorize payment" followed by "Cancel order" makes no sense.  
2. **Shipping after Cancellation:** Once an order is canceled, the process must not continue with fulfillment activities like shipping. The correct cancellation path is simply: Receive → Check Inventory → Cancel → Close. The case includes “Ship order” after “Cancel order,” which is explicitly disallowed.

**Case 4: (No Violation)**  
**Event Sequence:** Receive → Check Inventory → Cancel Order → Close Order  
**Normative Expectation (Inventory Insufficient Path):**  
Receive → Check Inventory → Cancel Order → Close Order  
**Conclusion:** This perfectly follows the insufficient-inventory scenario. No violations.

**Case 5: (Violation)**  
**Event Sequence:** Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → Ship Order → Close Order  
**Normative Expectation (Inventory Sufficient Path):**  
Receive → Check Inventory → Authorize Payment → **Package Items** → Ship Order → Close Order  

**Violation Identified:** “Package items” is missing before “Ship order.” The normative sequence requires items to be packaged prior to shipping. Skipping “Package items” and moving directly from “Authorize payment” to “Ship order” violates the established requirement that packaging must precede shipping.

---

**Summary:**  
- **Case 1:** Compliant  
- **Case 2:** Violates order of “Authorize payment” and “Package items”  
- **Case 3:** Unjustified “Authorize payment” and “Ship order” after “Cancel order”  
- **Case 4:** Compliant cancellation scenario  
- **Case 5:** Missing “Package items” before “Ship order”

Thus, cases 2, 3, and 5 deviate from the normative process as described.
