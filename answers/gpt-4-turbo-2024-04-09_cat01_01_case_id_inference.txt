Based on a detailed analysis of the attributes and sequence of activities, we can infer the case groupings as follows:

### Case 1: Patient (Age: 45, Gender: M)
1. **Event 1:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, activity: Register patient, department: ER
2. **Event 4:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, activity: Initial triage, department: ER
3. **Event 7:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, activity: X-ray imaging, department: Radiology, additional_info: body_part=left_leg
4. **Event 12:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: ER, additional_info: diagnosis=hairline_fracture
5. **Event 15:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: ER, additional_info: followup=outpatient_clinic

### Case 2: Patient (Age: 62, Gender: F)
1. **Event 2:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, activity: Register patient, department: ER
2. **Event 5:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, activity: Initial triage, department: ER
3. **Event 8:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, activity: Lab test requested, department: ER, additional_info: test_type=blood_panel
4. **Event 10:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, activity: Lab test completed, department: Laboratory, additional_info: results=normal_levels
5. **Event 11:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: ER, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection
6. **Event 14:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, activity: Prescription created, department: ER, additional_info: medication=antibiotics
7. **Event 17:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: ER, additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup

### Case 3: Patient (Age: 28, Gender: M)
1. **Event 3:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, activity: Register patient, department: Surgery
2. **Event 6:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, activity: Doctor consultation, department: Surgery, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery
3. **Event 9:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, activity: Surgery preparation, department: Surgery, additional_info: prep_type=general_anesthesia
4. **Event 13:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, activity: Surgery performed, department: Surgery, additional_info: procedure=arthroscopy
5. **Event 16:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, activity: Recovery room, department: Surgery, additional_info: condition=stable
6. **Event 18:** timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, activity: Patient discharged, department: Surgery, additional_info: followup=physiotherapy_sessions

These groupings are based on the logical order of clinical activities, timestamp progression, and crucially, the matching of patient demographics (age and gender) and relevant departments for different stages of their respective healthcare processes.
