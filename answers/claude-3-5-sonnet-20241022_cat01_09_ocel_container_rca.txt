Based on the directly-follows graph provided, here are the key process and data-specific performance issues:

1. Long Container Storage Times:
- The transition from "Place in Stock" to "Bring to Loading Bay" for containers shows an extremely long duration (743,380.51 time units), indicating containers spend excessive time in storage.

2. Empty Container Management Delays:
- The duration between "Order Empty Containers" and "Pick Up Empty Container" is very high (368,943.92 time units)
- The complete path from "Order Empty Containers" to "Depart" in the Transport Document perspective shows a very long duration (1,007,066.16 time units)

3. Vehicle Booking and Scheduling Issues:
- Repetitive "Book Vehicles" activities (self-loops) with long durations (295,965.56 time units)
- Long duration between "Book Vehicles" and "Reschedule Container" (371,476.42 time units)
- Multiple rescheduling iterations as shown by "Reschedule Container" self-loops

4. Terminal Operations Bottleneck:
- After "Drive to Terminal," trucks have a long waiting time before the next "Load Truck" (84,119.09 time units)
- This suggests congestion or resource constraints at the terminal

5. Loading Bay Inefficiencies:
- Multiple rework loops in the Forklift perspective between "Load to Vehicle," "Weigh," "Place in Stock," and "Bring to Loading Bay"
- Some unusual long durations in these loops, such as "Load to Vehicle" to "Weigh" (29,836.64 time units)

These issues suggest problems with resource allocation, storage management, and scheduling coordination between different object types in the process.
