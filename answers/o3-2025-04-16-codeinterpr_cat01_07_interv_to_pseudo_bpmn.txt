BPMN-LIKE TEXTUAL PROCESS MODEL  
Process Name: “Invoice Approval & Payment Preparation”  

1. PARTICIPANTS / LANES  
   • Supplier  
   • Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)  
   • Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor) – exception lane  
   • Purchasing Officer  
   • Department Manager  
   • Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM) – ad-hoc support  
   • Accounting / ERP System (system lane)

2. ARTIFACTS / DATA OBJECTS  
   INV  = Invoice (e-mail PDF)  
   PO   = Purchase Order  
   REC  = Goods / Services Receipt Confirmation  
   3WM  = Three-way-match result  
   APP  = Manager Approval record  
   PYR  = Payment Run file  

3. NORMAL (“HAPPY-PATH”) FLOW  
   (Sequence-numbers = task IDs; Gx = exclusive gateway / decision)

   0  [Supplier]  Send Invoice (INV) to AP Clerk (e-mail)  —— Start Event  

   1  [AP Clerk]  Check for valid PO number on INV  

   G1  PO present?  
       No  2a  
       Yes  3  

   2a [AP Clerk]  Return INV to Supplier, request missing PO  —— wait for corrected INV, then back to step 0 (loop)  

   3  [AP Clerk]  Log INV and PO into ERP (creates INV record)  

   4  [AP Clerk]  Forward INV & PO to Purchasing Officer (system generates notice)  

   5  [Purchasing] Compare INV vs PO (qty, price, freight)  

   G2  Everything matches?  
       No  6a  
       Yes  7  

   6a [Purchasing]  • Contact supplier for correction  OR  
                   • Instruct AP Clerk to place INV “On-Hold”  
                   (If unresolved, AP Clerk escalates to AP Supervisor – see Exception E1)  
       —— upon corrected or confirmed data, return to step 5  

   7  [Purchasing]  Send Confirmation (REC) to AP Clerk (e-mail / system flag)  

   8  [AP Clerk]  Perform three-way match (INV-PO-REC) in ERP  

   G3  Discrepancy found?  
       Yes  9a  
       No   10  

   9a [AP Clerk]  E-mail Purchasing for clarification  
       G3.1 Resolved quickly?  
            Yes  back to step 8  
            No   escalate to AP Supervisor (Exception E1)  

   10 [AP Clerk]  Trigger Manager Approval workflow (system auto-e-mail)  

   11 [Dept Manager] Review INV / PO / 3WM  

   G4  Approve?  
       Reject / Hold  12a  
       Approve         13  

   12a [Dept Manager] Reject or request investigation  
        • AP Clerk (and possibly AP Supervisor) analyse issue, then return to step 8 or 5 as appropriate  

   13 [AP Clerk]  Schedule approved INV for next Payment Run (PYR)  

   14 [ERP]       Payment executed in scheduled batch  —— End Event “Invoice Paid”  

4. EXCEPTIONS / VARIATIONS  

   E1  Escalation to AP Supervisor  
       Trigger: • Unresolved mismatch in steps 6a or 9a  
       Actions:  
         – AP Supervisor mediates between Purchasing, Supplier, and Dept Heads  
         – If INV lacks any PO (e.g., informally contracted services), AP Supervisor may:  
            a. Arrange retrospective PO creation with Department, then resume at step 3, or  
            b. Decide to reject INV (terminating the instance)  

   E2  Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM) involvement  
       Triggered from steps 6a or E1 when supplier cooperation is required  
       Action: SRM contacts supplier to obtain revised INV or contractual clarification; upon resolution, flow returns to step 5 or 8  

   E3  Manager Rejection Loop  
       If Dept Manager rejects in G4, the process can loop to:  
         – step 8 (minor data correction) or  
         – E1 (major contractual/PO issue)  

5. NOTES & AMBIGUITIES  

   • Interviews agree that Manager Approval occurs only after PO match & Purchasing confirmation; ERP handles notification automatically.  
   • Some stakeholders were unsure whether Purchasing or AP triggers the Manager step. Model assumes AP Clerk triggers it (most consistent narrative).  
   • Time-outs / SLAs for “On-Hold” invoices were not specified.  
   • Payment run frequency (daily vs weekly) not stated; represented generically as “next batch”.
