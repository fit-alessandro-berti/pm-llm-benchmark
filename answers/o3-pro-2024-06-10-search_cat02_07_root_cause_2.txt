1  Which cases are slow?

Measured from “Submit Claim” to “Close Claim”

• Case 20011 h 30 m  
• Case 20041 h 25 m  
 fast, normal baseline ( 2 h)  

• Case 200225 h 55 m ( 1 d 2 h)  
• Case 200348 h 20 m ( 2 d)  
• Case 200577 h 05 m ( 3 d 5 h)  

 Significant performance issues in cases 2002, 2003, 2005.

2  What do the attributes tell us?

A. Complexity  
Low(2001, 2004)~1½ h  
Medium(2002)~26 h  
High(2003)~48 h(2005)~77 h  
Duration rises almost exponentially with complexity.  
High-complexity cases also show repeated “Request Additional Documents” loops:  
• 2002 – 1 request• 2003 – 2 requests• 2005 – 3 requests  
Waiting for customers to supply the extra material is the single biggest time-sink.

B. Region  
Region Aone fast (2001 Low) and one slow (2003 High).  
Region Bone fast (2004 Low) and two slow (2002 Medium, 2005 High).  
Region alone is not deterministic, but Region B handles every long case that involves Adjuster Lisa (see C). That suggests a resourcing/capacity issue in that regional branch when claims get more complicated.

C. Resource (adjusters make or break the timeline)  

           Adjuster          | Cases | Avg. duration | # Doc-request events
          -------------------|-------|---------------|----------------------
          Adjuster Mike      | 2001, 2003 | (1.5 h + 48 h)/2  24 h | 0 and 2
          Adjuster Lisa      | 2002, 2004, 2005 | (26 h + 1.5 h + 77 h)/3  35 h | 1, 0, and 3

• Every slow Region B case is handled by Adjuster Lisa.  
• Adjuster Mike’s long case is high-complexity; duration is shorter than Lisa’s high-complexity case, and fewer document loops (2 vs 3).  
 Adjuster Lisa appears to trigger more document iterations and therefore longer wait times, especially on high-complexity claims.

D. Approval manager  
Manager Ann approves all low/medium cases; Manager Bill approves both high-complexity cases.  
Bill’s involvement starts only after the extra-document cycles, so he is not creating the delay but is inevitably later in the timeline. The root cause sits earlier—during evaluation/document collection.

3  Plausible root causes and mitigation ideas

Root cause 1: High complexity requires more (and sometimes repeated) documentation.  
Why? Unclear submission guidelines, customers unsure what “enough proof” means, adjusters exercise caution.  
Mitigation  
• Provide claim-type-specific checklists to customers in the web/app portal so most documents arrive with the first submission.  
• Allow customers to upload additional evidence proactively during the waiting period to avoid back-and-forth cycles.  
• Introduce a “complexity flag” at intake; route high-complexity claims to a specialized team with deeper domain knowledge.

Root cause 2: Adjuster Lisa’s workload or working style in Region B.  
Why? Possible overload, less experience with complicated claims, or stricter interpretation of policy wording that generates extra document requests.  
Mitigation  
• Audit Lisa’s queue and turnaround times; balance the high-complexity load across adjusters.  
• Pair her with a senior mentor or run calibration sessions to agree on what is “sufficient documentation.”  
• Implement peer review before sending a second or third additional-document request.

Root cause 3: Waiting time between document request and customer reply is entirely idle time.  
Mitigation  
• Set up automated reminders/escalations to customers after 24 h.  
• Offer real-time chat/phone assistance when a document request is issued to speed the turnaround.  
• Allow partial parallelism: begin preliminary approval work while waiting for less-critical documents.

Root cause 4: Cross-regional coordination.  
Why? Region B handles nearly all medium/high cases in the sample; if staff is thin, queues form.  
Mitigation  
• Cross-train Region A staff to pick up overflow from Region B.  
• Introduce a global work pool and claim-routing algorithm that considers real-time capacity, not just geography.

Measurable targets after interventions  
• Reduce high-complexity average lead time from 2-3 days to  24 h.  
• Cut the average number of “Request Additional Documents” loops from >2 to 1 by Q4 2025.  
• Bring Adjuster Lisa’s average time-in-system on complex claims in line with Adjuster Mike’s (< 48 h).

By tackling complexity-driven rework, aligning adjuster practices, and smoothing capacity across regions, the process should regain the sub-24-hour performance seen in straightforward (low-complexity) cases.
