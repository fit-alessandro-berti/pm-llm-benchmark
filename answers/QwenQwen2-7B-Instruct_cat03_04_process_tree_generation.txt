Certainly! Below is an example of Python code that uses the `pm4py` library to create a Process Tree for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator, Leaf

# Defining a function to create a process tree for the purchase-to-pay process
def create_purchase_to_pay_tree():
    # Define Process Tree nodes with their labels and operators
    # Purchase Request (PR)
    pr = Leaf("Purchase Request", parent=None)

    # Purchase Order (PO)
    po = Leaf("Purchase Order", parent=None)

    # Invoice Receipt (IR) AC
    ir_ac = Leaf("Invoice Receipt (Accounting Control)", parent=None)

    # Submit Expense Claim (DEC)
    dec = Leaf("Submit Expense Claim", parent=None)

    # Approve Purchase Order (PO Approval)
    poa = Leaf("Approve Purchase Order", parent=None)

    # Accept Invoice (IA)
    ia = Leaf("Accept Invoice", parent=None)

    # Approve Invoice (Invoicing (I Approval))
    ia_i = Leaf("Approve Invoice", parent=None)

    # Pay Invoice (PI)
    pi = Leaf("Pay Invoice", parent=None)

    # Purchase-to-Pay Process sequence
    process_tree = ProcessTree(Operator.PARALLEL, parent=None)

    # Dealing with the sequence steps inside the Purchase-to-Pay process
    sequence_branch = ProcessTree(Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=process_tree)

    # Purchase Request sequence
    purchase_request_branch = ProcessTree(Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=sequence_branch)
    purchase_request_branch.children.append(pr)

    processing_pipeline = ProcessTree(Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=sequence_branch)
    processing_pipeline.children.append(poa)
    processing_pipeline.children.append(ir_ac)

    # Adding the sequence branch to the main process tree
    sequence_branch.children.append(processing_pipeline)

    # Payment process sequence
    payment_pipeline = ProcessTree(Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=sequence_branch)
    payment_pipeline.children.append(pi)

    # Submissions process sequence
    submissions_pipeline = ProcessTree(Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=sequence_branch)
    submissions_pipeline.children.append(dec)

    # Getting all the parallel execution branches at the root process tree
    process_tree.children.append(sequence_branch)
    process_tree.children.append(payment_pipeline)
    process_tree.children.append(submissions_pipeline)

    return process_tree
