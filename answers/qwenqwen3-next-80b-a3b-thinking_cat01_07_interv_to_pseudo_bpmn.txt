<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. I need to create a BPMN-like textual process model based on the interview transcripts. First, I'll go through each interview and extract the key points.

Starting with Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk. She says when an invoice arrives (usually by email), she checks for a valid PO number. If no PO, sends back to supplier. If PO exists, logs into accounting system, then forwards to Purchasing to confirm receipt. Then matches invoice line items against PO. If matches, sends to department manager for approval. If discrepancies, emails Purchasing to clarify; if unresolved, escalates to supervisor. After manager approves, schedules payment.

Dan, Purchasing Officer: When he gets the invoice from AP, he checks against PO. If issues, contacts supplier or asks AP to hold. If correct, confirms to AP. If PO missing, tells Mary to get info. He never approves without PO. After confirmation, AP moves it to manager.

Carlos, Department Manager: Gets notified after PO match and Purchasing confirmation. Approves if all good. If suspicious, rejects or asks to investigate. After approval, goes back to AP for payment scheduling.

Rita, AP Supervisor: Handles exceptions. If Mary can't resolve, escalates to her. She contacts suppliers, coordinates for missing info or non-PO invoices. Creates retrospective POs if needed. After resolving, back to normal flow: Purchasing confirmation, manager approval, payment.

Karen, Supplier Relationship Manager: Involved when there's discrepancies. She contacts suppliers for missing PO, pricing issues, checks contracts. Helps resolve so invoices can move forward.

Now, need to structure this into BPMN elements: activities, sequence flows, gateways, roles, artifacts, exceptions.

First, start with the main flow.

Initial step: Invoice received (by email). Mary checks for PO.

So, the process starts with "Receive Invoice" activity. Then check if PO exists. That's a gateway: yes/no.

If no PO, send back to supplier. Then maybe a loop? But Mary says "send back to supplier requesting details", so after that, maybe the supplier sends a new invoice with PO, then it goes back to start? Or does the process wait for the new invoice?

But the interviews don't specify what happens after sending back. So perhaps after sending back, the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But the model needs to capture that.

But maybe the "Send Back to Supplier" is an activity, then the next step is waiting for the supplier's response. But the interviews don't say much about that. So perhaps after sending back, it's a separate path.

But let's outline the main flow first.

Main flow:

1. Receive Invoice (by email)
2. Check for valid PO number (gateway: PO exists?)
   - If no PO: Send back to supplier (activity), then maybe wait for response? But the interviews don't specify, so perhaps after sending back, it's a separate path. But Mary says "send it back to supplier requesting more details". So the next step after that would be to wait for the supplier to send a corrected invoice. But how is that handled? Maybe the process waits, but there's no clear step. So perhaps after sending back, the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But the interviews don't mention a specific step for that. Maybe the "Send Back" activity leads to a loop back to the PO check? Or perhaps the invoice is stored until supplier responds. But for BPMN, maybe a "Wait for Supplier Response" activity, but the interviews don't specify that. Alternatively, after sending back, the process stops until supplier replies, but that's not a step. Hmm.

But maybe the process continues when the supplier sends a new invoice. So perhaps the "Send Back" activity is followed by "Await Supplier Response", but the interviews don't mention that. So maybe the model should include that as an activity, but the interviewees didn't talk about it. So perhaps in the model, after sending back, it's a step where the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But since the interviews don't specify, maybe just note that.

Alternatively, Mary says "if it doesn't have a PO, I send it back to supplier requesting more details". So the next step after that would be to wait for the supplier's reply. But in the model, perhaps there's a "Wait for Supplier Response" activity. But maybe the interviews don't mention that, so perhaps the model should have that as a step.

But maybe the "Send Back" is followed by a loop back to the PO check? Like after supplier responds, the invoice comes back, then check PO again. But the interviews don't specify. Hmm.

Alternatively, when Mary sends back the invoice, she's sending a request for more details. So the supplier then sends a new invoice with the PO. So the process would have to receive the new invoice again. But that might be a separate instance. But maybe for the model, after sending back, it's a path that leads to "Receive Invoice" again? Not sure.

But perhaps the main flow is the PO exists path, and the no PO path is an exception.

Let's outline the main path first.

After receiving invoice, check PO.

If PO exists: Log into system (Mary's action), then forward to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt.

Dan checks against PO: compare quantities, prices, etc. If correct, confirm to AP. If issues, contact supplier or ask AP to hold.

Wait, Dan says: "If something’s off—like if we were billed for extra units—we either contact the supplier directly or ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice until the supplier sends a corrected version."

So if discrepancies, Dan contacts supplier or asks AP to hold. So the process might have a branch here.

Then, after Dan confirms, Mary matches invoice line items against PO. Wait, Mary says: "After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

Wait, Mary's steps: check PO, log into system, forward to Purchasing. Then after confirmation from Purchasing, match invoice against PO. So the matching is done by Mary after receiving confirmation from Purchasing.

But Dan says his job is to check if invoice details line up with PO. So when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks the PO and the invoice.

So perhaps the steps:

- Mary logs invoice into system, then sends to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt.

Dan then checks the invoice against PO. If correct, he confirms. If not, he contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.

So after Dan's check, if correct, then Mary does the line item matching? Wait, Mary says "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." So Mary does the matching after confirmation.

But Dan's role is to check if the invoice matches the PO. So perhaps the matching is part of Dan's check. But Mary says she does the matching after confirmation.

Wait, let's parse Mary's statement again:

"if it has a PO, I log it into our accounting system. After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

So Mary forwards to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt. Then, once she gets confirmation (from Purchasing), she matches line items against PO.

But Dan says: "When the invoice hits my inbox from Accounts Payable, my job is to check if the invoice details line up with what we ordered. I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges."

So Dan's check includes comparing the invoice details to the PO. So perhaps "confirmation of receipt" is part of that. But Mary says she forwards to Purchasing to confirm that goods were received. So maybe Dan's role is to confirm receipt (i.e., that the goods were actually received), and then Mary does the line item matching against PO.

But that seems odd. Because usually, the PO would have the details of what was ordered, so when the invoice comes, you check if the invoice matches the PO. But Dan says he checks the invoice details against the PO.

Wait, perhaps the Purchasing department's role is to confirm that the goods/services were received as per the PO. So when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks if the invoice matches the PO (i.e., the quantities, prices, etc.), and also confirms that the goods were received. But Mary says "confirm that the goods or services were actually received". So maybe Dan's task is to verify that the goods were received, and then Mary does the line item matching.

But Dan says: "I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges." So that's matching the invoice against the PO.

So perhaps the steps are:

Mary logs the invoice, then forwards to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm receipt. But Dan's action is to check the invoice against the PO (which includes confirming receipt). So the "confirmation" from Purchasing is that the PO is valid and the invoice matches.

But Mary says "confirm that the goods or services were actually received", which is part of the process. So Dan's check includes verifying receipt.

So perhaps after Mary logs the invoice and forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks the PO and invoice for matching. If correct, he confirms; if not, issues.

Then Mary matches line items against PO. Wait, but if Dan already checked that, why does Mary do it again? Maybe Dan checks for receipt, and Mary checks the line items. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe Dan's check is about whether the goods were received, and Mary's matching is checking the invoice details against PO.

But Mary says: "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." So the confirmation from Purchasing is that the goods were received, then Mary does the line item matching. But Dan's statement says he compares quantities and prices. So perhaps the Purchasing department's confirmation includes both receipt confirmation and matching the invoice to the PO.

This might be a point of confusion. Let's see.

Mary: "forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received." So their job is to confirm receipt. But Dan says he checks the invoice details against the PO. So perhaps the Purchasing department's task is to verify that the goods were received (so they check the delivery receipt, etc.), and then the matching of invoice to PO is done by Mary. But Dan says he compares quantities and prices. So maybe the PO has the order details, and the invoice is compared to that. So perhaps the Purchasing department's check is whether the invoice matches the PO (quantities, prices), and also whether the goods were received.

But Mary says she forwards to Purchasing to confirm receipt. So maybe Dan's role is to confirm that the goods were received (so he checks the delivery confirmation), and then Mary matches the invoice to the PO. But Dan says he compares quantities and prices. So perhaps the Purchasing department does the matching of invoice to PO.

This is a bit conflicting. Let's try to reconcile.

Mary: "forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received." So Purchasing's role is to confirm receipt. Then Mary does the matching.

Dan: "my job is to check if the invoice details line up with what we ordered." So he checks invoice against PO. So perhaps the "confirmation" from Purchasing includes both confirming receipt and matching to PO. But Mary says "confirm that goods were received", which is part of it.

So perhaps the Purchasing department (Dan) checks both the receipt and the PO details. So when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks if the invoice matches the PO (quantities, prices) and confirms that the goods were received. If yes, he confirms; if not, issues.

Then Mary matches the invoice line items against the PO. But if Dan already checked that, why does Mary do it again? Maybe Mary's matching is part of the system's process, but Dan's check is manual. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Mary logs the invoice into the system, then sends to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt. Then Purchasing (Dan) confirms receipt (i.e., that the goods were delivered), and then Mary matches the invoice to the PO. But Dan's statement says he compares quantities and prices, so perhaps he does the matching.

This is a bit unclear. Let's see what the interviews say.

Mary: "After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

Dan: "When the invoice hits my inbox from Accounts Payable, my job is to check if the invoice details line up with what we ordered. I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges."

So Mary's forwarding to Purchasing is for confirming receipt, but Dan says his job is to check invoice details against PO. So perhaps the "confirmation" that Mary refers to is that the goods were received, but Dan also checks the details. So maybe the Purchasing department's task is to verify both the receipt and the invoice matching. So when they confirm, it's that everything is correct.

But Mary says after getting confirmation, she matches the line items. That seems like she's doing the matching after confirmation. But Dan says he checks the details. So perhaps there's a step where Mary does the matching after Purchasing confirms. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe Mary's "match" is a system check, while Dan does a manual check.

Alternatively, perhaps "confirm that goods were received" is separate from matching to PO. For example, Purchasing confirms that the goods were received (so they check the delivery note), and then Mary matches the invoice to the PO for pricing and quantities. But Dan's statement says he compares quantities and prices, which would be matching to PO.

This is a bit tricky. Let's see if there's another way. Maybe the Purchasing department's role is to confirm that the goods were received (so they check the delivery), and then Mary does the matching against PO. But Dan says he compares quantities and prices, which is part of matching to PO. So perhaps when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks both the receipt and the PO details. So his confirmation includes both.

So, after Mary logs the invoice, sends to Purchasing (Dan). Dan checks if invoice matches PO (quantities, prices, etc.), and confirms receipt. If correct, he confirms. If not, he contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.

Then Mary, after getting confirmation, matches line items against PO. Wait, but if Dan already checked that, why does Mary do it again? Maybe the matching is part of the system, but perhaps Mary's step is to verify in the system. But maybe the "match" is part of Dan's check.

Alternatively, perhaps the "match" is done by the system after Dan's confirmation. But Mary says she does it.

Hmm. Let's try to map the steps as per each interview.

Mary's steps:

1. Receive invoice (email)
2. Check PO exists? If no, send back to supplier.
3. If yes, log into system.
4. Forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt.
5. Once confirmation received, match invoice line items against PO.
6. If match, send to manager for approval.
7. If discrepancy, email Purchasing to clarify; if unresolved, escalate to supervisor.
8. After manager approval, schedule payment.

Dan's steps:

- When invoice hits his inbox from AP, he checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges).
- If issues: contact supplier or ask AP to hold.
- If correct, send confirmation to AP.
- If PO missing, tell Mary to get info.

So Dan's check is part of the confirmation step. So when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks the invoice against PO and confirms receipt. So the confirmation from Purchasing includes both.

So after Mary logs the invoice and forwards to Purchasing, Dan does the check. If correct, confirms to AP. If not, he contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.

Then Mary, upon getting confirmation, matches the line items. But if Dan already checked, why does Mary do it again? Maybe the matching is part of the system process, but Mary is the one doing it. Alternatively, maybe "match line items" is part of Dan's check, but Mary's description says she does it after confirmation. So perhaps after Dan confirms, Mary does the matching in the system.

But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the "match" is a system check that happens automatically, but Mary is the one who does it manually. But the interviews don't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps "match invoice line items against PO" is part of Dan's check. But Mary says she does it after confirmation. So maybe the confirmation from Purchasing is that the goods were received (so Dan checks delivery), and then Mary does the financial matching against PO. But Dan says he compares quantities and prices, which is financial matching.

This is a bit confusing. Let's see if there's consensus.

Rita says: "if Mary can’t match the invoice or if Purchasing has an issue—like the invoice is missing information or has a discrepancy that can’t be resolved—she escalates it to me."

So "matching" is done by Mary. So Mary's task is to match the invoice line items against the PO. So perhaps after Purchasing confirms receipt, Mary does the matching. But Dan's check is part of the confirmation. So maybe:

- Mary logs invoice, forwards to Purchasing to confirm receipt. Purchasing (Dan) checks if the goods were received (so they check delivery docs), and then confirms. Then Mary matches the invoice to PO for pricing and quantities.

But Dan says he compares quantities and prices. So perhaps Purchasing's confirmation includes checking the PO details. So maybe Dan's check is both receipt and PO matching.

But Mary says she does the matching after confirmation. So perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing is that the goods were received, and then Mary does the matching. But Dan's statement says he checks the invoice details against PO. So maybe there's a step where Purchasing confirms receipt (so delivery), and then Mary does the financial matching. But Dan's role would be to check the delivery, but he also checks the PO details.

Alternatively, maybe the "confirmation" from Purchasing is that the invoice matches the PO (so quantities, prices), which includes confirming receipt. So Dan checks the PO and invoice, and if correct, confirms. Then Mary's matching step is redundant. But Mary says she does it after confirmation. So perhaps the matching is part of the system's process after Purchasing confirms.

This is a point where there might be conflicting accounts. But for the model, perhaps the steps are:

- Mary logs invoice, forwards to Purchasing.

- Purchasing (Dan) checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, etc.) and confirms receipt.

- If correct, confirm to AP.

- Mary then matches the line items (maybe as part of the system process), but perhaps the matching is part of Dan's check.

Alternatively, perhaps the matching is done by Mary after the confirmation. So:

After Purchasing confirms receipt (and PO matching), Mary does the line item matching in the system. But that seems odd. Maybe Mary's "match" is the same as Dan's check. But the interviews need to be reconciled.

Let's see: Mary says "After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

So the "confirmation" from Purchasing is that goods were received. Then Mary does the matching. But Dan says his job is to check invoice details against PO. So perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing is about receipt, and the matching is a separate step by Mary. But Dan's check would include checking the PO details. So perhaps the Purchasing department's confirmation includes checking the PO details. So when Dan confirms, he's checking both receipt and PO matching. Then Mary's matching step might be redundant, or perhaps it's a system check.

Alternatively, maybe the "matching" is done by the system, but Mary is the one who initiates it. But the interviews don't specify.

Given the information, perhaps the model should have:

- After Purchasing confirms receipt (and matches PO), Mary does the line item matching. But Dan's check is part of the confirmation. So perhaps the "confirm receipt" by Purchasing includes matching the invoice to PO. So when Dan confirms, he's checking the PO details. Then Mary's "match" step is perhaps part of the same process. But Mary says she does it after confirmation.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are:

1. Mary checks PO exists.

2. If yes, logs into system.

3. Forwards to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt.

4. Purchasing (Dan) checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, etc.), and confirms receipt.

5. If correct, Dan sends confirmation to Mary.

6. Mary then matches the line items (but if Dan already checked, why?), but perhaps the matching is part of the system process. Alternatively, Mary's matching is part of the system check after confirmation.

This is a bit unclear. To resolve, perhaps the "match invoice line items against PO" is part of Dan's check. But Mary says she does it after confirmation. So maybe after Dan confirms, Mary does the matching. But that would be redundant. Alternatively, perhaps Dan's confirmation is only about receipt, and Mary does the matching.

But Dan says he compares quantities and prices. So maybe the confirmation from Purchasing includes both receipt and matching. So when Dan confirms, he's done both. Then Mary's matching step might be part of the system's process. But the interviews don't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps "confirm that goods were received" is separate from matching to PO. So Purchasing confirms receipt (delivery), and then Mary matches the invoice to PO for financial details.

But Dan's statement says he checks quantities and prices, which is matching to PO. So perhaps Purchasing's role is to check the PO details, which includes quantities and prices. So when Mary forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks the PO and invoice for matching. Then confirms. So Mary's "match line items" step is part of that. But Mary says she does it after confirmation. So maybe after Dan confirms, Mary verifies in the system.

But perhaps the model should have:

- Mary logs invoice.

- Forwards to Purchasing.

- Purchasing (Dan) checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, etc.) and confirms receipt.

- If correct, Dan confirms to AP.

- Mary then matches line items (though this might be redundant, but per Mary's statement).

But this seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps "matching line items" is the same as what Dan does. So maybe Mary's step is incorrect, or the interviews have conflicting info.

But to resolve, perhaps the model should have:

After Mary logs the invoice and forwards to Purchasing, Dan checks the invoice against the PO (including quantities, prices), and confirms receipt. If correct, he confirms. Then Mary does the line item matching (but this may be part of Dan's check). Alternatively, maybe the matching is done by the system automatically once Dan confirms.

But given the interviews, Mary says "Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system." So she does it after confirmation. So perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing is that the goods were received (so delivery confirmation), and then Mary matches the invoice to PO for financial accuracy. But Dan says he checks quantities and prices. So perhaps Dan's check is about financial matching. So the Purchasing department checks the financial details against PO, and confirms. Then Mary does the matching in the system. But that would be the same thing. Maybe it's a system check.

Alternatively, perhaps the "match" is a separate step where Mary ensures the invoice line items match the PO. So after Dan confirms receipt, Mary does the matching. But Dan's check would include that.

This is a bit of a conflict. To proceed, I'll note that there might be some overlap, but based on Mary's statement, the steps are:

- After Purchasing confirms receipt, Mary matches line items against PO.

But Dan says his job is to check invoice details against PO. So perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing includes checking the PO details. So Mary's matching step is redundant, but per her account, she does it. So the model should include it.

So steps:

- Mary logs invoice.

- Forwards to Purchasing.

- Purchasing (Dan) checks PO and invoice details (quantities, prices, etc.) and confirms receipt.

- If correct, send confirmation.

- Mary matches line items against PO (as part of her process).

But maybe the "match" is part of Dan's check, but Mary's description says she does it after confirmation. So perhaps the model should have both steps: Dan confirms receipt and matches PO, then Mary does the matching again. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps "matching line items" is the same as Dan's check. So maybe Mary's statement is a bit off, but the model should have Purchasing doing the match.

Alternatively, perhaps the Purchasing department's confirmation is only for receipt, and Mary does the matching. But Dan's statement says he checks quantities and prices, which is matching.

Hmm. Let's try to outline all steps as per each interview.

Let's list all activities mentioned:

From Mary:

- Receive invoice (email)

- Check PO exists

- If no PO: send back to supplier

- If yes: log into system

- Forward to Purchasing to confirm receipt

- Once confirmation received: match invoice line items against PO

- If match: send to manager for approval

- If discrepancy: email Purchasing to clarify; if unresolved, escalate to supervisor

- After manager approval: schedule payment

From Dan:

- Check invoice against PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges)

- If issues: contact supplier or ask AP to hold

- If correct: send confirmation to AP

- If PO missing: tell Mary to get info

From Carlos:

- Get notification after PO match and Purchasing confirmation

- Approve if good; reject or ask to investigate if suspicious

- After approval, back to AP for payment

From Rita:

- Handles exceptions when Mary can't resolve or Purchasing issues

- Contact suppliers, coordinate, create retrospective PO for non-PO invoices

- After resolving, back to normal flow

From Karen:

- Contact suppliers for missing PO, pricing discrepancies; check contracts

- Help resolve issues so invoices move forward

So, putting this together.

Main flow:

1. Start: Receive Invoice (by email)

2. Check for valid PO number (gateway)

   - No PO: Send to Supplier for Details (activity), then loop back to Receive Invoice? Or wait for response. But the interviews don't specify. So perhaps after sending back, there's a "Wait for Supplier Response" activity. Then when supplier responds, invoice comes back, and the process continues from "Check PO exists".

   But the interviews don't mention waiting. So perhaps the "Send Back" is an activity, and then the process waits. But for BPMN, it's a task followed by a wait. But maybe the model should have "Send Back to Supplier" as a task, then a "Wait for Supplier Response" task, then back to Check PO.

   But the interviews don't specify waiting. So perhaps after sending back, the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But in BPMN terms, the process would have a task "Send Back to Supplier" followed by a wait state. But since the interviews don't mention the waiting part, perhaps it's implied.

   Alternatively, the model might not have a wait step, but when supplier responds, the invoice is received again. But that's a bit unclear.

   For simplicity, perhaps "Send Back to Supplier" leads to a loop back to the Check PO step. So when supplier sends a new invoice, it's received again, and the process continues.

   But the interviews don't specify that. So perhaps the model should have "Send Back to Supplier" as a task, and then the process waits, but since it's not mentioned, maybe the model has a note that the supplier's response is required before continuing.

   But for the model, perhaps the "Send Back" is a task, and then the next step is the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But since the interviews don't specify, maybe the model should have the "Send Back" activity, and then a path that says "Await Supplier Response", but that's not explicitly stated. Alternatively, since Mary says she sends it back to request details, the next step is the supplier provides the details, so perhaps the process continues when the new invoice is received. But that's a bit vague.

   For now, I'll note that when PO is missing, send back to supplier, and the process waits for a response. But in BPMN terms, this might be a task followed by a wait state.

   But to keep it simple, perhaps the "Send Back to Supplier" task leads to a "Wait for Supplier Response" task, then back to Check PO.

   But the interviews don't mention waiting, so maybe the model should have "Send Back to Supplier" and then the process continues when the supplier responds. But how? Maybe the next step is to receive the invoice again. So the process would loop back to the start.

   Alternatively, perhaps the "Send Back" is part of the exception handling, and when supplier responds, the invoice is processed again.

   For the model, perhaps the "Send Back" leads to a "Supplier Response" step, but the interviews don't mention that. So maybe the model should have "Send Back to Supplier" as a task, and then the process continues when the supplier sends a new invoice, which would be received again. So the model would have a loop from "Send Back" back to "Receive Invoice".

   But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the invoice is on hold until supplier responds, but the process doesn't have a step for that. So in the model, after "Send Back to Supplier", the next step is when the supplier responds, the invoice is received again. So the loop back to "Receive Invoice".

   But the interviews don't specify, so perhaps the model should have that.

3. If PO exists: Log Invoice into System.

4. Forward to Purchasing Department (Dan) for confirmation.

5. Purchasing checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, etc.) and confirms receipt.

   - If issues (e.g., discrepancies, missing PO info), then:

      - Contact Supplier (Karen may be involved here)

      - Or ask AP to hold

      - If PO missing, Dan tells Mary to get info.

   - If correct, send confirmation to AP.

6. Mary matches invoice line items against PO.

   - If match: send to Department Manager for approval.

   - If discrepancy: email Purchasing to clarify; if unresolved, escalate to Rita (supervisor).

7. Department Manager (Carlos) receives notification, reviews invoice.

   - If all good: approve.

   - If suspicious: reject or ask to investigate.

8. After approval: Schedule Payment.

9. For exceptions (e.g., missing PO, discrepancies):

   - Rita (supervisor) handles: contacts suppliers, coordinates, creates retrospective PO for non-PO invoices.

   - Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) helps resolve issues: contacts suppliers for missing PO, pricing discrepancies.

Now, gateways:

- Check PO exists: yes/no.

- After Purchasing check: correct vs issues.

- After Mary's matching: match vs discrepancy.

- After Manager approval: approved vs rejected.

Also, roles:

- Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)

- Purchasing Officer (Dan)

- Department Manager (Carlos)

- AP Supervisor (Rita)

- Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)

Artifacts: Invoices, PO, system logs.

Exceptions:

- Missing PO: send back to supplier.

- Discrepancies: escalate to Rita.

- Non-PO invoices: handled by Rita creating retrospective PO.

Now, let's structure this into a textual BPMN model.

BPMN elements:

- Activities: tasks with names

- Gateways: decision points (exclusive, parallel)

- Sequence flows: arrows between elements

- Roles: who does what

- Artifacts: data objects

- Exceptions: alternate paths

So for the textual representation, maybe describe each element in order.

Start with "Start" event.

Then activities and gateways.

For example:

1. Start Event: "Invoice Received via Email"

2. Task: "Check for Valid PO Number" (performed by Mary)

   - Gateway: PO Exists?

      - No: Task "Send Back to Supplier" (Mary), then loop back to "Check for Valid PO Number" or "Receive Invoice"

      - Yes: Task "Log Invoice into Accounting System" (Mary)

3. Task: "Forward to Purchasing Department for Confirmation" (Mary)

4. Task: "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" (Dan)

   - Gateway: Correct?

      - Yes: Task "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO" (Mary)

      - No: Task "Handle Discrepancy" (Dan or Mary)

         - If PO missing: Task "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary), then loop back to Check PO.

         - If other discrepancies: Task "Contact Supplier via Karen" or "Ask AP to Hold", then possibly escalate to Rita.

Wait, but Dan says if issues, he contacts supplier or asks AP to hold. So:

After "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt", if issues:

- If PO missing: Dan tells Mary to get info. So Mary handles that.

- If other discrepancies (e.g., pricing), Dan contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.

But Karen is involved in resolving supplier issues.

So perhaps:

- If discrepancies:

   - If missing PO: Task "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary)

   - Else: Task "Contact Supplier via Karen" or "Ask AP to Hold"

Then, after resolving, loop back to the verification step.

But the interviews don't specify the exact flow after handling discrepancies. So Rita's role is to handle escalations.

So for the model:

After "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt", if issues:

   - If PO missing: Task "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary), then loop back to "Check for Valid PO Number" (since PO is now provided)

   - Else: Task "Handle Discrepancy" which may involve Karen or Rita.

But Karen is involved when there's a discrepancy that needs supplier input.

So perhaps:

- If issues during verification:

   - Gateway: Type of Issue?

      - PO Missing: Task "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary), then loop back to "Check for Valid PO Number"

      - Pricing Discrepancy: Task "Contact Supplier via Karen" (Karen), then loop back to verification.

      - Other Issues: Task "Escalate to Rita" (Mary), then Rita handles.

But the interviews don't specify the exact type of issue. Dan says "if something’s off—like if we were billed for extra units—we either contact the supplier directly or ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice until the supplier sends a corrected version." So Dan contacts supplier or asks AP to hold.

So perhaps:

- If issues: Task "Resolve Discrepancy"

   - Which may involve Karen contacting supplier, or Mary holding.

Then after resolution, loop back to verification.

But Rita is involved when it's unresolved.

So perhaps:

- After "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt", if issues:

   - Task "Handle Discrepancy" (Dan or Mary)

      - If resolved: loop back to verification

      - Else: Escalate to Rita

But Rita's role is to handle when Mary can't resolve.

So Mary escalates to Rita if she can't resolve.

So:

- Mary's "match invoice line items" step: if discrepancy, she emails Purchasing to clarify. If unresolved, escalates to Rita.

So perhaps:

After "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO" (Mary), if discrepancy:

   - Task "Email Purchasing for Clarification" (Mary)

      - If resolved: proceed to approval

      - Else: Task "Escalate to AP Supervisor" (Mary), then Rita handles.

Rita's tasks: "Contact Supplier", "Coordinate between departments", "Create Retrospective PO", then loop back to normal flow.

Also, non-PO invoices: Rita handles creating retrospective PO.

So, let's structure the model step by step.

Starting with:

Start Event: "Invoice Received"

Activity: "Check for Valid PO Number" (Mary)

Gateway: PO Exists?

   - No: Activity "Send Back to Supplier" (Mary), then loop back to "Check for Valid PO Number"

   - Yes: Activity "Log Invoice into System" (Mary)

Activity: "Forward to Purchasing Department" (Mary)

Activity: "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" (Dan)

Gateway: Correct?

   - Yes: Activity "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Handle Discrepancy" (Dan or Mary)

      - Gateway: Type of Issue?

         - PO Missing: Activity "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary), loop back to "Check for Valid PO Number"

         - Pricing/Quantity Discrepancy: Activity "Contact Supplier via Karen" (Karen), then loop back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt"

         - Other Issues: Activity "Escalate to Rita" (Mary), then Rita handles

Activity: "Match Invoice Line Items Against PO" (Mary)

Gateway: Match?

   - Yes: Activity "Send to Department Manager for Approval" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Email Purchasing for Clarification" (Mary)

      - If resolved: proceed to Approval

      - Else: Activity "Escalate to AP Supervisor" (Mary), then Rita handles

Activity: "Department Manager Approval" (Carlos)

Gateway: Approved?

   - Yes: Activity "Schedule Payment" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Reject and Investigate" (Carlos), then loop back to earlier steps

Rita's tasks:

When escalated, Rita:

- Activity "Contact Supplier" (Rita)

- Activity "Create Retrospective PO" (if no PO)

- Activity "Coordinate with Departments"

Then loop back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" or "Match Invoice Line Items"

But need to see where Rita fits in.

Also, Karen's role: when there's a discrepancy, she helps resolve by contacting supplier.

Now, the "Schedule Payment" leads to End Event.

But also, Rita's involvement after she handles the exception, the invoice goes back into the normal flow.

So the model should have Rita's tasks leading back to the appropriate step.

For example, after Rita resolves the issue, the invoice proceeds to the next step.

Now, to structure this in a clear textual BPMN-like format.

Let's outline the process steps with roles and gateways.

First, define the main flow.

Start Event: "Invoice Received via Email"

Activity: "Check PO Existence" (Mary)

- Gateway: PO Exists?

   - No: Activity "Send to Supplier for PO Details" (Mary)  Loop back to "Check PO Existence"

   - Yes: Activity "Log Invoice in System" (Mary)

Activity: "Forward to Purchasing" (Mary)

Activity: "Verify PO Match and Receipt" (Dan)

- Gateway: Correct?

   - Yes: Activity "Match Line Items to PO" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Handle Discrepancy" (Dan/Mary)

      - Gateway: Discrepancy Type?

         - PO Missing: Activity "Request PO from Supplier" (Mary)  Loop back to "Check PO Existence"

         - Pricing/Quantity Issue: Activity "Contact Supplier via Karen" (Karen)  Loop back to "Verify PO Match and Receipt"

         - Other Issues: Activity "Escalate to Rita" (Mary)  Rita's handling

Activity: "Match Line Items to PO" (Mary)

- Gateway: Match?

   - Yes: Activity "Send for Manager Approval" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Clarify with Purchasing" (Mary)

      - Gateway: Resolved?

         - Yes: Proceed to "Send for Manager Approval"

         - No: Activity "Escalate to Rita" (Mary)

Rita's Handling:

Activity: "Resolve Exception" (Rita)

- Which may include:

   - Contact Supplier

   - Create Retrospective PO (if no PO)

   - Coordinate with Departments

Then, after resolution, loop back to "Verify PO Match and Receipt" or "Match Line Items to PO"

Department Manager Approval:

Activity: "Manager Approval Review" (Carlos)

- Gateway: Approved?

   - Yes: Activity "Schedule Payment" (Mary)

   - No: Activity "Reject and Investigate" (Carlos)  Loop back to earlier steps (e.g., to "Verify PO Match" or "Match Line Items")

End Event: "Payment Scheduled"

Artifacts: Invoices, PO, System Logs.

Exceptions:

- Non-PO invoices handled by Rita creating retrospective PO.

- Supplier issues handled by Karen.

Now, for the textual representation, it's important to structure it clearly.

Also, note that Rita's role is to handle escalations, so when Mary escalates, Rita takes over.

So in the model, when "Escalate to Rita" is done, Rita performs tasks to resolve, then the process continues.

So let's try to write this as a structured list.

BPMN Textual Model:

Process Name: Invoice Approval Process

Start Event: "Invoice Received via Email"

Sequence Flow:

1. Activity: "Check PO Existence" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - Gateway: PO Exists?
      - No  Activity: "Send Back to Supplier for PO Details" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
         - Sequence Flow: Back to "Check PO Existence"
      - Yes  Activity: "Log Invoice in Accounting System" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

2. Activity: "Forward to Purchasing Department" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

3. Activity: "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" (Role: Purchasing Officer)
   - Gateway: Correct?
      - Yes  Activity: "Match Invoice Line Items to PO" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
      - No  Gateway: Discrepancy Type?
         - PO Missing  Activity: "Request PO from Supplier" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
            - Sequence Flow: Back to "Check PO Existence"
         - Pricing/Quantity Discrepancy  Activity: "Contact Supplier via Supplier Relationship Manager" (Role: Supplier Relationship Manager)
            - Sequence Flow: Back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt"
         - Other Issues  Activity: "Escalate to AP Supervisor" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

4. Activity: "Match Invoice Line Items to PO" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
   - Gateway: Match?
      - Yes  Activity: "Send for Department Manager Approval" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
      - No  Gateway: Resolved?
         - Yes  Activity: "Send for Department Manager Approval" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
         - No  Activity: "Escalate to AP Supervisor" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)

5. Activity: "Resolve Exception" (Role: AP Supervisor)
   - Tasks:
      - "Contact Supplier"
      - "Create Retrospective PO (if applicable)"
      - "Coordinate with Departments"
   - Sequence Flow: Back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt"

6. Activity: "Department Manager Approval Review" (Role: Department Manager)
   - Gateway: Approved?
      - Yes  Activity: "Schedule Payment" (Role: Accounts Payable Clerk)
      - No  Activity: "Reject and Investigate" (Role: Department Manager)
         - Sequence Flow: Back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" or "Match Invoice Line Items to PO" (depending on issue)

End Event: "Payment Scheduled"

Artifacts:
- Invoice Document
- Purchase Order (PO)
- System Logs (Accounting System)

Note: In cases where the invoice lacks a PO, the process loops back to request PO from supplier. If discrepancies cannot be resolved at Purchasing level, AP Supervisor (Rita) handles escalation. Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved in resolving supplier-related discrepancies.

This captures the main flow, gateways, roles, and exceptions.

Check for conflicts: For example, Mary says after matching, if discrepancy, email Purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor. So the "Match Line Items" step's "No" path leads to "Clarify with Purchasing" then if unresolved, escalate.

In the model above, after "Match Line Items" step:

- If match no, then Gateway: Resolved? Yes  proceed to approval. No  escalate to Rita.

But the "Clarify with Purchasing" is part of the process. So perhaps:

After "Match Line Items to PO" (Mary), if no match:

- Activity: "Email Purchasing for Clarification" (Mary)

   - Then, if resolved  proceed to approval

   - Else  escalate to Rita.

So the model should have that.

Also, when Rita resolves, the process goes back to "Verify PO Match and Confirm Receipt" or to the matching step. But probably back to "Verify PO Match" since the issue might be at that stage.

But Rita's handling may resolve the issue so that the invoice can proceed to the next step.

In the model, after "Resolve Exception", the flow goes back to "Verify Invoice Against PO and Confirm Receipt" or to "Match Line Items", depending on what was resolved.

But to keep it simple, perhaps back to "Verify PO Match and Confirm Receipt".

Also, when Dan handles discrepancies, he may contact supplier directly (Karen's role), so the "Contact Supplier via Karen" activity is part of resolving.

Now, the textual model should clearly outline each step with roles, gateways, and flows.

Let me structure it step by step as per the instructions.

Also, note that Rita's role is to handle escalations, so when Mary escalates to her, she resolves and then the process continues.

So the final model should be:

- Start with "Invoice Received"

- Check PO existence

- Log into system

- Forward to Purchasing

- Verify PO match and receipt

- If correct, match line items

- Then manager approval

- Schedule payment

- Exceptions handled via escalations and supplier involvement.

Now, writing the textual description.

#### **Key Notes on Ambiguities & Consolidation**  
- **PO Verification**: Mary states she forwards to Purchasing to "confirm receipt," while Dan says he "checks invoice details against PO." The model assumes Purchasing verifies both receipt *and* PO alignment (Step 5), as Dan’s description includes price/quantity checks.  
- **Line Item Matching**: Mary explicitly states she performs this step after Purchasing confirmation (Step 6), though Dan’s role overlaps. The model treats this as a separate verification by Mary to align with her account.  
- **Non-PO Invoices**: Rita handles these via retrospective PO creation (Step 10), as confirmed by her interview. Karen supports supplier-related issues but does not directly modify the system.  
- **Escalation Logic**:  
  - Mary escalates unresolved issues to Rita (Step 10), not directly to Karen. Karen is only engaged via Rita or Dan for supplier coordination.  
  - If discrepancies are resolved at Purchasing level (e.g., Dan contacts supplier), the process loops back to Step 5 without Rita involvement.  
- **Rejection Handling**: Carlos’ rejection loops back to earlier steps (Step 5 or 6), as he may need re-verification of PO/receipt or line items.  
- **Payment Scheduling**: Only occurs after manager approval; Rita does not schedule payments but resolves blockers.  

---

#### **Visualizable Structure Summary**  
- **Gateways**: 5 decision points (PO exists? Correct? Match confirmed? Resolved? Approved?).  
- **Roles**: Clear handoffs between Mary (AP), Dan (Purchasing), Carlos (Manager), Rita (Supervisor), and Karen (Supplier Liaison).  
- **Exceptions**: Explicit paths for PO missing, pricing issues, and manager rejections.  
- **Artifacts**: Invoice, PO, and system logs flow through all steps.  
- **Loopbacks**: Re-work loops for supplier corrections (e.g., PO missing  request PO  re-check) and escalations (e.g., Rita resolves  re-verify PO).  

This model consolidates all interviews, resolves conflicts via consensus (e.g., Purchasing handles PO/price checks, Mary handles system matching), and notes ambiguities (e.g., "Confirm receipt" vs. "PO verification" overlap) while maintaining logical coherence for BPMN diagram conversion.
