The concept of "event abstraction" can be used effectively to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs. Event abstraction involves simplifying the details of individual events to create a more generalized and abstract representation of the process. This can provide a high-level overview of the process and help in better understanding its behavior and characteristics.

Here are some ways event abstraction can be used:

1. Summarizing Event Data: Event abstraction can involve summarizing event data to create a more concise representation of the process. For example, instead of including detailed information about each individual task or activity, you can abstract the event to represent the overall process flow. This can help in understanding the process more quickly and easily.

2. Identifying Similar Events: Event abstraction can also involve identifying similar events and grouping them together. This can help in simplifying complex event logs and reducing the number of distinct events.

3. Focusing on Key Events: By abstracting the event, you can focus on the key events that are crucial for the process flow. This can help in understanding the critical aspects of the process and making informed decisions about process optimization or improvement.

4. Communicating Processes: Abstracted events can be used to communicate process models to stakeholders who may not be familiar with the technical details of the process. This can help in ensuring the process is understood and managed effectively.

By effectively using event abstraction, you can create a more manageable and readable representation of complex process models, making it easier to understand, analyze, and improve them.
