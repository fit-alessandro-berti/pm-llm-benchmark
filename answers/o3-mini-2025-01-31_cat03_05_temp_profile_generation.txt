Below is one example of a Python dictionary that captures a representative, estimated temporal profile for our global supply chain process. In this example the keys denote pairs of activities (even if not directly adjacent in a trace) and the values are tuples with estimated average delays (in seconds) and associated standard deviations. (Interpret the numbers as rough estimates based on typical delays in the process.) You can always adjust these numbers to suit your specific process details.

For instance, consider this dictionary:

------------------------------------------------------------
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct sequential steps
    ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 14400),    # Supplier Selection  Order Placement (avg ~2 days, ±4 hours)
    ('OP', 'RC'): (259200, 43200),    # Order Placement  Receive Components (avg ~3 days, ±12 hours)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 7200),      # Receive Components  Quality Inspection (avg ~1 day, ±2 hours)
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 3600),      # Quality Inspection  Component Assembly (avg ~12 hours, ±1 hour)
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 10800),     # Component Assembly  Product Testing (avg ~1 day, ±3 hours)
    ('PT', 'PK'): (43200, 7200),      # Product Testing  Packaging (avg ~12 hours, ±2 hours)
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 3600),      # Packaging  Warehouse Storage (avg ~6 hours, ±1 hour)
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),     # Warehouse Storage  Distribution (avg ~1 day, ±4 hours)
    ('DT', 'AS'): (172800, 28800),    # Distribution  After-Sales Support (avg ~2 days, ±8 hours)
    
    # Steps skipped over one or more intervening activities
    ('SS', 'RC'): (432000, 57600),    # From Supplier Selection to Receive Components (avg ~5 days)
    ('OP', 'QI'): (345600, 15000),    # From Order Placement to Quality Inspection (avg ~4 days)
    ('QI', 'PT'): (129600, 18000),    # From Quality Inspection to Product Testing (avg ~1.5 days)
    ('SS', 'PT'): (648000, 30000),    # From Supplier Selection to Product Testing (avg ~7.5 days)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (151200, 14400),    # From Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage (avg ~1.75 days)
    ('PT', 'DT'): (151200, 25200),    # From Product Testing to Distribution (avg ~1.75 days)
    
    # Overall end-to-end delay from the start to the very last activity
    ('SS', 'AS'): (972000, 50000)     # From Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support (avg ~11.25 days)
}
------------------------------------------------------------

How this dictionary was built:
• The keys include both immediate pairs (e.g. ('SS', 'OP')) and pairs that are separated by one or more intermediate activities (such as ('SS', 'RC') or ('SS', 'AS')).
• The numbers (all in seconds) give estimated average times as well as standard deviations.
  – For example, ('SS', 'OP'): (172800, 14400) represents an average delay of 172800 seconds (2 days) with a variability of about 14400 seconds (4 hours).
• Such a temporal profile is useful when checking each process execution (trace) for deviations beyond (AVG ± ZETA * STDDEV).

Feel free to modify or extend this dictionary further to capture additional or refined relationships between events in your process log.
