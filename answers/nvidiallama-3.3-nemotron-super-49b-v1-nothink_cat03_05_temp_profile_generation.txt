### Temporal Profile Dictionary for Global Supply Chain Process

Below is a constructed Python dictionary representing a simplified temporal profile for a subset of activity pairs in the described global supply chain process. **Note:** The average times and standard deviations are **estimates** based on general assumptions about supply chain operations and may vary widely depending on the actual process specifics (e.g., industry, location, technology level). Times are in **seconds** for consistency, though in practice, larger units (e.g., hours, days) might be more readable for these scales.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Direct Sequence Pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),  # 1 day avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 86400),  # 14 days avg, 1 day stdev (typical supplier lead time)
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 720),  # 1 hour avg, 12 minutes stdev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 1800),  # 2 hours avg, 30 minutes stdev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 7200),  # 6 hours avg, 2 hours stdev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 720),  # 1 hour avg, 12 minutes stdev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 360),  # 30 minutes avg, 6 minutes stdev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),  # 1 day avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 86400),  # 1 week avg, 1 day stdev (before support might be needed)
    
    # Pairs Separated by Multiple Steps (for complexity)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1296000, 172800),  # ~15 days avg (SS to OP to RC), 2 days stdev
    ('OP', 'CA'): (259200, 86400),  # ~3 days avg (OP to RC to QI to CA), 1 day stdev
    ('QI', 'PK'): (32400, 10800),  # 9 hours avg (QI to CA to PT to PK), 3 hours stdev
    ('CA', 'WS'): (50400, 18000),  # 14 hours avg (CA to PT to PK to WS), 5 hours stdev
    ('PK', 'AS'): (691200, 172800),  # ~8 days avg (PK to WS to DT to AS), 2 days stdev
}
```

### Key Assumptions Behind the Estimates:

- **Supplier Lead Times (OP to RC)**: Reflects a typical long lead time for component procurement.
- **Manufacturing and Testing Phases**: Assume a mix of labor-intensive and automated processes, influencing the average times and variability.
- **Warehousing and Distribution**: Logistics efficiency and geographic distances heavily influence these times.
- **After-Sales Support Activation**: Assumes a delay before support is typically required post-distribution.

### How to Interpret and Adjust:

| **Activity Pair** | **Average Time (Seconds)** | **Standard Deviation (Seconds)** | **Assumption Rationale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

| **('SS', 'OP')** | 86400 (1 day) | 14400 (4 hours) | Typical administrative processing time |
| **('OP', 'RC')** | 1209600 (14 days) | 86400 (1 day) | Standard supplier lead time for components |
| **...** | ... | ... | ... |

### To Adjust for Your Specific Scenario:

1. **Review Each Pair's Rationale**: Understand the assumption behind each estimate.
2. **Adjust Based on Known Metrics**: If you have historical data, replace the estimates with your actual averages and standard deviations.
3. **Scale for Process Efficiency/Inefficiency**: 
   - **Efficient Processes**: Reduce average times and standard deviations.
   - **Inefficient Processes**: Increase both, especially standard deviations to reflect higher variability.
4. **Consider External Factors**:
   - **Geographic Distance**: Longer distances (e.g., international shipping) increase average times and variability.
   - **Technology and Automation**: Can significantly reduce average times and standard deviations in manufacturing and logistics.
   - **Seasonal Variability**: Might increase standard deviations for activities sensitive to seasonal changes (e.g., holiday shipping surges).
