Anomalies Identified  
• Out-of-order processing  
  – Case 1002: “Confirm Shipment” (08:25) and “Ship Goods” (08:40) occur before “Perform Credit Check” (09:10) and “Validate Stock” (09:15), suggesting premature shipment.  
  – Case 1003: “Ship Goods” (09:10) precedes “Confirm Shipment” (09:45), and “Validate Stock” is entirely missing.  
• Missing activities  
  – Case 1003: no “Validate Stock” event.  
  – Case 1004: no “Perform Credit Check” or “Validate Stock” logged at all.  
• Invoice/payment sequencing issues  
  – Case 1004: “Receive Payment” (09:05) happens before “Issue Invoice” (09:20).  
• Extreme compression of steps  
  – Case 1004: payment received just five minutes after order registration, indicating possible process misuse or system mis-timestamping.  

Hypotheses for Anomalies  
• System or logging errors  
  – Timestamp mis-ordering due to asynchronous logging or clock skew on resource machines.  
• Policy violations or manual overrides  
  – Warehouse or logistics staff expediting shipments without proper credit check/stock validation, possibly to meet service-level agreements or due to pressure on sales.  
• Training gaps  
  – Some resources (e.g., LogisticsMgr_2, WarehouseClerk_3) may be unaware of mandatory stock validation steps.  
• Process-engine misconfiguration  
  – Automated workflows not enforcing strict preconditions, allowing certain activities to bypass gates.  
• High-value or priority orders  
  – Priority orders (e.g., case 1002) might be intentionally expedited, but lack of explicit flags in the log makes it hard to distinguish.  

Proposed SQL Queries to Investigate Further  

1. Detect cases where “Ship Goods” occurs before “Perform Credit Check”  
```sql
SELECT el_ship.case_id,
       el_ship.timestamp AS ship_time,
       el_credit.timestamp AS credit_time
FROM order_event_log el_ship
JOIN order_event_log el_credit
  ON el_ship.case_id = el_credit.case_id
WHERE el_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND el_credit.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  AND el_ship.timestamp < el_credit.timestamp;
```  

2. Find cases missing “Validate Stock” entirely  
```sql
SELECT case_id
FROM order_event_log
GROUP BY case_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;
```  

3. Identify cases where payment is received before invoice issuance  
```sql
SELECT pay.case_id,
       pay.timestamp AS payment_time,
       inv.timestamp AS invoice_time
FROM order_event_log pay
JOIN order_event_log inv
  ON pay.case_id = inv.case_id
WHERE pay.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND inv.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND pay.timestamp < inv.timestamp;
```  

4. List all cases with out-of-order key steps (using window functions)  
```sql
WITH sequenced AS (
  SELECT case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT s1.case_id,
       s1.seq_num AS seq1, s1.activity AS act1,
       s2.seq_num AS seq2, s2.activity AS act2
FROM sequenced s1
JOIN sequenced s2
  ON s1.case_id = s2.case_id
WHERE s1.seq_num < s2.seq_num
  -- define an undesirable order, e.g., ship before credit check
  AND s1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND s2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check';
```  

5. Correlate anomalies with order types and values  
```sql
SELECT o.order_type,
       o.order_value,
       COUNT(DISTINCT el.case_id) AS anomaly_cases
FROM order_event_log el
JOIN orders o
  ON el.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE el.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log el2
    WHERE el2.case_id = el.case_id
      AND el2.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
      AND el.timestamp < el2.timestamp
  )
GROUP BY o.order_type, o.order_value
ORDER BY anomaly_cases DESC;
```  

6. Identify resources most frequently involved in premature shipments  
```sql
SELECT r.resource_id,
       r.role,
       COUNT(*) AS premature_ship_count
FROM order_event_log el_ship
JOIN order_event_log el_credit
  ON el_ship.case_id = el_credit.case_id
JOIN resources r
  ON el_ship.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE el_ship.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND el_credit.activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
  AND el_ship.timestamp < el_credit.timestamp
GROUP BY r.resource_id, r.role
ORDER BY premature_ship_count DESC;
```  

7. Measure average time between “Register Order” and “Perform Credit Check” to flag outliers  
```sql
SELECT case_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (credit.timestamp - reg.timestamp))/60 AS minutes_to_credit
FROM (
  SELECT case_id, timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Register Order'
) reg
JOIN (
  SELECT case_id, timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check'
) credit
  ON reg.case_id = credit.case_id
ORDER BY minutes_to_credit DESC
LIMIT 10;  -- top 10 slowest cases
```  

These queries will help you pinpoint which orders and which resources are driving the anomalies, assess the scope of missing or out-of-sequence steps, and explore correlations with order characteristics. From there, you can drill down into specific cases or resources for root-cause analysis and remedial action.
