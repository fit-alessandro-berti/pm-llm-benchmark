Based on the declarative constraints provided, it is possible to describe the underlying process as follows:

The process begins with an employee submitting a declaration, which can occur between 0 and 7 times, as specified by the 'Activity Occurrences' constraint for 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. After the declaration is submitted, it goes through a series of approvals, rejections, and other actions by various roles, including administration, supervisor, pre-approver, budget owner, and missing information. The 'Equivalence' constraints suggest that there are different paths that the declaration can take, depending on the outcome of each step.

For example, if the declaration is approved by the administration, it can lead to one of several outcomes, such as being approved by the pre-approver, being rejected by the supervisor, being rejected by the budget owner, or being saved by the employee. Similarly, if the declaration is rejected by the administration, it can lead to being saved by the employee or rejected by the missing information.

The 'Always Before' constraints specify the order in which some activities must occur. For instance, the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' must always occur before the 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING', and the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' must always occur before the 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.

The 'Always After' constraints indicate that certain activities must occur immediately after others. For instance, the 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING' must always occur immediately after the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER', and the 'Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE' must always occur immediately after the 'Payment Handled'.

The 'Never Together' constraints specify that some activities cannot co-exist within the same case. For example, the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR' cannot occur at the same time as the 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION', and the 'Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER' cannot occur at the same time as the 'Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER'.

Finally, the 'Directly-Follows' constraints specify the order in which certain activities must follow each other. For example, the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION' must always be immediately followed by the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', and the 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER' must always be immediately followed by the 'Declaration REJECTED by MISSING'.

Overall, the process appears to involve a series of approvals, rejections, and other actions related to a declaration, with various paths and outcomes depending on the outcome of each step. The declarative constraints provide a framework for understanding the possible sequences and combinations of activities that can occur in the process.
