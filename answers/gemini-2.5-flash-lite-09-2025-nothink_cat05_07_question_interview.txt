Here is a list of targeted, open-ended questions designed to clarify and deepen understanding of the described property onboarding process:

### Questions Regarding Documentation and Initial Review

1.  When the Property Coordinator requests updates for missing or outdated documentation, what is the standard timeframe or deadline given to the landlord to provide those items, and what happens if that deadline is missed?
2.  Could you elaborate on the criteria used to judge whether a recent inspection report is "acceptable" during the initial review, versus triggering a mandatory new inspection by your company?
3.  What specific internal controls ensure that the square footage, unit count, and amenities recorded in the central database accurately reflect the property’s physical reality *before* the official inspection?

### Questions Regarding Manager Assignment and Alignment

4.  Regarding the assignment of a Property Manager, what is the hierarchy or weighting of the factors you mentioned (workload, specialization, experience, unique requirements)? Is workload always the primary driver, or does specialization take precedence for complex properties?
5.  During the introductory meeting between the Property Manager and the landlord, what is the key deliverable or documented agreement that signifies a successful expectation alignment?
6.  If a landlord insists on a custom lease clause that conflicts with standard company policy (e.g., non-standard payment channels), at what level within the management structure is the final authorization required to approve that exception?

### Questions Regarding Physical Preparation and Marketing

7.  When the inspector identifies issues, what is the typical escalation path if the landlord is slow to authorize or finance the necessary repairs? Is there a point where the property onboarding is paused indefinitely?
8.  How is the feedback loop structured between the Marketing team (after seeing the initial photos/data) and the Property Manager to ensure the advertised rental price range is realistic before the listing goes live?
9.  What key performance indicators (KPIs) does the digital marketing team use to determine when a property listing is sufficiently optimized and ready to be "activated" in the rental portal?

### Questions Regarding Tenant Screening and Selection

10. Beyond credit checks and employment verification, what specific qualitative benchmarks are used when contacting previous landlords for references, and what would constitute a "red flag" reference that would automatically disqualify an applicant?
11. When negotiating lease terms or considering promotional discounts, what parameters or financial thresholds guide the Property Manager on how far they can deviate from the initial pricing model?
12. If you have multiple qualified tenants interested, what is the defined, documented tie-breaker procedure that the leasing agent or Property Manager must follow to ensure fairness and compliance?

### Questions Regarding Finalization and Quality Checks

13. Who is ultimately responsible for signing off that all required quality checks (compliance, financial, IT integration) have been completed, and how is this sign-off formally documented?
14. Could you describe a common scenario where the Compliance Officer flags a lease agreement, and what the standardized corrective action process is for remedying that specific issue?
15. Considering the blend of communication tools (email, CRM, project management), what is the single source of truth or the primary system used to confirm the *final, approved* state of the property onboarding record?
