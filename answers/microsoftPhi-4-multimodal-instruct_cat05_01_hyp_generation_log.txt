### Identified Anomalies and Hypotheses with SQL Queries

#### Anomaly 1: Late Confirmation on Incomplete Processes (Case ID 1003)
- **Observation:** At timestamp 2024-02-01 09:45:00, a 'Confirm Shipment' activity is recorded, but at timestamp 2024-02-02 11:00:00, a 'Receive Payment' activity is recorded. There could be a disconnect in completing the confirmation process.
- **Hypothesis:** The 'Confirm Shipment' might take too long due to staff overload or process inefficiencies. Additionally, an anomaly might occur if payment was received due to a clerical error before the confirmation was officially logged.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e.case_id, e.event_id, e.timestamp, e.activity, o.order_value, r.role, r.department
  FROM order_event_log e
  JOIN orders o ON e.case_id = o.case_id
  JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
  WHERE e.case_id = 1003
  ORDER BY e.timestamp;
  ```

#### Anomaly 2: Early Shipment Attempt with No Complete Process (Case ID 1002)
- **Observation:** At timestamp 2024-02-01 08:25:00, a 'Confirm Shipment' activity is recorded. The ship_goods activity is logged at 2024-02-01 08:40:00 in the same case, suggesting the initial attempt.
- **Hypothesis:** The confirmation of shipment could be conflicting with an early execution attempt. Possible reasons could be errors or different system parts wrongly syncing.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e.case_id, e.event_id, e.timestamp, e.activity, r.role, r.department
  FROM order_event_log e
  JOIN resources r ON e.resource = r.resource_id
  WHERE e.case_id = 1002
  ORDER BY e.timestamp;
  ```

#### Anomaly 3: Unlogged Service Step for Case ID 1003 (Missing 'Analyze Order')
- **Observation:** It appears that for Case ID 1003, there is no record of an 'Analyze Order' activity after registration. In the standard process, there should be an 'Analyze Order' before moving to 'Perform Credit Check' or subsequent activities.
- **Hypothesis:** There might be documentation errors, or pre-requisites for this step were not logged. It may also indicate that the staff skipped a step due to urgency or oversight.
- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e.case_id, e.event_id, e.timestamp, e.activity, o.order_value, r.role, r.department
  FROM order_event_log e
  JOIN orders o ON e.case_id = o.case_id
  CROSS JOIN resources r
  WHERE e.case_id = 1003;
  ```

- **Following SQL Query to Detect Missing Activity:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 'Analyze Order' AS expected_activity, o.case_id, o.customer_id, o.order_type, e.resource, e.timestamp as appeared_when, NULL AS expected_when
  FROM orders o
  WHERE o.case_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003)
  UNION
  SELECT e.activity AS recorded_activity, o.case_id, o.order_type, r.role, e.timestamp AS appeared_when, e.timestamp AS appeared_when
  FROM order_event_log e
  JOIN orders o ON e.case_id = o.case_id
  CROSS JOIN resources r
  WHERE e.case_id IN (1001, 1002, 1003)
  GROUP BY o.case_id, expected_activity, o.order_type, r.role, e.activity, e.timestamp
  HAVING NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_event_log as e2
    WHERE e2.case_id = e.case_id AND e2.activity = 'Analyze Order' AND e2.activity IS NOT NULL
  );
  ```

These queries aim to identify gaps or sequence issues in the provided event logs and also ensure that the activities reflect the hypothesized behavioral patterns or discrepancies. The results from these queries should help root down and address the anomalies effectively.
