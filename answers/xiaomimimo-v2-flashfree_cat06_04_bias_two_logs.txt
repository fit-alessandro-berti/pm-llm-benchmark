Based on a comparative analysis of the two event logs, **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias.**

Here is the detailed explanation of how this bias manifests, considering the attributes and columns provided:

### 1. The Mechanism of Bias: ScoreAdjustment
The primary driver of bias is the **ScoreAdjustment** column. While Group A consistently has a `0` adjustment, Group B has a specific pattern:
*   **Group A:** PreliminaryScore remains unchanged throughout the process (e.g., P001 stays at 720).
*   **Group B:** Applicants with a `CommunityGroup` (Highland Civic Darts Club) receive a `+10 (Community Boost)` adjustment. This transforms their score (e.g., U003 goes from 695 to 705) and changes the outcome.

### 2. Manifestation in Decision Outcomes
The bias is evident when comparing applicants with similar base scores:
*   **The "720" Applicant:**
    *   **Protected (P001):** Score 720 $\rightarrow$ Approved.
    *   **Unprotected (U001):** Score 720 $\rightarrow$ Boosted to 730 $\rightarrow$ Approved.
    *   *Analysis:* While the outcome is the same here, U001 received an unearned score increase.
*   **The "710" Applicant:**
    *   **Protected (P002):** Score 710 $\rightarrow$ Rejected.
    *   **Unprotected (U002):** Score 710 $\rightarrow$ No Boost $\rightarrow$ Rejected.
    *   *Analysis:* U002 was treated consistently with Group A, but only because they lacked the "CommunityGroup" attribute.
*   **The Critical "695" Applicant (Proof of Bias):**
    *   **Unprotected (U003):** Base Score 695 $\rightarrow$ Boosted to 705 $\rightarrow$ **Approved**.
    *   *Analysis:* This applicant would likely have been rejected (like P002 with a 710) without the "+10" boost. The boost artificially pushed this applicant over a decision threshold that the Protected Group is held to.

### 3. The Role of LocalResident and CommunityGroup
In this specific dataset, these attributes act as **proxies for special treatment** rather than merit:
*   **Correlation:** The bias does not stem from being a local resident (TRUE/FALSE) alone. In **U002**, the user is a `LocalResident: TRUE` but receives `0` adjustment because they have `CommunityGroup: None`.
*   **The Trigger:** The bias is triggered specifically by the **CommunityGroup** attribute.
*   **Systemic Impact:** The system is programmed to give preferential treatment to members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" (the unprotected group in this dataset) by artificially inflating their scores, thereby lowering the bar for their approval.

### Conclusion
**Group B is biased** because the scoring engine applies a "Community Boost" that is not available to Group A. This creates a systematic advantage where Group B applicants can be approved with lower base scores (e.g., 695) than applicants in Group A (who are rejected at 710).
