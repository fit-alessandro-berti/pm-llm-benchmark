Certainly! To achieve the task of filtering out cases containing more than six events and returning only the events from cases that have six or fewer events, you can use the following DuckDB SQL query:

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    event_counts ec
ON
    e.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE
    ec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `event_counts`:**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the events and counting the number of rows per `case_id`.

2. **Main Query:**
   - The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table.
   - It performs an inner join with the `event_counts` CTE on the `case_id` to ensure that only the cases with six or fewer events are included.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters out any cases where the event count is greater than six.

This query effectively filters out the cases with more than six events and returns the full set of events for the remaining cases.
