----------------------------------------------------------------
1.  ANALYZING HISTORICAL SCHEDULING PERFORMANCE AND DYNAMICS  
----------------------------------------------------------------
1.1  Preparing the event log  
• Extract the past-year MES log into the standard process-mining format (CSV/XES) with the following mappings:  
  – Case ID = Job ID (JOB-####).  
  – Activity = Task state (“Setup Start”, “Task End - Milling”, …).  
  – Timestamp = Timestamp column.  
  – Resource = Machine ID or “Operator - <id>”.  
  – Lifecycle transition = Start / Complete.  
• Add derived attributes during ETL: “Setup Flag”, “Task Family” (feature for sequence analysis), “Planned_Duration”, “Due Date”, “Priority”.

1.2  Reconstructing the real flow of work  
Technique: Discovery + performance overlays in ProM / PM4Py.  
• Use Heuristic Miner (frequency-based) to discover the general routing network.  
• Use Transition System Miner or the “Inductive Visual Miner” to see the *exact* path of every case, highlighting re-work loops.  
• Create *per-machine* event logs (filter on Resource).  The timeline view immediately shows the exact execution sequence on each machine.

1.3  Metrics and analyses  
a) Job flow-time & lead-time distributions  
   – Compute per-case: Release  Final Task End.  Visualize with violin/box plots; calculate mean, p90, and coefficient-of-variation (CV).  
b) Waiting (queue) time per task  
   – Waiting = TaskStart – QueueEntry.  Conformance extension “Performance Spectrum” plots wait vs. process time for each activity.  
c) Resource utilization  
   – For each machine: productive = (Task durations), setup = (Setup durations), idle = calendar time – productive – setup – breakdown.  
   – Overlay Gantt-like plots (“Timeline analysis”) to spot starvation periods.  
d) Sequence-dependent setup analysis  
   – From the per-machine log, build an n × n setup-time matrix S(i,j) where i = previous job’s *task family* and j = current family.  Average the “Setup End – Setup Start” whenever the (i,j) transition appears.  Heat-map the matrix to find costly switches.  
e) Schedule-adherence / tardiness  
   – Tardiness = max(0, Completion  DueDate).  Add this as a case-level attribute.  Variant analysis splits on “On-time” vs. “Late” to reveal path differences.  
f) Impact of disruptions  
   – Create a separate “Breakdown” event log; join on overlapping time windows to mark every task that overlapped with a breakdown.  Compare KPIs for “affected” vs. “not affected” tasks.  
   – Likewise, tag “Priority-Change” events and measure the delta in remaining flow-time after the change.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  DIAGNOSING THE SCHEDULING PATHOLOGIES
-------------------------------------------------
Evidence generated with the above analyses typically shows:

• Bottleneck machines: e.g., MILL-03 shows > 85 % load, queue lengths > 6 jobs, and contributes > 70 % of total lateness ripple (bottleneck analysis plug-in).  
• Poor prioritization: “High” priority jobs share the **same median wait** as “Low” jobs; variant view shows they simply join the tail of FCFS queues.  
• Setup inflation: Setup-time matrix reveals that the actual average setup after family-switch *A  B* is 42 min versus 18 min for *A  A*, yet current sequencing causes 58 % family switches at CUT-01.  
• Starvation: Gantt overlay highlights that GRIND-02 is idle 28 % of the time immediately after long queues upstream at HEAT-TREAT-01.  
• Bullwhip in WIP: The “WIP over time” chart shows oscillations of 40–120 pieces; spectral analysis links spikes to periods when breakdowns at MILL-02 forced upstream dispatching to send jobs to secondary routings, overloading CUT-02.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------
1.  Static, single-queue dispatch rules (FCFS/EDD) ignore:  
    • Actual remaining processing time (varies by job),  
    • Sequence-dependent setup penalties,  
    • Downstream congestion.

2.  Visibility gap  
    – Planners do not see real-time machine states; decisions made in Excel each morning become obsolete within hours.

3.  Data/model inaccuracies  
    – Planned durations for Milling tasks are underestimated by 18 % on average; conformance checking shows systematic positive drift.

4.  No formal handling of setups  
    – Current rule “start the next job in queue” causes costly alternations of cutting fluid, fixtures, and tool pallets.

5.  Disruption response  
    – Breakdowns trigger manual phone calls and “first available machine” decisions that ignore the global impact.

Process mining distinguishes:  
• Capacity limits  identified when even an *optimal* sequencing (simulated) shows high utilization and long queues.  
• Scheduling logic problems  when simulated “what-if” scenarios with the *same resources* but smarter sequencing show large KPI gains.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  ADVANCED DATA-DRIVEN SCHEDULING STRATEGIES
-------------------------------------------------
STRATEGY 1 – Dynamic Multi-Attribute Dispatching (Enhanced ATCS-DL)  
Core logic: Extend the classical “Apparent Tardiness Cost with Setups” (ATCS) rule with Downstream Load (DL).  
   Priority index =  exp(–d_i/)  * (w_i / p_i)  * exp(– s_ij / )  * exp(– L_down / )  
   where d_i = time remaining to due date, p_i = remaining processing time, w_i = priority weight, s_ij = expected setup if current machine last processed family j, and L_down = estimated queue at the job’s next machine (from real-time MES).  
How mining feeds it:  
   – , ,  calibrated on one-year history via regression to minimize tardiness.  
Addresses: tardiness, poor prioritization, setup inflation, starvation.  
Expected impact (simulated): 25–35 % lateness reduction; WIP cut 15 %.

STRATEGY 2 – Predictive, Proactive Finite-Capacity Scheduling  
Core elements:  
1.  Stochastic task-time models: For each (Machine, Part-family, Operator) triple, fit a log-normal or Johnson distribution mined from the event log.  
2.  Breakdown risk: Use survival models on historical MTBF/MTTR to assign probability-of-failure curves for each machine; if P(fail within next shift) > x %, schedule preventive slot.  
3.  Rolling-horizon optimizer: Every 2 h, run a time-indexed MIP (or a Constraint Programming model) with the stochastic durations represented by *p-tau* safety factors.  Objective: minimize expected total weighted tardiness + expected setup costs.  
Addresses: inaccurate planning, lack of visibility, disruption response.  
Expected impact: 40 % reduction in schedule revisions, 20 % better due-date promise accuracy (95 % CI within ±4 h).

STRATEGY 3 – Setup-Time-Aware Sequencing & Batching at Bottlenecks  
Step 1: Use the mined setup-cost matrix S(i,j) to cluster *part families* into similarity groups (hierarchical clustering on setup penalty).  
Step 2: For CUT-01 and MILL-03 (top setup-sensitive machines), daily construct a sequence by solving a Travelling-Salesman-Problem variant where distance = expected setup time; impose due-date “release windows” to avoid excessive lateness.  Heuristic: GRASP + 2-opt.  
Step 3: For non-urgent jobs within ±2 days due-date tolerance, create micro-batches of 2–4 jobs of the same family so they flow together through the bottleneck.  
Addresses: sequence-dependent setups, WIP oscillations.  
Expected impact: 35–50 % reduction in total setup minutes on targeted machines; throughput up 8 %.

5.  SIMULATION, EVALUATION & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
-------------------------------------------------
5.1  Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)  
• Engine: SimPy or commercial package (AnyLogic/FlexSim).  
• Input parameters:  
   – Routing table and branching probabilities mined from actual variants.  
   – Task-time distributions & setup-time matrix from Section 1.3.  
   – Breakdown process: Non-homogeneous Poisson calibrated to historical MTBF seasonality.  
• Scenarios to test:  
   1.  Normal load (mean weekly release rate).  
   2.  Peak season (+30 % jobs).  
   3.  High disruption (double breakdown frequency + two hot jobs/day).  
Measures: lateness distribution, average WIP, 95 % lead-time, machine utilization.  Use 30 replications; compare means with ANOVA and 95 % CIs.

5.2  Continuous monitoring & adaptation  
• Deploy streaming process-mining pipeline (e.g., PM4Py-Streaming + Kafka).  
   – Real-time KPI dashboards (lateness, WIP, setup minutes, OEE).  
   – Drift detection: SPLICE or ADWIN on flow-time series; trigger re-calibration of ,, in Strategy 1 or re-fitting of duration distributions in Strategy 2.  
• Closed-loop improvement cycle every month:  
   1.  Mine new data  detect new patterns/bottlenecks.  
   2.  If deviations > threshold, auto-regenerate optimized dispatch parameter set or resequence high-setup machines.  
   3.  Push updated rule set to MES scheduler via API.

Conclusion  
Process-mining provides both the x-ray (fact-based diagnosis) and the fuel (quantitative inputs) for building advanced, adaptive scheduling at Precision Parts Inc. The three proposed strategies attack tardiness, excess WIP, and setup waste from complementary angles; DES shows their expected gains before risking shop-floor disruption, while a streaming-mining loop keeps performance from drifting in the future.
