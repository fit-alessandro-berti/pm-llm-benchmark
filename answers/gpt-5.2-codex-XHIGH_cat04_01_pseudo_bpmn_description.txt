Below is a clear, stepbystep explanation of what the pseudoBPMN describes, including each task’s purpose, the gateway logic, how paths converge, and when approval or rework happens.

##  Overall Business Process Summary
The process models how a company handles a customer request. It begins with receiving a request, branches depending on whether the request is **standard** or **custom**, performs the necessary checks and calculations, may require management approval, and ends by confirming the final order to the customer.  

---

## 1. **Start Event  Task A: “Receive Customer Request”**
**Purpose:**  
The process begins when a customer submits a request (order, quotation request, etc.). The company captures and logs it.

---

## 2. **Gateway (XOR): “Check Request Type”**
**Meaning of XOR:** Only one path is taken.  
The request is classified as **Standard** or **Custom**.

---

##  If **Standard Request**
### **Task B1: Perform Standard Validation**
Checks basic completeness and correctness (e.g., customer data, product availability rules).

### **Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks**
**Meaning of AND:** Split into **parallel** tasks that happen simultaneously.

- **Task C1: Credit Check**
- **Task C2: Inventory Check**

### **Join (AND Merge)**
Both checks must finish before continuing.

### **Task D: Calculate Delivery Date**
Determines the delivery schedule based on availability and credit status.

---

##  If **Custom Request**
### **Task B2: Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis**
Determines whether the customization is possible.

### **Gateway (XOR): “Is Customization Feasible?”**
Only one outcome:

- **Yes  Task E1: Prepare Custom Quotation**  
  Creates a tailored proposal with price and timeline.

- **No  Task E2: Send Rejection Notice  End Event**  
  If customization cannot be done, the process stops here.

---

## 3. **Convergence of Standard/Custom Paths**
After **Task D (Standard)** or **Task E1 (Custom)**, both paths join and continue together.

---

## 4. **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Needed?”**
Approval is required only for certain cases (e.g., high value, custom, unusual terms).

### **If No Approval Needed**
 **Task G: Generate Final Invoice**

### **If Approval Needed**
 **Task F: Obtain Manager Approval**

---

## 5. **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Granted?”**
- **Yes  Task G: Generate Final Invoice**
- **No  Task H: Reevaluate Conditions**

### **Loop Back Logic**
Reevaluation leads back to:
- **Task E1** for **Custom Requests**  
  (Revise quotation)
- **Task D** for **Standard Requests**  
  (Recalculate delivery date)

This creates a **feedback loop** until conditions are acceptable.

---

## 6. **Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer**
The finalized invoice and confirmed delivery/terms are sent to the customer.

---

##  End Event
Process ends after confirmation.

#  Key Gateway Meanings
| Gateway | Type | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| “Check Request Type” | XOR | Choose one path (standard OR custom) |
| “Run Parallel Checks” | AND | Run tasks in parallel |
| “Is Customization Feasible?” | XOR | Accept OR reject |
| “Is Approval Needed?” | XOR | Approval required OR not |
| “Is Approval Granted?” | XOR | Approved OR rework |

---

#  Standard vs Custom Differences
| Standard Requests | Custom Requests |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Validation + credit/inventory check | Feasibility analysis |
| Delivery date calculated | Custom quotation prepared |
| Typically faster, predictable | May be rejected if not feasible |

---

#  When Approvals/Rework Occur
**Approval is triggered** when business rules require it (e.g., high cost or customization).  
**Rework occurs** if approval is **denied**, forcing the company to revise the offer (custom) or delivery terms (standard).
