# Clarifying Questions for the Property Onboarding Process

## Documentation & Initial Review

1. When a landlord first contacts the regional office, is there a standardized checklist of required documents they are given upfront, or does the coordinator assess requirements on a case-by-case basis depending on the property type or location?

2. You mentioned that the coordinator requests updates if documents are missing or outdated — how long does the landlord typically have to provide those updates, and is there a point at which the process is formally paused or abandoned if they don't respond in time?

3. Are there meaningful differences in documentation requirements across the different cities you operate in, and if so, how do coordinators stay current with varying local housing regulations?

4. Who has the authority to make the final call that a landlord's documentation package is complete and acceptable — is that solely the coordinator's judgment, or does a supervisor or compliance officer sign off at this stage?

## Property Data Entry & Database Management

5. When the coordinator records property details into the central database, are there mandatory fields that must be completed before the record can be saved and the process advanced, or can the property move forward with partial information filled in later?

6. You mentioned that expected rental price range is recorded at this early stage — where does that initial estimate come from? Does the landlord propose it, does the coordinator derive it from market data, or is it a collaborative discussion?

7. How are updates or corrections to the property record handled after the initial entry — for example, if the inspector later discovers the square footage was recorded incorrectly?

## Property Manager Assignment

8. When you consider factors like workload, geographic specialization, and experience with similar property types, how are those factors weighted against one another? Is there a formal scoring or ranking system, or is the assignment largely a judgment call made by a supervisor?

9. Who actually makes the property manager assignment decision — is it a regional manager, a team lead, or is it more of a self-selection process where available managers claim new properties?

10. What happens if no available property manager has strong experience with a particular property type — for example, a luxury furnished unit in a market where you've rarely operated? Is there an escalation path or a mentorship arrangement?

11. You described an introductory meeting between the property manager and the landlord — is that meeting documented in any formal way, such as a written summary of agreed conditions, or does it primarily serve as a relationship-building conversation whose details live informally in the manager's memory?

---

## Inspection & Photography

12. How are the photographer and inspector sourced — are they employees of the company, preferred external vendors, or can the landlord bring their own? And does that distinction affect how their work is reviewed or accepted?

13. When the inspector identifies issues, who determines whether those issues are minor enough to address during onboarding versus serious enough to put the entire onboarding on hold? Is there a severity classification system?

14. In cases where repairs are needed, does the company coordinate and pay for contractors directly, or is the financial and logistical responsibility entirely the landlord's? And how does that affect the timeline?

15. Is there a maximum number of times a property can fail inspection before the company decides not to onboard it at all? Or is there no hard limit as long as the landlord keeps making improvements?

16. Does the photographer's visit always happen after the inspection is passed, or can photography happen in parallel while repair issues are being resolved?

---

## Marketing & Pricing

17. When the digital marketing team updates the internal pricing model based on market trends, how does that interact with the price range the landlord originally had in mind? Is there a negotiation if the two are significantly different, and who has the final say?

18. What does the process look like if a landlord disagrees with the company's recommended rental price — is there a formal review or appeal step, or can they simply override the recommendation?

19. How long does the marketing preparation phase typically take, and are there cases where a property is marketed before all the marketing materials are fully finalized?

20. Are listings created uniformly across all platforms and channels, or does the marketing team tailor the approach based on property type, target tenant demographic, or location?

---

## Tenant Screening & Leasing

21. You mentioned reviewing applications, running credit checks, verifying employment, and contacting previous landlords — does all of this happen sequentially, or are some of those steps run in parallel to reduce time?

22. Is there a standardized scoring or threshold system for evaluating tenant applications, or does the property manager exercise significant personal discretion in deciding who qualifies?

23. When multiple tenants are interested, you mentioned the possibility of promotional discounts or prioritizing longer lease commitments — who has the authority to approve those kinds of negotiations? Does the landlord need to be consulted, or can the property manager make those decisions independently?

24. How is the landlord involved, if at all, in the final tenant selection decision? Do they have veto power over a tenant the property manager has approved?

25. What happens if a tenant is approved, a lease is nearly finalized, and the tenant then withdraws — does the process restart from the beginning of tenant screening, or is there a backup candidate system in place?

---

## Compliance, Audits & Quality Checks

26. You described a compliance officer reviewing the lease for fair housing adherence — does this review happen before or after the tenant has signed the lease? If it happens after, what occurs if a violation is found at that point?

27. Are the compliance review, the financial analyst's pricing verification, and the IT integration check done sequentially or simultaneously? And is there a defined owner who tracks whether all three have been completed before the property is considered fully onboarded?

28. What does "fully onboarded" mean in your process — is there a specific sign-off event or milestone that officially closes the onboarding workflow, or does it fade into ongoing property management without a clear handoff moment?

---

## Exceptions & Edge Cases

29. You briefly mentioned properties requiring special insurance — can you walk me through what triggers that requirement, who identifies it, and how it changes the standard process flow?

30. When a landlord insists on custom lease clauses, who reviews and approves those clauses? Is there a library of pre-approved custom clauses, or does each one require fresh legal review?

31. How does the process differ, if at all, when a landlord is onboarding multiple properties at once — do they move through the workflow as a batch, or is each property treated as a completely independent process?

32. Have there been cases where a property made it far into the onboarding process — perhaps all the way to the marketing stage — before the company decided not to proceed? What caused that, and how was it handled?

---

## Communication, Tracking & Handoffs

33. You mentioned that communication is tracked across email, CRMs, and project management tools — is there a single system of record that is considered authoritative, or do different teams maintain their own records with periodic reconciliation?

34. When there is a handoff between teams — for example, from the coordinator to the property manager, or from the property manager to the leasing agent — how is that handoff formalized? Is there a briefing, a transferred ticket, or simply an email introduction?

35. How does the landlord stay informed about where their property is in the onboarding process? Is there a self-service portal, scheduled status updates, or do they need to reach out to ask?

36. What does the escalation path look like when something goes wrong — for instance, if a deadline is missed, a landlord becomes unresponsive, or two teams disagree on how to handle an exception? Who gets involved, and through what channel?

---

## Timing & Volume

37. From the moment a landlord first makes contact to the moment a tenant moves in, what does the typical end-to-end timeline look like? And what are the stages where the process most commonly gets delayed?

38. Are there seasonal patterns in how many properties are onboarded — for example, higher volumes at the start of the year or before academic semesters — and if so, how does the company adjust its capacity to handle those peaks?

39. Roughly how many properties are in various stages of onboarding at any given time, and does managing that volume create coordination challenges that are worth discussing?
