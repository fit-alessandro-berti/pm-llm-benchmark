Here is an example of a temporal profile for a Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): (86400, 7200),  # 1 day, 2 hours stdev
    ('Send Purchase Order', ' Receive Goods'): (1209600, 86400),  # 14 days, 1 day stdev
    ('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'): (86400, 7200),  # 1 day, 2 hours stdev
    ('Create Invoice', 'Verify Invoice'): (7200, 3600),  # 2 hours, 1 hour stdev
    ('Verify Invoice', 'Authorize Payment'): (3600, 1800),  # 1 hour, 30 minutes stdev
    ('Authorize Payment', 'Make Payment'): (28800, 14400),  # 8 hours, 4 hours stdev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): (1209600, 120960),  # 14 days, 2 days stdev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Create Invoice'): (2419200, 241920),  # 28 days, 4 days stdev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Authorize Payment'): (3024000, 302400),  # 35 days, 5 days stdev
    ('Create Purchase Order', 'Make Payment'): (3456000, 345600)  # 40 days, 6 days stdev
}
```

This temporal profile is based on a general outline of a Purchase-to-Pay process:

1. Creating a Purchase Order (PO)
2. Sending the PO to the supplier
3. Receiving the Goods
4. Creating an Invoice
5. Verifying the Invoice
6. Authorizing Payment
7. Making the Payment

The temporal profile assumes the following time intervals between these activities:

* The time between creating a PO and sending it to the supplier is usually short (1 day, with a standard deviation of 2 hours).
* The time between sending the PO and receiving the goods can take around 2 weeks (14 days, with a standard deviation of 1 day).
* The time between receiving the goods and creating an invoice is usually short (1 day, with a standard deviation of 2 hours).
* The time between creating an invoice and verifying it takes a few hours (2 hours,
