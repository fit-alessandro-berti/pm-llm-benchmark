## Process Mining Approach for Speedy Parcels Optimization

Here's a comprehensive approach to analyzing Speedy Parcels' operations using process mining, addressing the outlined points.

**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking:**

*   **Data Preprocessing and Integration:** The first challenge is combining data from disparate sources. This involves:
    *   **Schema Alignment:** Harmonizing data formats and field names across GPS, scanner, dispatch, and maintenance logs. This may require data cleaning and transformation.
    *   **Timestamp Alignment:** Ensuring timestamps are synchronized and using a common timezone.
    *   **Case ID Creation:** The "Vehicle-Day" (V12-20241205) approach is good but could be broadened to “Vehicle-Shift” to better isolate driver performance and be more responsive to shift changes.
    *   **Entity Resolution:** Linking events across systems using shared identifiers like Vehicle ID, Driver ID, and Package ID.  This will be critical to understand the full lifecycle of a delivery.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Converting categorical data (e.g., 'Activity Type' descriptions) into more structured categories suitable for process mining algorithms.

    Challenges:  Data quality inconsistencies (missing values, incorrect timestamps) will require careful handling. Integrating maintenance logs might be complex due to their irregular structure.  Ensuring correct linking of events across different systems (e.g., a driver scanning a package on the handheld matching the package assigned to a vehicle on the dispatch system) can be difficult and may require fuzzy matching techniques.

*   **Process Discovery:** I'd use a process discovery algorithm like the Heuristic Miner or ILP Miner. These algorithms build process models from event logs without prior knowledge of the process. The resulting models will visualize:
    *   **Typical Delivery Flow:** Starting from 'Driver Start Shift' and 'Vehicle Depart Depot', tracing the sequence of activities through customer visits, package scans, failed delivery attempts, and ultimately 'Vehicle Arrive Depot'.
    *   **Variations & Deviations:** Identifying different paths and process variants, such as routes with multiple failed delivery attempts or vehicles requiring unscheduled maintenance stops. We'll use filters (e.g. vehicle type, driver ID) to get more granular views.
    *   **Loops and Bottlenecks:** Highlighting loops and frequent activities, indicating potential bottlenecks.

*   **Conformance Checking:** I'd utilize conformance checking techniques:
    *   **Model Comparison:** Construct a "compliance model" from the dispatch system's planned routes and compare it to the discovered process model.
    *   **Deviation Detection:** Identify significant deviations from the planned routes, such as:
        *   **Sequence Deviations:** Unexpected activity order (e.g., delivering package 5 before package 2 when the planned route had the reverse order).
        *   **Unplanned Stops:**  Vehicle deviating from the planned route, potentially indicating traffic avoidance, unscheduled customer visits, or breakdowns.
        *   **Timing Differences:** Significant discrepancies between planned and actual durations of activities (e.g., unusually long customer interaction times).
        *   **Conformance Metrics:** Calculate conformance metrics (e.g., compliance, fitness) to quantify the extent of deviations.

**2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification:**

*   **KPI Definitions and Calculation:**
    *   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of packages delivered within the agreed-upon time window.  Calculated as (Successful Deliveries within Time Window) / (Total Successful Deliveries).
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Total delivery time divided by the number of successful delivery stops.
    *   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**  Travel time to customer locations compared to the time spent at each stop (scanning, delivery interaction).  High ratio suggests excessive travel or inefficient routing.
    *   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** Total fuel consumption (estimated from GPS data and vehicle characteristics) divided by total distance traveled and total packages delivered.
    *   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** Percentage of time vehicles are actively engaged in delivery activities versus idle or parked. Calculated from GPS data (ignition on, moving).
    *   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Identifying time intervals flagged as "Low Speed Detected" in GPS data and correlating them with location and time to estimate traffic impact.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:**  (Failed Deliveries / Total Deliveries) * 100%.

*   **Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**
    *   **Process Flow Analyzer:** Visually identify areas with high congestion and long queues.
    *   **Path Analysis:** Analyze the most frequent paths and pinpoint steps causing significant delays.
    *   **Time Analysis:** Utilize time analysis features in process mining tools to determine average duration of activities and identify outliers.
    *   **Variant Analysis:** Compare the performance of different delivery paths. Routes with consistently high failure rates or long durations likely indicate bottlenecks.
    *   **Statistical Correlation:** Correlate activities with KPIs to discover specific activities (e.g., parking, first deliveries of the day) that strongly affect performance.



**3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies:**

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning:** Static routes might not account for real-time traffic conditions.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:** Existing models might be based on historical averages and not reflect current traffic patterns or road conditions.
*   **Traffic Congestion:** Heavily impacted delivery times, especially during peak hours.
*   **High Service Time Variability:** Some customers take significantly longer to interact with, delaying subsequent deliveries.
*   **Vehicle Breakdowns:** Unscheduled maintenance events disrupt schedules and incur extra costs.
*   **Driver Behavior:** Aggressive driving habits or inefficient parking strategies can increase fuel consumption and delay deliveries.
*   **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Customer unavailability and inaccurate address information contribute to re-delivery needs.

*   **Process Mining Analyses for Root Cause Validation:**
    *   **Variant Analysis (Route vs. Performance):** Compare routes with high and low On-Time Delivery Rates. Identify common characteristics (e.g., routes traversing specific areas, time of day).
    *   **Correlation Analysis (Traffic Data vs. Delay):** Overlay GPS speed data with external traffic data to quantify the impact of congestion on delivery times.
    *   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Analyze the time spent at each customer location. Identify drivers or geographic areas with unusually high dwell times, indicating potential customer-specific issues or inefficient delivery practices.
    *   **Maintenance Event Analysis:** Analyze patterns of unscheduled stops related to vehicle warnings. Correlate these events with vehicle type, mileage, or driver.



**4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies:**

2.  **Optimized Delivery Territories & Route Sequences:**
    *   *Targets:* High service time variability, failed deliveries
    *   *Root Cause:* Inefficient route sequences leading to backtracking or unnecessary driving. Clustering customers based on delivery difficulty.
    *   *Data Support:* Historical delivery data, customer location data, service time distributions. Cluster analysis, Route optimization algorithms based on delivery areas
    *   *Expected Impact:* Reduced travel time, fewer failed deliveries, lower operational costs.
3.  **Predictive Maintenance Schedules:**
    *   *Targets:* Vehicle breakdowns, unscheduled downtime
    *   *Root Cause:* Reactive maintenance, lack of preventative measures
    *   *Data Support:* Vehicle telematics data (engine diagnostics), maintenance logs, mileage. Machine learning models predict maintenance needs.
    *   *Expected Impact:* Reduced vehicle downtime, lower maintenance costs, increased vehicle utilization.



**5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring:**

*   **Operational Constraints:** Dynamic routing and scheduling must respect:
    *   **Driver Working Hours:** Adhere to legal regulations and union agreements.
    *   **Vehicle Capacities:** Ensure packages fit within vehicle limits.
    *   **Customer Time Windows:**  Prioritize deliveries within the requested windows.  Process mining analysis will reveal the impact of time windows on efficiency.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**
    *   **Dashboards:** Develop dashboards displaying key KPIs: On-Time Delivery Rate, Fuel Consumption, Vehicle Utilization.
    *   **Process Views:** Monitor critical process flows: typical delivery paths, common deviations, frequently occurring bottlenecks.
    *   **Alerts:** Implement alerts for significant KPI drops or unusual process deviations.
    *   **Periodic Audits:** Regularly review process models and KPIs to ensure the optimization strategies remain effective and identify new areas for improvement. Integrating feedback from drivers and dispatchers can improve the quality of the data and the relevance of the analyses.
