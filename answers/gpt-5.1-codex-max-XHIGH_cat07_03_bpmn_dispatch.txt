It's a BPMNstyle process diagram for the "Dispatch of goods" at a computer hardware shop, divided into two swimlanes for Logistics and Warehouse.

The process starts with a "Ship goods" start event in the Logistics lane that immediately branches at a parallel gateway. One branch goes down to the Warehouse lane to "Package goods"; there's a timer attached to this task – if packaging takes 48 hours an exception flow notifies the customer about delay.

The other branch in Logistics clarifies the shipment method using the order details and checks at an exclusive gateway whether special handling is needed. For special handling, three offers are requested from logistics companies and one is selected and ordered. Regardless, customer information is used to check if insurance is required; if so the parcel is insured, and in all cases a package label is written. The labelwriting and carrier selection come together and feed into filling out the shipment paperwork.

At the end of the process, after both the packaging and the logistics paperwork branches have converged, the package is moved to the pickup area, and the flow ends with a "Shipment prepared" end event.
