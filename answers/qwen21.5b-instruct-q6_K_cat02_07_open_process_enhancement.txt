Process Mining is a process modeling technique that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and extract meaningful information about business processes. It involves the use of various tools, such as BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams, to represent the structure of a business process and identify its key attributes.
There are several approaches to process mining:

  * Discovery: This approach involves identifying patterns in historical or current data that can be used to understand business processes better. The goal is to find insights about how processes work, their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. It is often used as a pre-implementation activity before formalizing a process.
  * Conformance Checking: This approach involves checking the adherence of a process to predefined rules or requirements. The goal is to ensure that a process follows established standards or best practices. It can be conducted during an ongoing process, such as when a new policy or regulation requires changes in processes. Conformance checking uses data-driven approaches and metrics to evaluate how well a process meets its specifications.
  * Process Enhancement: This approach involves improving the design of a process by modifying its structure, inputs, outputs, tasks, roles, etc. It is used when there are areas in the current process that need improvement or when a business processes undergoes changes such as new initiatives, organizational restructuring, or acquisitions.

Process Enhancement can be achieved through various methods, including:

  * Process Automation: This involves using automation tools to streamline and expedite processes.
  * Process Refactoring: This involves modifying existing processes to make them more efficient, effective, and adaptable.
  * Process Transformation: This involves completely redesigning a process from scratch with the objective of creating an even better process than what existed before.

In summary, Process Mining can be divided into three main approaches: Discovery, Conformance Checking, and Enhancement. Each approach has its own focus, and it is up to the user to decide which one best suits their needs at a particular time.
