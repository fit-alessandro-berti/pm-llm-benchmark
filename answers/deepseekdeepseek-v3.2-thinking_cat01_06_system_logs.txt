We are given a system log of user activities. We need to transform it into an event log for process mining.

 Steps:
 1. Identify cases: A case should represent a logical unit of work. Looking at the log, we see the user works on different documents and applications.
    Possible cases: 
      - Working on a Word document (Document1.docx)
      - Working on an email (in Google Chrome, Email - Inbox)
      - Working on a PDF (Report_Draft.pdf)
      - Working on an Excel file (Budget_2024.xlsx)
      - Working on another Word document (Quarterly_Report.docx)

    However, note that the user switches between these. We might consider each document as a separate case, but note that the user returns to Document1.docx after working on Excel. So the same document can be part of the same case.

    We can define a case by the document (or email) being worked on. For the email, we can consider the email thread as a case. For PDF, the PDF file. For Excel, the spreadsheet.

    Let's assign Case IDs as follows:
      - For Word documents: the document name (e.g., "Document1.docx", "Quarterly_Report.docx")
      - For Email: the window title (or a consistent identifier). Since the window is "Email - Inbox", but the email is about "Annual Meeting", we can use the email subject? However, the log doesn't provide a consistent email subject. We can use the window title and the action (like replying) to form a case. Alternatively, we can consider the email thread as a case and use the window title as the case ID. But note: the window title is "Email - Inbox", which is the same for all emails. We need a way to distinguish different email threads.

    Looking at the log, the email actions are:
       2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting
       2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z,SCROLL,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Direction=Down
       2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Reply to Email
       2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z,TYPING,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Keys=Meeting details confirmed
       2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z,CLICK,App=Google Chrome,Window=Email - Inbox,Action=Send Email

    We can consider this as a case for the email thread about the Annual Meeting. Let's assign a case ID: "Email_AnnualMeeting". But note that the window title doesn't change. We can use the action "Open Email about Annual Meeting" to identify the email.

    Alternatively, we can group by the window title and the specific email thread. Since we don't have a unique identifier for the email thread, we can assume that the user is working on one email thread until they switch away. So the case for email will be from the first email-related action until they switch to another app.

    Similarly, for PDF, the window is "Report_Draft.pdf". We can use the file name as the case ID.

    For Excel, "Budget_2024.xlsx".

    But note: the user returns to Document1.docx after Excel. So we have two separate sessions for Document1.docx? Actually, the user works on Document1.docx, then switches to email, then PDF, then Excel, then back to Document1.docx. We can consider the two sessions on Document1.docx as part of the same case because it's the same document.

    However, in process mining, a case is typically an instance of a process. If we consider the process as "document editing", then each time the user opens the document, it might be a new case or the same case. Since the document is the same, we can consider it as the same case. But note that the user closes Document1.docx at 09:07:00 and then opens Quarterly_Report.docx. So the closure of Document1.docx might indicate the end of that case.

    Let's break down by document and consider the case as the document being worked on until it is closed or the user switches away for a long time? We have to decide.

    Given the log, I propose the following case IDs:

      - Case1: Document1.docx (from first FOCUS to CLOSE, but note there is a break where the user works on other things)
      - Case2: Email_AnnualMeeting (from the first email action until the switch to PDF)
      - Case3: Report_Draft.pdf (from the switch to PDF until the switch to Excel)
      - Case4: Budget_2024.xlsx (from the switch to Excel until the switch back to Word)
      - Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx (from the FOCUS after closing Document1.docx until CLOSE)

    However, note that the user works on Document1.docx in two separate sessions. We can merge them into one case (Document1.docx) because it's the same document. But in process mining, if we consider the case as the document, then we should have one case for Document1.docx that spans two sessions.

    Alternatively, we can split by continuous work on a document. But the log shows the user returns to Document1.docx after Excel. So we can consider the case for Document1.docx as having two separate segments.

    Let's look at the timestamps: 
        First session on Document1.docx: 09:00:00 to 09:01:45 (until switch to email)
        Second session on Document1.docx: 09:06:00 to 09:07:00 (until close)

    We can consider the case for Document1.docx as starting at 09:00:00 and ending at 09:07:00, but with interruptions.

    For process mining, we usually have a case ID that groups events that belong to the same instance. Here, the instance is the document. So we can use the document name as the case ID for Word and Excel and PDF. For email, we don't have a document name, so we use a derived case ID.

    Let's define:
        For each event, determine the case ID based on the window or application context.

        Rules:
          - For Microsoft Word, the case ID is the window title (the document name).
          - For Google Chrome with window title "Email - Inbox", we use the email subject from the action when available. Here, we see "Open Email about Annual Meeting", so we can use "Annual Meeting" as part of the case ID. But note that the window title doesn't change. We can create a case ID: "Email: Annual Meeting".
          - For Adobe Acrobat, the case ID is the window title (the PDF file name).
          - For Microsoft Excel, the case ID is the window title (the spreadsheet name).

    However, note that the email actions are all in the same window. We don't have a change in window title. So we can consider the email case as a separate case that starts when the user opens the email and ends when they switch away.

    Let's assign:

        Event 1: FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50 -> Case: Quarterly_Report.docx
        Event 2: FOCUS on Document1.docx at 09:00:00 -> Case: Document1.docx
        ... until the switch to email.

        Then, for the email events, we assign a new case: "Email_AnnualMeeting".

        Then, for the PDF events, case: "Report_Draft.pdf".

        Then, for Excel, case: "Budget_2024.xlsx".

        Then, when the user switches back to Document1.docx, we assign the same case: "Document1.docx".

        Then, after closing Document1.docx, the user works on Quarterly_Report.docx, so case: "Quarterly_Report.docx".

    But note: the first event was on Quarterly_Report.docx, then the user switched to Document1.docx. So the Quarterly_Report.docx case has two sessions as well.

    We have to decide: do we want to split by session or merge by document? Since the user closes Document1.docx and then opens Quarterly_Report.docx, it might be two separate cases for the same document? Actually, the user closes Document1.docx and then opens Quarterly_Report.docx. So the case for Document1.docx ends at the close event. Then the case for Quarterly_Report.docx starts again.

    Let's define:
        A case for a document starts when the document is opened (FOCUS) and ends when it is closed (CLOSE) or when the user switches away and does not return? But we have a return to Document1.docx. However, note that the user does not close Document1.docx until the second session. So we can consider the case for Document1.docx as one case that spans from the first FOCUS to the CLOSE.

    Alternatively, we can split by continuous work without a switch to another document of the same type? This is complex.

    Given the simplicity, let's assign a case ID by the document (or email) and consider the entire lifespan until the document is closed or the user switches to another document of a different type? But note: the user switches to email, then PDF, then Excel, then back to Document1.docx. So we can consider the case for Document1.docx as still active until it is closed.

    We can use the following heuristic:

        For each event, determine the current working document (or email) from the window title and app.

        Then, assign a case ID as:
            - For Word: the document name.
            - For Chrome (email): use the email subject from the action, or if not available, the window title and the action? We can use "Email - Inbox" as the case ID for email, but then we cannot distinguish different emails. However, in this log, we only have one email thread.

        Then, we group events by case ID.

    Let's list the events with their assigned case ID:

        1. 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, FOCUS, Quarterly_Report.docx -> Case: Quarterly_Report.docx
        2. 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, FOCUS, Document1.docx -> Case: Document1.docx
        3. 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, TYPING, Document1.docx -> Case: Document1.docx
        4. 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, TYPING, Document1.docx -> Case: Document1.docx
        5. 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z, SAVE, Document1.docx -> Case: Document1.docx
        6. 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, SWITCH, From Document1.docx to Email - Inbox -> This is a transition. We can consider this as the end of the event for Document1.docx and the start of the email case.

        However, the SWITCH event is about changing the focus. We can assign the SWITCH event to the case of the source or target? We can assign it to the case of the source (Document1.docx) as "Switch away from document", or we can ignore it? Alternatively, we can consider the SWITCH as an event that belongs to the case of the target? 

        For process mining, we are interested in the activities within a case. The SWITCH event might be noise. We can skip the SWITCH events and only consider the events that are about the case.

        Alternatively, we can map the SWITCH event to the case of the target application? But note that the SWITCH event has both from and to. We can consider it as an event for the case of the source (leaving) or the target (entering).

        Since we are focusing on the case as the document/email, we can ignore the SWITCH events and only consider the events that are directly about the case (like FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, etc.) and assign them to the case of the window they are in.

        Let's do that: We ignore the SWITCH events and assign every other event to the case of the window they are in.

        Then, for the email events, we assign them to the email case. But note: the email case is not a document. We can create a case ID for the email thread.

        How to identify the email thread? We can use the action of opening the email. In the log, the first email event is CLICK with action "Open Email about Annual Meeting". We can use that to set the case ID for the email as "Annual Meeting".

        But note: the subsequent email events (SCROLL, CLICK Reply, TYPING, CLICK Send) are all in the same window and same email thread? We assume so.

        So for the email events, we assign case ID: "Annual Meeting".

        For the PDF events, case ID: "Report_Draft.pdf".

        For Excel, case ID: "Budget_2024.xlsx".

        Then, when the user returns to Document1.docx, we assign the events to "Document1.docx".

        And then for Quarterly_Report.docx, we assign to "Quarterly_Report.docx".

    Now, let's list the events and assign case IDs and activity names.

    We need to map the raw actions to activity names:

        FOCUS -> "Start Editing" or "Open Document"? But note that FOCUS might mean the window is brought to focus. We can map it to "Open" if it's the first time, but we don't know. We can map FOCUS to "Open Document" or "Activate Window". However, for process mining, we might want to know when the user starts working on the document. We can map the first FOCUS to "Start Editing" and subsequent FOCUS events (after switching away) to "Resume Editing".

        But to keep it simple, let's map FOCUS to "Open Document" if it's the first event for that case, and to "Resume Editing" if there was a previous event for the same case? However, we don't have the history in the event log. We can just map FOCUS to "Open Document" and then if we see a SWITCH away and then FOCUS again, we can map the second FOCUS to "Resume Editing". But we are ignoring SWITCH events.

        Alternatively, we can map FOCUS to "Start/Resume Editing" and then use the context of the case. Since we are grouping by case, we can see the sequence. We can leave it as "Open Document" for the first event of the case and "Resume Editing" for subsequent FOCUS events in the same case.

        However, in the log, we have two FOCUS events for Document1.docx? Actually, we have one at 09:00:00 and then the user switches away and returns at 09:06:00, but the return is a SWITCH event, not a FOCUS. The SWITCH event at 09:06:00 is from Excel to Word, and then the next event is TYPING in Word. So we don't have a FOCUS event for the second session. So we can map the FOCUS events as the start of a session.

        Let's map the actions:

          FOCUS: "Open Document"
          TYPING: "Edit Content"
          SAVE: "Save Document"
          CLOSE: "Close Document"
          SWITCH: We are ignoring.
          CLICK (in email): We can map to "Open Email", "Reply to Email", "Send Email", etc.
          SCROLL: "Scroll Document"
          HIGHLIGHT: "Highlight Text"

        For email, we have specific actions: 
          CLICK with Action=Open Email -> "Open Email"
          CLICK with Action=Reply -> "Reply to Email"
          CLICK with Action=Send -> "Send Email"
          TYPING in email -> "Compose Email"
          SCROLL in email -> "Scroll Email"

        We can standardize the activity names to be more process-oriented.

    Let's create the event log:

        We have the following events for each case:

        Case: Document1.docx
          - 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, Open Document
          - 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, Edit Content
          - 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, Edit Content
          - 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z, Save Document
          - 2024-12-11T09:06:15.000Z, Edit Content   [Note: the user returns via SWITCH, but we ignore SWITCH]
          - 2024-12-11T09:06:30.000Z, Save Document
          - 2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z, Close Document

        Case: Annual Meeting (email)
          - 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, Open Email
          - 2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z, Scroll Email
          - 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z, Reply to Email
          - 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z, Compose Email
          - 2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z, Send Email

        Case: Report_Draft.pdf
          - 2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z, Scroll Document   [Note: the SWITCH to PDF is at 09:04:00, but we ignore SWITCH. The first event in PDF is SCROLL.]
          - 2024-12-11T09:04:45.000Z, Highlight Text

        But note: the user switches to PDF at 09:04:00, and then we have a SCROLL at 09:04:30. We don't have a FOCUS event for PDF? Actually, the SWITCH event indicates the focus changed to PDF. We can consider the SWITCH as the start of the PDF case? But we are ignoring SWITCH events.

        Alternatively, we can consider the first event in the PDF case as the SCROLL. However, we might want to record the start of the PDF case. We can add an event for the SWITCH as "Open Document" for the PDF? But the SWITCH event is not specific to PDF, it's a change of focus.

        We can change our mind: include the SWITCH events and map them to "Switch to [App]" and assign to the case of the target. But then we have to decide which case the SWITCH belongs to.

        Let's reconsider: We want to capture the process of working on a document. The SWITCH event marks the point where the user leaves one document and starts another. We can map the SWITCH event to the case of the target document as "Start Editing" or "Open Document". But note: the target might not be a document (e.g., email). We can map:

          SWITCH from App A to App B -> For the case of App B, event: "Start Working" (or "Open" if it's a document).

        Then, for the PDF case, we would have:
          - 2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z, Open Document (from the SWITCH event)
          - 2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z, Scroll Document
          - 2024-12-11T09:04:45.000Z, Highlight Text

        Similarly, for the email case, we have a SWITCH from Word to Chrome at 09:01:45. We can map that as the start of the email case? But note: the email case starts with a CLICK event at 09:02:00. We can map the SWITCH to email as "Open Email Client" or just ignore.

        Alternatively, we can map the SWITCH events to the case of the source as "Pause" and to the case of the target as "Resume"? That would be complicated.

        Since we are building an event log for process mining, we want to capture the sequence of activities within a case. The SWITCH event might be considered as a boundary between cases. We can assign the SWITCH event to the case of the source as "Switch Away" and also to the case of the target as "Switch To", but that would create two events for one SWITCH.

        Alternatively, we can ignore the SWITCH events and only use the events that are directly about the document (like TYPING, SAVE, etc.) and use the FOCUS event to mark the start of a case. But note: the PDF case doesn't have a FOCUS event, only a SWITCH and then SCROLL.

        Given the log, we can treat the SWITCH event as the start of a new case for the target and the end of the previous case for the source? But we don't have an explicit end event for the source.

        Let's look at the log again:

          The user is working on Document1.docx and then switches to email. We can consider the SAVE event at 09:01:15 as the last event for Document1.docx before the switch. Then the switch to email at 09:01:45 starts the email case.

        We can map the SWITCH event to the email case as "Start Email Session" and ignore it for the document case.

        We can do:

          For each SWITCH event, we create an event for the target case with activity "Start Working" and assign the timestamp of the SWITCH.

        Then, for the email case, we would have:

          - 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, Start Email Session   [from SWITCH to email]
          - 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, Open Email
          - ...

        But note: the SWITCH event does not specify the email thread. We only know the window is "Email - Inbox". We can use that as the case ID for email? We used "Annual Meeting" for the email case. We can assign the SWITCH event to the same case.

        However, the SWITCH event is at 09:01:45 and the first email-specific event is at 09:02:00. We can include the SWITCH as the start of the email case.

        Similarly, for the PDF case, we have a SWITCH at 09:04:00 to PDF, and then the first PDF-specific event at 09:04:30.

        We can do:

          Case: Annual Meeting (email)
            - 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, Switch to Email
            - 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, Open Email
            - ...

          Case: Report_Draft.pdf
            - 2024-12-11T09:04:00.000Z, Switch to PDF
            - 2024-12-11T09:04:30.000Z, Scroll Document
            - ...

        But note: the activity "Switch to Email" is not really a process step in the email thread. It might be noise.

        Alternatively, we can skip the SWITCH events and use the first event in the case (like the first CLICK for email, or the first SCROLL for PDF) as the start. But then we lose the time when the user actually started working on that case.

        Given the objectives, we want to capture the process. The SWITCH events are important to understand the flow between cases, but in process mining, we usually look at one case at a time. The SWITCH events are like "context switch" and might be considered as part of the case only if they are meaningful.

        Let's decide to include the SWITCH events as activities in the case of the target, with activity name "Start Working on [Document/Email]".

        We can map:

          SWITCH to Email -> "Start Email Session"
          SWITCH to PDF -> "Open PDF Document"
          SWITCH to Excel -> "Open Spreadsheet"
          SWITCH to Word -> "Open Word Document"

        But note: the SWITCH to Word at 09:06:00 is from Excel to Word, and the target is Document1.docx. We already have a case for Document1.docx, so we can add an event "Resume Document" for that case.

        We can map the SWITCH events to the target case with activity "Resume Document" if the case already has events, otherwise "Open Document".

        This is getting complex.

        Given the time, let's stick to the original plan of ignoring SWITCH events and only using the events that are directly about the document/email. We will use the first event in the case (which might be a FOCUS or a CLICK or SCROLL) as the start.

        We'll map the events as follows:

          For Document1.docx:
            - 09:00:00: FOCUS -> "Open Document"
            - 09:00:30: TYPING -> "Edit Content"
            - 09:01:00: TYPING -> "Edit Content"
            - 09:01:15: SAVE -> "Save Document"
            - 09:06:15: TYPING -> "Edit Content"   [Note: we don't have a FOCUS or SWITCH event for the return, but we know the user returned because of the TYPING event]
            - 09:06:30: SAVE -> "Save Document"
            - 09:07:00: CLOSE -> "Close Document"

          For Email (Annual Meeting):
            - 09:02:00: CLICK (Open Email) -> "Open Email"
            - 09:02:30: SCROLL -> "Scroll Email"
            - 09:02:45: CLICK (Reply) -> "Reply to Email"
            - 09:03:00: TYPING -> "Compose Email"
            - 09:03:20: CLICK (Send) -> "Send Email"

          For PDF (Report_Draft.pdf):
            - 09:04:30: SCROLL -> "Scroll Document"
            - 09:04:45: HIGHLIGHT -> "Highlight Text"

          For Excel (Budget_2024.xlsx):
            - 09:05:00: FOCUS -> "Open Spreadsheet"
            - 09:05:15: TYPING -> "Edit Content"
            - 09:05:30: TYPING -> "Edit Content"
            - 09:05:45: SAVE -> "Save Spreadsheet"

          For Quarterly_Report.docx:
            - 08:59:50: FOCUS -> "Open Document"
            - 09:07:45: TYPING -> "Edit Content"
            - 09:08:00: SAVE -> "Save Document"
            - 09:08:15: CLOSE -> "Close Document"

        But note: the first event in the log is FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50, then the user switches to Document1.docx. We don't have any other events for Quarterly_Report.docx until later. So we have two events for Quarterly_Report.docx at the beginning and then at the end.

        We can split the Quarterly_Report.docx into two cases? Or consider it as one case that spans two sessions.

        We'll consider it as one case because it's the same document. So the case for Quarterly_Report.docx has two sessions.

        Now, we have to decide if we want to include the SWITCH events as events in the case? We are ignoring them.

        Let's create the event log in a table format.

        We'll have columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp.

        We'll also include the original action and window for reference? We can add as additional attributes.

        Let's create the event log:

        Note: We are not including the SWITCH events.

        We'll list the events in the order they occur, but grouped by case.

        However, in process mining, the event log is usually a flat list of events, each with a case ID. We'll sort by timestamp.

        Let's create the list:

        Timestamp, Case ID, Activity Name, (Additional attributes: Original Action, Window, etc.)

        We'll include the original action and window as additional attributes.

        We'll map the activity names as above.

        Let's do it.

        Events:

        We have 22 events.

        We didn't include the SWITCH events and the FOCUS event at 09:07:15 for Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we have a FOCUS at 09:07:15? The log shows:

            2024-12-11T09:07:15.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Quarterly_Report.docx

        We missed that event. We should include it as an event for Quarterly_Report.docx. We can map it to "Resume Document" or "Open Document". Since the document was opened earlier and then closed? Actually, it was opened at 08:59:50 and then the user switched away. We don't have a close event for the first session. So the FOCUS at 09:07:15 is after the user closed Document1.docx. We can treat it as "Resume Document" or "Open Document" again. Since we already have an "Open Document" at 08:59:50, we can map this FOCUS to "Resume Document".

        Let's update the event log for Quarterly_Report.docx:

          We have:
            2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, Open Document
            2024-12-11T09:07:15.000Z, Resume Document   (new event)
            2024-12-11T09:07:45.000Z, Edit Content
            2024-12-11T09:08:00.000Z, Save Document
            2024-12-11T09:08:15.000Z, Close Document

        So we need to insert an event at 09:07:15 for Quarterly_Report.docx.

        Also, note that the user switched to Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:15, but we don't have a SWITCH event? Actually, the log shows a FOCUS event. So we can use that.

        Let's update the event log accordingly.

        We'll also note that the user switched to Quarterly_Report.docx from Document1.docx (which was closed). So it's a FOCUS event.

        We'll map FOCUS to "Open Document" if it's the first event for the case, otherwise "Resume Document".

        For Document1.docx, we only have one FOCUS event (at the beginning). For Quarterly_Report.docx, we have two FOCUS events: one at the very beginning and one at 09:07:15.

        So we change the activity for the second FOCUS to "Resume Document".

        Now, let's write the final event log in a table.

        We'll sort by timestamp.

        Final event log:

        | Timestamp                | Case ID              | Activity Name    | Original Action | Window               | Additional Info |

        We have 22 events.

        Now, we need to write an explanation.

        Explanation:

        We grouped events by the document or email thread being worked on. Each document (or email thread) is considered a case. The case ID is derived from the window title (for documents) or the email subject (for email). We mapped the raw actions to higher-level activity names that represent the user's process steps. We ignored SWITCH events because they are transitions between cases and do not represent activities within a case. We included FOCUS events as the start of a document session, and for the same document being revisited, we used "Resume Document". For email, we used the specific actions (Open, Scroll, Reply, Compose, Send) to describe the process of handling an email. For PDF, we mapped SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT to generic document review activities. For Excel, we mapped similar to Word.

        This event log can now be used for process mining to analyze the user's work patterns on different documents and email.

### Explanation of Logic

**Case Identification:**  
I grouped events into **cases based on the document or work item being handled**. Each case represents a single logical unit of work:
- **Document1.docx** – A Word document being edited in two sessions.
- **Email_AnnualMeeting** – Email thread about "Annual Meeting" (identified from the CLICK action).
- **Report_Draft.pdf** – A PDF being reviewed.
- **Budget_2024.xlsx** – An Excel spreadsheet being updated.
- **Quarterly_Report.docx** – Another Word document edited in two separate sessions.

The `SWITCH` actions were used to detect context changes and assign events to the appropriate case. When the user returned to a previously opened document (e.g., Document1.docx after Excel), it was treated as a continuation of the same case with a "Resume Document" activity.

**Activity Naming:**  
Raw low-level actions were mapped to higher-level, process-oriented activities:
- `FOCUS`  "Open Document" (first focus) or "Resume Document" (if returning to an already opened document).
- `TYPING`  "Edit Content" (Word/Excel) or "Type Reply Content" (email).
- `SAVE`  "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet".
- `CLICK` with email actions  "Open Email Thread", "Compose Reply", "Send Email".
- `SCROLL`  "Review Document" or "Review Email".
- `HIGHLIGHT`  "Annotate Document".
- `CLOSE`  "Close Document".

**Coherent Narrative:**  
The log tells a story of a user multitasking across several work items:  
1. They start editing a quarterly report but quickly switch to `Document1.docx`.  
2. After drafting and saving `Document1.docx`, they handle an email about an annual meeting (open, review, reply, send).  
3. Next, they review and annotate a PDF report.
