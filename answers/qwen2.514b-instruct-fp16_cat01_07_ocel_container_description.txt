Based on the provided data, we can infer several processes involving different entities and their interactions within a logistics or warehouse operation.

### Object Type: Goods

1. **Weighing Process**
   - Goods are weighed multiple times in various contexts, suggesting that weight validation is an important step before further operations.
     - `Place in Stock -> Weigh`: After placing goods in stock (3 objects), they are typically weighted within a relatively short duration of about 20 seconds on average per event. This likely happens as part of quality control or inventory management.
     - `Load to Vehicle -> Weigh` and `Bring to Loading Bay -> Weigh`: Similar processes but at different stages before loading goods onto vehicles.

2. **Stock Placement and Relocation**
   - Goods frequently transition between placement in stock (`Place in Stock`) and being brought to the loading bay (`Bring to Loading Bay`). This implies that goods are sometimes relocated from their initial stocking point to prepare for transport.
     - The significant duration associated with `Bring to Loading Bay -> Place in Stock` (112600.53) suggests there could be multiple handling stages involved, possibly due to inventory adjustments.

3. **Loading and Unloading Operations**
   - There are several cycles involving loading goods onto vehicles (`Load to Vehicle`) from various initial states.
     - For instance, `Place in Stock -> Load to Vehicle` involves a large duration (128603.05) indicating complex processes or multiple steps before the final loading.

4. **Cyclical Operations**
   - Certain operations like weighing and moving goods between stock areas occur cyclically (`Weigh -> Weigh`, `Place in Stock -> Place in Stock`), which implies quality checks, inventory reviews, or process compliance are iterative activities.

### Object Type: Customer Order

- The creation of transport documents is tightly coupled with registering customer orders.
  - Each registered order leads to a new document that sets the transportation logistics into motion. This suggests an immediate and direct linkage between sales/customer requests and logistical execution (329005.22 duration for creating a single document implies significant processing time, potentially due to data input, validation, etc.).

### Object Type: Transport Document

- The creation of transport documents initiates a series of steps involving vehicle scheduling (`Book Vehicles`), container allocation (`Order Empty Containers`), and departure logistics.
  - This sequence highlights the structured planning process for transporting goods. For instance:
    - After booking vehicles, containers are ordered, which triggers the next phase.
    - Departure events are closely linked with re-scheduling activities due to potential delays or changes in logistics (e.g., `Reschedule Container`).

### Summary of Process:

1. **Customer Order Handling**
   - A customer order is registered (`Register Customer Order`).
   - This immediately triggers the creation of a transport document (`Create Transport Document`) that sets up transportation planning.

2. **Transport Planning and Execution**
   - Following document creation, vehicles are booked and containers ordered to facilitate shipment (`Book Vehicles`, `Order Empty Containers`).
   - The logistics then move towards actual departure (`Depart`), which may involve multiple re-scheduling steps to optimize routes or accommodate unexpected changes (`Reschedule Container`).

3. **Goods Handling**
   - Goods destined for transport go through rigorous processes including placement in stock, weighing, and movement between various locations until they are loaded onto vehicles.
   - These operations ensure quality control, compliance with regulations, and efficient inventory management.

Overall, this system demonstrates a well-coordinated chain of activities from receiving customer orders to the final departure of goods, incorporating extensive planning, validation, and operational processes.
