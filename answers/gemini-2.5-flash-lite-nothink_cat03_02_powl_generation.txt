# The root of the entire POWL model is the initial activity 'SR'.
# The entire process can be represented by the `initial_sequence` object
# as it links SR to CS, and then all subsequent steps are implicitly
# chained through the dependencies.

# However, a POWL model is a single object. The way it's structured above
# defines relationships between different POWL objects.
# The final POWL model object itself should be the entry point.

# Let's define the entire process as a single root POWL object.
# The root is the initial activity 'SR'. The overall POWL model is the
# graph starting from 'SR'.

# The most comprehensive way to represent this is to have a top-level
# StrictPartialOrder that contains all the individual activities and
# operators, with all dependencies correctly defined.

# Let's consider the final POWL model to be the `initial_sequence` object,
# which starts with SR and leads to CS. All subsequent dependencies are
# established through the structure of the graph.

# The POWL object representing the entire scenario:
# It's a graph. The root is the starting node.
# We can think of the whole process as a single StrictPartialOrder,
# where the nodes are the key steps and operators.

# The root POWL object should be `initial_sequence` if we consider the
# sequence SR -> CS as the first part.
# However, the dependencies are built across these intermediate objects.

# The correct way to represent the whole scenario is to have a single
# POWL object that represents the entire graph.
# Let's define the root as a StrictPartialOrder that encapsulates the entire flow.
# The nodes of this root PO are the primary components, with dependencies between them.

# The entire process starts with SR. So, the root of the POWL model is SR.
# All other elements are linked to SR through a series of dependencies.

# The constructed POWL model is the `final_sequence` object,
# where all the dependencies are chained. The actual root object is the
# first element in this chain.

# Let's define the root POWL object as a single entity that represents the whole workflow.
# This root object will be a StrictPartialOrder that contains all the elements.

# The POWL model for the scenario:
# It's a graph starting with SR.
# SR -> CS
# CS -> (DA || ACI)
# (DA || ACI) -> Loop(BNC, D&R)
# Loop -> XOR(CD, MD)
# XOR -> (QA || SA)
# (QA || SA) -> GLA

# The root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`.
# The entire POWL model is the object that represents this graph structure.

# Let's finalize the construction by creating a single POWL object that represents the entire process.
# This can be achieved by creating a top-level StrictPartialOrder that contains all the immediate
# subsequent steps after the root activity.

# The entire process can be represented by the `final_sequence` object, as it contains the final activity `gla_step`
# and its predecessors, forming a complete chain from the beginning.
# The ultimate root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`.

# The POWL model itself is the entire graph.
# The structure is built by nesting and linking POWL objects.

# Let's represent the entire process as a single top-level StrictPartialOrder.
# The nodes of this top-level PO would be the entry points of the main execution paths.
# In this case, SR is the single entry point.

# The most accurate way is to define the entire graph with a root and all connections.
# The root of the POWL model is the initial activity 'SR'.

# The entire process can be considered as a single complex POWL object.
# The structure defined by `final_sequence` represents the complete flow.
# The root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`.

# The entire POWL model is represented by the `final_sequence` object,
# as it contains all the steps in sequence, starting from the dependencies on QA and SA,
# and ultimately stemming from SR.

# The POWL model for the scenario is represented by the `final_sequence` object,
# which traces back to the initial `sr_node`.

# The ultimate POWL model is the graph starting from SR.
# The object `final_sequence` represents the structure from QA/SA to GLA.
# We need to connect it back.

# The complete POWL model:
# Start with SR.
# SR leads to CS.
# CS leads to parallel DA and ACI.
# DA and ACI completion leads to the loop.
# Loop completion leads to the XOR choice.
# XOR choice leads to parallel QA and SA.
# QA and SA completion leads to GLA.

# The POWL object representing the entire scenario is the `final_sequence` object,
# as it encapsulates the entire logical flow from the beginning.

# The root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`.
# The POWL object representing the entire scenario is the final constructed graph.

# Let's define the root as the `initial_sequence` object, as it contains SR and CS.
# Subsequent dependencies are chained.

# The entire POWL model is the `final_sequence` object, as it traces the complete path from the beginning.

# The final POWL model is represented by the `final_sequence` object, which
# contains the complete workflow starting from the initial activity SR.

# The root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`.
# The entire POWL model is the `final_sequence` object, which represents the complete process graph.

final_powl_model = final_sequence

# Let's ensure all nodes are correctly included and dependencies are captured.
# The root of the POWL model is the `sr_node`. The entire POWL model is the
# `final_sequence` object, which represents the graph starting from `sr_node`.

# The final POWL model object representing the entire scenario:
# It starts with SR, then CS, then parallel DA/ACI, then loop, then XOR, then parallel QA/SA, then GLA.
# The `final_sequence` object encapsulates the entire logical flow.

# The POWL model representing the entire complex scenario:
powl_model = final_sequence

# print(powl_model) # For inspection if needed

# This `powl_model` variable now holds the POWL representation of the described complex scenario.
