Proposed High-Level Process Map
================================
(Each step is shown in the order it normally occurs in a case)

1. Material Preparation  
2. Welding / Mechanical Joining  
3. Weld Quality Check  
4. Surface Finishing  
5. Final Visual Inspection  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. High-Level Step :  Material Preparation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Included low-level events (exact activity labels may vary slightly):

• Retrieve raw metal sheet  
• Scan barcode  
• Place metal sheet on table  
• Align metal sheet  
• Preheat metal sheet  

Why these belong together  
• Common goal – turn an un-identified raw sheet into a positioned, pre-heated work-piece ready for joining.  
• Same physical object (metal sheet) is manipulated throughout.  
• Tight time spacing (all within ~30 s).  
• Mainly preparation-type resources (Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit).  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2. High-Level Step :  Welding / Mechanical Joining
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Included low-level events  

• Pick up welding tool  
• Weld corner A  
• Weld corner B  

Why these belong together  
• They create the permanent joints.  
• All performed by the same human operator (Operator B) with the same tool.  
• Activities are inseparable in purpose; without any of them the joint is incomplete.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
3. High-Level Step :  Weld Quality Check
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Included low-level event  

• Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)  

Why its own step?  
• Executed by a different resource class (sensor, not human).  
• Semantically changes the state from “joined” to “validated joint”.  
• Can be repeated or branched on failure, so isolating it is useful for analysis.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
4. High-Level Step :  Surface Finishing
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Included low-level events  

• Apply protective coating  
• Dry coating  

Why these belong together  
• Both manipulate the same surface coating.  
• Always consecutive and done by coating & heating units.  
• Transform the part from “welded” to “finished surface”.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
5. High-Level Step :  Final Visual Inspection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Included low-level event  

• Visual check  

Why its own step?  
• Done by human inspector (Operator C) after all automated work.  
• Last acceptance gate before the item leaves the cell.

(The same mapping applies to Case B2 or any later case.)

How to Re-create This Grouping Programmatically
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Sort events per CaseID by timestamp.  
2. Define regex/key-word sets for each high-level step:  
   • Preparation     {Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat}  
   • Welding         {Pick up welding tool, Weld*}  
   • Weld QA         {Measure weld integrity}  
   • Finishing       {Apply protective coating, Dry coating}  
   • Final QA        {Visual check}  
3. Scan down the trace; whenever the activity label matches the current step’s set, keep adding it.  
4. When the label matches the next step’s set, close the current cluster and open a new one.  
5. Record Start = first event’s timestamp, End = last event’s timestamp for each cluster.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Aggregation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
• Compresses ~13 granular events into 5 intelligible phases.  
• Easier KPI tracking (e.g., prep time vs. weld time).  
• Supports conformance checking, bottleneck analysis, and simulation at the business-process level instead of the sensor level.
