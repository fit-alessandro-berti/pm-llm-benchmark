The visualization is composed of three parts, labeled (a), (b), and (c), each depicting different aspects of a lab visit and lab test process.

**(a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels:**

This part is a process flow diagram illustrating the interaction between two "proclet classes," presumably representing different entities or systems involved in a lab process. Based on the labels and flow, these classes seem to be "Lab visit" (on the left side) and "Lab test" (on the right side).

**Lab visit proclet class (left side):**

*   The process begins with a "Lab visit" initiated by a **doctor**.
*   A **lab assistant** performs "Order entry" and then "Take blood sample".
*   The system "Order system" is represented as a dashed rounded rectangle and is connected to "Order entry" and "Perform test" in the "Lab test" proclet class with a channel labeled "1..*" to "1..1". This suggests that one "Order entry" in "Lab visit" can initiate one communication with the "Order system", which in turn connects to one "Perform test" in "Lab test".
*   After taking the blood sample, the process moves to "Receive result" (colored grey, suggesting data input).
*   A **lab assistant** then "Judge results" (colored green, likely indicating a positive outcome or decision point).
*   If the results are judged as "Everything fine" (represented by a grey box), the process proceeds directly to "Send report" (colored red, potentially indicating a final action).
*   If the results are not fine, the process branches to "Do tests again" (grey box), then "Receive updated result" (grey box).
*   Finally, a **lab assistant** performs "Send report". The process ends at a black square symbol.
*   There is a dashed rounded rectangle labeled "HIS" (likely Hospital Information System) connected to "Receive result" and "Finish lab test" in the "Lab test" proclet class through channels labeled "1..*" to "1..1" and "1..*" to "1..?". This suggests communication between "Receive result" and "HIS", and "HIS" and "Finish lab test".

**Lab test proclet class (right side):**

*   The process in "Lab test" starts with "Perform test" carried out by a **chemical analyst**. This step is connected to "Order system" from the "Lab visit" side.
*   A **chemical analyst** then "Make report".
*   "Finish lab test" (grey box) is performed by a **chemical analyst**.
*   From "Finish lab test", there is a branch to "Perform test again" (grey box) carried out by a **chemical analyst**, which is then followed by "Provide updated report" (grey box) by a **chemical analyst**.
*   The "Perform test again" and "Provide updated report" steps are connected back to "Receive updated result" in the "Lab visit" proclet class through a channel labeled "1..?" to "1..?". This shows a potential feedback loop for updated test results.
*   The process ends at a black square symbol.

**(b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes:**

This part is a simple class diagram showing the relationship between the two proclet classes identified in part (a).

*   It shows two classes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test".
*   There is a relationship labeled "requires" connecting "Lab visit" to "Lab test".
*   The cardinality indicates that "Lab visit" (1..1) requires "Lab test" (1..*).  This means one instance of a "Lab visit" requires one or more instances of "Lab test".

**(c) Example of a performative:**

This part is a table providing an example of a "performative," which is likely a message or communication event within the described process.

*   The table has columns: "Time", "Channel", "Sender", "Receivers", "Action", "Content", "Scope", and "Direction".
*   The example row shows:
    *   **Time:** 11:00
    *   **Channel:** Order system
    *   **Sender:** Lab visit - John (likely an instance of the "Lab visit" class, possibly related to a patient named John)
    *   **Receivers:** Lab test - HGB, John (likely an instance of "Lab test" for Hemoglobin (HGB), and potentially patient John again)
    *   **Action:** Create
    *   **Content:** "Can you perform a HGB test for John?"
    *   **Scope:** Private
    *   **Direction:** OUT (indicating the message is sent out from the "Lab visit" to the "Order system" channel)

**Overall Description:**

The visualization depicts a simplified model of a lab visit and lab test process using proclet classes and channels. Part (a) illustrates the workflow and interactions between the "Lab visit" and "Lab test" processes, highlighting the roles of different actors (doctor, lab assistant, chemical analyst) and systems (Order system, HIS). Part (b) formally defines the relationship between the "Lab visit" and "Lab test" classes, indicating that a lab visit necessitates one or more lab tests. Part (c) provides a concrete example of a communication message exchanged between these classes via the "Order system" channel, initiating a specific lab test. The visualization uses different shapes and colors to represent process steps, data, decisions, and systems, making it easier to understand the flow of information and actions within the lab process.
