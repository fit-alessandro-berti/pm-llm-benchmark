To address the issues with the current underfitting process tree model, we need to ensure that the activities follow the correct sequence as per the "Procure-to-Pay" process. The activities should be structured to enforce the proper order of events, preventing unwanted behavior such as paying an invoice before receiving goods or matching an invoice to a purchase order.

### Issues with the Current Model:
1. **Parallel Block**: The current model uses a parallel block (AND) for activities like creating a purchase order, receiving goods, receiving an invoice, matching an invoice to a PO, and paying an invoice. This allows these activities to occur in any order, which is not appropriate for the "Procure-to-Pay" process.
2. **Lack of Sequence Enforcement**: The model does not enforce the sequence of activities as required by the domain logic.

### Corrected Process Tree Model:
To enforce the correct sequence, we need to use a sequence operator for activities that must occur in a specific order. We can introduce choice operators where necessary to handle conditional paths.

Here is the corrected process tree model:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator, ProcessTree

# Define activities
create_req = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Requisition")
approve_req = ProcessTree(label="Approve_Purchase_Requisition")
create_po = ProcessTree(label="Create_Purchase_Order")
receive_goods = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Goods")
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive_Invoice")
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match_Invoice_to_PO")
pay_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Pay_Invoice")
close_case = ProcessTree(label="Close_Case")

# Corrected structure:
# A sequence that starts with creating and approving the requisition,
# then creating a purchase order, receiving goods, receiving an invoice,
# matching the invoice to the PO, paying the invoice, and finally closing the case.
sequence_block = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[
    create_req,
    approve_req,
    create_po,
    receive_goods,
    receive_invoice,
    match_invoice,
    pay_invoice,
    close_case
])

root = sequence_block
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sequence Operator**: The root of the process tree is a sequence operator that ensures all activities are performed in the correct order:
   - **Create Purchase Requisition**
   - **Approve Purchase Requisition**
   - **Create Purchase Order**
   - **Receive Goods**
   - **Receive Invoice**
   - **Match Invoice to PO**
   - **Pay Invoice**
   - **Close Case**

2. **Enforcement of Order**: By using a sequence operator, we ensure that each activity must be completed before the next one can start. This prevents activities like paying an invoice before receiving goods or matching an invoice to a PO.

3. **Prevention of Unwanted Behavior**: The corrected model ensures that the activities follow the intended "Procure-to-Pay" process, preventing any out-of-order execution that could lead to errors or inefficiencies.

This updated process tree model ensures conformance to the domain’s logic and prevents unwanted behavior by enforcing the correct sequence of activities.
