1. A fine is created first. Once that's done, a date for the appeal to the prefecture is inserted.
2. The appeal to the prefecture could then lead to several outcomes: a) receiving results from the prefecture which could result in payment, sending another appeal, appealing to a judge or being sent for credit collection; b) inserting a fine notification which might later lead to sending another appeal to the prefecture; c) directly leading to sending a fine which could then be appealed to a judge.
3. The results from the appeal to the prefecture could also result in adding a penalty or notifying the offender of the result.
4. If an appeal is made to a judge, there are multiple potential paths: it might lead back to sending another appeal to the prefecture, inserting date for an appeal to the prefecture, sending a fine which could be appealed again, notifying the offender about the result of the appeal, or sending for credit collection.
5. The process also includes sending an appeal to the prefecture which might lead back to the same set of outcomes as receiving results from the prefecture: payment, further appeals, adding a penalty, inserting date for an appeal to the prefecture, notifying offender about the result or being sent for credit collection.
6. The fine notification could also lead to sending another appeal to the prefecture.
7. A direct path exists from notifying the result of the appeal to the offender to sending another appeal to the prefecture.
8. Payment might be made after receiving results from the prefecture or inserting date for an appeal to the prefecture, and could also lead back to sending another appeal to the prefecture.
9. A penalty could be added directly after notifying the result of the appeal to the offender, but this action does not seem to lead any further in the process described by your data.
