Here's the grouping of the low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps, along with the rationale and proposed names:

### High-Level Process Steps and Justification

Based on the temporal sequence, resource type, and logical flow of activities, the manufacturing process can be segmented into six distinct high-level stages.

---

**1. High-Level Activity: Material Intake & Initial Positioning**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
    *   `Scan barcode`
    *   `Place metal sheet on table`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** These events represent the foundational steps of introducing a new raw material into the production line. They involve initial physical handling, identification (for tracking and verification), and placement of the material at the starting workstation. These are all preparatory actions performed by an operator to begin the processing of a new item.

---

**2. High-Level Activity: Component Pre-Processing**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Align metal sheet`
    *   `Preheat metal sheet`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** Following the initial placement, these activities focus on preparing the raw material's physical state and properties for the subsequent core manufacturing processes. Alignment ensures precision, and preheating optimizes the material for operations like welding. These are conditioning steps that ready the component for transformation, often involving automated or specialized equipment.

**3. High-Level Activity: Primary Assembly (Welding)**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Pick up welding tool`
    *   `Weld corner A`
    *   `Weld corner B`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** This cluster represents the core fabrication or assembly stage where the raw material is fundamentally transformed into a sub-component or a completed part through a primary joining process (welding). Picking up the tool is an immediate preparatory action directly preceding and necessary for the welding tasks performed by the same resource, making it an integral part of this assembly phase.

**4. High-Level Activity: In-Process Quality Inspection (Weld)**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Measure weld integrity`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** This event is a critical automated quality control check performed immediately after the primary assembly (welding). Its purpose is to verify the success and integrity of the most recent critical manufacturing step before proceeding, preventing further value-add to a potentially defective component.

---

**5. High-Level Activity: Surface Treatment & Curing**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Apply protective coating`
    *   `Dry coating`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** These events constitute the post-assembly finishing steps. They involve applying a protective or functional layer to the product's surface and then ensuring that layer is properly set or cured. These are sequential processes focused on enhancing the product's durability, appearance, or specific performance characteristics.

---

**6. High-Level Activity: Final Quality Assurance**

*   **Low-Level Events Included:**
    *   `Visual check`
*   **Rationale for Grouping:** This represents the final, comprehensive inspection of the fully manufactured product. Typically a human-led visual assessment, it serves as a final gate to ensure overall product quality, completeness, and adherence to all specifications before the item is deemed ready for packaging, storage, or dispatch. It's distinct from earlier, more specific automated checks.
