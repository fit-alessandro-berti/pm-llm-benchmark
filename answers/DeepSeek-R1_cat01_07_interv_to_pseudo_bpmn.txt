**BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**  
*Based on consolidated interview transcripts. Ambiguities and variations are noted where accounts differ or require interpretation.*

---

### **1. Activities/Tasks**  
1. **Receive Invoice**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Input:* Invoice (via email)  
   - *Output:* Invoice logged in system (if valid)  

2. **Check for Valid PO**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Decision Criteria:* Presence of a purchase order (PO) number  

3. **Log Invoice in System**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  

4. **Confirm Goods/Services Received**  
   - *Role:* Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - *Input:* Invoice + PO  

5. **Match Invoice to PO**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Decision Criteria:* Quantities, pricing, line items alignment  

6. **Escalate Discrepancy**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) or Purchasing Officer (Dan) / Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
   - *Input:* Disputed invoice details  

7. **Manager Approval**  
   - *Role:* Department Manager (Carlos)  
   - *Input:* Approved/Rejected status  

8. **Schedule Payment**  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - *Output:* Payment scheduled in system  

9. **Create Retrospective PO** (Exception Path)  
   - *Role:* Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) + Department Heads

### **2. Sequence Flow**  
1. **Start:** Invoice received via email → **Check for Valid PO**.  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**  
     - **No PO:**  
       - *Path 1:* Send invoice back to supplier (Mary initiates, Karen may assist).  
     - **PO Exists:**  
       - *Path 2:* Log invoice → Forward to Purchasing (Dan) for **Confirm Goods/Services Received**.  

2. **After Purchasing Confirmation:**  
   - Proceed to **Match Invoice to PO**.  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**  
     - **Match Successful:**  
       - *Path 1:* Send to **Manager Approval** (Carlos).  
     - **Discrepancy Detected:**  
       - *Path 2:* Notify Purchasing (Dan) for resolution.  

3. **Discrepancy Resolution Subprocess:**  
   - If Dan resolves discrepancy → Return to **Match Invoice to PO**.  
   - If unresolved → Escalate to Rita.  
     - Rita coordinates with Karen (supplier contact) or department heads (retrospective PO).  
     - Once resolved → Return to **Match Invoice to PO**.  

4. **After Manager Approval:**  
   - **Gateway (Exclusive):**  
     - **Approved:** → **Schedule Payment**.  
     - **Rejected/Queried:** → Investigate (loop back to Purchasing or Rita).  

---

### **3. Gateways/Decision Points**  
- **Gateway 1 (PO Check):**  
  - *Condition:* "Does the invoice have a valid PO?"  
  - *Outcomes:* Reject invoice (no PO) or proceed.  
- **Gateway 2 (Invoice-PO Match):**  
  - *Condition:* "Do invoice line items match the PO?"  
  - *Outcomes:* Proceed to approval or trigger discrepancy resolution.  
- **Gateway 3 (Manager Approval):**  
  - *Condition:* "Is the invoice approved?"  
  - *Outcomes:* Schedule payment or re-investigate.

### **4. Roles/Participants**  
- **Primary Roles:**  
  - Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
  - Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
  - Department Manager (Carlos)  
  - Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
  - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)  
- **Secondary Roles:**  
  - Suppliers  
  - Department Heads (for retrospective POs)  

---

### **5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs**  
- **Key Artifacts:**  
  - Invoice (email)  
  - Purchase Order (PO)  
  - Confirmation Email (Purchasing → AP)  
  - Corrected Invoice (from supplier)  
  - Retrospective PO (exception path)  
  - Payment Schedule  

---

### **6. Exceptions/Variations**  
1. **Missing PO:**  
   - *Standard Path:* Invoice rejected and returned to supplier.  
   - *Exception Path (Rita):* Retrospective PO created for informal services.  

2. **Unresolved Discrepancies:**  
   - Loop between Purchasing, AP, and Rita/Karen until resolved.  

3. **Manager Queries:**  
   - Rare rejections trigger re-investigation (ambiguous whether loop returns to Purchasing or AP).  

---

### **Ambiguities/Conflicts**  
- **Missing PO Handling:**  
  - Mary states she sends invoices back immediately, but Rita’s account implies some exceptions bypass this (e.g., retrospective POs). Model includes both paths.  
- **Supplier Contact Responsibility:**  
  - Karen assists but is not always explicitly mentioned in initial steps. Noted as optional escalation.  
- **Post-Manager Rejection Flow:**  
  - Transcripts lack clarity on whether rejection loops back to Purchasing or AP. Assumed return to AP for triage.

**Final Notes:**  
This model prioritizes the most frequently described path while capturing critical exceptions. A visual BPMN diagram would highlight loops (e.g., discrepancy resolution) and parallel roles (Rita/Karen involvement).
