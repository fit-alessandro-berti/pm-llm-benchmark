The image you've provided appears to be a flowchart describing a process with several decision points and actions. Here’s a step-by-step description of the flow:

1. **Start**: The process begins.
2. **Register Request**: A request is registered.
3. **Decision Point**: From here two paths emerge based on a decision:
   - **Examine Thoroughly**: The request is examined thoroughly.
   - **Examine Casually**: The request is examined casually.
4. Both paths lead to the same action:
   - **Check Ticket**: The next step is verifying or checking a ticket.
5. **Decision**: Based on the result of the ticket check, another decision is made:
   - **Decide**: A decision about the request is made.
6. From the decision, the paths diverge into three possible outcomes:
   - **Reject Request**: The request might be rejected.
   - **Reinitiate Request**: The request might be sent back to a previous step for reevaluation or more information.
   - **Pay Compensation**: Alternatively, payment (compensation) may be issued.
7. **End**: Each of the three outcomes leads to the end of the process.

The flowchart uses standard symbols:
- Circles for the start and end points.
- Diamonds for decision points.
- Rectangles for processes or actions.

This type of flowchart is commonly used to document or design business processes, administrative systems, or software functions where decision-making and varied outcomes based on conditions are involved.
