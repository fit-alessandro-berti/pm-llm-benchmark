Here's a Python dictionary representing a **temporal profile** for the global supply chain process. This dictionary includes estimated average times and standard deviations for various activity pairs in the process:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (12, 3),  # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('OP', 'RC'): (20, 5),  # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3, 1),   # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('QI', 'CA'): (5, 2),   # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('CA', 'PT'): (7, 2),   # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('PT', 'PK'): (2, 1),   # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PK', 'WS'): (4, 1.5), # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('WS', 'DT'): (6, 3),   # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('DT', 'AS'): (8, 2),   # Distribution to After-Sales Support
    ('SS', 'CA'): (27, 6),  # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly (indirect connection)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (32, 8),  # Order Placement to Product Testing
    ('RC', 'DT'): (30, 7),  # Receive Components to Distribution
    ('QI', 'DT'): (25, 6),  # Quality Inspection to Distribution
    ('CA', 'AS'): (18, 4),  # Component Assembly to After-Sales Support
    ('PT', 'AS'): (15, 4),  # Product Testing to After-Sales Support
}
```

### Explanation of Key Patterns:

1. **Direct connections**: Activity pairs like `('PT', 'PK')` or `('RC', 'QI')` reflect their immediate temporal relationships, with relatively low deviations.
2. **Indirect connections**: Some pairs, such as `('SS', 'CA')` or `('OP', 'PT')`, consider multiple steps in the process and include higher average times and deviations to account for the variability in intermediate activities.
3. **Complex supply chain variability**: Factors such as supplier delays, manufacturing constraints, or distribution delays are abstracted into average and standard deviation estimates.

This temporal profile provides a representative model for the supply chain's temporal dynamics, balancing simplicity and complexity in describing activity sequences.
