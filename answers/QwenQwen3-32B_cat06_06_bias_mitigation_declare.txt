Okay, let's see. I need to modify the given DECLARE model to add constraints that reduce bias in a loan application process. The example model includes some existing constraints, and my task is to add new ones to ensure fairness regarding sensitive attributes like ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace.

First, I need to identify where bias might occur. The problem mentions that decisions like Approve or Reject could be influenced by sensitive attributes. For example, if a FinalDecision of Reject happens right after checking a sensitive attribute like ApplicantRace without any checks in between, that's a problem.

So, the plan is to add constraints that enforce certain conditions. Let's go through the possible constraints one by one.

1. **Coexistence:** Maybe require that whenever a decision is made for a sensitive applicant, a ManualReview must be present. For example, if there's a Reject_Minority activity, it must coexist with ManualReview. But wait, in the current model, there's a coexistence between StartApplication and FinalDecision. I need to add new coexistence constraints. Let's say if FinalDecision is Approve or Reject, and the applicant is from a sensitive group, then ManualReview must be present. But how to model that in DECLARE? DECLARE constraints are based on activities, not their attributes. So perhaps the activities themselves are labeled with the sensitive attributes. For example, maybe there are activities like CheckApplicantRace_Minority, and then decisions like Reject. But the example model doesn't have these activities yet. Wait, the initial model has StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo. The user might need to add new activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, etc. But the given model doesn't have them. However, the user's task is to add constraints to the existing model, so maybe I need to assume that such activities exist in the model. Wait, the initial model's example has StartApplication and FinalDecision. So perhaps I need to add new activities to the model. But the user's instruction says to add constraints to the existing model. Wait, the user's given model is the one provided, and I have to add new constraints. So I need to add constraints that involve new activities. But the problem says that the DECLARE model is a Python dictionary with certain keys. So I can assume that activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, etc., exist in the process. So I need to add constraints involving these activities.

For example, adding a coexistence constraint between Reject and ManualReview when the applicant is in a sensitive group. But DECLARE constraints are not conditional on attributes but on activities. So if there is an activity like Reject_Minority, then coexistence with ManualReview. Alternatively, if the process has activities like CheckApplicantRace, then we can add constraints that after that activity, certain steps are required.

Another approach is to ensure that any decision (like Approve or Reject) cannot immediately follow a CheckApplicantRace activity without an intervening activity (like ManualReview). That would require a response or precedence constraint.

Let me think of possible constraints:

- **Non-succession between sensitive checks and decisions:** For example, prevent a direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject. This would use the 'nonsuccession' constraint. So adding a nonsuccession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and Reject.

- **Response constraint:** After CheckApplicantRace, there must be a ManualReview before any decision. So, for example, a response constraint where CheckApplicantRace must be followed by ManualReview. Also, perhaps a precedence constraint that ManualReview must come before Reject.

- **Coexistence:** When a decision is made (like Approve or Reject), ManualReview must be present in the same trace. So adding a coexistence constraint between Approve and ManualReview, and between Reject and ManualReview.

But wait, the example model's coexistence is between StartApplication and FinalDecision. So adding new coexistence entries for other activities.

Also, the problem mentions that for binary constraints, the structure is activity1 maps to activity2 with support and confidence. So for coexistence, each pair is bidirectional? Or does it depend on the constraint type. DECLARE's coexistence is symmetric, I think. So adding coexistence between Reject and ManualReview would require that if Reject is present, ManualReview is present, and vice versa. But maybe that's too strong. Alternatively, maybe it's better to have a responded existence constraint. For example, if a decision is made, then a ManualReview must have occurred. But the 'responded existence' constraint is that if A occurs, then B must occur (but not necessarily in order). But if I want that whenever a decision is made, a ManualReview has occurred, then I can add a responded existence from the decision to ManualReview. However, the problem is that the existing model may not have ManualReview as an activity. But since the user is allowed to add new constraints, perhaps adding new activities is part of the model. However, the initial model doesn't have these activities. But maybe the model is to be extended with these activities. Wait, the initial model's given example includes StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo. So perhaps the user is to add constraints involving new activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, etc. But the user's task is to add constraints to the existing model. So I need to assume that these activities are present. Therefore, adding constraints involving them.

Let me outline the possible new constraints:

1. **Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject:** To prevent a direct succession from checking a sensitive attribute to a decision. This would use the 'nonsuccession' constraint. So adding to 'nonsuccession' a mapping from CheckApplicantRace to Reject with support and confidence 1.0.

2. **Response constraint from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview:** Ensuring that whenever CheckApplicantRace occurs, it must be followed by ManualReview. So adding a 'response' constraint from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview.

3. **Precedence constraint from ManualReview to Reject:** So that Reject can only occur after ManualReview. This would use the 'precedence' constraint, mapping Reject to ManualReview. Wait, precedence is A must precede B. So if we have a precedence constraint from A to B, then every occurrence of B must be preceded by A. So if we want Reject to be preceded by ManualReview, then the precedence constraint is from ManualReview to Reject. Wait, no. Precedence is A must precede B. So if we have a precedence constraint for (A, B), then every occurrence of B must be preceded by an occurrence of A. Therefore, to ensure that Reject is preceded by ManualReview, we need a precedence constraint where ManualReview is A and Reject is B. Wait, no. Wait, the precedence constraint is that if B occurs, then A must have occurred before. So to enforce that every Reject is preceded by ManualReview, the precedence constraint would be (ManualReview, Reject). So in the 'precedence' part of the model, add an entry for Reject pointing to ManualReview? Wait, no. The structure for precedence is similar to response. For example, in the existing model, there's a 'response' from StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo. That means StartApplication must be followed by RequestAdditionalInfo. For precedence, if we have a precedence from A to B, then every occurrence of B must be preceded by A. So for the constraint that Reject must be preceded by ManualReview, we need a precedence constraint where A is ManualReview and B is Reject. Therefore, in the 'precedence' dictionary, under the key Reject, we add ManualReview with the support and confidence. Wait, the structure for binary constraints is that for a constraint type like precedence, it's a dictionary where each key is the activity B (the one that must be preceded), and the value is a dictionary mapping the activity A (the one that must precede) to the support and confidence. So in this case, for the precedence constraint (ManualReview, Reject), the key in 'precedence' would be 'Reject', and the value would be {'ManualReview': { ... }}.

So adding to the 'precedence' section: 'Reject' maps to 'ManualReview' with support and confidence 1.0.

4. **Coexistence between Reject and ManualReview:** Ensuring that whenever a Reject occurs, a ManualReview is present in the trace. This would be a coexistence constraint. So in the 'coexistence' section, add an entry for 'Reject' mapping to 'ManualReview', and also 'ManualReview' mapping to 'Reject' (since coexistence is symmetric). Wait, DECLARE's coexistence is symmetric. So adding a coexistence between Reject and ManualReview would require that whenever one is present, the other is present. But if we only want that whenever Reject is present, ManualReview is present, but not necessarily the other way around, perhaps a 'responded_existence' would be better. For example, a 'responded_existence' from Reject to ManualReview. That would mean that if Reject occurs, then ManualReview must occur. But coexistence requires both directions. So perhaps using responded existence is better here. Let me check.

The 'responded_existence' constraint is that if A occurs, then B must occur (but not necessarily after). So if I want that whenever a decision (like Reject) is made, there's a ManualReview, then a 'responded_existence' from Reject to ManualReview would ensure that. So adding to 'responded_existence' an entry where Reject maps to ManualReview.

Alternatively, if the decision is made for a sensitive applicant, but DECLARE doesn't have conditions on attributes. So perhaps the activity names are such as 'Reject_Minority', and we can add coexistence between that and ManualReview. But the initial model doesn't have such activities. Assuming that the model includes activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, Approve, Reject, etc.

So let's proceed with adding the following constraints:

- **Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject:** To prevent direct succession from checking a sensitive attribute to a rejection decision.

- **Response from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview:** Ensures that after checking the applicant's race, a manual review must be done.

- **Precedence from ManualReview to Reject:** Ensures that a rejection can only happen after a manual review.

- **Responded existence from Reject to ManualReview:** Ensures that whenever a rejection occurs, a manual review has occurred.

Wait, but the precedence constraint already ensures that Reject is preceded by ManualReview. However, that only applies if the ManualReview is before the Reject. But what if the ManualReview is after? The precedence constraint would not cover that. Wait, no. The precedence constraint requires that every occurrence of Reject is preceded by ManualReview. So the ManualReview must occur before the Reject. However, the 'responded existence' would require that whenever a Reject occurs, a ManualReview occurs (anywhere in the trace). But if we have the precedence constraint, then the ManualReview must occur before the Reject, so the responded existence is redundant. But maybe adding both would be redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the 'responded existence' is not needed if we have the precedence constraint. However, the precedence constraint only ensures that each Reject is preceded by a ManualReview. But there could be multiple Rejects, and each must be preceded by a ManualReview. However, the 'responded existence' would require that for each Reject, there's at least one ManualReview in the trace. But if the precedence constraint is in place, then each Reject is preceded by a ManualReview, so the 'responded existence' is redundant. So maybe the precedence constraint is sufficient here. However, maybe adding a coexistence constraint between ManualReview and Reject would ensure that whenever a Reject happens, a ManualReview is present. But coexistence is symmetric. So perhaps using 'responded existence' is better.

Alternatively, maybe adding a 'coexistence' between ManualReview and Reject. But again, coexistence is symmetric, so that would require that whenever a ManualReview is present, a Reject is present, which is not desired. So better to use 'responded existence'.

So let's proceed with adding:

- **nonsuccession**: CheckApplicantRace  Reject.

- **response**: CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview.

- **precedence**: Reject  ManualReview (i.e., ManualReview must precede Reject).

Wait, no. Precedence is A must precede B. So if we want that every occurrence of B (Reject) is preceded by A (ManualReview), then the precedence constraint is A  B. Wait, no. The precedence constraint is that for every occurrence of B, there must be a prior occurrence of A. So the constraint is A must precede B. Therefore, the constraint is (A, B) = (ManualReview, Reject). So in the 'precedence' dictionary, under the key 'Reject', we have 'ManualReview' as the value. So:

precedence: {
    "Reject": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

This would enforce that every Reject is preceded by a ManualReview.

Additionally, adding a 'responded_existence' from Reject to ManualReview might not be necessary if the precedence constraint is in place, but perhaps it's redundant.

Now, considering the example model's existing constraints, the 'response' has StartApplication  RequestAdditionalInfo. So adding a response from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview would ensure that after CheckApplicantRace, a ManualReview occurs.

Now, let's think about other possible constraints. For example, ensuring that decisions like Approve or Reject cannot immediately follow a CheckApplicantRace without a ManualReview. So the nonsuccession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject, and also between CheckApplicantRace and Approve? Or maybe only for Reject? Depending on the scenario. Suppose that both Approve and Reject should not directly follow CheckApplicantRace. So adding nonsuccession for both.

But the example given in the problem mentions that a FinalDecision of Reject might occur more frequently after seeing attributes like ApplicantRace: Minority. So perhaps the main concern is with Reject, but maybe Approve as well. But for simplicity, maybe focus on Reject first.

Another constraint could be that any decision (Approve or Reject) must be preceded by a ManualReview. So adding precedence constraints for both Approve and Reject requiring ManualReview to precede them.

So, adding to 'precedence' for both Approve and Reject:

precedence: {
    "Approve": {"ManualReview": ...},
    "Reject": {"ManualReview": ...}
}

But the initial model doesn't have an 'Approve' activity. Wait, the example model has 'FinalDecision' in existence. So maybe the actual decision activities are part of the process. For example, perhaps the 'FinalDecision' activity is followed by an Approve or Reject. But the model as given doesn't have those. But the user is to add constraints involving these activities. Therefore, assuming that the model includes activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, Approve, Reject.

But since the initial model doesn't have these, perhaps the user is to add them. However, the problem says that the given model is the one to modify. Wait, the given model is an example. The user's task is to add constraints to the model. So perhaps the model already includes these activities. For example, the 'FinalDecision' activity may have sub-activities, but DECLARE is activity-based. So perhaps the model includes activities like 'Approve', 'Reject', 'CheckApplicantRace', 'ManualReview'.

Therefore, assuming that these activities are present in the model, I can proceed to add constraints involving them.

So, putting it all together, here are the new constraints to add:

1. **nonsuccession** between CheckApplicantRace and Reject.

2. **response** from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview.

3. **precedence** for Reject requiring ManualReview.

Additionally, perhaps a **coexistence** between Reject and ManualReview to ensure that whenever a Reject occurs, a ManualReview is present. But with the precedence constraint, this is already enforced, since the ManualReview must occur before the Reject, so it's present. However, the coexistence constraint would ensure that even if there are multiple ManualReviews, but maybe not necessary. Alternatively, maybe a 'responded_existence' from Reject to ManualReview, which would require that whenever a Reject occurs, there is a ManualReview in the trace. But the precedence constraint already ensures that the ManualReview occurs before the Reject, so this is redundant. However, if there are multiple Rejects, each must be preceded by a ManualReview. So the 'responded_existence' is redundant here. Therefore, perhaps it's better to stick with the precedence and response constraints.

Another possible constraint is to ensure that after a ManualReview, a decision must follow. For example, a 'response' from ManualReview to Approve or Reject. But that might not be necessary. The problem is to prevent biased decisions, not to enforce that all ManualReviews lead to a decision.

So the main constraints are:

- No direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject.

- After CheckApplicantRace, a ManualReview must occur.

- Any Reject must be preceded by a ManualReview.

Now, adding these to the model.

In the given model, the 'nonsuccession' is empty. So adding to 'nonsuccession' a key for CheckApplicantRace to Reject.

For the 'response' constraint, adding to the 'response' dictionary an entry for CheckApplicantRace mapping to ManualReview.

For the 'precedence' constraint, adding to the 'precedence' dictionary an entry for Reject mapping to ManualReview.

Additionally, perhaps adding a similar constraint for Approve. For example, if Approve is also a decision that could be biased, then adding the same precedence and response constraints. But the problem example focuses on Reject. However, to be thorough, maybe include both.

But the initial model's 'existence' includes 'StartApplication' and 'FinalDecision'. If 'Approve' and 'Reject' are part of the process, they should be in the 'existence' as well. However, the initial model may not have them. But since the user is to add constraints, perhaps adding them to the 'existence' is necessary. Wait, the problem says to preserve the format. The existing model has 'existence' with StartApplication and FinalDecision. If the new constraints involve activities not present in the 'existence', then maybe we need to add them. For example, if we add a 'ManualReview' activity, we should add it to 'existence' with support and confidence 1.0. But the problem says to add new constraints that limit bias. So if the model doesn't have 'ManualReview' as an existing activity, adding it to 'existence' would be necessary. However, the initial model's 'existence' only has StartApplication and FinalDecision. Therefore, to include ManualReview in existence, we need to add it.

But the problem says that the initial model is given, and we need to add new constraints. Therefore, perhaps the user is allowed to add new activities to the model. However, the problem's example shows that the 'existence' key has StartApplication and FinalDecision. So if we add a new activity like ManualReview, we need to add it to 'existence' as well. But the user's instructions don't mention adding new activities, only adding new constraints. Wait, the instructions say to "insert new DECLARE constraints into the model". So perhaps adding new activities is allowed, but the problem's example doesn't include them. However, the initial model may not have the activities required for the new constraints. Therefore, perhaps the user is to assume that these activities are already present. For example, the 'ManualReview' activity is part of the process, and thus is in the 'existence' of the model. Therefore, in the given model, perhaps the 'existence' should include ManualReview, CheckApplicantRace, etc. But since the initial model doesn't have them, maybe the user is to add them as part of the new constraints. But the problem's instruction says to add new constraints, not new activities. This is a bit ambiguous. However, the problem says that the DECLARE model is a Python dictionary with particular keys. Therefore, if the new constraints involve new activities, they must be added to the existing constraints. For example, adding existence for ManualReview.

So, for example, adding to 'existence' the ManualReview activity.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Add ManualReview to 'existence'.

2. Add CheckApplicantRace to 'existence'.

3. Add the new constraints as discussed.

But the initial model's 'existence' only includes StartApplication and FinalDecision. So adding new activities to 'existence' would be part of the modifications.

But the problem's instruction says to add new constraints, not new activities. However, without the activities, the constraints can't be added. Therefore, perhaps the user is to assume that these activities are present. Alternatively, the problem may expect that the activities are already in the model. For example, the 'CheckApplicantRace' activity is part of the process, and thus is in the 'existence' key. Therefore, in the given model, it's not present, but the user is to add constraints involving it. But without adding it to 'existence', the existence constraint would not require it to be present. However, the DECLARE constraints like 'response' and 'precedence' can involve activities not in 'existence'? Or does 'existence' enforce that the activity must appear at least once in the trace? Well, the 'existence' constraint in DECLARE requires that the activity appears at least once. So if we add a 'response' constraint from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview, but CheckApplicantRace is not in 'existence', then the process may not require CheckApplicantRace to be present. However, the problem scenario involves sensitive attributes, so perhaps the process does include these activities. Therefore, to properly model the constraints, we need to add CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview to 'existence'.

Therefore, adding to 'existence' the activities CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview, with support and confidence 1.0.

Now, putting it all together:

The updated declare_model will have:

- In 'existence': added CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview.

- In 'response': added CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview.

- In 'precedence': added Reject  ManualReview.

- In 'nonsuccession': added CheckApplicantRace  Reject.

Additionally, perhaps adding a nonsuccession from CheckApplicantRace to Approve if needed. But the problem example focuses on Reject.

So the final model would look like:

declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {
        # Maybe adding here if needed
    },
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {
        "Reject": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    "noncoexistence": {},
    "nonsuccession": {
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonsuccession": {}
}

Wait, in the 'nonsuccession' part, it's a dictionary where each key is the source activity, and the value is a dictionary of target activities. So for the nonsuccession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject, it would be:

"nonsuccession": {
    "CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
}

Additionally, the 'response' now includes the new entry for CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview.

The 'precedence' now includes the entry for Reject  ManualReview.

The 'existence' includes the new activities.

But wait, the initial model's 'response' already has StartApplication  RequestAdditionalInfo. Now adding CheckApplicantRace  ManualReview.

Also, the 'precedence' is now adding that Reject must be preceded by ManualReview.

Now, the rationale for each added constraint:

1. **Existence of CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview:** Ensures that these activities are present in every trace, which is necessary for the other constraints to take effect.

2. **Response from CheckApplicantRace to ManualReview:** Ensures that after checking the applicant's race, a manual review must be conducted, preventing biased decisions from being made without oversight.

3. **Precedence from ManualReview to Reject:** Ensures that any rejection decision must be preceded by a manual review, which helps ensure that the decision is fair and not based solely on sensitive attributes.

4. **Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject:** Prevents a direct sequence from checking a sensitive attribute to a rejection decision, which could indicate bias without an intervening review step.

These constraints collectively ensure that decisions are made with appropriate checks and balances, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes.

### **Rationale for Added Constraints**

1. **Existence of `CheckApplicantRace` and `ManualReview`:**  
   Ensures these activities are mandatory in every process trace, enabling oversight mechanisms to be enforced.

2. **Response Constraint: `CheckApplicantRace`  `ManualReview`:**  
   Prevents sensitive attribute checks from directly leading to decisions. A manual review must occur after assessing race, ensuring human intervention before finalizing outcomes.

3. **Precedence Constraint: `Reject`  `ManualReview`:**  
   Guarantees that all rejection decisions are preceded by a manual review, reducing the risk of automated or biased rejections based on sensitive attributes.

4. **Non-Succession Constraint: `CheckApplicantRace`  `Reject`:**  
   Prohibits direct transitions from checking a sensitive attribute (e.g., race) to a rejection decision. This avoids scenarios where rejections are disproportionately linked to sensitive attributes without mitigation.

---

### **Impact on Bias Mitigation**

These constraints enforce fairness by:
- **Introducing oversight** (e.g., `ManualReview`) after sensitive attribute checks.
- **Blocking direct biased paths** (e.g., from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`).
- **Requiring deliberate, human-in-the-loop decisions** for rejections, ensuring they are not automatically tied to sensitive attributes.
