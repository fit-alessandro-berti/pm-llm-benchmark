## Anomalies, Hypotheses, and Verification Queries for Claim Handling Process

**Anomalies:**

*   **Receive (R) to Approve (P):** A relatively short average time (approximately 25 hours) with a very low standard deviation suggests a highly rigid and potentially artificial approval schedule.
*   **Approve (P) to Notify (N):** A long average time (7 days) with a substantial standard deviation (2 days) indicates significant delays or inconsistencies in customer notification.
*   **Assign (A) to Close (C):** A short average time (2 hours) suggests claims are being closed prematurely, potentially without proper evaluation or approval.
*   **Evaluate (E) to Notify (N):** A very short average time (5 minutes) suggests a potentially unrealistic or skipped transition, possibly indicating missing steps.

**Hypotheses:**

*   **R to P:** The short approval time might be due to automated approval for low-value claims or a pre-defined rule set. Alternatively, it could indicate that the "Approve" event is being recorded prematurely, before all necessary checks are completed.
*   **P to N:** The long delay in notification could be caused by a backlog in the notification system, limited resources dedicated to customer communication, or manual intervention required before notification can be sent.
*   **A to C:** Premature closure could be due to incorrect data entry, a system bug, or a process where certain claims are automatically closed after assignment under specific conditions (e.g., duplicate claims).
*   **E to N:** The rapid transition from evaluation to notification might be due to a system error, a misinterpretation of the "Notify" event (e.g., internal notification rather than customer notification), or a process where notification is triggered automatically upon evaluation without further review.

**Verification Queries:**

1.  **Identify claims exceeding the expected R to P time:**

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    (timestamp_p - timestamp_r) AS time_to_approve
FROM (
    SELECT
        ce_r.claim_id,
        MAX(ce_r.timestamp) AS timestamp_r,
        MAX(ce_p.timestamp) AS timestamp_p
    FROM claim_events ce_r
    JOIN claim_events ce_p ON ce_r.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id
    WHERE ce_r.activity = 'R' AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
    GROUP BY ce_r.claim_id
) AS subquery
WHERE time_to_approve > INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

2.  **Identify claims with excessively long P to N delays:**

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id,
    (timestamp_n - timestamp_p) AS time_to_notify
FROM (
    SELECT
        ce_p.claim_id,
        MAX(ce_p.timestamp) AS timestamp_p,
        MAX(ce_n.timestamp) AS timestamp_n
    FROM claim_events ce_p
    JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
    WHERE ce_p.activity = 'P' AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
    GROUP BY ce_p.claim_id
) AS subquery
WHERE time_to_notify > INTERVAL '7 days';
```

3.  **Identify claims closed immediately after assignment:**

```sql
SELECT
    claim_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        ce_a.claim_id,
        MAX(ce_a.timestamp) AS timestamp_a,
        MAX(ce_c.timestamp) AS timestamp_c
    FROM claim_events ce_a
    JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
    WHERE ce_a.activity = 'A' AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
    GROUP BY ce_a.claim_id
) AS subquery
WHERE timestamp_c - timestamp_a < INTERVAL '2 hours';
```

4.  **Investigate if specific adjusters contribute to long P to N delays:**

```sql
SELECT
    a.name,
    AVG((ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp)) AS avg_delay
FROM claim_events ce_p
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON ce_p.resource = a.adjuster_id
WHERE ce_p.activity = 'P' AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY avg_delay DESC;
```

5.  **Check if claims closed quickly after assignment have a specific claim type:**

```sql
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    COUNT(subquery.claim_id) AS count
FROM (
    SELECT
        claim_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            ce_a.claim_id,
            MAX(ce_a.timestamp) AS timestamp_a,
            MAX(ce_c.timestamp) AS timestamp_c
        FROM claim_events ce_a
        JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
        WHERE ce_a.activity = 'A' AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
        GROUP BY ce_a.claim_id
    ) AS subquery2
    WHERE timestamp_c - timestamp_a < INTERVAL '2 hours'
) AS subquery
JOIN claims c ON subquery.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_type;
```
