<think>We have a prompt: "Prompt for the Benchmark:" with instructions about writing a SQL query in DuckDB to identify rows from event_log table with columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. The goal: Exclude any case that contains a specific sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then 'Create Order' then 'Confirm Order'. And among those sequences if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. But we need to exclude these events from final output. Therefore, query should return all events from event_log except those belonging to cases that have that sequence with the timing condition.

Wait, check instructions: "Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`" and columns: case_id, activity, timestamp.
We need to write a SQL query that:

1. Identify any case (case_id) that contains a sequence of three events exactly in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then 'Create Order' then 'Confirm Order'. So they must appear consecutively in the order of the event_log ordering? But "direct succession" means no other event from same case in between them. Therefore, we need to detect that in each case, if there is an event with activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and following immediately (with no events in between) event for which its preceding event's timestamp is just before the next event? But how do we identify "direct succession"? Possibly use window functions: Lag function. But then check that the subsequent rows have exactly these values.

We can assume that if rows are ordered by timestamp, then the three events should be consecutive in the ordering. So maybe using self join or partition windows and compare row numbers. We need to join event_log with itself: first alias is e1 for 'Approve Purchase Requisition', second alias e2 for 'Create Order' where e2 has exactly one row after e1 (maybe using row_number partitioned by case_id sorted by timestamp, then check if row number difference equals 1), and third alias e3 for 'Confirm Order' with similar condition. Then further filter that the time elapsed between e2.timestamp and e3.timestamp is more than 5 days.

But instructions says "direct succession", meaning they must appear consecutively in the log ordering (I assume sorted by timestamp). And then we need to exclude those cases from final result.
We want final query: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (list of case_ids that satisfy these conditions)? But careful: if one sequence appears multiple times, it's still the same case id. So yes.

So I can write a subquery that identifies all distinct case ids that have at least one occurrence of these sequences with time difference > 5 days. Then final SELECT * FROM event_log where case_id not in (subquery result).

We want to exclude events from cases matching both criteria.
Therefore, query can be:

WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT e1.case_id
    FROM event_log e1 
    JOIN event_log e2 on e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.timestamp > e1.timestamp
    JOIN event_log e3 on e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      -- We require that these events are consecutive. 
      -- How to enforce consecutiveness?
      -- If we assume ordering by timestamp, then for them to be consecutive, the row number difference should equal 1.
      -- Use window function or self join with LAG and LEAD?
    AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (e2.timestamp - e1.timestamp)) / 86400) < 1? No, that's not given. But "direct succession" means there is no event between them.
    But wait, "direct succession" implies the next activity right after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' in ordering should be 'Create Order'. How to enforce this condition? Possibly use row_number() function with partition by case_id and order by timestamp.

    Alternatively, join using LAG and LEAD window functions. For each event_log, we can compute previous_event and next_event.

Maybe do something like:
WITH events AS (
   SELECT *, 
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn,
          LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
          LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity
   FROM event_log
)
Then find sequences: Look for events e where activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the following row's activity is exactly 'Create Order', and then two rows later the activity equals 'Confirm Order'.

But if we want to use self join, can do:
WITH numbered AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT DISTINCT n1.case_id 
FROM numbered n1
JOIN numbered n2 ON n1.case_id = n2.case_id AND n2.rn = n1.rn + 1
JOIN numbered n3 ON n2.case_id = n3.case_id AND n3.rn = n2.rn + 1
WHERE n1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND n2.activity = 'Create Order'
  AND n3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (EXTRACT(DAY FROM (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp)) > 5)
But note: "more than 5 days" means strictly greater than 5 days. But using EXTRACT(EPOCH from difference) divided by 86400, then check if that is > 5.

Alternatively, you can use TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, ... ) but not sure if DuckDB supports that function. But since it's DuckDB and supports window functions, we may need to do something like: (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > interval '5 days' maybe? But careful: The "timestamp" column is a timestamp type. We can check if the difference is greater than 5 days by comparing with an interval literal.
We can write:
WHERE n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
But need to confirm syntax for DuckDB. Possibly use e.g.: WHERE DATE(n3.timestamp) - DATE(n2.timestamp) > 5 maybe.

Alternatively, we can do: 
(DATEDIFF('day', n2.timestamp, n3.timestamp)) > 5
If DATEDIFF exists in DuckDB? Might check documentation but I'll assume that we can use INTERVAL arithmetic.

I recall that DuckDB SQL supports "INTERVAL" keyword. So probably: WHERE n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp > interval '5 days'.

But careful: The instructions say more than 5 days. That means if it's exactly 5 days, then it's not included, so strictly >.

The query should return all events from event_log that do NOT belong to these case_ids. So final query:
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT n1.case_id FROM numbered n1 ...
)

We can use a CTE with "filtered" as well.

Plan:

WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
  FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT n1.case_id
  FROM numbered n1
  JOIN numbered n2 ON n1.case_id = n2.case_id AND n2.rn = n1.rn + 1
  JOIN numbered n3 ON n2.case_id = n3.case_id AND n3.rn = n2.rn + 1
  WHERE n1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND n2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND n3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);

That should be correct.

But maybe need to ensure ordering. Also note: "direct succession" means no event in between them, so using row_number ensures that the three events are consecutive rows, because we use condition rn+1 for each join.

Alternatively, a self join solution with row_number computed on the fly is typical. Alternatively, could do something like:
WITH e AS (
   SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
   FROM event_log
)
SELECT e.*
FROM e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM e e2 WHERE e.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.activity='Approve Purchase Requisition'
  JOIN e e3 ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id and e3.rn = e2.rn + 1 WHERE e3.activity='Create Order'
  JOIN e e4 on e3.case_id = e4.case_id and e4.rn = e3.rn+1 
  AND e4.activity='Confirm Order' AND (e4.timestamp - e3.timestamp) > interval '5 days'
)
But that is a bit messy.

I'll use the CTE approach. Let's produce a query with three CTEs: one for numbering, one for filtering cases, and then final select.

We need to be careful that we don't have ambiguous columns from multiple tables. But it should be fine.

Alternatively, if not allowed to do window function, I can use self join on event_log table. But using window functions is more straightforward in SQL.

I'll produce answer:

WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
  FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT n1.case_id
  FROM numbered n1
  JOIN numbered n2 ON n1.case_id = n2.case_id AND n2.rn = n1.rn + 1
  JOIN numbered n3 ON n2.case_id = n3.case_id AND n3.rn = n2.rn + 1
  WHERE n1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND n2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND n3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);

That is the answer.

I can include commentary.

Since instructions require a final query that returns events from cases not meeting the criteria, then I need to use a NOT IN filter on case_id. So this seems correct.

Double-check conditions:
The three consecutive events in each case are detected using ROW_NUMBER and joining with condition rn+1.
Time difference condition: (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days' ensures that the gap between "Create Order" event and "Confirm Order" event is more than 5 days. So it matches.

I'll produce final answer accordingly.

I'll now produce final answer in plain text. We'll output query as text.

I'll produce final answer message with code block containing the SQL query in a text code block.</think>Below is one acceptable solution. In this example we first assign row numbers (using ROW_NUMBER) per case ordered by timestamp so that consecutive events have consecutive rn values. Then, using self-joins on these numbered rows we identify cases where an event with activity "Approve Purchase Requisition" is immediately followed (rn+1) by one with "Create Order" and then by one with "Confirm Order." Finally, among those sequences we check that the time difference between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" exceeds 5 days. We use these case_ids in a NOT IN clause so that our final result returns only events from cases that do not match both criteria.

Here is the complete query:

--------------------------------------------------
WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM event_log
),
filtered_cases AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT n1.case_id
  FROM numbered n1
  JOIN numbered n2 ON n1.case_id = n2.case_id AND n2.rn = n1.rn + 1
  JOIN numbered n3 ON n2.case_id = n3.case_id AND n3.rn = n2.rn + 1
  WHERE n1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND n2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND n3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
    -- Check that the time between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" is >5 days.
    AND (n3.timestamp - n2.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases);
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. The CTE “numbered” assigns a row number per case ordered by timestamp so that consecutive events have rn values that differ by 1.
2. In the CTE “filtered_cases” we join this numbered table with itself three times:
   • n1 holds the "Approve Purchase Requisition" event,
   • n2 (rn = n1.rn + 1) must be "Create Order",
   • n3 (rn = n2.rn + 1) must be "Confirm Order".
3. We then ensure that the time difference between n2 and n3 is more than 5 days.
4. Finally, we return all events from event_log except those whose case_id appears in filtered_cases.

This query meets the requirements by excluding any cases containing a direct “Approve Purchase Requisition”  “Create Order”  “Confirm Order” sequence where the time gap between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" is more than 5 days.
