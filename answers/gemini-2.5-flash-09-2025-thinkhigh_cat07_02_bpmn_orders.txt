This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram illustrating a cross-departmental business process, likely related to fulfilling a customer order. The process is divided into four horizontal lanes representing different organizational roles: **Sales, Production, Procurement,** and **Warehouse.**

## 1. Sales Lane (Process Initiation and Customer Handling)

The process begins in the Sales lane:

*   **Start Event:** The process is triggered by a Timer Start Event labeled **"Monday morning."**
*   **Initial Checks:** The flow proceeds sequentially through **"Check order for completeness"** and **"Check if customer is already in the database."**
*   **Customer Database Handling:** An Exclusive Gateway splits the flow based on the database check:
    *   If the **"Customer not in the database,"** a sequence of tasks is executed: **"Check customer's order"** followed by **"Add customer to the database"** (which interacts with a **Database** Data Object). This flow then merges back via another Exclusive Gateway labeled **"Customer in the database."**
*   **Order Distribution:** The flow converges into the task **"Send order details."** This task initiates concurrent processes in the Production and Procurement lanes via Message Flows.
*   **Final Steps:** The Sales lane process continues to an Intermediate Throw Event labeled **"Product sent"** (indicating the product has been shipped, confirmed by a message from the Warehouse lane), followed by the task **"Draft invoice,"** which leads to the final End Event.

## 2. Production Lane (Manufacturing)

The Production process is triggered by the Sales department:

*   **Start Event:** The process begins with a Message Catch Start Event receiving **"Order details arrive."**
*   **Planning and Execution:** The flow proceeds to an Exclusive Gateway, followed by the task **"Plan production."**
*   **Rework Loop:** After planning, a Parallel Gateway is encountered. This structure manages material quality:
    *   If the material is **"Material not faulty,"** the flow proceeds to **"Manufacture product."**
    *   If the material *is* faulty (implied by the loop connection coming back from the gateway), the flow cycles back to **"Plan production,"** suggesting a need to re-plan or adjust based on material availability.
*   **Completion Event:** After manufacturing, the flow ends with a Message Throw Intermediate Event labeled **"Product complete,"** which triggers the Warehouse process.

## 3. Procurement Lane (Material Compensation)

The Procurement process is initiated concurrently with Production:

*   **Start Event:** The process begins with a Message Catch Start Event receiving **"Order details arrive."**
*   **Subprocess:** The main activity is housed within a complex task, the **"Material Compensation Subprocess."**
    *   Inside the subprocess, materials are **"Order materials."**
    *   **Compensation:** This task has an associated Compensation Intermediate Event (double-lined circle) linked to a Compensation Handler task **"Return material,"** which indicates how to undo or compensate for the ordering step if necessary (e.g., if the order needs to be reversed).
*   **Checks and Cancellation:** After the subprocess, the flow proceeds to **"Check materials."**
    *   **Interrupting Event:** An Interrupting Error Intermediate Event (lightning bolt) attached to "Check materials" is labeled **"Order cancellation."** If this error occurs, the entire process terminates via a Terminate End Event (thick-bordered circle).
*   **End Event:** If materials are checked successfully and no cancellation occurs, the process ends with a simple End Event.

## 4. Warehouse Lane (Shipping)

The Warehouse process is triggered by the completion of manufacturing:

*   **Start Event:** The process begins with a Message Catch Start Event receiving **"Product complete"** (sent from the Production lane).
*   **Action and Message:** The task is **"Send product."**
*   **End Event:** The process concludes with a Message Throw End Event labeled **"Product sent,"** which confirms shipment and is linked back to the Intermediate Catch Event in the Sales lane.

## Summary of Interactions

The diagram highlights concurrent flows and explicit message exchanges:

1.  **Sales** initiates **Production** and **Procurement** concurrently using the **"Order details"** message.
2.  **Production** signals **Warehouse** when the product is ready using the **"Product complete"** message.
3.  **Warehouse** signals **Sales** when the shipment is complete using the **"Product sent"** message, allowing Sales to draft the invoice.
4.  **Procurement** includes a cancellation path that can terminate the entire order process if materials fail inspection.
