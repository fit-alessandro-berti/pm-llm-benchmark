Here are 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions based on the pseudo-BPMN representation of the multinational smartphone supply chain process:

1. **Process Rationale and Justification**
	1. Why is market research conducted as the first step, and how does it influence the subsequent design and component procurement processes?
	2. How does the use of multiple parallel tasks in component procurement impact the overall efficiency of the supply chain process?
	3. What are the reasons for choosing Malaysia as the assembly location, and how does this decision affect cost, logistics, and delivery timelines?
2. **Process Improvements**
	4. How can the process be improved to ensure faster procurement of components, especially from distant locations?
	5. What steps can be taken to reduce the time or complexity at the parallel gateways while maintaining the same level of efficiency?
	6. Are there alternative ways to conduct the quality checks to further streamline the process after assembly?
3. **Risk Management and Contingency Planning**
	7. What are the risks associated with sourcing components from multiple countries, and how does the process address geopolitical or supply chain disruptions?
	8. How is the quality of components from different suppliers ensured before they are shipped to the assembly plant?
	9. What contingency plans exist if any component procurement task faces a delay or disruption?
4. **Decision-Making and Trade-offs**
	10. How are decisions made when choosing whether to scrap or rework defective smartphones during the quality assurance process?
	11. What are the trade-offs between using air freight and cargo ships for delivering smartphones to different markets?
	12. How does the process determine which markets should be prioritized for air freight versus sea freight shipments?
5. **Stakeholder Communication**
	13. What communication channels or tools are used to coordinate procurement, assembly, and distribution tasks across multiple countries and teams?
	14. How are manufacturers and suppliers informed about changes in demand forecasts, and what challenges exist in maintaining this communication?
	15. How is real-time information shared across the supply chain to ensure efficient coordination between assembly and distribution?
6. **Performance Measurement**
	16. What key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to measure the performance of each task within this supply chain?
	17. How is the efficiency of the assembly process measured, especially during the 24/7 operation phase?
	18. How are the effectiveness and accuracy of the inventory monitoring and sales forecasting being evaluated?
7. **Sustainability and Future Adaptations**
	19. What sustainability measures are in place to manage the environmental impact of logistics operations, such as air freight emissions or packaging waste?
	20. How can this process be adapted to respond to market fluctuations, such as a surge in demand or a sudden decrease in sales during the sales cycle?
