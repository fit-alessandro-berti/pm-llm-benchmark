The data you're presenting seems to be from a business process related to handling declarations (likely expense reports or claims) submitted by employees, with multiple roles (e.g., employees, administrators, supervisors, budget owners, etc.) involved in the approval/rejection of these declarations. This process involves numerous variations of interacting events and decisions, leading to different outcomes such as requests for payment, rejection, re-submission, or saving.

### General Process Description:
1. **Declaration Submission**:
    - The process generally starts when an **EMPLOYEE submits a declaration**. This submission is critical as this declaration needs to be reviewed or processed by other stakeholders.
    - In some cases, the process might involve simply **saving the declaration**, where no follow-up action takes place yet (no submission for approval).

2. **Review and Approval Layers**:
    - Once the EMPLOYEE submits the declaration, there are multiple potential layers of approval, depending on the configuration of the process or roles involved in different declarations.
    - The declaration could be approved by roles such as:
      - **ADMINISTRATION**
      - **PRE_APPROVER**
      - **BUDGET OWNER**
      - **SUPERVISOR**
    - Approval routes differ based on the specific process instance, but the role of the **SUPERVISOR (FINAL_APPROVED phase)** seems to be critical as the last checkpoint before the declaration is processed for payment.
    - If the declaration is approved by all necessary parties, **a request for payment** is initiated, eventually resulting in the declaration being handled (paid).

3. **Rejection and Resubmission**:
    - Rejection events frequently occur. This particularly involves:
      - **ADMINISTRATION**
      - **SUPERVISOR**
      - **PRE_APPROVER**
      - **BUDGET OWNER**
    - In cases of rejection, the declaration is typically sent back to the EMPLOYEE for modifications or clarifications, and the EMPLOYEE may resubmit it after handling the reasons for rejection.
    - In some variants, declarations are rejected more than once (even multiple rejections by different roles), leading to prolonged processes.

4. **Final Outcome - Payment or Abandonment**:
    - If the declaration goes through all required approvals successfully (i.e., approved by ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR, etc.), the process follows with a **payment request** and subsequent handling of the payment.
    - However, in some cases, the declaration could be **completely abandoned or rejected**, leading to termination without a payment request being initiated.

5. **Performance Insights**:
    - Each process variant also has performance data. Performance here likely refers to the **time taken (in seconds) to complete the entire process** for that particular variant.
    - Variants with multiple rejections, resubmissions, and extra approval steps tend to have significantly higher **performance values (indicating delays)** compared to more streamlined cases where the declaration is approved in fewer steps.
    - The simple process path directly leading to approval and payment follows a **much faster performance**, while cases with multiple rejections and back-and-forth approval cycles tend to take much longer.

### Some Common Paths Noted:

1. **Simplest Path**:
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**.
   - This path description suggests that the declaration skips certain layers of approval (e.g., ADMINISTRATION or PRE_APPROVER), resulting in faster completion times. (Frequency: 1392; Performance: ~850,000 seconds)

2. **Standard Two-Layer Approval**:
   - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**.
   - This represents a more typical path with both ADMINISTRATION and SUPERVISOR checks, yet it's still relatively fast (~810,000 seconds). (Frequency: 4618)

3. **Introduction of PRE_APPROVER or BUDGET OWNER**:
   - In more complex scenarios, a **BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER** also reviews the declaration. These roles tend to add more steps, complexity, and time. For instance:
     - **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled**. Performance: ~1 million seconds. (Frequency: 2473)
   
4. **Rejection-Heavy Paths and Loops**:
   - Several paths show declarations going through **multiple rejection and resubmission cycles**, where rejections by ADMINISTRATION or SUPERVISOR cause delays, and the EMPLOYEE is forced to resubmit. These processes involve significant delays (with performances exceeding 2 or 3 million seconds in some rare cases).
   - For instance:
     - **Declaration with ADMINISTRATION rejection and multiple EMPLOYEE resubmissions** could lead up to performance times over **2.5 million seconds**. (Frequency: 36)

### Observations on Frequency of Variants:
- The most frequent variants in the data are:
  - **Straight-forward approvals**: Declaration submitted, approved, and paid without much back-and-forth (e.g., 4618 and 2473 frequencies).
  - **Rejection routes** exist but are far less frequent. Rejection usually happens in rare cases (< 100 frequencies), but those processes tend to be more time-consuming.
  - **Loopy variants** involving multiple rejection-resubmission cycles are particularly rare (single-digit frequencies like 4-8), but they disproportionately contribute to process slowdowns.

### Summary:
The underlying process involves handling declarations submitted by employees, which are reviewed by various stakeholders (ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR) based on process rules. The main outcome is either:
  - **Successful approval leading to payment**, OR
  - **Rejection and resubmission cycles** leading to potential delays and rework.

Processes with fewer roles involved or less rework tend to complete faster, while more complex processes involving multiple layers of rejection and resubmission can drag on for significantly longer periods of time.
