The picture is a BPMN 2.0 process diagram that shows, end-to-end, how a customer order is handled in a manufacturing company.  
The canvas is divided into four horizontal swim-lanes that represent the company’s organisational units:

1. Sales (top lane)  
2. Production  
3. Procurement  
4. Warehouse (bottom lane)

Below is a verbal walk-through of the model, from left to right, lane by lane, noting the most important BPMN constructs that appear.


1. Sales lane

• The process is triggered by a single start event labelled “Monday morning”.  
• “Check order for completeness” – ordinary task.  
• Exclusive gateway – “Check if customer is already in the database”.  
  – If the customer is NOT known, the upper branch “Add customer to the database” is executed; afterwards flow rejoins the lower branch.  
• The order details are then packed into a message and sent to the next lanes using the task “Send order details”.  
  – Dashed lines leading out of the task are BPMN message flows; they show that the order details are sent to Production and Procurement.  
• Sales has nothing more to do until a dashed message labelled “Product sent” returns from Warehouse.  
• When that message arrives an inter-mediate message catch event fires and Sales drafts the invoice (final task).  
• A plain end event closes the Sales part.


2. Production lane

• The Production lane is started by the arrival of the “Order details” message (message start event on the left border).  
• “Plan production” – task.  
• After planning, Production needs materials. An exclusive gateway checks whether material is available or defective.  
  – If the material is faulty, a dashed message flow is thrown to Procurement so that material can be ordered/replaced.  
  – When correct material is on hand, the forward flow rejoins.  
• “Manufacture product” – task that actually builds the item.  
• A message end event labelled “Product complete” sends a message to the Warehouse lane and also (dashed) back to Sales to inform them that the product has been built.


3. Procurement lane

• Procurement is also triggered by the “Order details” message that originally came from Sales (message start event).  
• Procurement contains a collapsed (black-border) sub-process called “Material Compensation Sub-process”.  
  – Inside that subprocess the main path is “Order materials”.  
  – A compensation boundary event is attached to “Order materials”. If material arrives faulty, a compensation handler “Return material” is invoked to ship the faulty goods back to the supplier.  
• After materials arrive, they are inspected in “Check materials”.  
  – If the inspection fails, an exclusive gateway directs the flow to a signal end event “Order cancellation” (terminating the whole order).  
  – If the inspection is fine, Procurement just ends with a normal end event.


4. Warehouse lane

• Warehouse is started by the “Product complete” message coming from Production.  
• “Send product” – pick, pack and dispatch task.  
• A message end event “Product sent” informs Sales that the goods are on their way.  


Connecting logic & BPMN symbols

• Thick dashed arrows = BPMN message flows (cross-lane communication).  
• Thin solid arrows = sequence flow (inside a lane).  
• White diamonds = exclusive gateways (XOR).  
• Circle with envelope icon = message catch / throw events.  
• Circle with a little rewind icon on the boundary of a task = compensation boundary event.  
• Sub-process with a folded corner symbol = collapsed sub-process.  
• Normal end events are plain circles with a thicker rim.


Overall story the diagram tells

1. Sales receives an order, validates it and, if necessary, adds a new customer record.  
2. Sales distributes the order details to Production and Procurement.  
3. Production plans and manufactures the product; if no acceptable material is available it relies on Procurement to replace it.  
4. Procurement orders or replaces material and, when required, can return faulty goods (compensation).  
5. When production is complete the Warehouse ships the product.  
6. Shipment confirmation flows back to Sales, which drafts and issues the invoice, completing the case.
