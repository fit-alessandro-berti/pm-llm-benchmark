To achieve the task described in your prompt, we need a DuckDB query that filters `event_log` to exclude any case where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' occurs within 5 days of each other. The steps involved are:

1. Identify sequences matching the specified activities.
2. Check if there is more than a 5-day gap between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
3. Exclude these cases from the final result.

Here's how you can construct such a query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM event_log sub
    WHERE (sub.case_id = e.case_id)
      AND 
        ((sub.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND sub.timestamp < e.timestamp) OR
         (sub.activity = 'Create Order' AND sub.timestamp > e.timestamp))
      AND (
          (sub.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND sub.timestamp - e.timestamp <= 5 days) OR
          (sub.activity NOT IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') 
           AND sub.case_id = e.case_id)
      );
```

**Explanation:**

- **Outer Query:** We iterate over each row in `event_log` and check if it does not belong to a case that meets the specified criteria.
  
- **Subquery (WHERE NOT EXISTS):** The subquery looks for cases (`sub`) within the same `case_id` of `e` where:
  - There is an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event immediately preceding any 'Create Order' or 
  - An 'Confirm Order' occurs after a 'Create Order', with no more than a 5-day gap.
  
- **Filtering:** The `NOT EXISTS` clause ensures we exclude cases that meet the above conditions. Thus, only events from other cases are selected.

**Order and Grouping:** Since we're using an outer query to filter out specific case IDs based on their sequence occurrence within time constraints (without directly grouping by them), ordering or grouping isn't explicitly necessary in this particular SQL construct because we aren't aggregating data across multiple rows of the same `case_id`. The focus is solely filtering and selecting events from excluded cases.

This approach ensures that only events belonging to cases which do not contain the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' within 5 days are included in the result.
