### Identified Anomalies  
1. **R → P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - *Observation:* Extremely low standard deviation (1 hour) for a 25-hour average.  
   - *Implication:* Approval timing is rigidly consistent, suggesting automated approval without variability typical of human review.  

2. **P → N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - *Observation:* Long average delay (7 days) with high variability (STDEV = 2 days).  
   - *Implication:* Notifications are inconsistently delayed, potentially due to manual backlog or prioritization issues.  

3. **A → C (Assign to Close):**  
   - *Observation:* Claims close 2 hours after assignment, bypassing Evaluate/Approve.  
   - *Implication:* Adjusters may prematurely close claims without proper evaluation.  

4. **E → N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - *Observation:* 5-minute average between Evaluate and Notify.  
   - *Implication:* Notifications may be auto-generated without validation or logged incorrectly.

### Hypotheses for Anomalies  
1. **R → P:**  
   - Automated approval workflows trigger at fixed intervals, overriding manual evaluation.  
   - Claims with specific types (e.g., low amounts) bypass evaluation.  

2. **P → N:**  
   - Manual notification processes cause bottlenecks in high-volume regions.  
   - System failures delay notification generation for certain claim types.  

3. **A → C:**  
   - Adjusters close invalid/duplicate claims immediately after assignment.  
   - Claims are auto-closed if no response is required (e.g., zero claim_amount).  

4. **E → N:**  
   - System-triggered notifications fire immediately post-evaluation, skipping quality checks.  
   - Timestamp inaccuracies (e.g., logging Notify before manual confirmation).

### Verification SQL Queries  

#### 1. **R → P: Claims with Approval Exactly 25 Hours After Receipt**  
```sql  
WITH receive_times AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS receive_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'R'
),
approve_times AS (
    SELECT claim_id, timestamp AS approve_time
    FROM claim_events
    WHERE activity = 'P'
)
SELECT 
    r.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a.approve_time - r.receive_time)) AS time_diff_seconds
FROM receive_times r
JOIN approve_times a ON r.claim_id = a.claim_id
WHERE ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a.approve_time - r.receive_time)) - 90000) <= 3600  -- ±1 hour from average
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claims c 
    WHERE c.claim_id = r.claim_id 
      AND c.claim_type = 'auto_insurance'  -- Test hypothesis for specific claim types
);
```  

#### 2. **P → N: Notifications Delayed Beyond 7 Days Post-Approval**  
```sql  
SELECT 
    p.claim_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) / 86400 AS days_delay,
    adj.region,
    c.claim_type
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters adj ON p.resource = adj.name
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
  AND (n.timestamp - p.timestamp) > INTERVAL '7 days'
  AND adj.region = 'Northwest';  -- Correlate with high-delay regions
```  

#### 3. **A → C: Claims Closed Without Evaluation/Approve**  
```sql  
SELECT 
    a.claim_id,
    adj.adjuster_id,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) / 3600 AS hours_to_close
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id AND c.activity = 'C'
JOIN adjusters adj ON a.resource = adj.name
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
  AND (c.timestamp - a.timestamp) < INTERVAL '3 hours'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events 
    WHERE claim_id = a.claim_id 
      AND activity IN ('E', 'P')  -- Check for missing Evaluate/Approve steps
);
```  

#### 4. **E → N: Notifications Within 1 Minute of Evaluation**  
```sql  
SELECT 
    e.claim_id,
    e.resource AS evaluator,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS notify_delay_seconds,
    ce.claim_amount
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims ce ON e.claim_id = ce.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND (n.timestamp - e.timestamp) < INTERVAL '1 minute'
  AND ce.claim_amount > 10000;  -- Check if high-value claims have unrealistic delays
```
