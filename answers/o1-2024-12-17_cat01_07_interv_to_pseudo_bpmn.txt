**Process Flow Description:**

1. **Start Event:** *Invoice Arrives (via Email)*

2. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Check Invoice for PO Number*  
   - **Data Input:** Invoice

3. **Exclusive Gateway:** *PO Present?*  
   - If **No PO**:  
     3a. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Request PO or Clarification from Supplier*  
     3b. **Event (Waiting):** Wait for Supplier Response with valid PO.  
     3c. Once a valid PO is obtained (Supplier sends updated invoice), return to Step 2.
   - If **PO Present**: Proceed to Step 4.

4. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Log Invoice into Accounting System*  
   - **Data Output:** Invoice recorded in Accounting System

5. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Forward Invoice & PO Details to Purchasing Officer for Receipt Confirmation*  
   - **Data Input:** Invoice & PO Details  
   - **Data Output:** Email to Purchasing

6. **Activity (Purchasing Officer):** *Verify Goods/Services Receipt & Compare Invoice to PO*  
   - **Data Input:** Invoice, PO  
   - **Decision:** If discrepancy is found (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items), the Purchasing Officer may contact Supplier or request AP to hold the invoice.

7. **Exclusive Gateway (Purchasing Officer):** *Invoice Matches PO?*  
   - If **Not Matched**:  
     7a. **Activity (Purchasing Officer):** *Notify AP Clerk of Discrepancy*  
     7b. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Attempt Resolution* (via direct contact with Purchasing or involving AP Supervisor / Supplier Relationship Manager as needed)  
         - If resolution requires supplier input: AP Clerk or Supplier Relationship Manager contacts Supplier. Wait for corrected invoice (go back to Step 2 or Step 5 depending on required actions).  
         - If internal resolution (e.g., a retrospective PO creation by AP Supervisor): Once resolved, return to Step 6 to re-verify.  
   - If **Matched**: Purchasing Officer sends confirmation to AP Clerk (Email Confirmation).

8. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Match Invoice Line Items Against PO in System*  
   - Although Purchasing has confirmed receipt, AP Clerk performs a formal matching in the accounting system.

9. **Exclusive Gateway (AP Clerk):** *Discrepancy Found During System Matching?*  
   - If **Discrepancy Found**:  
     9a. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Contact Purchasing Officer or Escalate to AP Supervisor*  
     9b. **Activity (AP Supervisor if involved):** *Resolve Complex Exceptions* (may involve Supplier Relationship Manager if supplier clarification is needed).  
     - Once resolved, return to Step 8.
   - If **No Discrepancy**: Proceed to Step 10.

10. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Send Invoice for Department Manager Approval*  
    - **Trigger:** System-generated request to Department Manager once all matches are verified and confirmed.

11. **Activity (Department Manager):** *Review & Approve Invoice*  
    - If **Approved**: Proceed to Step 12.  
    - If **Rejected** (e.g., suspicious amount): Manager notifies AP Clerk to hold and investigate further (returns to Step 9â€™s exception handling).

12. **Activity (AP Clerk):** *Schedule Approved Invoice for Payment*  
    - Invoice is now set for the next payment cycle in the accounting/payments system.

13. **End Event:** *Invoice Payment Scheduled*

---

**Notable Variations & Exceptions:**

- **Missing PO Scenario:** If the invoice arrives without a PO, AP Clerk requests it from the Supplier and process does not advance until a valid PO is provided.
- **Discrepancy in Invoice vs. PO:** If line items, prices, or quantities do not match, resolution may involve:  
  - Purchasing Officer comparing contracts and contacting suppliers.  
  - AP Supervisor creating retrospective POs or negotiating exceptions.  
  - Supplier Relationship Manager contacting the supplier to provide corrected invoices.
- **Manager Rejection:** If Department Manager rejects the invoice, it loops back to AP Clerk and potentially AP Supervisor or Supplier Relationship Manager for investigation.

**Roles and Data Flow Hints:**

- **AP Clerk (Mary)**: Initial invoice check, logging invoice, routing documents, final payment scheduling.  
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Confirms goods/services receipt and ensures invoice alignment with PO terms.  
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Provides final approval.  
- **AP Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles complex exceptions and escalations.  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Engages suppliers to correct missing or erroneous invoice details.  
- **Supplier**: Provides revised invoices or missing details as requested.
