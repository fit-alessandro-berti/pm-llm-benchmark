# Advanced Imaging process
advanced_imaging_process = ProcessTree(label="AI", parent=advanced_imaging_lifestyle_support_process)
advanced_imaging_lifestyle_support_process.children.append(advanced_imaging_process)

# Nutritional Counseling process
nutritional_counseling_process = ProcessTree(label="NC", parent=advanced_imaging_lifestyle_support_process)
advanced_imaging_lifestyle_support_process.children.append(nutritional_counseling_process)

# Final administrative and informational steps process

```
This code generates a process tree that accurately models the described hospital patient management system, including all of its complex activities and decision points.
