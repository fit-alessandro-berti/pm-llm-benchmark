To address the benchmark prompt, we will construct a DuckDB SQL query that performs the following steps:

1. **Extract the Ordered Sequence of Activities per `case_id`:**
   - Use the `LISTAGG` function to concatenate the `activity` names for each `case_id` in the order defined by the `timestamp`.
   
2. **Identify Unique Process Variants and Count Their Frequencies:**
   - Group the results by the concatenated activity sequences to identify unique process variants.
   - Count the number of `case_id`s associated with each variant to determine their frequencies.
   
3. **Determine the Top K Variants by Frequency:**
   - Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the variants by their frequency in descending order.
   - Utilize the `LIMIT` clause to select the top K variants.
   
4. **Filter the Original Event Log to Include Only Cases from the Top K Variants:**
   - Join the original `event_log` table with the top K variants identified in the previous step.
   - Ensure that only events from cases belonging to these top K variants are included in the final result.

Below is the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes these tasks:

```sql
-- Define the number of top variants to retrieve
-- Replace <K> with the desired number of top variants
WITH top_variants AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            LISTAGG(activity, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
    ) AS sequenced_cases
    GROUP BY
        activity_sequence
    ORDER BY
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT <K>
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
    JOIN top_variants tv ON e.case_id = tv.activity_sequence
ORDER BY
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation of the Query:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) - `top_variants`:**
   - **Subquery (`sequenced_cases`):**
     - `LISTAGG(activity, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence`: This aggregates the `activity` names for each `case_id` in the order of their `timestamp`, concatenating them with " -> " as a separator.
     - The result is a list of activities representing the process variant for each `case_id`.
   
   - **Main Query:**
     - `GROUP BY activity_sequence`: Groups the sequenced cases by their activity sequences to identify unique process variants.
     - `COUNT(*) AS variant_count`: Counts the number of `case_id`s associated with each variant.
     - `ORDER BY variant_count DESC`: Sorts the variants by their frequency in descending order.
     - `LIMIT <K>`: Selects the top K variants based on their frequency.

2. **Final SELECT Statement:**
   - `JOIN top_variants tv ON e.case_id = tv.activity_sequence`: Joins the original `event_log` table with the `top_variants` CTE to filter out cases that are not part of the top K variants.
     - **Note:** The join condition should actually be on the `case_id` rather than the `activity_sequence`. The corrected join condition is:
       ```sql
       JOIN top_variants tv ON e.case_id = tv.case_id
       ```
     - To facilitate this, we need to include `case_id` in the `top_variants` CTE. Here's the corrected CTE:
       ```sql
       WITH top_variants AS (
           SELECT
               case_id,
               activity_sequence,
               COUNT(*) AS variant_count
           FROM (
               SELECT
                   case_id,
                   LISTAGG(activity, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
               FROM
                   event_log
               GROUP BY
                   case_id
           ) AS sequenced_cases
           GROUP BY
               case_id,
               activity_sequence
           ORDER BY
               variant_count DESC
           LIMIT <K>
       )
       ```
   
   - `SELECT e.*`: Selects all columns from the `event_log` for the filtered cases.
   - `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp`: Orders the final results by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the sequence of activities.

### Final Corrected Query:

```sql
-- Define the number of top variants to retrieve
-- Replace <K> with the desired number of top variants
WITH top_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            LISTAGG(activity, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
        FROM
            event_log
        GROUP BY
            case_id
    ) AS sequenced_cases
    GROUP BY
        case_id,
        activity_sequence
    ORDER BY
        variant_count DESC
    LIMIT <K>
)

SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
    JOIN top_variants tv ON e.case_id = tv.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id,
    e.timestamp;
```

### Notes:

- **Parameter `<K>`:** Replace `<K>` with the actual number of top variants you wish to retrieve.
- **Performance Considerations:** For very large datasets, ensure that appropriate indexes are in place, especially on the `case_id` and `timestamp` columns, to optimize query performance.
- **Handling Ties:** If there is a tie in the variant counts and you wish to include all variants that tie for the K-th position, consider using the `QUALIFY` clause or other methods to handle ties appropriately.

This query effectively extracts the top K process variants and retrieves all events associated with the cases that follow these variants.
