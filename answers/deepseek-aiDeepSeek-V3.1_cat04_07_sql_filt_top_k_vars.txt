Here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
WITH ranked_variants AS (
    WITH process_variants AS (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) as activity_sequence,
            COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as event_count
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ),
    variant_counts AS (
        SELECT 
            activity_sequence,
            COUNT(case_id) as case_count
        FROM process_variants
        WHERE event_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log el WHERE el.case_id = process_variants.case_id)
        GROUP BY activity_sequence
        ORDER BY case_count DESC
    ),
    top_variants AS (
        SELECT activity_sequence
        FROM variant_counts
        LIMIT K  -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
    )
    SELECT case_id
    FROM process_variants pv
    INNER JOIN top_variants tv ON pv.activity_sequence = tv.activity_sequence
)

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN ranked_variants rv ON el.case_id = rv.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Process Variants CTE**: 
   - Groups events by `case_id` and aggregates activities into ordered sequences using `string_agg()` with `ORDER BY timestamp`
   - Includes a check to ensure all events for each case are captured

2. **Variant Counts CTE**:
   - Counts the number of cases for each unique activity sequence
   - Orders variants by frequency in descending order

3. **Top Variants CTE**:
   - Selects the top K variants using `LIMIT K` (replace K with your desired number)

4. **Ranked Variants CTE**:
   - Joins the variants with their corresponding case IDs to identify which cases belong to top variants

5. **Final Select**:
   - Returns all events from the original log for cases that belong to top variants
   - Maintains the original event order by sorting by `case_id` and `timestamp`

**Key Features:**
- Uses `string_agg()` with proper ordering to create sequential activity paths
- Handles edge cases where events might be missing or duplicated
- Efficiently filters to only top K variants while preserving all relevant events
- Maintains original event data structure and order

**Note:** Replace `K` with the actual number of top variants you want to retrieve (e.g., `LIMIT 5` for top 5 variants).
