Anomalies in the DECLARE Model:
1. The "precedence" constraint states that activity "C" must always be preceded by "R". However, the "init" constraint specifies that "R" is the initial activity. This creates a contradiction, as "C" cannot occur before "R" if "R" is always the first activity.

2. The "noncoexistence" constraint between activities "E" and "C" indicates that if "E" occurs, "C" cannot occur, and vice versa. This conflicts with the overall process flow, where both evaluation and closing steps are expected for each claim.

3. The "responded_existence" constraint mandates that if activity "A" occurs, "E" must eventually happen. However, there is no constraint ensuring that "A" will occur after "R". This could lead to situations where evaluation is expected without an assignment.

Hypotheses for the Anomalies:
1. The contradictory "precedence" constraint might have been introduced due to a misinterpretation of the business requirement. The modeler may have intended to express that "C" should be the final activity, but instead defined it as always being preceded by "R".

2. The "noncoexistence" constraint between "E" and "C" could be a result of incremental policy changes. Perhaps there was a previous version of the process where claims could be closed without evaluation, and this constraint was not updated when the process was modified to require evaluation.

3. The missing constraint between "R" and "A" might be due to incomplete data. If the dataset used to discover the constraints did not include enough examples of the assignment step, the relationship between receiving and assigning could have been overlooked.

4. The overall anomalies might be a consequence of pressure to handle claims quickly. In an effort to streamline the process, constraints may have been defined to allow skipping crucial steps like evaluation and assignment.

Verification Approaches using SQL Queries:
1. To check if there are claims closed without evaluation:
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
LEFT JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
INNER JOIN claim_events cl ON c.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND cl.activity = 'C'
WHERE e.event_id IS NULL
```

2. To find traces where evaluation and closing coexist:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
INNER JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'  
INNER JOIN claim_events cl ON c.claim_id = cl.claim_id AND cl.activity = 'C'
```

3. To verify if evaluation always happens after assignment:
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id
FROM claims c
INNER JOIN claim_events e ON c.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
LEFT JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A' AND a.timestamp < e.timestamp
WHERE a.event_id IS NULL
```

These queries can help identify if the anomalies in the DECLARE model manifest in the actual process execution data, providing insights into the real-world implications of the contradictory constraints.
