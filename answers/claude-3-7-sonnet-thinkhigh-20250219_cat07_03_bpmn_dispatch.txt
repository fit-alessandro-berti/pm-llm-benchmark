This visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram depicting a shipping workflow across three organizational lanes:

**Top Lane (Logistics)**:
- Contains the "Insure parcel" task, which is triggered when insurance is required

**Middle Lane (Secretary/Department of Computer Hardware Shop)**:
- Begins with the "Ship goods" start event
- After an initial gateway, the process moves to "Clarify shipment method"
- A decision diamond asks if "Special handling?" is needed:
  - If "yes," the flow moves to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies" followed by "Select logistic company and place order"
  - If "no," it proceeds to "Check if insurance is required" (which references "Customer information" and "Order details" data)
- The insurance check may trigger the "Insure parcel" task in the Logistics lane
- The flow always proceeds to "Write package label"
- The paths converge at a gateway before moving to the Warehouse lane

**Bottom Lane (Warehouse)**:
- "Package goods" is performed (with a 48-hour time constraint)
- If packaging exceeds the time limit, a path triggers "Notify customer about delay"
- After gateways coordinate the flow, tasks include "Fill out Shipment paperwork" and "Move package to pickup area"
- The process concludes with the "Shipment prepared" end event

The diagram effectively illustrates the cross-departmental responsibilities and sequence of activities in the shipping process, including decision points, parallel activities, and timing constraints.
