The comparison of the event logs for Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group) reveals bias in the decision-making process. Here's the analysis:

### 1. **Bias Observation**

- **Group B** exhibits bias, primarily due to the **ScoreAdjustment** column and its interaction with the **CommunityGroup** attribute.
- In Group B, individuals associated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a **+10 score boost** during **PreliminaryScoring**, impacting their likelihood of approval.
- No such adjustments are observed for Group A, which is consistent but lacks the favorable bias provided to Group B.

### 2. **Manifestation of Bias**

- The **FinalDecision** in Group B shows more favorable outcomes for cases where **ScoreAdjustment** occurred. Specifically:
	- **U001** and **U003** received the +10 community boost, and their scores were adjusted from 720 and 695 to 730 and 705, respectively. Both were **approved**.
	- **U002**, with no community affiliation, did not receive a boost and was **rejected**.
- In Group A, there is no adjustment mechanism, and the scoring process is entirely dependent on the initial **PreliminaryScore** and other automated steps. Decisions are more reliant on the **PreliminaryScore** set at the beginning.

### 3. **Influencing Factors**

- **LocalResident and CommunityGroup in Group B**:
	- The **CommunityGroup** attribute (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club") introduces bias by selectively boosting scores for specific groups.
	- The absence of this attribute in Group A ensures uniform processing without additional advantages.
- **ScoreAdjustment**:
	- The explicit adjustment mechanism for Group B creates systematic differences in final decisions, favoring applicants based on their affiliation rather than objective evaluation criteria.

### 4. **Impact on Final Decisions**

- **Group A**: Decisions are consistent with initial scores.
	- All cases with scores above a certain threshold (e.g., 720) were **approved**, and the one below (710) was **rejected**.
- **Group B**: Community affiliation (via ScoreAdjustment) disproportionately increases the chances of approval, overriding initial scoring differences. Applicants without community affiliation face disadvantageous outcomes.

### 5. **Conclusion**

The bias in Group B arises from **score adjustment linked to CommunityGroup affiliation**, which creates subjective advantages for certain applicants. This systematic difference is absent in Group A, where decisions are made more uniformly based on the initial scores and established criteria.
