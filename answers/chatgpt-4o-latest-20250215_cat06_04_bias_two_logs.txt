The event logs for Group A (Protected Group) and Group B (Unprotected Group) reveal a potential bias in decision-making, particularly in how score adjustments and community affiliations impact final outcomes. Below is a breakdown of how this bias manifests.  

### **Key Observations & Differences**  

#### **1. Influence of Score Adjustment (Community Boost Bias)**
- In **Group B (Unprotected Group)**, applicants affiliated with the *Highland Civic Darts Club* received a **+10 Score Adjustment** due to their community membership.  
  - *Example:* U001 had an initial score of **720**, received a **+10 boost (730 adjusted)**, and was **approved**.  
  - *Example:* U003 had an initial score of **695**, received a **+10 boost (705 adjusted)**, and was **approved**.  
- In contrast, **Group A (Protected Group)** received **no such adjustment**, even when their preliminary scores were equal to or higher than those in Group B.
  - *Example:* P001 had **720** but did not receive a boost.  
  - *Example:* P003 had **740** and was approved without adjustment.  

This suggests that membership in a particular **community group** (Highland Civic Darts Club) provides an advantage, which is **only present for Group B applicants**.  

#### **2. Effect of Local Residency Status**  
- Every applicant in **Group B** is a **local resident** (TRUE), while every applicant in **Group A** is a **non-local resident** (FALSE).  
- There is no explicit score penalty or adjustment based on residency, but **the combination of local residency and community group affiliation benefits Group B applicants** through score boosts.  

#### **3. Disparity in Treatment of Similar Scores**
- **Case P002 (Group A, Protected)**
  - **Score: 710**
  - **No Adjustment**
  - **Final Decision: Rejected**
- **Case U002 (Group B, Unprotected)**
  - **Score: 710**
  - **No Adjustment**
  - **Final Decision: Rejected**  

ðŸ‘‰ In cases where no community boost is applied, decisions appear consistent (both were rejected). However, when a **community boost is applied (e.g., U001, U003), lower scores lead to approvals**â€”which did not happen in **Group A**, where no one received a boost.  

### **How Bias Manifests**  
1. **Score Adjustments Favor Group B**  
   - Group B applicants who belong to the *Highland Civic Darts Club* receive a **+10 point boost**, giving them an advantage in the final decision process.  
   - Group A applicants never receive a boost, even when they have similar or higher scores.  

2. **Systematic Favoring of Local Residents & Community Members**  
   - Although there is no explicit rule adjusting scores for local residency, the fact that **only Group B receives the community boost** suggests a structural bias.  
   - Because all boosted applicants are **local residents**, residency and community membership indirectly improve approval chances.  

3. **Group A is Disadvantaged in Final Decisions**  
   - Applicants in Group A **never receive positive score adjustments** and are evaluated purely on their preliminary scores.  
   - Meanwhile, applicants in Group B can have **lower initial scores but still be approved** if they qualify for the community boost.  

### **Conclusion: Evidence of Bias**
- The **system systematically favors Group B applicants** who are **local residents and affiliated with a particular community group**.  
- This **bias is indirect but impactful**, as community membership serves as a **proxy for group affiliation**, leading to **higher approval rates for Group B** even when scores are comparable.  
- The **Protected Group (Group A) is disadvantaged**, as they do not receive adjustments that could increase their likelihood of approval.  

#### **Potential Remedies**
To ensure fairness, the system should:  
1. **Apply score adjustments consistently across both groups** or remove the community-based boost entirely.  
2. **Evaluate whether residency or community affiliation should influence approvals** and ensure that any adjustments do not disproportionately favor one group.  
3. **Review historical decisions for systemic biases** and implement corrective measures if necessary.
