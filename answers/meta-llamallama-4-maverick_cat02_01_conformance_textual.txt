To identify the cases that violate the normative process, we need to carefully examine each case in the event log against the constraints and sequences outlined in the normative process description.

## Step 1: Understand the Normative Process Description
The normative process description outlines a process for handling orders based on inventory availability. It starts with "Receive order," followed by "Check inventory." If inventory is sufficient, the process proceeds through "Authorize payment," "Package items," "Ship order," and ends with "Close order." If inventory is insufficient, it goes from "Check inventory" to "Cancel order" and then "Close order." Key constraints include: "Authorize payment" after "Check inventory" and before "Package items"; "Package items" after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order"; "Ship order" after "Package items" and not after "Cancel order"; and "Close order" as the final activity.

## Step 2: Analyze Case 1
Case 1 follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order. This matches the expected flow when inventory is sufficient. Thus, Case 1 does not violate the normative process.

## Step 3: Analyze Case 2
Case 2 follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order. Here, "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which violates the constraint that "Authorize payment" should happen before "Package items." Thus, Case 2 violates the normative process.

## Step 4: Analyze Case 3
Case 3 follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order. The violation here is that "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is not allowed since an order should not be shipped after being canceled. Thus, Case 3 violates the normative process.

## Step 5: Analyze Case 4
Case 4 follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order. This matches the expected flow when inventory is insufficient. Thus, Case 4 does not violate the normative process.

## Step 6: Analyze Case 5
Case 5 follows the sequence: Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order. The issue here is that "Package items" is missing between "Authorize payment" and "Ship order." According to the normative description, "Package items" should occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order." Thus, Case 5 violates the normative process because it skips "Package items."

## Step 7: Summarize Violations
- Case 2 violates the process by packaging items before authorizing payment.
- Case 3 violates the process by shipping an order after it has been canceled.
- Case 5 violates the process by skipping the "Package items" step before shipping the order.

## Step 8: Interpret Ambiguities
The normative description implies that the process is rigid, with specific steps following one another in a particular order based on inventory availability. However, it does not explicitly state what happens in exceptional circumstances (e.g., technical issues causing a step to be skipped or out of order). For Case 5, one might argue that "Package items" could be considered an internal step that doesn't necessarily get logged, but based on the given information, we identify it as a violation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2, 3, 5}$
