**Explanation of New Constraints:**

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - **Approve_Minority and ManualReview:** Ensures that for any approval decision involving a minority applicant, there must be a manual review to check for any potential biases.
   - **Reject_Minority and ManualReview:** Ensures that for any rejection decision involving a minority applicant, a manual review must also be conducted.
   - **Approve and BiasMitigationCheck:** Ensures that a bias mitigation check must coexist with any approval decision to avoid biased outcomes.
   - **Reject and BiasMitigationCheck:** Ensures that a bias mitigation check must coexist with any rejection decision to avoid biased outcomes.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck:** Ensures that whenever an applicant's race is checked, a bias mitigation check must follow to ensure fairness.

3. **Succession Constraints:**
   - **BiasMitigationCheck and Approve:** Ensures that a bias mitigation check must be performed before any approval decision.
   - **BiasMitigationCheck and Reject:** Ensures that a bias mitigation check must be performed before any rejection decision.

4. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - **CheckApplicantRace and Reject:** Prevents a rejection decision from immediately following the checking of an applicant's race, thus avoiding direct biased outcomes.

These constraints help in mitigating bias by ensuring that sensitive attributes do not lead to immediate biased decisions and by mandating additional checks and reviews to enforce fairness throughout the loan application process.
