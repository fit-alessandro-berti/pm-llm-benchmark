After analyzing the process variants of the protected and unprotected groups, I've identified some key differences:

1. **Rejection rates**: The unprotected group has a higher rejection rate, with more process variants leading to "Reject Prospective Tenant" (4 variants with frequencies 2490, 1022, 674, and 365) compared to the protected group (2 variants with frequencies 1036 and 793).
2. **Extensive screening**: The protected group has more process variants that involve extensive screening (6 variants) compared to the unprotected group (4 variants). This might indicate that the protected group is subject to more rigorous evaluation.
3. **Tenant cancellation**: The unprotected group has more process variants that involve tenant cancellation (13 variants) compared to the protected group (11 variants). This could suggest that tenants in the unprotected group are more likely to cancel their rental agreements.
4. **Missed rent payments and eviction**: The protected group has a single process variant that involves missed rent payments and eviction (frequency 6), while the unprotected group does not have any such variants. This might indicate that the protected group is more likely to experience financial difficulties.
5. **Appointment setting and viewing**: Both groups have similar frequencies for setting appointments and viewing properties. However, the unprotected group has a slightly higher frequency for these activities (2490 + 1022 + 674 = 4186) compared to the protected group (1036 + 793 + 484 = 2313).
6. **Handing in paperwork and screening**: Both groups have similar frequencies for handing in paperwork and screening (e.g., 366 vs. 2490 for the protected and unprotected groups, respectively). However, the unprotected group has a slightly higher frequency for these activities.
7. **Payment and rent-related activities**: The unprotected group has a higher frequency for payment and rent-related activities (e.g., Pay Rent, Pay Rent -> Pay Rent, etc.) compared to the protected group.

Using my domain knowledge, I can hypothesize that the protected group might be subject to more stringent evaluation and screening processes, which could lead to a lower rejection rate. In contrast, the unprotected group might experience more financial difficulties, leading to a higher rate of tenant cancellations and, potentially, evictions. However, it's essential to note that these are just hypotheses and would require further investigation to confirm.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or explore other aspects of the data?
