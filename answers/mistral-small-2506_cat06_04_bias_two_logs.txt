### **Comparison of Event Logs and Identification of Bias**

#### **Key Observations:**
1. **Protected Group (Group A):**
   - All applicants are **non-local residents** (`LocalResident = FALSE`).
   - No **CommunityGroup** affiliation is recorded.
   - **No score adjustments** are applied (`ScoreAdjustment = 0`).
   - **Final Decisions:**
     - **P001 (720)  Approved**
     - **P002 (710)  Rejected**
     - **P003 (740)  Approved**
   - **Decision Threshold:** Approval seems to be granted for scores ** 720**, rejection for **< 720**.

2. **Unprotected Group (Group B):**
   - All applicants are **local residents** (`LocalResident = TRUE`).
   - Some belong to the **Highland Civic Darts Club** (a community group).
   - **Score Adjustments:**
     - **+10 points** for applicants in the **Highland Civic Darts Club**.
     - **No adjustment** for those without a community group.
   - **Final Decisions:**
     - **U001 (720  730)  Approved**
     - **U002 (710)  Rejected**
     - **U003 (695  705)  Approved**
   - **Decision Threshold:**
     - **U001 & U003** were **approved after adjustments**, even though their **original scores (720 and 695) would have led to different outcomes** (U003 would have been rejected without the +10 boost).
     - **U002 (710)  Rejected** (no adjustment, same as Group A).

#### **Bias Identification:**
- **Bias in Group B (Unprotected Group):**
  - The **CommunityGroup** attribute introduces a **positive bias** for members of the **Highland Civic Darts Club**, as they receive a **+10 score adjustment**.
  - This means:
    - **U003 (original score: 695) was approved only because of the +10 boost.**
    - If the same applicant were in **Group A (Protected Group)**, they would have been **rejected** (since 695 < 720).
  - **Systematic Favoritism:** Local residents with community affiliations get an **unfair advantage**, while non-local residents (Group A) are evaluated purely on their **raw scores** without any adjustments.

- **Group A (Protected Group) is Fairer:**
  - No adjustments are made based on **LocalResident** or **CommunityGroup** status.
  - Decisions are based **solely on the PreliminaryScore**, making the process **consistent and unbiased** for this group.

#### **Conclusion:**
- **Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias** because:
  - **CommunityGroup membership** artificially inflates scores for certain applicants.
  - This creates a **systematic advantage** for local residents with group affiliations, while non-local residents (Group A) are evaluated without such benefits.
- **Fairness Issue:** The scoring system **favors local residents with community ties**, potentially leading to **unfair rejections** for equally qualified non-local applicants.

#### **Recommendation:**
- **Remove or justify the +10 Community Boost** to ensure fairness.
- **Standardize decision thresholds** across both groups.
- **Monitor for disparate impact** to ensure no group is systematically disadvantaged.

This analysis highlights how **hidden biases in scoring adjustments** can lead to **unfair outcomes** in decision-making processes.
