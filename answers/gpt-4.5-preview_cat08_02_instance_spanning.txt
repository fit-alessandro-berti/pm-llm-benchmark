## 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

**Constraint Identification via Event Log and Process Mining Techniques:**

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations:**
    - Examine event logs **filtered by "Requires Cold Packing = TRUE"**.
    - Use **Resource Utilization Analysis**, such as "Resource Occupation Profile" (ROP), in tools like ProM or Celonis, to detect contention.
    - Statistically measure the resource waiting queues' length and durations when the cold-packing stations are occupied, particularly peaks and seasonal variations.

- **Batching for Shipping:**
    - Identify **"waiting-for-batch"** time by calculating the interval from the completion of the "Quality Check" step until the "Shipping Label Generation".
    - Group cases by Destination Region; evaluate delay incursions per region and average waiting times attributable specifically to forming shipping batches.

- **Priority Handling (Express vs. Standard):**
    - Analyze situations where standard orders experience prolonged idle or interrupted states, particularly at shared resources, coinciding with arrivals of express orders.
    - Perform **Comparative Process Mining** (e.g., using performance spectrums) contrasting standard vs express orders, focusing explicitly on concurrent activities (packing station occupancy, quality checks, etc.).

- **Hazardous Material Regulatory Limits:**
    - Filter logs **by "Hazardous Material = TRUE"** and analyze concurrency of hazardous orders during "Packing" and "Quality Check" activities.
    - Implement **Concurrency Analysis techniques (such as concurrency matrices)** to detect limit breaches or potential inefficiencies due to strict compliance.

**Quantifying Constraint Impact Metrics:**

| Constraint Type | Key Metrics to Measure |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Cold-Packing Resource Contention | Waiting time for cold-packing equipment availability, Resource idle vs occupied ratio, Average queue lengths |
| Shipping Batches | Waiting time from Quality Check completion until batch size achieved, Number of orders on hold per batch |
| Priority Handling Interruptions | Delay duration imposed on standard orders by interruptions from express orders, frequency of interruptions |
| Hazardous Material Limits | Throughput reduction (fewer concurrent hazardous orders), Waiting & queue buildup for hazardous orders |

**Differentiating Within-instance vs Between-instance Waiting Times:**

- **Within-instance delays** are evident when an activity’s complete timestamp has a substantial delay following its start, signifying prolonged durations for activities themselves (e.g., packing duration).
- **Between-instance delays** identified by clear gaps between the completion timestamp of an upstream activity instance and the start timestamp of subsequent activity without resource occupancy within the order itself. Such idle times indicate cross-instance waiting (either waiting for shared resources, batch formation, priority interruptions, or compliance thresholds).

Using timestamps, resource IDs, and concurrency analysis techniques, we can isolate these various waiting interval types in the event log clearly.

## 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

**Interconstraint Interactions to Examine Specifically Include:**

- **Priority Handling meets Cold-Packing Resource Bottlenecks:**
    - Express cold-pack orders preemptively occupy limited cold stations, exacerbating waiting for standard cold-pack orders. Such interactions can compound wait times disproportionately.

- **Shipping Batches intersecting Hazardous Limits:**
    - If batches include multiple hazardous items, forming a batch meeting regulatory concurrency becomes complicated. Orders may wait significantly longer owing to strictly regulated maximum simultaneous hazardous orders.

- **Express Order Interrupts plus Hazardous Limit Complexities:**
    - Express hazardous orders require sudden reprioritization, disrupting previously stable hazardous order throughput patterns and possibly reducing overall constraint compliance efficiency.

**Importance of Analyzing Constraint Interactions:**

Understanding these interactions helps avoid localized optimization that fails at system-level performance improvement. It facilitates comprehensive strategies ensuring solutions to one of these constraints don't unintentionally exacerbate another.

## 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Dynamic Resource Allocation & Intelligent Scheduling for Cold-Packing Stations**
**Target Constraint: Shared Cold-Packing, Priority Handling**

- **Change Proposed:**
    - Introduce **real-time resource allocation** with prioritization scoring considering urgency (Express vs Standard), waiting duration, and perishability (based on historical shelf-life cycles).
    - Leverage Machine-Learning (ML) models trained on historical event log patterns to predict daily/hourly resource demand.
  
- **How Data/Analysis Supports:**
    - Resource occupancy profile data can feed predictive analytics tools (Process Mining augmented with ML).
    - Predictive algorithms dynamically forecast upcoming workloads, proactively smoothing peaks and distributing demand across operational hours.

- **Expected Outcomes:**
    - Reduced cross-instance waiting times for standard orders without sacrificing express service levels.
    - Enhanced Cold-Packing resource utilization efficiency.

### Strategy 2: **Dynamic Batch Formation with Intelligent Triggers (Shipping Optimization)**
**Target Constraint: Batching for Shipping & Hazardous Materials Interaction**

- **Change Proposed:**
    - Shift from purely static batch-size rules to dynamically adjusting batch formation criteria based on real-time conditions (order queue, waiting times, hazardous limits, and scheduled transportation cycles).
    - Intelligently trigger batch finalization logic such as threshold-driven (waiting time threshold) or load-driven (percentage-full thresholds).
  
- **Data-driven Approach:**
    - Process mining-derived historic waiting time data distributions per region and hazardous constraints inform ideal regions and times for flexible vs strict batching.
  
- **Expected Outcomes:**
    - Reduction of batching-induced waiting durations.
    - Improved hazardous constraint throughput as dynamic sizing allows real-time adjustments avoiding breaches.

### Strategy 3: **Predictive-Adaptive Scheduling for Hazardous Material Processing**
**Target Constraint: Regulatory Hazardous Material Limits, Priority Handling**

- **Change Proposed:**
    - Implement forecasting-driven scheduling: historically informed, adaptive forward-planning for Hazardous Material orders to evenly distribute hazardous item handling across available timeframes, balancing daily quotas well in advance.
    - Adaptive day-part scheduling supported by observed historical traffic patterns for hazardous material inflow and potential express order spikes.

- **Data-driven Approach:**
    - Leverage event-log mining (timestamps, frequency, concurrency analysis of hazardous orders historically) to accurately predict demand spikes and likely regulatory constraint violation periods.

- **Expected Outcomes:**
    - Increased throughput and minimized backlog caused by hazardous constraints.
    - Decreased incidents needing emergency priority reshuffling, minimizing disruptions to standard service flows.

## 4. Simulation and Validation

**Simulation Methods & Validation Approach:**

- **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** with detailed scenarios representing:
    - Real-time cold-packing station loading patterns.
    - Dynamic shipping batch formation behaviors.
    - Express order interruption scenarios and hazardous concurrency compliance monitoring.

- **Model Calibration:**
    - Use historic event logs to calibrate precisely simulated waiting intervals, capacities, preemption probabilities, regulatory compliance constraints, resource contention behaviors.
  
- **Validation Focus:**
    - Measure improvements explicitly on end-to-end throughput, percentage time spent in between-instance waiting, batch formation delays, and compliance with hazardous regulatory limits under differing optimized strategies.

## 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

**Key Metrics & Dashboards Setup:**

- **Dashboard KPIs:**
    - Resource utilization profiles for shared cold-packing stations.
    - Real-time batch delays visuals (Quality Check to Shipping Label Generation intervals).
    - Express-standard impact metrics ("interruptions caused" and "average waiting times imposed").
    - Concurrency dashboard showing active hazardous orders simultaneously under processing, ensuring regulatory compliance persistently.

- **Monitoring & Process Mining:**
    - Continuous Process Discovery models refreshed regularly from new event logs post-implementation.
    - Conformance checking dashboards detect emerging bottlenecks or deviations from optimized behaviors.
    - Real-time alerts for hazardous limit compliance, resource idleness/utilization imbalances, and batch delays surpassing thresholds.

**Ensuring Constraint Management Effectiveness:**
- Regularly scheduled audits via process mining tools (Celonis, Signavio) to confirm long-term constraint optimization sustainability.
- Continuous improvement cycles based on insights from dashboards to incrementally refine strategies where constraints interactions evolve or new patterns emerge.

## **Summary of Proposed Approach:**

- Clearly identify and measure constraints via data-driven process mining techniques.
- Address constraint interactions explicitly through comprehensive and holistic approach.
- Propose concrete optimization solutions employing dynamic scheduling, predictive analytics, and adaptive practices.
- Reinforce approach validation via detailed simulation followed by rigorous monitoring post-implementation.

This structured strategy ensures robust management of complex, instance-spanning constraints, ultimately enabling the fulfillment center to achieve substantial efficiency gains, reduce delays broadly, and maintain regulatory compliance effectively.
