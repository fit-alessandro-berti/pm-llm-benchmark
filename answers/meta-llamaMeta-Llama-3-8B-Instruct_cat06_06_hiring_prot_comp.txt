A fascinating task! Based on the provided data, I'll highlight the differences between the "protected" and "unprotected" groups. Please note that my analysis is limited to the provided data and my understanding of the context.

**Registering at ER vs. FD**: The "protected" group has more process variants starting with registration at ER (12 variants) compared to FD (8 variants). In contrast, the "unprotected" group has more process variants starting with registration at FD (11 variants) compared to ER (6 variants). This suggests that the "unprotected" group may be more likely to register at FD.

**Expert Examination**: The "unprotected" group has more process variants involving expert examination (6 variants) compared to the "protected" group (4 variants). This might indicate that the "unprotected" group is more likely to receive expert examination as part of their process.

**Thorough Examination**: Both groups have similar numbers of process variants involving thorough examination (the "protected" group has 6 variants, while the "unprotected" group has 7 variants). This suggests that thorough examination is a common step in both groups.

**Diagnosis and Treatment**: The "unprotected" group has more process variants involving diagnosis and treatment unsuccessful events (e.g., "Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge"). This might indicate that the "unprotected" group is more likely to experience unsuccessful diagnosis and treatment outcomes.

**Discharge**: The "unprotected" group has a higher frequency of discharge (505 cases) compared to the "protected" group (158 cases). This suggests that the "unprotected" group may have a higher likelihood of discharge or completion of their process.

**Performance**: The "unprotected" group has a slightly higher average performance (317.14) compared to the "protected" group (253.41). This could indicate that the "unprotected" group is more efficient or effective in their process.

These are the main differences that I've identified between the "protected" and "unprotected" groups based on the provided data.
