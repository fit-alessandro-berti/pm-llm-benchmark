4. Once property details are entered into the central database, what validation or quality-control measures ensure the information (square footage, amenities, pricing) is accurate and complete?

10. What governance or escalation paths exist when the landlord resists making required repairs or disagrees with the inspector’s findings?  
11. How does your marketing team translate inspection and property data into pricing and listing strategies? What market data sources or models do they rely on?

13. During tenant screening, what scoring or decision criteria guide acceptance or rejection, and how do you handle edge cases like borderline credit scores or self-employed applicants?
