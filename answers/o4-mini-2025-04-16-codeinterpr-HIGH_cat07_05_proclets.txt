The picture you uploaded is really three related diagrams (labelled (a), (b) and (c)) showing how a “Lab visit” process and a “Lab test” process interact by exchanging messages over two channels.  Here’s a description of each part:

1. Panel (a): Two ProceIt classes connected through two channels  
   - On the left you see the “Lab visit” process (swimlanes for doctor and lab assistant), on the right the “Lab test” process (swim-lane for chemical analyst).  
   - Each process has its own start-event (small black triangle at top) and end-event (filled circle at bottom).  
   - In the Lab visit:  
     • “Order entry”  “Take blood sample”  (send order to Lab test)  “Receive result”  “Judge results”  either “Everything fine”  “Send report” or “Do tests again”  “Receive updated result”  “Send report.”  
   - In the Lab test:  
     • Upon receiving the order  “Perform test”  “Make report”  fork/join (the little circle)  “Finish lab test” (end)  
     • If a retest is required the flow goes “Perform test again”  “Provide updated report”  back into the join  “Finish lab test.”  
   - The two dashed rectangles in the middle are the communication channels:  
     • “Order system” (carries the initial test request from Lab visit to Lab test)  
     • “HIS” (carries the test results back from Lab test to Lab visit)  
   - On each channel you see multiplicities ([1..*], 1..1) indicating how many senders and receivers can be attached.

2. Panel (b): UML-style class diagram of the two process classes  
   - A single Lab visit “requires” one (and only one) Lab test.  
   - A Lab test may be required by one or more Lab visits (multiplicity 1..*).  

3. Panel (c): A concrete example of one “performative” (i.e. one message) exchanged over a channel  
   - Time: 11:00  
   - Channel: Order system  
   - Sender: Lab visit – John  
   - Receiver: Lab test – John  
   - Action: Create  
   - Content: “Can you perform a HGB test for John?”  
   - Scope: Private  
   - Direction: OUT  

Taken together, these three views show (a) the detailed choreography of two collaborating processes, (b) their highlevel classrelationship, and (c) one sample message instance that flows between them.
