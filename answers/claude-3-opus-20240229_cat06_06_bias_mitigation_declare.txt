Here is the updated `declare_model` dictionary with new constraints to mitigate potential bias in the loan application process:

```python
declare_model = {

        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},  # Added to ensure manual review always occurs
        "BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}  # Added to ensure bias mitigation check always occurs
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        "CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added to ensure manual review if race is checked
        "CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added to ensure manual review if gender is checked
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added to ensure manual review if age is checked
    },
    "response": {

        "CheckApplicantAge": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added to ensure bias check after age check
    },

        "CheckApplicantGender": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},  # Added to prevent immediate decision after gender check
        "CheckApplicantAge": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}  # Added to prevent immediate decision after age check  
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

Explanation of the added constraints:
1. **Existence:** Ensured that `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` activities always occur in the process to provide additional oversight and fairness checks.

2. **Coexistence:** If any sensitive attribute (`ApplicantRace`, `ApplicantGender`, `ApplicantAge`) is checked, a `ManualReview` must also occur in the same process instance. This ensures an extra level of human scrutiny when sensitive information is accessed.

3. **Response:** After checking any sensitive attribute, a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must occur. This forces an explicit bias review step following the exposure of potentially biasing information.

4. **Precedence:** A `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede the `FinalDecision` activity. This guarantees that potential biases are assessed and mitigated before reaching a lending decision.

5. **Non-succession:** No `FinalDecision` can immediately follow the checking of a sensitive attribute without some intervening activity. This prevents snap judgments based on protected characteristics.

These new constraints introduce additional checkpoints, reviews, and activity orderings that collectively aim to identify, prevent, and mitigate potential biases in the loan application assessment process. By mandating manual reviews, bias checks, and decoupling sensitive information from immediate decisions, the model promotes a more equitable and auditable procedure.
