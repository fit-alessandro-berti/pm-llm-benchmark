1. How can the company balance the trade‑off between just‑in‑time replenishment for high‑demand markets and bulk shipments for slower‑moving regions while minimizing both stockouts and excess inventory?  

2. What risk‑mitigation strategies should be implemented to handle disruptions in critical component supplies (e.g., microprocessors from Taiwan) caused by geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, or pandemics?  

3. In what ways can advanced analytics and machine‑learning forecasts be integrated with existing demand‑planning systems to improve accuracy across diverse markets and product life‑cycle stages?  

4. How might the company redesign its supplier‑performance evaluation framework to incorporate not only lead time and quality metrics but also sustainability, carbon footprint, and labor‑rights compliance?  

5. What are the potential cost and service‑level impacts of shifting a larger share of transportation from air freight to sea freight for certain product segments, and how can the optimal mode mix be determined?  

6. How can real‑time visibility of inventory levels across the Malaysia assembly plant, regional distribution centers, and retail outlets be enhanced to enable faster decision‑making and reduce the bullwhip effect?  

7. Which digital tools or platforms could streamline cross‑border customs documentation, insurance handling, and regulatory compliance while reducing manual effort and error rates?  

8. How can the company design a flexible production‑scheduling system that dynamically reallocates capacity among shifts in response to sudden changes in demand or component availability? What incentives or contractual terms could be introduced with key component suppliers to encourage early delivery, higher quality, or adoption of greener manufacturing practices?  

10. How might the organization assess the total cost of ownership for each supplier, taking into account hidden costs such as currency fluctuations, tariffs, and logistics complexities?  

11. In what ways can the after‑sales support and warranty processes be linked to upstream quality‑control data to proactively identify and address systemic product issues?  

12. How can the company develop a robust product‑recall protocol that quickly isolates affected units across multiple distribution channels and geographic regions?  

13. What metrics should be tracked to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous‑improvement initiatives aimed at reducing lead times, costs, and carbon emissions throughout the supply chain?  

14. How could the firm leverage blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies to increase transparency and trust among suppliers, logistics partners, and retailers?  

15. What scenario‑planning models would be most useful for evaluating the impact of emerging regulations (e.g., stricter e‑waste laws) on the supply chain’s design and operations?  

16. How can the organization align its multi‑currency financial processes with operational decisions to minimize exposure to exchange‑rate risk while maintaining supplier relationships?  

17. What role can collaborative forecasting with key retailers and e‑commerce platforms play in improving demand accuracy and reducing inventory obsolescence?  

18. How might the company restructure its warehouse network (e.g., adding micro‑fulfillment centers) to better serve last‑mile delivery expectations in densely populated urban markets?  

19. What are the potential benefits and challenges of implementing a circular‑economy model (e.g., take‑back programs, component refurbishing) within the existing supply chain?  

20. How can the company measure and communicate the social and environmental impact of its supply chain to consumers, investors, and regulatory bodies to enhance brand reputation and compliance?
