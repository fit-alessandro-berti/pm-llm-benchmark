We need to produce a comprehensive strategy. Must follow formatting rules: use LaTeX for math, no single dollar signs. Provide sections. Use Markdown.

We must not mention the model unless asked; not asked.

We need to produce detailed answer with metrics, analysis, strategies, simulation, monitoring.

Let's craft sections:


1. 
Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact


	- Use event log mining: conformance checking, alignment; use instance-spanning constraint detection algorithms (e.g., IS-constraint mining). Provide metrics: waiting time due to resource contention at cold-packing (average wait per order), waiting time for batch completion (time from last order in batch to shipping label generation), delays caused by express orders (difference between expected vs actual start of packing for standard orders when express arrives), throughput reduction due to hazardous material limits (orders processed per hour vs capacity). Distinguish within-instance vs between-instance using event timestamps and resource assignment; compute activity duration vs waiting time before start of next activity; use difference between earliest possible start given preceding activity end and actual start.
2. 
Analyzing Constraint Interactions


	- Discuss interactions: priority handling may preempt cold-packing station causing queue shift; batching may delay hazardous orders because they must wait until batch forms but also limited by hazardous limit; etc. Show importance of understanding interactions for optimization.
3. 
Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies


	- Provide three strategies:
a) Dynamic Cold-Packing Allocation with Priority Queueing & predictive scheduling.
b) Adaptive Batch Formation with Hazardous Material-aware batching.
c) Regulatory Compliance Scheduler with real-time monitoring of hazardous packing count and preemptive rescheduling.
For each explain constraints addressed, changes proposed, data usage, expected outcomes.
4. 
Simulation and Validation


	- Use discrete-event simulation built on process model extracted via process discovery (e.g., Alpha Miner or Inductive Miner). Incorporate instance-spanning constraints as resources & global variables. Validate strategies by comparing KPIs: average end-to-end time, throughput per hour, queue lengths etc.
5. 
Monitoring Post-Implementation


	- Define dashboards: Resource Utilization Heatmap for cold-packing stations; Batch Formation Time distribution; Express Order Delay metric; Hazardous Packing Count over time vs limit 10 threshold indicator; Overall Process Performance metrics like average cycle time per region etc.
Also mention using process mining tools like ProM or Celonis? Not necessary but can mention generic tools.

Need to ensure LaTeX formatting for any math expressions e.g., \(\Delta t\).

Let's craft answer accordingly in Markdown sections with headings (#). Ensure no single dollar signs used – we will use \(...\) inline and \(...\) display if needed but likely not needed except maybe formulas like \(\frac{W}{T}\).

Also ensure code blocks properly formatted if we include sample code? Not necessary but could include pseudo-code or SQL queries? Might include small snippet in markdown code block language python or SQL but ensure print width 80 characters? The instruction says "Ensure code is properly formatted using Prettier with a print width of 80 characters". We might provide small Python snippet that calculates waiting times from log DataFrame – we should format accordingly within 80 char lines maybe fine.

Let's produce final answer accordingly.

# 1 Identifying Instance‑Spanning Constraints and Their Impact  

| Constraint | How it appears in the log | Mining technique | Key metric(s) |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Shared Cold‑Packing** | Orders flagged *Requires Cold Packing* are assigned to stations `C1…C5`. When two such orders overlap in their *Packing* timestamps the station is contested.| **Resource‑centric alignment** + **Instance‑spanning constraint mining** (e.g., IS‑ConstraintMiner).<br>Compute the *resource conflict graph* where nodes are events sharing a station.| • **Average cold‑packing wait** = mean( `start(Packing)` – `end(Packing)` of previous order on same station )<br>• **Cold‑packing queue length** = number of pending orders at each timestamp.<br>• **Cold‑packing utilisation** = total packing duration / available capacity |
| **Shipping Batches** | Shipping Label Generation events are tagged “Batch B\*” and only fire after all orders destined for that region have been packed.| **Batch detection via clustering on destination + timestamp window**.<br>Use *batch formation delay* analysis.| • **Batch formation latency** = mean( `start(Shipping Label Gen.)` – latest `end(Packing)` among batch members )<br>• **Batch size distribution** |
| **Priority Handling (Express)** | Express orders appear earlier in the log than standard ones at the same step and sometimes preempt resources.| Apply *priority rule extraction*: compare interleaving patterns where an express event precedes a standard one on the same resource.<br>Use *conformance checking* against an extended Petri net that models preemption.| • **Standard order delay due to express preemption** = mean( difference between expected start under no priority & actual start )<br>• **Express order turnaround time reduction** |
| **Hazardous Material Limits** | Orders flagged *Hazardous Material* cannot exceed ten simultaneously in Packing or Quality Check.| Build a global counter over timestamps across all relevant activities.<br>Detect violations via sliding window analysis.| • **Violation frequency & duration** <br>• **Throughput loss due to throttling:** compare observed throughput against theoretical maximum when limit is enforced |

### Distinguishing Within‑Instance vs Between‑Instance Waiting

For every transition \(A \rightarrow B\):

1. Compute  
   \[
   d_{\text{act}} = t_{\text{complete}}^{A} - t_{\text{start}}^{A}
   \]
2. Compute  
   \[
   d_{\text{wait}} = t_{\text{start}}^{B} - t_{\text{complete}}^{A}
   \]
3. If \(d_{\text{wait}}\) > threshold (e.g., median + 2 σ), flag as potential instance‑spanning delay.
4. Cross–check whether \(d_{\text{wait}}\) correlates with resource contention indicators:
    * Same station used by another case,
    * Batch formation flag,
    * Express priority flag,
    * Hazardous counter > 9 at that instant.
5. If correlation exists → attribute delay to between‑instance factor else treat as within‐instance inefficiency.



# 2 Analyzing Constraint Interactions  

1. ***Priority + Cold Packing***  
   An express order requiring cold packing can displace several standard orders queued on one of five stations—this amplifies both cold‐packing wait times AND batch delays because those displaced orders must finish packing before their region’s batch can be formed.

2. ***Batching + Hazardous Limit***  
   Suppose ten hazardous items destined for “South” arrive close together while other non-hazardous items are also queued for South’s batch.\nThe regulator forces only ten hazardous items into Packing/Quality Check simultaneously.\nIf all ten slots are occupied by hazardous items, any additional non-hazardous item destined for South must wait until one slot frees up—delaying its own packing AND postponing the entire South batch’s shipping label generation.

3. ***Cold Packing + Hazardous Limit***  
   A subset of hazardous items may also require cold packing.\nWhen both constraints overlap there can be deadlock scenarios: e.g., five cold stations occupied by non-hazardous items while ten hazardous items await packaging elsewhere—no further processing possible until either some non-hazardous finish or some hazard moves out of quality check.



Understanding these cross–effects is essential because optimizing one constraint without considering its ripple effects can worsen another—for example adding more cold stations without adjusting batching logic could still leave batches stalled if hazard limits remain tight.



# 3 Developing Constraint‑Aware Optimization Strategies  

## Strategy A – Dynamic Priority Queueing & Predictive Cold Station Allocation  

- **Primary constraints addressed:** Shared Cold‐Packing & Priority Handling  
- **What changes?**
  1️⃣ Introduce a two-level queue per station:
      - High-priority lane reserved exclusively for Express+Cold cases up to a configurable quota (`q_express`).
      - Low-priority lane holds Standard+Cold cases.
      When high-priority lane empties early enough before scheduled shift changeover (`t_shift_end`), temporarily lift quota so low-priority cases can occupy freed slots—reducing idle capacity.
  2️⃣ Predictive scheduler uses historical arrival rates (`λ`) per hour plus real-time backlog (`b`) → compute expected occupancy curve via exponential smoothing:
      ```python
      # Python pseudo-code
      λ_est = α*b_prev + (1-α)*λ_prev          # α ∈ [0,1]
      predicted_wait = λ_est / available_stations
      ```
- **Data leveraged:** Arrival timestamps per case type → estimate λ ; current backlog counts → dynamic adjustment.
- **Expected outcomes:** 
    • Reduced average waiting time for Standard+Cold cases during peak hours (<15 % drop).  
    • Maintained express turnaround (<10 % improvement).  
    • Lower overall cycle times without increasing physical resources.



## Strategy B – Adaptive Batch Formation Triggered by Real-Time Demand & Hazard Status  

- **Primary constraints addressed:** Shipping Batches & Hazardous Material Limits  
- **What changes?**
  1️⃣ Replace static “batch every X minutes” rule with demand-driven trigger:
     - Monitor incoming packed orders per region (`R`).  
     - When cumulative volume ≥ `V_min(R)` OR elapsed time since first packed ≥ `T_max(R)` AND hazard count ≤10 → fire shipping label generation immediately instead of waiting full window.
     ```sql
     SELECT R,
            COUNT(*) AS packed_cnt,
            MAX(timestamp_packed) AS last_packed_ts,
            SUM(CASE WHEN Haz=TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS haz_cnt
       FROM logs WHERE status='Packed'
       GROUP BY R;
     ```
     If conditions met → create new shipment record instantly.
     
- 2️⃣ Introduce “hazard buffer” inside each region’s batch:
     ‑ Reserve up to `h_max(R)=min(10,total_haz_in_region)` slots exclusively for hazards so they never block other regions’ batches even when total hazards exceed local capacity.
     
- 3️⃣ Recompute optimal regional thresholds weekly based on historical volume distributions using clustering over destination coordinates plus delivery deadlines.


- 4️⃣ Expected outcomes:
    ‑ Batch formation latency reduced from median ~12 min down to ~6 min during peak periods (<30 % improvement).   
    ‑ Throughput increase ≈8–12 % because fewer shipments sit idle awaiting additional non-hazardious items.



## Strategy C – Real-Time Regulatory Compliance Scheduler With Preemptive Rescheduling  

- Primary constraint addressed: Hazardous Material Limits across Packing/Quality Check simultaneously

### What changes?

1️⃣ Implement an online monitor that tracks current count `c_haz(t)` across both activities:

```
c_haz(t) = Σ_{case∈active} I(case.hazard)
```

If approaching threshold (`c_haz(t)+Δ >10`) trigger:

a) Identify candidate low-impact tasks among active non-hazardious cases whose completion would free up slots quickly—prefer those already near end-of-life or having short remaining durations (`d_remain`). 

b) Preemptively pause these tasks (**soft pause**) allowing them later requeue once hazard load drops below safe level:

```python
if c_haz >= THRESHOLD_HAZARD:
    candidates = sorted(active_nonhazards,
                        key=lambda x: x.remaining_duration)
    pause(candidates[0])          # minimal disruption strategy
```

c) Record pause reason (“Regulatory buffer”) so downstream analytics capture impact accurately.


### Data leveraged

* Real-time event stream ingestion from MES system → instant update of active task list.\n* Historical duration distributions -> estimate how long it takes typical tasks to complete after being paused/resumed.


### Expected outcomes

• Avoids hard stops that would otherwise stall entire line (>20 % downtime).\n• Keeps regulatory compliance intact while maintaining higher throughput (~5–7 % gain).\n• Provides audit trail linking pauses directly back to regulatory triggers.



# 4 Simulation and Validation  

## Building the Simulation Model

1️⃣ Extract an annotated Petri net from discovery algorithms (**Inductive Miner**) including places representing shared resources:

```
Place_Pack_Cold_i : i=1..5        // each cold station availability token set {0..∞}
Place_Haz_Count : token ∈ [0..10] // global counter across Packing+QC    
Place_Batch_R_j : j=region        // indicates whether current shipment ready 
```

2️⃣ Encode instance-spanning rules as guard functions:

```pseudocode
if Place_Haz_Count.tokens <10 then allow(Pack_Hazard)
else block(Pack_Hazard)
```

3️⃣ Add stochastic timing distributions derived from log statistics:

```pseudocode
duration_Pack_Standard ~ LogNormal(mean=8m , sd=2m)
duration_Pack_Express ~ LogNormal(mean=6m , sd=1m)
duration_BatchFormation ~ Exponential(rate=λ_batch)
```

4️⃣ Run baseline simulation replicating observed KPI distribution (~100 runs).

## Testing Proposed Strategies

For each strategy run separate simulation scenarios:

*A.* Baseline ↔ Strategy A ↔ Combined A+B ↔ Combined A+B+C

Track KPIs:

| KPI | Baseline | After A | After AB | After ABC |
|-----|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Avg End-to-End Time | Xh Ymin | ↓15 % | ↓22 % | ↓28 % |
| Throughput (#orders/hr)| Z | ↑8 % | ↑12 % | ↑18 % |
| Avg Cold-Packing Wait |\(\bar w_c\)| ↓30 % |\(\downarrow\)| |\(\downarrow\)| |
|max simultaneous Hazards violated?| N/A→0|

Validate that simulated improvements match analytical expectations within confidence intervals derived from bootstrapping residuals.



# 5 Monitoring Post‑Implementation  

Create interactive dashboards grouped into three layers:

## Layer I – Resource Utilisation Overview  

* Heatmap showing real-time occupancy (%) per Cold Station.\n\
 Threshold line at target utilisation (~70%).\n\
 Alert when any station remains idle >15 min during shift.\n\
 Metric: Average Idle Time / Station / Shift.


## Layer II – Batch Dynamics Tracker  

* Histogram of Batch Formation Latency broken down by Region.\n\
 Moving average line over past week.\n\
 Trigger alert if median latency exceeds policy value (>8 min).\n\
 Metric: Number_of_batches_per_hour / Region.


## Layer III – Regulatory Compliance Monitor  

* Gauge showing current Hazards Count relative to limit (=10).\n\
 Red zone if approaching limit within next minute.\n\
 Historical trend plot showing frequency/duration of pauses triggered by safety rule.\n\
 Metric: Total Pause Duration / Day.


Additionally publish composite KPI cards summarising overall performance improvements compared against baseline targets set during planning phase.

By systematically extracting quantitative evidence from the event log about how shared resources, batching logic, priorities and safety limits interact—and then designing data-driven interventions that respect these interdependencies—we enable continuous optimisation while keeping regulatory compliance intact throughout the fulfillment lifecycle.”
