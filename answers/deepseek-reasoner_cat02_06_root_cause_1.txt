**1. Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**  
The following cases have notably longer resolution times compared to others:  
- **Case 102**: ~25 hours (Received 03-01 08:05, Closed 03-02 09:15).  
- **Case 104**: ~24 hours (Received 03-01 08:20, Closed 03-02 08:30).  
- **Case 105**: ~49 hours (Received 03-01 08:25, Closed 03-03 09:30).  

Case 105 stands out as the most extreme outlier, taking more than double the average resolution time. Cases 102 and 104 are also significantly above the average (~20 hours).

**2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**  
**a. Escalations to Level-2 Teams**  
- **Impact**: Cases 102 and 105 required escalations, leading to prolonged handover times. For example:  
  - Case 105 had a 28-hour gap between escalation and subsequent investigation.  
  - Case 102 had a 2.5-hour delay after escalation before Level-2 investigation began.  
- **Root Cause**: Level-2 teams may lack capacity, prioritize other tasks, or have inefficient handover processes.  

**b. Long Waiting Times Between Activities**  
- **Impact**: Delays between critical steps (e.g., assignment to investigation):  
  - Case 104: 3.5-hour gap between assignment and investigation.  
  - Case 102: 2.5-hour delay after escalation.  
- **Root Cause**: Resource bottlenecks, poor workload balancing, or lack of prioritization.  

**c. Delays Between Investigation and Resolution**  
- **Impact**: Cases 102, 104, and 105 all had 19+ hours between investigation and resolution.  
  - Example: Case 104 took 19 hours post-investigation to resolve.  
- **Root Cause**: Dependency on external inputs, approval delays, or lack of follow-up protocols.  

**d. Non-Working Hours**  
- **Impact**: Many delays spanned overnight periods (e.g., Case 102’s 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution).  
- **Root Cause**: Lack of 24/7 support or after-hours processes for critical steps.

**3. Recommendations to Address Bottlenecks**  
**a. Optimize Escalation Processes**  
- **Action**: Implement real-time alerts for escalated tickets and set SLAs for Level-2 response times.  
- **Outcome**: Reduce handover delays (e.g., Case 105’s 28-hour gap).  

**b. Reduce Waiting Times Between Steps**  
- **Action**: Use automated prioritization to ensure agents address tickets promptly after assignment.  
- **Outcome**: Minimize gaps like Case 104’s 3.5-hour delay before investigation.  

**c. Streamline Post-Investigation Resolution**  
- **Action**: Provide agents with templates, knowledge bases, or authority to resolve issues without approvals.  
- **Outcome**: Shorten resolution times (e.g., Case 102’s 19-hour post-investigation delay).  

**d. Enable 24/7 Support for Critical Steps**  
- **Action**: Implement shifts or on-call rotations for Level-2 teams during non-business hours.  
- **Outcome**: Avoid delays caused by overnight gaps (e.g., Case 104’s 19-hour resolution delay).  

**e. Train Level-1 Agents to Reduce Escalations**  
- **Action**: Enhance training for Level-1 agents to handle complex issues independently.  
- **Outcome**: Reduce escalations (e.g., Cases 102 and 105) and associated delays.

**Final Insights**  
The longest delays stem from **inefficient handovers during escalations**, **prolonged waiting times between steps**, and **dependencies on non-working hours**. Addressing these through process automation, capacity planning, and 24/7 support coverage would significantly reduce cycle times.
