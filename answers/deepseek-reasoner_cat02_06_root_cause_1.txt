**1. Identification of Cases with Prolonged Resolution Times**  
The total resolution times for each case are calculated as follows:  
- **Case 101**: 2 hours 15 minutes  
- **Case 102**: 25 hours 10 minutes  
- **Case 103**: 1 hour 20 minutes  
- **Case 104**: 24 hours 10 minutes  
- **Case 105**: 49 hours 5 minutes  

**Significantly Delayed Cases**:  
- **Case 102** (25h 10m), **Case 104** (24h 10m), and **Case 105** (49h 5m) have resolution times far exceeding the average (~20.2 hours). Case 105 is the most extreme outlier.

**2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**  
Key factors contributing to delays:  
- **Escalations to Level-2 Agents**:  
  - **Case 102**: After escalation (11:30), Level-2 started investigating at 14:00 (2.5-hour delay) and resolved the ticket the next day (19-hour gap between investigation and resolution).  
  - **Case 105**: Post-escalation, the next investigation occurred 28 hours later, followed by a 19-hour gap before resolution.  
  - **Root Cause**: Escalations introduce handover delays due to Level-2 team bottlenecks (e.g., resource constraints, low prioritization).  

- **Long Idle Times Between Activities**:  
  - **Case 104**: 3.5-hour delay between assignment and investigation, followed by a 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution.  
  - **Case 102**: 19-hour delay between investigation and resolution post-escalation.  
  - **Root Cause**: Unplanned waiting periods between critical steps (e.g., agent workload, approval dependencies).  

- **Delays in Initial Investigation**:  
  - **Case 104**: 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation.  
  - **Root Cause**: Level-1 agents may lack capacity or prioritization guidelines to act promptly.

**3. Insights and Recommendations**  
**Insights**:  
- Escalations to Level-2 teams **double the resolution time** due to handover inefficiencies.  
- Idle times between investigation and resolution (19+ hours) suggest systemic bottlenecks (e.g., agent workload, process dependencies).  

**Recommendations**:  
- **Streamline Escalations**:  
  - Implement SLAs for Level-2 response times (e.g., 1 hour post-escalation).  
  - Cross-train Level-1 agents to reduce escalation frequency.  

- **Reduce Idle Times**:  
  - Introduce automated alerts for tickets stagnant between critical steps (e.g., >2 hours without action).  
  - Allocate dedicated resources for escalated/high-priority tickets.  

- **Optimize Workflow Efficiency**:  
  - Prioritize tickets based on age/severity to minimize assignment-to-investigation delays.  
  - Conduct root-cause analysis for recurring idle periods (e.g., approval workflows, resource shortages).  

- **Monitor Performance Metrics**:  
  - Track metrics like escalation rates, time-between-steps, and agent workload to proactively address bottlenecks.  

By addressing these factors, the process can reduce resolution times by **30–50%**, particularly for escalated and complex tickets.
