**1. Identification of Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**  
The total resolution times for each case are calculated as follows:  
- **Case 101**: 2 hours 15 minutes (8:00–10:15).  
- **Case 102**: ~25 hours 10 minutes (March 1 08:05–March 2 09:15).  
- **Case 103**: 1 hour 20 minutes (8:10–9:30).  
- **Case 104**: ~24 hours 10 minutes (March 1 08:20–March 2 08:30).  
- **Case 105**: ~49 hours 5 minutes (March 1 08:25–March 3 09:30).  

**Significantly delayed cases**:  
- **Case 102** (25 hours), **Case 104** (24 hours), and **Case 105** (49 hours) are outliers compared to the average resolution time (~20 hours) and the median (~24 hours). Case 105 is the most extreme outlier.

**2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**  
Key factors contributing to delays:  

- **Escalations to Level-2 Teams**:  
  - **Case 102**: Escalation introduced a 19-hour gap between investigation (14:00) and resolution (09:00 next day).  
  - **Case 105**: Escalation led to a 28-hour delay before Level-2 investigated (March 1 10:00–March 2 14:00).  
  - Escalations likely cause handover delays due to limited Level-2 availability or prioritization inefficiencies.  

- **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**:  
  - **Case 104**: 3.5-hour delay between assignment (09:30) and investigation (13:00).  
  - **Case 102**: 2.5-hour delay between assignment (09:00) and escalation (11:30).  
  - **Case 105**: 28-hour delay after escalation.  
  - Bottlenecks occur when tickets sit idle between steps, possibly due to agent workload or poor prioritization.  

- **Non-Working Hour Delays**:  
  - Cases 102, 104, and 105 all include overnight gaps (e.g., March 1 14:00–March 2 09:00), suggesting no 24/7 support.  

- **Rework After Escalation**:  
  - **Case 105** required re-investigation after escalation, indicating incomplete handoffs or information gaps.

**3. Insights and Recommendations**  
**How Factors Increase Cycle Times**:  
- Escalations create dependency on specialized teams with potential backlogs.  
- Idle time between steps reflects inefficient resource allocation.  
- Lack of 24/7 support extends resolution times for tickets requiring overnight action.  

**Recommendations**:  
1. **Streamline Escalations**:  
   - Implement SLAs for Level-2 response times.  
   - Ensure complete information is transferred during handoffs to avoid rework.  

2. **Reduce Idle Time**:  
   - Monitor time between steps (e.g., assignment to investigation) and set internal SLAs.  
   - Use automated alerts for tickets waiting too long in queues.  

3. **Extend Support Coverage**:  
   - Introduce shifts or on-call agents to handle escalations and investigations during non-business hours.  

4. **Prioritize Escalated Tickets**:  
   - Flag escalated tickets as high priority to expedite Level-2 action.  

5. **Analyze Level-1 Efficiency**:  
   - Train Level-1 agents to resolve more issues independently, reducing escalation rates.  

**Impact**: Addressing these bottlenecks could reduce resolution times by up to 50% for cases like 102 and 104, and significantly mitigate extreme outliers like Case 105.
