**Justification of Renaming Choices:**

1. **Verify Documents  Initial Document Verification / Post-Submission Re-Verification**  
   - **Context**: In `C001`, the first verification checks submitted documents (e.g., incomplete ID), while the second re-verifies after the customer provides missing scans.  
   - **Rationale**: Highlights the *stage of the process* and the *trigger for re-verification* (customer action).  

2. **Call Customer  Clarify Discrepancy Call / Follow-Up Adjustment Call**  
   - **Context**: In `C002`, the first call addresses an unresolved discrepancy, and the second confirms internal adjustments.  
   - **Rationale**: Emphasizes the *purpose* of each call (problem-solving vs. confirmation).  

3. **Verify Documents  In-Person ID Verification / Post-Adjustment Re-Verification**  
   - **Context**: In `C003`, the first check occurs during a physical branch visit, while the second follows an internal account correction.  
   - **Rationale**: Distinguishes *location* (in-person vs. remote) and *post-action verification* (adjustment-driven).  

4. **Additional Changes**:  
   - **Submit Additional  Submit Additional Docs**: Improved clarity for brevity.  
   - **Adjust Account**: No renaming needed within cases (occurs once), but `C002` vs. `C003` contexts differ:  
     - `C002`: "Adjust account details internally after call"  *Post-Call Adjustment*.  
     - `C003`: "Internal correction due to missing info"  *Data Gap Correction*.  
     *(Not renamed here due to no intra-case repetition but potential for cross-case disambiguation.)*

**Key Design Principles**:  
- **Explicit Process Flow**: Renames link to *why* the activity occurs (e.g., "post-submission," "post-adjustment").  
- **Role Clarity**: Terms like "Clarify Discrepancy" or "Locate Customer" directly reflect the action’s business intent.  
- **Consistency**: Retained core terms like "Document Verification" to preserve domain familiarity while adding specificity.
