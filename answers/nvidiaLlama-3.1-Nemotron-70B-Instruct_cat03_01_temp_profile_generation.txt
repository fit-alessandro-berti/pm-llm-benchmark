Generating a temporal profile for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process requires understanding the typical steps involved in such a process and estimating reasonable average times and standard deviations between these steps. The P2P process generally includes the following activities:

1. **Purchase Request (PR) Creation**
2. **Purchase Order (PO) Approval**
3. **Purchase Order (PO) Issuance**
4. **Goods Receipt**
5. **Invoice Receipt**
6. **Invoice Approval**
7. **Payment Processing**

Please note that the actual times can vary widely depending on the organization's size, policies, the value of purchases, and the efficiency of the procurement and finance departments. The times provided below are hypothetical and used for illustrative purposes.

### Hypothetical Temporal Profile for Purchase-to-Pay Process

```python
temporal_profile_p2p = {
    ('PR Creation', 'PO Approval'): (86400 * 3, 28800),  # Avg: 3 days, STDEV: 8 hours
    ('PO Approval', 'PO Issuance'): (28800, 7200),        # Avg: 8 hours, STDEV: 2 hours
    ('PO Issuance', 'Goods Receipt'): (86400 * 7, 86400 * 2),  # Avg: 1 week, STDEV: 2 days
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400 * 3, 86400),  # Avg: 3 days, STDEV: 1 day
    ('Invoice Receipt', 'Invoice Approval'): (86400 * 2, 28800),  # Avg: 2 days, STDEV: 8 hours
    ('Invoice Approval', 'Payment Processing'): (28800, 7200),    # Avg: 8 hours, STDEV: 2 hours
    # Considering indirect relationships for a more comprehensive profile:
    ('PR Creation', 'PO Issuance'): (86400 * 3.5, 34560),        # Compound avg & stdev
    ('PO Issuance', 'Invoice Receipt'): (86400 * 10, 86400 * 3),  # Compound avg & stdev
    ('PR Creation', 'Goods Receipt'): (86400 * 11, 86400 * 4),    # Compound avg & stdev
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment Processing'): (86400 * 6, 86400 * 2),  # Compound avg & stdev
    ('PR Creation', 'Payment Processing'): (86400 * 18, 86400 * 6),  # Compound avg & stdev
}
```

### Notes:
- **Average (AVG) and Standard Deviation (STDEV) Times:**
  - Times are in seconds for consistency. There are 86,400 seconds in a day.
  - **Direct Relationships:** Estimated based on typical workflow efficiencies.
  - **Indirect Relationships:** Compounded averages and standard deviations are rough estimates. Real values should be derived from process data.
- **Using ZETA for Deviation Detection:**
  - Choose a ZETA value based on your tolerance for deviation (e.g., ZETA=2 for a 95% confidence interval in a normal distribution).
  - **Example Detection with ZETA=2:**
    - For ('PO Approval', 'PO Issuance'), a time < (28800 - 2*7200) or > (28800 + 2*7200) seconds would be considered a deviation.

### Advisory:
- **Real-World Application:** This profile should be validated and adjusted based on historical data from your specific organization's Purchase-to-Pay process.
- **Process Improvement:** Analyze deviations to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for streamlining the P2P process.
