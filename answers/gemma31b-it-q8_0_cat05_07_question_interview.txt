Okay, here’s a list of targeted, open-ended questions I’d ask the interviewee, designed to deepen my understanding of their property onboarding process, focusing on clarifying details and uncovering decision-making:

**Understanding the Process & Roles:**

1.  "Could you walk me through a typical day or week for a property coordinator when onboarding a new property? What are the most common tasks they tackle?" (This gets a sense of daily flow and identifies key responsibilities.)
2.  “How does the property manager’s role evolve as the property moves through the onboarding process? Are there specific milestones where the manager’s involvement shifts?” (Explores the dynamic between roles and potential bottlenecks.)
3.  “What’s the primary reason the regional office relies on the property coordinator’s input, and how does that influence the decision-making process?” (Uncovers the importance of the coordinator’s role and the rationale behind it.)

**Documentation & Verification:**

4.  “Beyond just verifying the documents, what specific steps are taken *after* the documentation is confirmed to ensure the property meets all regulatory requirements?” (Digs deeper into the verification process and potential challenges.)
5.  “How does the company handle situations where a property owner requests additional documentation that isn’t initially provided? What’s the typical workflow for that?” (Explores the flexibility and escalation process.)

**Property Management & Technology:**

6.  “Can you describe the system used for managing property details – beyond just the database – and how does it support the different stages of the onboarding process?” (Gets a better sense of the technology’s role and integration.)
7.  “How does the company balance the need for a highly personalized property manager with the need for standardized processes and efficiency?” (Addresses a key challenge in scaling the process.)
8.  “How do you handle situations where a tenant’s application is rejected – what’s the typical process for addressing the situation?” (Focuses on a critical point of potential conflict and resolution.)

**Decision-Making & Exceptions:**

9.  “Let’s say a property owner insists on a very unusual lease clause – something outside of standard practice. How does the property manager typically handle that?” (Tests their approach to handling exceptions and potential negotiation.)
10. “How does the company approach property inspections? What’s the process for addressing any issues identified during the inspection, and how does that impact the overall timeline?” (Focuses on the quality control aspect and its impact.)
11. “What’s the company’s approach to handling potential delays or complications during the onboarding process – are there specific protocols for dealing with unexpected issues?” (Explores contingency planning and risk management.)

**Overall Process & Communication:**

12. “How does the company ensure consistent communication and collaboration between the different teams involved in the onboarding process – regional office, property manager, and IT?” (Focuses on the flow of information and coordination.)
13. "Could you describe a situation where a key decision point in the onboarding process was particularly challenging, and how the team navigated that situation?” (Gets a real-world example and reveals their problem-solving approach.)

These questions are designed to elicit detailed responses and allow me to understand the nuances of their process, rather than just a surface-level overview.  I'm looking for a comprehensive understanding of how the company manages a complex, multi-faceted onboarding experience.
