We need to respond with anomalies, hypotheses, and SQL queries. Must not reference instructions. Use LaTeX for math. Provide queries. Ensure formatting. No mention of not referencing. Provide clear sections. Use code blocks with SQL. Use LaTeX for any math like thresholds. Provide calculations for ZETA maybe. Provide queries to compute time differences using lead/lag. Provide examples. Let's craft.

**1. Anomalies in the temporal profile**

| Activity pair | Avg. Δ (seconds) | Stdev (seconds) | Why it looks odd |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| (R → P) | 90 000 ≈ 25 h | **3 600** ≈ 1 h | Very low dispersion for a step that normally involves evaluation, approval, and possible re‑work. |
| (P → N) | 604 800 ≈ 7 d | 172 800 ≈ 2 d | Extremely long lag between approval and customer notification; the spread is also large, suggesting inconsistent handling. |
| (A → C) | 7 200 ≈ 2 h | 3 600 ≈ 1 h | Claims are closed only two hours after assignment, often without an explicit evaluation (E) or approval (P) step. |
| (E → N) | 300 ≈ 5 min | 60 ≈ 1 min | The transition from evaluation to notification is unrealistically fast; it leaves little time for any downstream checks. |
| (R → E) | 86 400 ≈ 1 d | 28 800 ≈ 8 h | The standard deviation is relatively high, indicating that some claims wait far longer than a day before evaluation. |
| (P → N) – high stdev | 172 800 ≈ 2 d | The large stdev itself is a red flag: the process is not stable. |

**2. Possible explanations**

| Anomaly | Hypothesis |
|---------|------------|
| **R → P** (tiny σ) | • A batch‑oriented approval job runs on a fixed schedule (e.g., nightly) and forces all approvals to complete at the same time. <br>• An automated rule overrides manual review for certain claim types, producing a deterministic latency. |
| **P → N** (very long μ, large σ) | • Notification is performed manually by a call‑center that experiences staffing spikes (e.g., weekends, holidays). <br>• Some claims are held for additional compliance checks before the customer is informed, while others are auto‑notified. |
| **A → C** (quick close) | • Certain low‑value or “auto‑close” claim categories are closed immediately after assignment (e.g., duplicate submissions). <br>• Data‑entry errors cause the *Close* event to be logged before the *Evaluate*/*Approve* steps. |
| **E → N** (5 min) | • An integration with an external system (e.g., fraud‑check API) returns instantly for most cases, triggering an immediate notification. <br>• The *Notify* event is logged by the system as soon as the evaluation record is created, even if the actual customer contact occurs later. |
| **R → E** (high σ) | • Manual triage creates a backlog; some claims sit in a “pending review” queue for days. <br>• Seasonal peaks (e.g., after natural disasters) cause spikes in waiting time. |
| **P → N** (high σ) | • Different business rules for claim types: “auto” claims are notified quickly, while “home” claims require a site‑visit before notification. <br>• Regional resource constraints (e.g., remote offices) delay the notification step. |

**3. SQL‑based verification queries**

All queries assume the table **claim_events** contains one row per activity with a `timestamp` column of type `TIMESTAMP`.  
The helper CTE `ordered_events` creates a per‑claim ordered list of events.

```sql
-- Helper: events ordered by time per claim
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        resource,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq
    FROM claim_events
),

-- 1. Compute time differences between any two activities of interest
pair_diffs AS (
    SELECT
        c1.claim_id,
        c1.activity AS act_start,
        c2.activity AS act_end,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c2.timestamp - c1.timestamp)) AS delta_seconds,
        c1.resource AS res_start,
        c2.resource AS res_end
    FROM ordered_events c1
    JOIN ordered_events c2
      ON c1.claim_id = c2.claim_id
     AND c2.timestamp > c1.timestamp
    -- keep only the pairs we care about
    WHERE (c1.activity, c2.activity) IN (
        ('R','P'), ('P','N'), ('A','C'), ('E','N'), ('R','E')
    )
)

-- 2. Flag out‑of‑range instances using the profile thresholds
SELECT
    claim_id,
    act_start,
    act_end,
    delta_seconds,
    CASE
        -- R → P : μ = 90 000, σ = 3 600, ZETA = 3 (example)
        WHEN act_start = 'R' AND act_end = 'P'
             AND (delta_seconds < 90_000 - 3*3_600
               OR delta_seconds > 90_000 + 3*3_600) THEN 'R→P outlier'
        -- P → N : μ = 604 800, σ = 172 800, ZETA = 2
        WHEN act_start = 'P' AND act_end = 'N'
             AND (delta_seconds < 604_800 - 2*172_800
               OR delta_seconds > 604_800 + 2*172_800) THEN 'P→N outlier'
        -- A → C : μ = 7 200, σ = 3 600, ZETA = 2
        WHEN act_start = 'A' AND act_end = 'C'
             AND (delta_seconds < 7_200 - 2*3_600
               OR delta_seconds > 7_200 + 2*3_600) THEN 'A→C outlier'
        -- E → N : μ = 300, σ = 60, ZETA = 3
        WHEN act_start = 'E' AND act_end = 'N'
             AND (delta_seconds < 300 - 3*60
               OR delta_seconds > 300 + 3*60) THEN 'E→N outlier'
        -- R → E : μ = 86 400, σ = 28 800, ZETA = 2
        WHEN act_start = 'R' AND act_end = 'E'
             AND (delta_seconds < 86_400 - 2*28_800
               OR delta_seconds > 86_400 + 2*28_800) THEN 'R→E outlier'
        ELSE NULL
    END AS anomaly_type
FROM pair_diffs
WHERE anomaly_type IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY claim_id, act_start, act_end;
```

*What this query does*  

* Calculates the elapsed seconds (`delta_seconds`) between the start and end activities for each claim.  
* Flags a record as an outlier when the elapsed time falls outside a configurable “ZETA‑sigma” band around the expected mean (the numbers profile values).  
* Returns the claim identifier, the activity pair, the measured lag, and a short label indicating which rule was violated.

### 3‑a Correlating anomalies with claim attributes

```sql
-- Example: Are long P→N delays concentrated in a specific claim type or region?
WITH outliers AS (
    SELECT
        ce.claim_id,
        ce.activity AS act_start,
        ce2.activity AS act_end,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS delta_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
    WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) > 604_800 + 2*172_800   -- > 2σ above mean
)
SELECT
    c.claim_type,
    a.region,
    COUNT(*) AS num_long_delays,
    AVG(o.delta_seconds) AS avg_delay_seconds
FROM outliers o
JOIN claims c      ON o.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a   ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id   -- assuming a link; adjust as needed
GROUP BY c.claim_type, a.region
ORDER BY num_long_delays DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

*Interpretation* – The result shows which claim types or adjuster regions experience the most extreme approval‑to‑notification delays.

### 3‑b Detecting “assign‑then‑close” shortcuts

```sql
-- Claims that go from Assign (A) directly to Close (C) without an intermediate Evaluate (E) or Approve (P)
WITH seq AS (
    SELECT
        claim_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM claim_events
)
SELECT
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A') AS assign_ts,
    MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C') AS close_ts,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C')
                     - MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A'))) AS delta_seconds
FROM seq e
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.claim_type
HAVING NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM seq s
        WHERE s.claim_id = e.claim_id
          AND s.activity IN ('E','P')
          AND s.timestamp BETWEEN
                MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'A')
                AND MIN(e.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE e.activity = 'C')
)
ORDER BY delta_seconds;
```

*What it reveals* – Claims that skip evaluation/approval steps entirely; the `HAVING NOT EXISTS` clause ensures no `E` or `P` events appear between the `A` and `C` timestamps.

### 3‑c Fast evaluation‑to‑notification cases

```sql
-- Identify claims where E→N happened in ≤ 2 minutes (120 s)
SELECT
    ce.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    a.region,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS delta_seconds,
    ce.resource AS eval_res,
    ce2.resource AS notify_res
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claim_events ce2
  ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
 AND ce.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
 AND ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
JOIN claims c      ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a   ON c.customer_id = a.adjuster_id   -- adjust join as appropriate
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) <= 120
ORDER BY delta_seconds;
```

*Why useful* – Highlights the subset of claims that may be bypassing required post‑evaluation checks, especially if the same resource performs both steps.

### 3‑d Seasonality of long R→E waits

```sql
-- Average R→E lag per month to see if certain periods cause spikes
WITH diffs AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ce.timestamp)   AS yr,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ce.timestamp)  AS mon,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce.timestamp)) AS delta_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce
    JOIN claim_events ce2
      ON ce.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
     AND ce.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'E'
     AND ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
)
SELECT
    yr,
    mon,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt,
    AVG(delta_seconds) AS avg_seconds,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY delta_seconds) AS p90_seconds
FROM diffs
GROUP BY yr, mon
ORDER BY yr, mon;
```

*Interpretation* – A rising `avg_seconds` or high 90‑th percentile in particular months may point to seasonal staffing shortages or external events (e.g., natural‑disaster claim surges).

These queries give you a concrete starting point to **detect** the timing outliers highlighted by the temporal profile, **explore** their business context (claim type, region, adjuster, season), and **validate** the hypotheses about process irregularities. Adjust the ZETA thresholds, join conditions, or additional filters as you refine the investigation.
