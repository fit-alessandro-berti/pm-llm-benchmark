### 1) Cases that violate the normative process
**Violating cases:** **Case 2, Case 3, Case 5**  
**Conforming cases:** **Case 1, Case 4**

### 2) Explanation of violations (by case)

#### Case 1 — **Conforms**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
Matches the “sufficient inventory” path exactly.

---

#### Case 2 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  **Package**  **Authorize**  Ship  Close

**Violation:** **“Package items” occurs before “Authorize payment.”**  
The description states that *payment authorization should occur after “Check inventory” and before packaging*, because packaging is part of fulfillment and should only happen once payment is approved.

So Case 2 breaks the key ordering constraint:
- **Authorize payment must precede Package items**

---

#### Case 3 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close

Violations (multiple):
1. **Cancellation is followed by fulfillment (“Ship order”).**  
   The text explicitly says shipping (and packaging) is illogical after cancellation:  
   - **Ship order should never occur after Cancel order**

2. **Wrong post-cancellation continuation:** after **Cancel order**, the process should go directly to **Close order**.  
   Normative cancellation path is: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close.  
   Case 3 inserts **Ship order** between Cancel and Close.

3. **Shipping occurs without packaging** (no “Package items” event exists).  
   The description requires:  
   - **Ship order should only occur after Package items**

Additionally, even if one argues payment might be authorized before discovering a problem, the description frames insufficient-inventory handling as **Check  Cancel (directly)**, so having **Authorize payment** in a case that then cancels is at least strongly inconsistent with the intended branching logic.

---

#### Case 4 — **Conforms**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
Matches the “insufficient inventory” path exactly.

---

#### Case 5 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close

**Violation:** **Shipping occurs without “Package items.”**  
The normative flow requires packaging before shipping:
- **Package items should occur after Authorize payment and before Ship order**
- **Ship order should only occur after Package items**

So Case 5 is missing a required step (or has it out of order / unrecorded), and as recorded it deviates from the intended process.

### Summary of violated rules (as implied by the description)
- **Check inventory must occur before** any of: Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Cancel order (all cases respect this).
- **Authorize payment must occur before packaging** (Case 2 violates).
- **Package items must occur before shipping** (Cases 3 and 5 violate).
- **After Cancel order, no fulfillment activities may occur; next should be Close order** (Case 3 violates).
- **Close order must be final** (all cases have Close last).
