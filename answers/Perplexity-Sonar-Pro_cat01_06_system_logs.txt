Explanation of the transformation logic:

1. Case Identification: I grouped events into cases based on the application and document being worked on. For example, all events related to "Document1.docx" are grouped under the case "DOC1", while events related to "Quarterly_Report.docx" are grouped under "DOC2". Similarly, email-related activities are grouped under "EMAIL1", PDF activities under "PDF1", and Excel activities under "EXCEL1".

2. Activity Naming: I translated low-level actions into higher-level, standardized activity names that are more meaningful for process analysis. For example:
   - FOCUS and SWITCH events became "Open Document/Email/PDF/Spreadsheet"
   - TYPING events became "Edit Document", "Write Reply", or "Edit Spreadsheet" depending on the context
   - SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT events in PDF became "Review PDF" and "Highlight PDF"
   - CLICK events in email became more specific actions like "Open Email", "Compose Reply", "Send Email"

3. Timestamps: I retained the original timestamps from the system log.

4. Additional Context: While not shown in the table for brevity, additional attributes like the specific document name or email subject could be included as additional columns if needed for more detailed analysis.

This transformation provides a higher-level view of the user's activities, making it more suitable for process mining analysis while still preserving the essential flow and timing of events.
