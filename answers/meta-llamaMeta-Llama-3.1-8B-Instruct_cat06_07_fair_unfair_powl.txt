Below is a representation of the two POWL models as described, using the classes provided by pm4py for the representation. 

The first model represents the process where there is a potential unfairness introduced in the hiring process. The second model shows how to modify this process to avoid the introduction of unfairness.


```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities for the process
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the XOR operator for the unfairness model
XorUnfairness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, SilentTransition()])

# Define the loop for data completeness check
DataCompletenessLoop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the unfairness model
UnfairnessModel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment, XorUnfairness])
UnfairnessModel.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
UnfairnessModel.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, XorUnfairness)
UnfairnessModel.order.add_edge(XorUnfairness, ManagerialReview)
UnfairnessModel.order.add_edge(XorUnfairness, FinalDecision)

# Define the fair model
FairModel = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck])
FairModel.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessLoop, SkillAssessment)
FairModel.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)
FairModel.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
FairModel.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Print the unfairness model
print("Unfairness Model:")
print(UnfairnessModel)

# Print the fair model
print("\nFair Model:")
print(FairModel)
```

These POWL models show the two hiring process representations. The first model represents the hiring process with potential unfairness, where applicants who are members of the "Global Business Leaders Club" or are local residents receive a subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation. The second model represents the hiring process without unfairness, where all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.
