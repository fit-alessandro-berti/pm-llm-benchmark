Here is a proposed grouping of the low-level events into higher-level process steps, along with the rationale and proposed names. The analysis is based on the sequence, nature of activities, and resources involved in the provided sample event log.

### Proposed High-Level Process Steps:

---

**High-Level Step 1: Material Preparation**

*   **Low-Level Events:**
    *   Retrieve raw metal sheet
    *   Scan barcode
    *   Place metal sheet on table
    *   Align metal sheet
    *   Preheat metal sheet
*   **Rationale:** This initial phase encompasses all activities related to acquiring, identifying, and preparing the raw material before any significant transformation occurs. It includes handling the base material, logging its identity (via barcode), positioning it correctly on a workspace, and setting its initial physical state (preheating) to be ready for the next stage. These events are sequential, logically dependent, and focus on setting up the product for fabrication.
*   **Proposed Name:** Material Preparation

**High-Level Step 2: Welding & Assembly**

*   **Low-Level Events:**
    *   Pick up welding tool
    *   Weld corner A
    *   Weld corner B
*   **Rationale:** This group represents the core manufacturing operation where the product's structure is formed or components are joined. The activities clearly revolve around welding, starting with the action of acquiring the necessary tool and progressing to the actual welding of different points (corners). This is the primary "Assembly" or fabrication stage where the item gains its essential form.
*   **Proposed Name:** Welding & Assembly

**High-Level Step 3: Finishing & Coating**

*   **Low-Level Events:**
    *   Apply protective coating
    *   Dry coating
*   **Rationale:** Following the main assembly/fabrication, these events involve applying a protective layer and then curing it. These are distinct processing steps that enhance the product's durability, appearance, or performance. They represent a post-assembly treatment phase separate from the core assembly and subsequent quality checks.
*   **Proposed Name:** Finishing & Coating

---

**High-Level Step 4: Quality Control & Inspection**

*   **Low-Level Events:**
    *   Measure weld integrity
    *   Visual check
*   **Rationale:** This final phase consolidates all verification and validation activities performed on the product. `Measure weld integrity` is a specific, often automated, check of the quality achieved in the previous "Welding & Assembly" step. `Visual check` is a more general, human-centric inspection that typically occurs at the end of the manufacturing sequence. Grouping these together represents the overall quality assurance gates before the product is considered complete.
*   **Proposed Name:** Quality Control & Inspection
