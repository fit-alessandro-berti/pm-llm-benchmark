The observed event log shows a primary sequence of activities, interrupted by an optional, potentially repetitive feedback loop involving requests for missing information ($\text{RMI}$) followed by re-validation ($\text{VF}$).

The core mandatory flow is: $\text{RA} \rightarrow \text{VF} \rightarrow \text{AE} \rightarrow \text{AD} \rightarrow \text{SC} \rightarrow \text{AC}$.

The variability occurs after $\text{AE}$. Cases 1 and 3 show that $\text{RMI}$ can occur one or more times before $\text{VF}$ is executed, leading to $\text{AD}$. Case 2 shows this entire remediation block is skipped ($\epsilon$).

We model the remediation block ($R$) as an exclusive choice between skipping it ($\tau$) or executing the sequence of requests followed by validation. To handle the repetition of $\text{RMI}$ seen in Case 3 ($\text{RMI} \rightarrow \text{RMI} \rightarrow \text{VF}$), we use the loop operator on $\text{RMI}$, and a silent step ($\tau$) as the exit condition carrier, which allows the sequence to proceed to the required validation step ($\text{VF}$).

The resulting Process Tree structure is:

$$\rightarrow ( \text{'RA'}, \rightarrow (\text{'VF'}, \rightarrow (\text{'AE'}, R, \rightarrow (\text{'AD'}, \rightarrow (\text{'SC'}, \text{'AC'})))))$$

Where $R$ is the remediation block:
$$R = X (\tau, \rightarrow ( * (\text{'RMI'}, \tau), \text{'VF'} ) )$$

**Final Process Tree Model (Textual Representation):**

`-> ( 'RA', -> ( 'VF', -> ( 'AE', X( tau, ->( *( 'RMI', tau ), 'VF' ) ), ->( 'AD', ->( 'SC', 'AC' ) ) ) ) )`
