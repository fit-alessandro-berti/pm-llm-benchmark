Here is the integrated, chronologically ordered event log for Order #1234, with merged records where possible and unmatched events preserved. Below the log you’ll find detailed reasoning about how each merge (or non-merge) decision was made.

Merged Event Log

Key:
- “Timestamp A” = System A’s timestamp  
- “Timestamp B” = System B’s timestamp  
- Origin = whether the row was merged or comes from only one system

## Reasoning

1. **Timestamp Tolerance & Primary Timestamp Selection**  
   - We chose a matching tolerance of ** 2 seconds**: if System A and System B timestamps differ by two seconds or less, we treat the events as the same occurrence.  
   - For merged records, **System A’s timestamp** is used as the “primary” timestamp column (since Log A is the “primary” timeline). System B’s timestamp is retained in its own field for audit.  
   - For events present only in one system, that system’s timestamp becomes the primary.

2. **Merged Events**  
   - **Order Received / OrderReceived**  
     - A: 10:00:00Z (“Order Received”)  
     - B: 09:59:58Z (“OrderReceived”)  
     -  = 2 sec  merge.  
     - Attributes combined: `user_id=u45`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Event captured at warehouse system"`.  
   - **Order Validated / OrderValidation**  
     - A: 10:01:30Z (“Order Validated”)  
     - B: 10:01:29Z (“OrderValidation”)  
     -  = 1 sec  merge.  
     - Combined `user_id=u12`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Cross-check inventory"`.  
   - **Item Shipped / Shipping**  
     - A: 10:05:00Z (“Item Shipped”)  
     - B: 10:05:02Z (“Shipping”)  
     -  = 2 sec  merge.  
     - Combined `user_id=u45`, `resource_id=r10`, `notes="Package handed to courier"`.

3. **Unmatched Events**  
   - **Payment Processed** (A only at 10:02:00Z) vs **PaymentCheck** (B only at 10:02:05Z)  
     - Although semantically related, their timestamps differ by 5 seconds (> 2 sec), so we cannot confidently align them. They remain as separate records.  
   - **Quality Check** (B only at 10:03:00Z)  
     - No corresponding event in Log A; preserved as its own entry.  
   - **Item Delivered** (A only at 10:20:00Z)  
     - No corresponding event in Log B; preserved as its own entry.

4. **Chronological Ordering**  
   - All rows are sorted by the primary timestamp field.  
   - This yields the final unified sequence from order receipt through final delivery, with all available metadata attached.

This merged log now provides a single, enriched timeline: you can see both systems’ views of each key step and still detect events unique to one system.
