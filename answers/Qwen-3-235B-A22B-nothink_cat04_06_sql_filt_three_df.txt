Here's a DuckDB SQL query that satisfies all the requirements you've outlined:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS event_order
    FROM
        event_log
),

sequence_candidates AS (
    SELECT
        e1.case_id,
        e1.timestamp AS approve_time,
        e2.timestamp AS create_time,
        e3.timestamp AS confirm_time
    FROM
        ordered_events e1
        JOIN ordered_events e2
            ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2.event_order = e1.event_order + 1
        JOIN ordered_events e3
            ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id AND e3.event_order = e2.event_order + 1
    WHERE
        e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', e2.timestamp, e3.timestamp) > 5
)

SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
WHERE
    el.case_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM sequence_candidates);
```

###  Explanation:

1. **`ordered_events` CTE**:
   - Assigns a row number (`event_order`) to each event in a `case_id`, ordered by `timestamp`.
   - This helps identify consecutive events.

2. **`sequence_candidates` CTE**:
   - Finds sequences of three **consecutive** events in the order:
     - `'Approve Purchase Requisition'`  `'Create Order'`  `'Confirm Order'`.
   - Filters for sequences where the time between `'Create Order'` and `'Confirm Order'` is **more than 5 days**.

3. **Final `SELECT`**:
   - Returns all rows from the `event_log` **except** those from `case_id`s found in the `sequence_candidates`.

---

###  Notes:

- The `DATE_DIFF` function is used to compute the difference in days.
- This query assumes that timestamps are stored as proper `TIMESTAMP` or `DATETIME` types.
- Adjust the date function if you're using a different datetime format or function syntax in your DuckDB version.
