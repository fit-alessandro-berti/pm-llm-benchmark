To generate the temporal profile for this process, we first need to identify all possible pairs of activities that can occur sequentially across different process variants and then calculate the average (AVG) time and standard deviation (STDEV) between these pairs. However, since actual timestamps or durations between activities are not provided in your input data, I'll illustrate how you might approach this problem theoretically using a simplified example.

For instance, if we assume some sample timing values for certain activity pairs:

1. **'Create Fine' -> 'Send Fine':**
   - If it's observed that the average time is 24 hours (86400 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 hour (3600 seconds), then:
     ```python
     ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (86400, 3600)
     ```

2. **'Insert Fine Notification' -> 'Add penalty':**
   - If the average time is 1 day and the standard deviation is 1 hour:
     ```python
     ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (86400, 3600)
     ```

To fully generate this profile for all possible pairs from your data, you would need to:

- **Collect Timing Data:** Obtain timestamps or durations between each pair of activities across multiple traces.
- **Calculate AVG and STDEV:** For every unique activity pair identified, calculate the average time and standard deviation using collected timing data.

Since detailed timing information is missing in the provided process variants, let's manually construct a sample profile based on hypothetical values for some activity pairs:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): (86400, 3600),       # AVG: 1 day, STDEV: 1 hour
    ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): (259200, 7200),   # AVG: 3 days, STDEV: 2 hours
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): (43200, 3600),   # AVG: 12 hours, STDEV: 1 hour
    ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): (57600, 9000),            # AVG: 16 hours, STDEV: 2.5 hours
    ('Add penalty', 'Send for Credit Collection'): (82800, 4320),  # AVG: 23 hours, STDEV: 1.2 hours
    ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Payment'): (172800, 10800)     # AVG: 48 hours (2 days), STDEV: 3 hours
}
```

### Explanation:
- **('Create Fine', 'Send Fine')**: This pair has an average time of one day and a standard deviation of one hour.
- **('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification')**: The average time is three days, with a standard deviation of two hours.
- Etc.

The actual values would need to be calculated based on real timing data. Each value in the dictionary represents a tuple where the first element is the average (AVG) and the second is the standard deviation (STDEV).

For your full process, you would repeat this calculation for every possible pair of activities across all variants, considering their frequencies.

If actual timestamps or performance times are available, they can be used to compute AVG and STDEV accurately.
