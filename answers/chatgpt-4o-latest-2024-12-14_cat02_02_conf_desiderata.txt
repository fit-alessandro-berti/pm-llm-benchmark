### **Analysis of the Event Log**

#### **Part 1: Normative Rule Violations**
Let us identify and explain violations of the strict sequence and ordering rules.

---

**Case 1:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Analysis:**  
  - All activities occur in the correct sequence and follow the normative constraints.  
  - No violations detected.

**Case 2:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received → Risk Assessment → Credit Check → Loan Decision (Rejected) → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Violations:**  
  1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**:  
     - Violates the rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.  
  2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**:  
     - Documentation should not be finalized for rejected loans.  
- **Outcome:**  
  - **Two normative rule violations.**

**Case 3:**  
- **Activities:**  
  - Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Activities are in the correct sequence and adhere to all normative rules.  
  - No violations detected.  

---

### **Summary of Normative Violations**  
- **Case 1:** No violations.  
- **Case 2:**  
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check.  
  - Documentation finalized after rejection.  
- **Case 3:** No violations.

#### **Part 2: Desiderata Deviations**
Let us analyze where cases deviate from recommended best practices.

---

**Case 1:**  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Credit Check is completed promptly (within 30 minutes of application).  
  - Applicant is informed quickly (2 hours after Loan Decision).  
  - No follow-up call was made before closing the case, but this is not required.  
- **Deviations:**  
  - **No deviations** from desiderata.

---

**Case 2:**  
- **Analysis:**  
  - No information on whether applicant was informed within 48 hours (not explicitly logged).  
  - Follow-up call was not conducted, but this is not mandatory.  
- **Deviations:**  
  - **None explicitly logged**.  

---

**Case 3:**  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after Application Received:  
    - Deviates from the recommendation to complete it within 24 hours.  
  - Applicant informed 4 days (96 hours) after Loan Decision:  
    - Deviates from the recommendation to inform within 48 hours.  
  - No follow-up call made before closing.  
- **Deviations:**  
  - Credit Check timing (desideratum).  
  - Late applicant notification (desideratum).  
  - No follow-up call.

---

### **Summary of Desiderata Deviations**
- **Case 1:** No deviations.  
- **Case 2:** No explicit deviations logged.  
- **Case 3:**  
  - Credit Check delayed.  
  - Applicant informed late.  
  - No follow-up call.

---

#### **Justifications and Interpretations**
1. **Case 2 Violations:**  
   - Performing Risk Assessment before Credit Check might indicate a process error or lack of clear guidance.  
   - Finalizing Documentation after rejection could reflect a miscommunication or misunderstanding of the rules.

2. **Case 3 Deviations:**  
   - Delayed Credit Check and applicant notification might be due to resource constraints or operational delays over the weekend (application received on 2024-01-12 and Credit Check delayed to 2024-01-14).  
   - Lack of follow-up call could be a matter of priority or workload.

### **Final Recommendations**
1. Ensure training and automation enforce normative rules, such as ensuring Credit Check always precedes Risk Assessment.  
2. Introduce automated reminders to meet timing desiderata, like completing Credit Checks within 24 hours and notifying applicants promptly.  
3. Consider improving logging to capture non-mandatory activities, like follow-up calls, for better process evaluation.
