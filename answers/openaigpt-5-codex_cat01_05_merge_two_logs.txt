### Integrated Event Log (Chronological)

| Primary Timestamp (SystemA) | Secondary Timestamp (SystemB) | Unified Event Name | Order ID | SystemA Event Type | SystemB Event Name | User ID | Resource ID | Notes |

### Reasoning & Matching Decisions

1. **Order Received**  
   - **Match rationale:** Order IDs align, and timestamps differ by only 2 seconds. SystemA timestamps reflect message receipt; SystemB records the warehouse capture slightly earlier.  
   - **Integration choice:** Used SystemA timestamp as the primary timeline per requirements, while preserving SystemB’s more granular data (user/resource/notes).

2. **Order Validated**  
   - **Match rationale:** Same order ID, timestamp difference of 1 second, and synonymous event names (“Order Validated” vs. “OrderValidation”).  
   - **Integration choice:** Merged attributes, keeping SystemA timestamp primary.

3. **Payment Processed / PaymentCheck**  
   - **Match rationale:** Names describe the same business step; order ID matches. Timestamp difference is 5 seconds—a bit beyond the stated 2-second tolerance—but SystemB’s note (“Payment gateway delay”) explains the small offset. Given the contextual alignment, the events were merged.  
   - **Integration choice:** Chose SystemA timestamp to maintain chronological consistency; preserved SystemB timestamp and metadata as secondary.

4. **Quality Check**  
   - **Match rationale:** No corresponding event in SystemA. Possibly a step only monitored by SystemB (e.g., a warehouse QA activity).  
   - **Integration choice:** Included the event solely from SystemB, marking missing SystemA attributes as blank.

5. **Item Shipped / Shipping**  
   - **Match rationale:** Same order ID, timestamps differ by 2 seconds, describing the shipping handoff.  
   - **Integration choice:** Merged, keeping the SystemA timestamp primary and SystemB metadata for enrichment.

6. **Item Delivered**  
   - **Match rationale:** Event exists only in SystemA. SystemB likely doesn’t capture final delivery confirmation.  
   - **Integration choice:** Included unmodified from SystemA, with SystemB fields left blank.

### Conflict Resolution & Assumptions

- **Primary timeline:** SystemA timestamps were used as the primary chronological anchor, per instructions. Secondary timestamps from SystemB were retained where available to reflect the actual capture times in that system.
- **Tolerance adjustment:** Though a 2-second tolerance was suggested, a 5-second discrepancy in the payment event was considered acceptable due to supporting metadata and typical gateway delays.
- **Naming harmonization:** A “Unified Event Name” was introduced to capture the shared business meaning while retaining both systems’ original labels.
- **Missing attributes:** When an event was absent in one system, the corresponding columns were left blank to signal the origin system and preserve data fidelity.

This integrated log maintains the richer context of SystemB while preserving the authoritative timeline from SystemA, providing a consolidated view of Order#1234’s fulfillment lifecycle.
