1. Normative (hard-rule) Compliance

Case 1   Compliant  
• Activities occur exactly in the mandated order.  
• No forbidden or missing steps.

Case 2   Non-compliant  
a. Risk Assessment recorded before Credit Check (ordering violation).  
b. Inform Applicant is completely missing (mandatory step skipped).  
c. Finalize Documentation executed although the decision was “Rejected” (contradictory action).  
d. Close Case therefore happens after an illegitimate finalisation.  
 Several hard-rule violations, the case is invalid from a normative standpoint.

Case 3   Compliant  
• Correct order and presence of all mandatory activities  
  (Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalise Documentation  Close Case).  
• No forbidden steps after an approval.  
 Normatively sound.


2. Desiderata (soft-rule) Compliance

Legend:  = recommendation not met

Case 1  
• Credit Check within 24 h                        OK  
• Inform Applicant within 48 h                    OK  
• Follow-up Call before closing                    (No call logged)  
 Minor sub-optimality, otherwise fine.

Case 2  
• Credit Check within 24 h                        OK  
• Inform Applicant within 48 h                     (Not done at all)  
• Follow-up Call before closing                    (No call logged)  
 Desiderata not met on two counts (added to the severe normative problems).

Case 3  
• Credit Check within 24 h                         (49 h after application)  
• Inform Applicant within 48 h                     (51 h after decision)  
• Follow-up Call before closing                    (No call logged)  
 All three recommendations missed, but still normatively correct.


3. Possible Interpretations / Justifications

Case 1  
• Smooth, ideal execution except for the missing follow-up call; team may have deemed a call unnecessary after prompt written notification.

Case 2  
• The clerk might have rushed into a Risk Assessment before the external credit bureau replied, then tried to “patch” the process afterwards.  
• The “Finalize Documentation” could be an accidental click or an automated document generation script that did not check the rejection outcome.  
• Omitting “Inform Applicant” suggests a serious procedural breakdown or an incomplete event capture.

Case 3  
• Application Friday morning; Credit Check executed Sunday (possible weekend staffing or external-system availability).  
• Inform Applicant on Tuesday afternoon—51 h delay could stem from waiting for managerial sign-off or client-preferred contact hours.  
• High workload may explain why the optional follow-up call was skipped.


Summary
• Normative violations only in Case 2 (order errors, missing mandatory step, forbidden action after rejection).  
• Desiderata violations: minor in Case 1, several in Cases 2 and 3.  
While Cases 1 and 3 are legally/contractually correct, addressing the soft-rule deviations would improve customer experience and operational efficiency.
