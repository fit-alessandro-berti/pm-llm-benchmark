# Visualization Description

This image contains **three related components** describing a proclet-based workflow system for medical lab processes.

## (a) Two Proclet Classes Connected Through Two Channels

This is the **main process flow diagram** showing two interconnected workflow processes:

### Left Proclet – "Lab Visit"
- Initiated by a **doctor** and **lab assistant**
- Activities include:
  - **Order entry**  **Take blood sample**  **Receive result**  **Judge results**
  - Branching paths: **"Everything fine"**  **Send report** (end)
  - Or: **"Do tests again"**  **Receive updated result**  loops back

### Right Proclet – "Lab Test"
- Involves a **chemical analyst**
- Activities include:
  - **Perform test**  **Make report**  **Finish lab test**
  - Alternative path: **Perform test again**  **Provide updated report**

### Channels
- Two dashed-boundary systems connect the proclets:
  - **Order system** (top)
  - **HIS** (Hospital Information System, middle)
- Cardinality notations (e.g., `1..1`, `1..*`, `1..?`) indicate message multiplicity

---

## (b) Class Diagram
Shows a simple UML relationship:
- **Lab visit** `requires` **1..\* Lab tests** (one lab visit requires one or more lab tests)

---

## (c) Example of a Performative (Table)
| Time | Channel | Sender | Receivers | Action | Content | Scope | Direction |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|-----------|
| 11:00 | Order system | Lab visit - John | Lab test - HGB John | Create | Can you perform a HGB test for John? | Private | OUT |

This illustrates a **message/communication instance** between proclet instances.
