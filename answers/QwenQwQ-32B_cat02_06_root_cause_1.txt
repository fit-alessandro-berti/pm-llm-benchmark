Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the task properly. The goal is to analyze the event log of customer support tickets to find cases with unusually long resolution times and figure out why those delays are happening. There are three main steps here: identify the delayed cases, find the root causes, and then suggest improvements.

Starting with the first task: identifying which cases have significantly longer total resolution times. To do this, I'll need to calculate the total time each case (ticket) took from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket". Let's see the data provided:

Looking at the table:

Case 101:
- Received on 2024-03-01 08:00
- Closed on the same day at 10:15. So total time is about 2 hours and 15 minutes.

Case 102:
- Received on 2024-03-01 08:05
- Closed on 2024-03-02 09:15. That's over 25 hours (next day at 9:15, so ~25h10m).

Case 103:
- From 8:10 to 9:30 on the same day. That's around 1 hour 20 minutes.

Case 104:
- Received 8:20, closed on the next day at 8:30. Total time is about 24 hours and 10 minutes (so roughly a day).

Case 105:
- Start at 8:25 and ends on the third day at 9:30. That's over two days, around 53 hours or so?

Wait, let me do exact calculations for each case to be precise.

Let me compute each case's total time:

Case 101:
End date/closed: 2024-03-01 10:15
Start: same day 8:00, so 2h15m.

Case 102:
Start 2024-03-01 08:05, Close 2024-03-02 09:15. That's 24h + 1 hour 10 minutes? Wait, from 08:05 to next day 08:05 is 24 hours. Then add until 09:15, so another 1 hour 10 minutes. Total 25h10m.

Case 103:
Start 2024-03-01 08:10 to Close 09:30 on same day. That's 1 hour 20 minutes.

Case 104:
Start 8:20 on March 1, 2024, closed March 2 at 8:30. Let's compute:
From 08:20 to next day 08:20 is 24h, plus another 10 minutes, so total 24h10m.

Case 105:
Start at 08:25 on March 1, closed March 3 at 09:30. Let's see:

From March 1 08:25 to March 2 08:25 is 24h. From March 2 08:25 to March 3 09:30 is another 24h45m. So total is 48h45m plus the remaining? Wait perhaps better to compute exactly:

Compute start and end timestamps.

Case 105:

Start: March 1 08:25,

End: March 3 09:30.

So the difference between those times.

March 1: 24 hours = March 2 08:25 is exactly 24h. Then March 3 09:30 is another 24h45m. Wait, no. Wait from 8:25 on March 1 to 8:25 on March 3 is 48 hours, plus 1 hour 5 minutes (from 08:25 to 10:30?), wait no. Wait, March 3's 09:30 is March 1's 08:25 + 48 hours plus 1 hour 5 minutes. So total time is 48h +1h5m = 49 hours and 5 minutes. Wait, perhaps better to compute each:

From March 1 08:25 to March 2 08:25 is 24 hours. Then from March 2 08:25 to March 3 09:30 is another 24h45m? Wait, March 3 09:30 minus March 2 08:25 is 24 (from 08:25 to same next day) plus 1h5m=25h5m?

Wait maybe I need to compute total hours using actual difference:

March 1:

Start time: 08:25,

End time: March 3, 09:30.

March 3 has a date two days later. The time between 08:25 and 09:30 is another day's time plus an extra hour and 5 minutes. Hmm, perhaps easier to compute in minutes.

Total days between March 1 and March 3 is 2 days, but the exact time:

Total days difference is 2 days (from March 1 to March 3 is 2 days, but time difference is:

Start: March 1, 8:25 AM

End: March 3, 9:30 AM

The total difference is:

2 days (48 hours) plus (9:30 -8:25) = 1h5m. So total is 49h5 minutes. So approximately 49 hours and 5 minutes. So around 49 hours.

Now, let me compile all the durations:

Cases:

101: ~2h15 (about 2.25 hours)

102: ~25h10 (25.17 hours)

103: ~1h20 (1.33 hours)

104: ~24h10 (24.17 hours)

105: ~49h5 (49.08 hours)

So looking at the total times:

The average would be (2.25 +25.17 +1.33 +24.17 +49.08)/5.

Adding them step by step:

First case: 2.25,

Add 25.17: total 27.42

Add 1.33: 28.75

Add 24.17: ~52.92

Add 49.08: ~102

Total is around 102 hours. Divided by 5 gives average of ~20.4 hours.

Comparing each case's duration to that average.

Case 101: 2.25 vs 20.4: much shorter.

Case 102: ~25 hours (above average). Since average is ~20.4, so 25 is a bit above.

Case 104 is ~24 (also above average).

Case 105 is way above (49).

So the most delayed cases are clearly Case 105, then 104, then 102. But "significantly longer" might require seeing standard deviations or just which are outliers. Since 105 is over 49h, compared to others (except 104 and 102 which are over 24h). So perhaps 105 is especially delayed. But 104 is about 24h (approx a full day), 102 is 25h. But since in some cases like 103 and 101 are done in a few hours.

So "significantly" would likely consider cases with much longer durations. For example, 105 is 49 hours, which is twice as long as 104. So probably case 105 is the most problematic. Cases 102 and 104 also take more than a day, which might be considered longer than average.

The question says "significantly longer than average", so maybe all cases with total time way above average. The average was around 20 hours, so cases like 102 (25h),104 (24h),105(49h) might be considered above. Perhaps 105 is the most, but let's see.

So first step: Identify the cases with longer times. The user probably wants to know which one are abnormally long. So I can note:

Cases 102 took over a day (~1 day 1 hour), 104 took about a day (24h10m), but 105 took almost 50 hours (about 2 days). Thus, 105 is the most delayed, followed by 104, then 102. Hence the first task's answer would list these cases (maybe 102, 104, 105 as significant).

Now moving to the second task: Determine root causes. Need to look at each of those cases and see why they took so long.

Starting with Case 105 first since it's the slowest.

Looking at case 105:

Timeline:

2024-03-01 08:25: Receive

08:35: triaged (so 10 mins)

09:00: assigned (25 minutes later)

09:10: investigate started (so 10 mins after assigned)

Then...

At 10:00: Escalate to Level-2 (so 50 minutes after investigation started? Wait let me check:

Investigate begins at 09:10, then next activity is 10:00 escalate.

So from 9:10 to 10:00 is 50 minutes, presumably time spent investigating before escalation?

Then next activity: on 2024-03-02 at 14:00 (which is the next day's 2:00 PM) there's another "Investigate Issue".

Wait, so between escalating and next activity, there is a wait time of almost 28 hours? Because escalate at 10:00 on day1, and next action on day2 at 14:00? Wait that's 28 hours? Let me compute.

From March 1, 10:00 AM to March 2, 2:00 PM is 28 hours (because next day 10 AM would be 24 hours, so +4h is 28).

Wait, that seems like a long delay between Escalate and Re-investigation.

Then after that, they investigated again on the 2nd at 2:00 PM, then they resolved on March 3 at 9:00 AM.

The resolve took 22 hours since the investigation? Because from 2 pm to next day's 9 AM is 19 hours (since 2pm to midnight is 10h, plus 9h to 9am = 19). Hmm, maybe.

But the long waiting could be between the escalation (March 1 10:00) and the next action at the 14:00 next day. That's a 28-hour delay. So that's a big chunk of time.

Similarly, in case 104, let's see. Case 104's timeline:

Received on 8:20,

Triage at 9:00,

Assigned at 9:30,

Investigate starts at 13:00 (so 3.5 hours after assignment? Wait from 9:30 AM to 1 PM is 3.5 hours), then resolves next day at 8:00 AM.

From investigation at 1:00 PM to resolve next day 8:00 AM is ~19h (assuming 24h minus 13h + ... Wait, from 13:00 to 08:00 next day is 19 hours (from 13 to 24 is 11h, plus 8h). So total 19.5h?

Then Resolve to Close is 30 minutes.

Wait but maybe the big delay here is after investigate. The investigate started at 1pm, then the next step is resolving at 8AM next day, which is 19 hours later—so maybe during that time, the agent took too long to close it, maybe no escalation but just slow processing?

Also, Case 102:

Case 102 timeline:

Escalation after being assigned to Level-1 (assigned at 9:00, then escalate at 11:30 AM). So 2.5 hours.

Then after escalate, the investigate next day at 2 PM (March 1 11:30 AM to March 1 2 PM is 2.5 hours? Wait no, March is 1st until 11:30 AM to 2 PM same day. Wait, then resolve at 9AM next day (March 2nd 9:00 AM). So from escalation at 11:30 on day1, to next investigation at 2 PM same day, which is 2.5h, then investigation to Resolve is from 2 PM to next day 9 AM. That's 19h again, similar to case 104?

Wait maybe the escalation itself wasn't the issue but the time between investigate and resolve?

Wait let me look again for 102:

After escalation at 11:30 AM March1, then they had an "Investigate" at 14:00 (2 PM). Then Resolve is at 9 AM next day. So the investigation starts at 2PM, then maybe the investigation took over 19h until resolve at 9AM next day?

Wait but the activity is "Investigate Issue" then next is "Resolve". So maybe the investigation step took longer.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a wait between activities not accounted for.

Wait for case 102, perhaps the main slow-down was between escalate and investigate? Let's see:

Case 102 escalate was at 11:30 AM on day1 (March1). Then next activity is investigate at 14:00 PM (2 PM next is 2.5h later. Then from 14:00 to resolve at 9 next day's morning. The time between investigate and resolve would be from 14- next day 9 AM is 19 hours.

Hmm. So that's a possible point.

But in Cases like 104 and 105, the longest delays were after the escalate steps? Wait, perhaps.

Looking at case 105's long delay between escalate (March1 10 AM) to next activity (March2 2 PM)—that's a 28-hour wait. That's a major contributor. So that could be a problem.

So possible factors here are:

- Delays between escalation and next action (like in case 105, 28 hrs between escalate and the next investigate, which could indicate that the Level-2 team took too long to start working on it.

- Also, if a case is escalated, perhaps there is a big time expenditure, but in 105 it's even worse since the escalation activity's next step took a huge delay.

Additionally, in case 105, after the escalate, when they reassigned to Level-2, maybe they didn't start until 14:00 next day, which is after a 28-hour delay. So that's a potential issue—long waiting time before the escalated team resumes work.

Another possible factor is time taken to complete steps:

For example, in Case 102, the duration from triage to assignment was okay, but investigate after escalate took time.

Alternatively, the steps that take the longest:

For case 101:

Triage quickly (10 mins), assigned a few mins, then investigation took 40 mins (8:20 to 9:00?), then resolved. The longest step there might not be major.

Wait, in case 104, the assignment happened at 9:30, then they didn't start investigating until 1 pm—3.5 hours of delay between assign and investigate. That seems like a long waiting time before they even start working on it. That could be a cause of delay.

Similarly, in case 104, between the assignment (9:30 AM) and investigate (1:00 PM):

That's ~3.5 hours. Why the wait?

Whereas in case 103, assigned at 830, investigate at 845—so 15 mins. That's quick.

So if the agents take a long time between assigning and starting to investigate, that's a problem.

Another factor is that when a case is escalated, there's time lost. For example:

Case 102 was escalated on March1 at 11:30 AM, but before that, after assignment at 9 AM, they took 2 hours until escallation. Maybe that's required, but the next step after escalate took 2.5 hours to start investigating?

Hmm, not a big delay, but then after that, 19 hours until resolved. Maybe the Level-2 team works slower?

Wait in case 102, after 2 pm investigation, the resolve is next day 9 AM. 19 hours until resolve. That's a whole night, perhaps the team didn't work after hours? Or if they are supposed to work 8-5, then maybe the processing happens during the next day.

Same in case 105: after 2 pm on day2 (the next day after escalate?), the investigation to resolve takes time but the next steps are over the night, but maybe that's standard working hours? Not sure the business hours here.

Alternatively, in case 105 after escalate, maybe the escalated team is very slow to do the investigation. So that could be a problem with the escalation process's efficiency.

Another point: in case 105, after the initial investigation, they escalate, but the escalate step itself is done at 10:00 AM, but the next investigate step is the next day, which is a very long wait. So maybe the escalated cases don't get prioritized.

So, summarizing possible causes:

- **Long delays between certain activities**:

  - especially between escalate and next investigation (case 105 had 28h wait after escalate)
  
  - also between assignment and investigate (case 104 waited 3.5h before starting)

- **Escalation itself adds time to the process**, but sometimes it's the time after escalation that's the problem (like in case 105, where escalate to Level-2 didn't trigger immediate action).

- Perhaps some steps (like investigation) take too long when done by Level-1, leading to needing escalation which compounds delays (but case 105's initial investigate was 10 mins before escalation, but they might not have done enough? Or maybe it was necessary to escalate but the escalation process is slow?)

Wait another thing is the number of steps. For example, case 105 has two "Investigate" steps? Or maybe the second one is after escalation. Let me check:

Case 105's timeline:

Investigasate starts at 9:10,

Then escalate at 10 AM,

Then another Investigate on 3/2 14:00 (next day). So the Level-2 agent started investigating again, meaning that the Level-1 agent passed it without finishing their part. Maybe duplication of work or inefficiency?

Or perhaps after escalate, the Level-2 has to start their own investigation, which is time-consuming. So it might be inherent to more complex issues needing escalation, but the process can be optimized.

So possible factors are:

1. Excessive delays between when a task is assigned/escalated and when the next action occurs (ex: Case 104 had a 3.5-hour delay between assignment and starting investigation, and Case 105 had a day plus delay after escalation).

2. Escalations introduce significant added time, and if those delays between escalation and next activity are not managed properly, it balloons the total time.

3. Some steps taking too long, such as the investigation in Level-2 taking too much time, e.g., in case 102 from investigate to resolve was 19 hours, but maybe the next working day processing is okay if that's typical, but 28 hours in Case 105's escalate/investigation is unusual.

Additionally, in case 104, the main delay is between "Investigate" at 13:00 and "Resolve" at 08:00 next day—so 19 hours. If the team is only working standard hours, perhaps this is overlapping into the next working day, so maybe it's acceptable, but if they need to resolve faster, then that's an issue. Alternatively, if they can process quicker, that would help.

Moreover, looking at cases without escalations (case 101 and 103) finish quite quickly. The ones that require escalation take much longer. Thus, the presence of an escalation path may inherently add more time, but especially when combined with waits between steps.

So the root causes are likely a combination of:

- Delayed start times for tasks (assign to agent not leading to immediate investigation).

- Long waiting periods after an escalation before work resumes on the ticket.

- Extended investigation times post-escalation.

Now, moving onto third task: how do these factors cause delays and what can be done.

The first issue is delays between activity assignments. For instance, after a ticket is assigned to a Level-1 agent, they might not begin working on it promptly—Case 104 waited 3.5 hours. This is probably due to the agent's workload or lack of priority handling. Agents might not prioritize new tickets quickly or may have other tasks.

Second, after escalation, if the next team (Level-2) is overloaded or doesn't have enough capacity, the tickets sit idle until someone gets to them. The 28-hour delay in Case 105 is critical here, as it could be that Level-2 was busy, but the process for escalating tickets needs better prioritization.

Third, if the investigation steps, particularly in Level-2, require costly or time-consuming activities (like needing more info or multiple rounds of troubleshooting), that adds time.

Recommendations:

1. **Reduce delays between assignment and first action**:

   - Implement a rule that agents must start investigating within X hours (e.g., 1 hour) after being assigned. Maybe introduction of a first response goal.

   - Monitor and address reasons for delays, like poor workload balance on Level-1.

2. **Streamline escalation process and improve handoff procedures**:

   - Ensure that escalated tickets are prioritized immediately by the Level-2 team. Maybe use automated alerts or prioritized queues.

   - Standardize communication tools between Level-1 and Level-2 so that the handoff is smoother, reducing confusion or redundant investigation.

3. **Improve availability of escalation resources**:

   - Staff sufficient Level-2 agents to handle escalated tickets promptly. The long delay in Case 105 suggests that Level-2 might be understaffed or over capacity.

   - Ensure Level-2 has access to resources or training to resolve issues faster. If they need more time because they lack knowledge, providing better training or docs could help.

4. **Set time limits on individual steps and monitor through process mining**:

   - For example, investigating should not take more than Y hours. If it does, escalate to a supervisor early.

   - Use analytics to identify tasks prone to delays and apply feedback to agents or process.

5. **Introduce an auto-escalation mechanism if tasks aren’t handled within SLAs**:

   - If a ticket hasn’t been investigated within 2 hours of assignment, it automatically escalates or an alert is raised to management.

   - Monitor bottlenecks through KPIs like SLA adherence and cycle times per activity.

6. **Review the necessity and efficiency of escalations**:

   - Do all escalated cases take about the same time? Perhaps some cases can be resolved faster with improved Level-1 training.

   - Maybe some escalations are unnecessary if Level-1 could handle them if given more resources or protocols.

Additionally, in Case 105, having two "Investigate" steps after escalation suggests maybe the Level-2 team needs to do a full reassessment rather than building on Level-1's work, leading to duplication. Ensuring that escalate passes along all current information to cut down redundant work.

In summary, the biggest issues are delays between assigning tickets and starting work, after escalation, and possibly the process around handling escalated cases being too slow or not well-coordinated. Addressing these steps with better management, staffing, and process design should reduce the cycle time.

### Analysis of Delayed Tickets and Root Causes

#### **1. Identification of Delayed Cases:**
The longest resolution times are found in cases **102, 104, and particularly 105**, as calculated below:

| **Case ID** | **Total Resolution Time**        | **Observations**                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **101**     | **2 hours 15 minutes**           | Fast resolution with no escalation.                                              |
| **102**     | **25 hours 10 minutes**          | Escalated case with a significant lag between escalation and investigation.      |
| **103**     | **1 hour 20 minutes**            | Very efficient; required no escalation.                                           |
| **104**     | **24 hours 10 minutes**          | Long delay between investigation and final resolution, plus a 3.5-hour lag post-assignment. |
| **105**     | **49 hours 5 minutes**           | Most delayed case, driven by a 28-hour gap after escalation and re-investigation. |

**Significantly longer cases:**  
- **Case 105**: ~49 hours (more than double the average).  
- **Case 104**: ~24 hours (approximate average of 2 days).  
- **Case 102**: ~25 hours (1–2 days beyond average).  

---

#### 2. **Root Causes of Delays**  
**A. Prolonged Gaps Between Key Activities**  
   - **Case 104**: A 3.5-hour delay occurred between **"Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30)** and the start of **"Investigate Issue" (13:00)**. This indicates poor urgency or workload management in Level-1 agents.  
   - **Case 102**: A 2.5-hour gap between **"Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30)** and the **"Investigate Issue" (14:00)** step. While shorter than Case 105’s delays, it still shows inefficiency in handoffs.  
   - **Case 105**: An **28-hour delay** between **escalation (10:00)** and **the Level-2 Agent** starting their **investigation (14:00 next day)**. This suggests under-resourcing or low priority of escalated cases by the Level-2 team.  

**B. Time Costs of Escalation**  
   - Escalated cases (102, 104, 105) incurred delays of **15–28 hours**, which amplified total resolution times compared to non-escalated cases (101, 103).  
   - **Case 105’s Reinvestigation**: After escalation, Level-2 Agents took **28 hours** to begin work, resulting in redundant efforts (e.g., re-investigating the issue from scratch).  

**C. Extended Investigation Times**  
   - **Case 102**: Investigation after escalation took **19 hours** (from 14:00 to the next day’s 09:00). While this might align with overnight working constraints, it still contributes to escalating delays.  
   - **Case 104**: Investigation (13:00  next day’s 08:00) also took ~19 hours, pointing to suboptimal resolution efficiency.

#### 3. **Performance Bottlenecks & Recommendations**  
| **Issue**                          | **Root Cause**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |  
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Delays in Starting Investigations** | Agents procrastinate or are overburdened post-assignment (e.g., Case 104’s assignment to investigation lag). | - **Implement SLA for first-response action** (e.g., within 1–2 hours of assignment). <br> - Use automated alerts for delayed tasks.  
| **Slack Handoffs During Escalation** | Poor communication/prioritization between Level-1 and Level-2 teams (e.g., Case 105’s 28-hour gap post-escalation). | - **Automate priority tagging during escalation** (e.g., high-priority flags to Level-2). <br> - Introduce **dedicated handover protocols** (e.g., shared task lists or automated notes).  
| **Inefficient Post-Escalation Work** | Level-2 agents re-creating steps (e.g., Case 105’s re-investigation).           | - **Streamline knowledge-sharing** during escalation (e.g., ensure Level-1’s findings are shared with Level-2). <br> - Train agents to reference prior steps.  
| **Overloaded Level-2 Team**         | Understaffing or poor resource allocation in Level-2 (e.g., Case 105’s wait).  | - **Staff Level-2 teams during peak periods** or use overflow staffing. <br> - Monitor escalation volumes to anticipate demand.  
| **Long Investigation Phases**       | Complex issues requiring excessive troubleshooting time.                       | - **Tiered investigations**: Level-2 agents should first consult pre-approved templates or knowledge bases. <br> - Provide faster access to technical resources (e.g., diagnostic tools).  

---

### **Summary of Insights**  
1. **Escalations are a double-edged sword**: While necessary for complex cases, their implementation often introduces delays due to handoff inefficiencies and over-burdened teams.  
2. **Urgency and accountability are critical** during initial assignment and post-escalation stages. Lack of timely action compounds delays.  
3. **Process standardization** (e.g., SLAs, tools, and communication channels) can reduce redundant work and ensure faster handoffs.  

By addressing these bottlenecks, the team can drastically reduce outlier cases like **105** and improve overall customer support cycle time.
