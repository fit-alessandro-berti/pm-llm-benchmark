# Follow-Up Questions for Property Onboarding Process Clarification

Thank you for that comprehensive overview. I have several questions that will help me better understand the nuances and decision points within this process.

---

## Initial Contact and Documentation Phase

1. **When a landlord first contacts the regional office, what determines which regional office handles the request?** Is it based purely on property location, or are there situations where a different office might take ownership?

2. **What specific criteria does the property coordinator use to determine if documentation is "sufficient"?** Are there different documentation requirements based on property type, location, or local regulations?

3. **How long does a landlord typically have to provide missing or updated documents before the request is considered abandoned or deprioritized?** Is there a formal follow-up cadence?

4. **What happens if a landlord provides documentation that appears fraudulent or inconsistent?** Is there a verification process beyond the coordinator's review?

## Property Manager Assignment

5. **You mentioned several factors for assigning a property manager—workload, geography, experience, and track record. How are these factors weighted against each other?** For instance, would you assign an overloaded but highly experienced manager to a complex luxury property, or distribute to someone with lighter capacity?

6. **Who makes the final decision on property manager assignment?** Is it the coordinator, a regional director, or is there a system that suggests matches?

7. **What happens if no available property manager meets the ideal criteria for a particular property?** Are there escalation paths or temporary assignments?

8. **Can a landlord request a specific property manager, perhaps based on a referral or past relationship?** How do you handle such requests?

## Landlord-Manager Alignment Meeting

9. **What specific outcomes or deliverables are expected from the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord?** Is there a standard agenda or checklist that guides this conversation?

10. **How are the agreements from this meeting documented and shared with other stakeholders** who may need to reference them later (e.g., the marketing team, leasing agents, compliance)?

11. **What happens if the landlord and property manager have a significant disagreement during this meeting**—for example, about pet policies or maintenance responsibilities? Is there a mediation process?

---

## Inspection and Photography

12. **How do you select which photographer and inspector to use?** Are these internal employees, preferred vendors, or does the property manager have discretion?

13. **What is the typical timeframe between scheduling the inspection/photography visit and the actual visit occurring?**

14. **You mentioned that if the inspector finds issues, the property manager works with the landlord to address them. Who bears the cost of these repairs**—the landlord, the management company, or is it negotiated case by case?

15. **Is there a threshold for inspection failures?** For instance, if a property has too many issues or safety hazards, can the company decline to onboard it entirely?

16. **What happens if the landlord refuses to make required repairs?** Does the process stall indefinitely, or is there a point where you disengage?

---

## Marketing and Pricing

17. **How does the digital marketing team determine the appropriate pricing?** You mentioned "internal pricing models" and "current market trends"—who has final approval if there's a discrepancy between the model's suggestion and the landlord's expectations?

18. **How long does the marketing preparation typically take** from receiving the photographer's images to having a live listing?

19. **Are there situations where a property is marketed before passing final inspection,** perhaps with caveats, or must inspection always precede marketing activation?

---

## Tenant Screening and Lease Finalization

20. **What are the specific criteria or thresholds used during tenant screening**—for example, minimum credit scores, income-to-rent ratios, or acceptable gaps in rental history?

21. **Who has final authority to approve a tenant**—the property manager, the landlord, or both? What happens if they disagree on a candidate?

22. **You mentioned negotiating lease terms and offering promotional discounts when multiple tenants are interested. What guardrails exist around these negotiations?** Can a property manager offer any discount, or are there limits?

23. **How do you handle situations where a property receives no applications** within a certain timeframe? Is there a formal review or adjustment process?

---

## Compliance and Quality Checks

24. **At what point in the process does the compliance officer review the lease**—before it's presented to the tenant, after signing, or both?

25. **What happens if the compliance review identifies an issue with a lease that has already been signed?** How is that remediated?

26. **How does the financial analyst's review work in practice?** If they determine the agreed rental price doesn't meet profitability targets, can they block or delay the activation?

27. **You mentioned the IT department checks data integration. What types of errors are they looking for,** and what happens if they find discrepancies?

---

## Exception Handling

28. **You mentioned properties requiring special insurance as an exception. What triggers the identification of such requirements,** and at what stage is this typically discovered?

29. **How are custom lease clauses requested by landlords evaluated and approved?** Is there a legal review process, and who has authority to accept or reject non-standard terms?

30. **What happens if a property falls out of compliance after it has been onboarded**—for example, if local regulations change or if a follow-up inspection reveals new issues?

31. **Are there any circumstances under which a property can be "fast-tracked" through this process,** perhaps skipping or condensing certain steps? What criteria would justify that?

---

## Communication and Coordination

32. **You mentioned communication is tracked across email, CRMs, and project management tools. Is there a single source of truth for the status of a property onboarding,** or do different stakeholders reference different systems?

33. **How is handoff managed between stakeholders**—for example, when the coordinator passes the property to the assigned manager, or when the manager hands listing details to the marketing team? Are there formal handoff protocols?

34. **How are delays or bottlenecks identified and escalated?** Is there proactive monitoring, or does it rely on stakeholders raising concerns?

35. **How do you handle situations where external stakeholders (landlords, inspectors, contractors) become unresponsive** and create delays in the process?

---

## Metrics and Process Improvement

36. **What does "success" look like for this onboarding process?** Are there KPIs you track, such as time-to-activation or landlord satisfaction?

37. **How often is this process reviewed or updated,** and who is responsible for identifying improvement opportunities?

These questions should help me build a much clearer picture of how decisions are made, where handoffs occur, what can go wrong, and how the organization manages complexity and exceptions throughout the property onboarding lifecycle.
