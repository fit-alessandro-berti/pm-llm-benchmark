**Anomalies Identified in Temporal Profile Model:**

1.  **Receive to Approve (R, P):** The average time of ~25 hours is paired with an exceptionally low standard deviation (1 hour), making the process appear rigid and unnaturally consistent.
2.  **Approve to Notify (P, N):** The average delay is extremely long (7 days) and highly inconsistent (STDEV of 2 days), suggesting a major, unpredictable bottleneck.
3.  **Assign to Close (A, C):** The quick average time (2 hours) suggests claims may be closed directly after assignment, bypassing critical evaluation and approval steps.
4.  **Evaluate to Notify (E, N):** The 5-minute average is unrealistically fast for a manual or considered step, indicating potential automation or the skipping of intermediary tasks.

**Hypotheses for Anomalies:**

1.  **Hypothesis for (R, P):** The approval step (`P`) might be automated or governed by a strict, time-based rule (e.g., "approve all claims after 24 hours if no fraud flag is raised"), removing natural human processing time variability.
2.  **Hypothesis for (P, N):** The notification step (`N`) could be a manually executed batch job (e.g., generating and mailing paper checks weekly) instead of an immediate, automated task, leading to long and variable delays.
3.  **Hypothesis for (A, C):** Adjusters might be incorrectly closing claims (e.g., as duplicates or due to lack of coverage) immediately after assignment without performing the required evaluation, or a system error is auto-closing certain claim types.
4.  **Hypothesis for (E, N):** The `N` activity might be an automated system notification (e.g., an instant email) triggered immediately by the `E` event, or the `E` event is logged retroactively only moments before the notification is sent.

**Verification SQL Queries:**

1.  **Query to Investigate Rigid R->P Timing:**
    This query finds claims where the time from Receive (`R`) to Approve (`P`) deviates significantly from the expected average, which could indicate exceptions to the hypothesized automated rule.

```sql
WITH time_diffs AS (
    SELECT
        ce_r.claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce_p.timestamp) - MAX(ce_r.timestamp))) AS time_diff_seconds
    FROM claim_events ce_r
    JOIN claim_events ce_p ON ce_r.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id
    WHERE ce_r.activity = 'R'
    AND ce_p.activity = 'P'
    GROUP BY ce_r.claim_id
)
SELECT
    claim_id,
    time_diff_seconds,
    (time_diff_seconds - 90000) / 3600 AS deviation_from_avg_hours -- Z-score proxy
FROM time_diffs
WHERE ABS(time_diff_seconds - 90000) > 3600 * 2 -- Filter for claims >2 STD away
ORDER BY deviation_from_avg_hours DESC;
```

2.  **Query to Investigate Long P->N Delays and Correlate with Resources:**
    This query identifies the slowest notifications after approval and shows which resource was responsible, helping pinpoint if delays are systemic or tied to specific individuals/teams.

```sql
SELECT
    ce_p.claim_id,
    ce_p.resource AS approval_resource,
    ce_n.resource AS notify_resource,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp)) / 86400.0 AS delay_days
FROM claim_events ce_p
JOIN claim_events ce_n ON ce_p.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id
WHERE ce_p.activity = 'P'
AND ce_n.activity = 'N'
AND (ce_n.timestamp - ce_p.timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days' -- Filter for excessively long delays
ORDER BY delay_days DESC;
```

3.  **Query to Find Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
    This query finds claims closed very quickly after being assigned, which may indicate improper closure and a bypassing of process steps. It includes claim details for further analysis.

```sql
SELECT
    ce_a.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    ce_a.resource AS assigned_adjuster,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp)) / 60.0 AS time_to_close_minutes
FROM claim_events ce_a
JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
JOIN claims c ON ce_a.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce_a.activity = 'A'
AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
AND ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp < INTERVAL '1 hour' -- Filter for very quick closures
ORDER BY time_to_close_minutes ASC;
```

4.  **Query to Check for Missing Process Steps in Quickly Closed Claims:**
    This query builds on the previous one by checking if the critical Evaluate (`E`) and Approve (`P`) steps are missing for claims closed quickly after assignment, confirming the hypothesis of a bypassed process.

```sql
WITH quickly_closed_claims AS (
    SELECT ce_a.claim_id
    FROM claim_events ce_a
    JOIN claim_events ce_c ON ce_a.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id
    WHERE ce_a.activity = 'A'
    AND ce_c.activity = 'C'
    AND ce_c.timestamp - ce_a.timestamp < INTERVAL '4 hours' -- Broader filter
)
SELECT
    qcc.claim_id,
    BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') AS was_evaluated,
    BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P') AS was_approved
FROM quickly_closed_claims qcc
LEFT JOIN claim_events ce ON qcc.claim_id = ce.claim_id AND ce.activity IN ('E', 'P')
GROUP BY qcc.claim_id
HAVING BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'E') = FALSE OR BOOL_OR(ce.activity = 'P') = FALSE;
-- Shows claims missing E, P, or both
```
