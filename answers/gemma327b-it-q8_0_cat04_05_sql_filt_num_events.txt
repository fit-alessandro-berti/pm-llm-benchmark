```sql
SELECT
  el.*
FROM
  event_log AS el
WHERE
  el.case_id IN (
    SELECT
      case_id
    FROM
      event_log
    GROUP BY
      case_id
    HAVING
      COUNT(*) <= 6
  );
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Outer `SELECT el.* FROM event_log AS el`:** This selects all columns from the `event_log` table, aliased as `el`. This is the main query that will return the filtered events.

2. **`WHERE el.case_id IN (...)`:** This filters the events based on whether their `case_id` is present in the result of the subquery.

3. **Subquery `SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`:**
   - **`SELECT case_id`:**  Selects the `case_id`.
   - **`FROM event_log`:** Specifies the table to query.
   - **`GROUP BY case_id`:** Groups the rows by `case_id`, so we can count events for each case.
   - **`HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6`:**  This is the crucial filtering step.  `COUNT(*)` counts the number of events within each `case_id` group. The `HAVING` clause filters these groups, keeping only those where the count is less than or equal to 6.  This returns a list of `case_id` values that meet the criteria.

**How it works:**

The subquery first identifies all `case_id` values that have six or fewer events.  Then, the outer query selects all events from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is in the list returned by the subquery.  This effectively filters out any events belonging to cases with more than six events.

**Why this is a good solution:**

* **Clear and Readable:** The query is relatively easy to understand, with a clear separation between the filtering logic (subquery) and the event selection (outer query).
* **Efficient:** Using `IN` with a subquery is generally efficient for this type of filtering, especially with DuckDB's query optimizer.
* **Correctness:**  The query accurately implements the requirements of the prompt, filtering out cases with more than six events and returning only the events from the remaining cases.
* **Standard SQL:**  The query uses standard SQL syntax, making it portable to other database systems with minimal modifications.
