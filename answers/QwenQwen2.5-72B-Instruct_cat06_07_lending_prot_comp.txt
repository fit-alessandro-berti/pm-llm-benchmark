To identify the main differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their frequencies and performance times. Here are the key differences:

### 1. **Overall Loan Outcomes:**
- **Loan Rejected:**
  - **Protected Group:** 
    - Most common path: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Application Rejected (960 cases, performance = 219999.156)
    - Other common rejections involve multiple steps, including co-signer requests and collateral assessments.
  - **Unprotected Group:**
    - Most common rejection path: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (2709 cases, performance = 340005.309)
    - Other rejections also involve multiple steps, but the frequency is lower.

- **Loan Approved:**
  - **Protected Group:**
    - Fewer approvals with longer processing times: 
      - Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colateral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (39 cases, performance = 330025.590)
  - **Unprotected Group:**
    - More approvals with slightly faster processing times:
      - Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (1656 cases, performance = 340004.889)

### 2. **Appointment Denial:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Appointment Denial: 599 cases, performance = 90000.623
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Appointment Denial: 363 cases, performance = 80001.088

### 3. **Application Rejection:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Application Rejection: 960 cases, performance = 219999.156
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Application Rejection: 664 cases, performance = 260002.042

### 4. **Co-Signer and Collateral Assessment:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - More frequent and longer processes involving co-signer requests and multiple collateral assessments.
  - Example: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (217 cases, performance = 330020.041)
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Less frequent and generally longer processes involving co-signer requests and multiple collateral assessments.
  - Example: Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Application -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Make Visit to Assess Colateral -> Make Visit to Assess Colateral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (7 cases, performance = 439995.571)

### 5. **Performance Times:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - Generally faster for simpler processes (e.g., Appointment Denied).
  - Longer for more complex processes involving multiple steps.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Generally longer overall, especially for complex processes involving multiple steps.
  - Faster for simpler processes (e.g., Appointment Denied).

### 6. **Frequency of Complex Processes:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - More frequent involvement in complex processes with multiple steps.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - Less frequent involvement in complex processes, but when involved, the processes are generally longer.

### Summary:
- The **protected group** faces more frequent rejections and is more often involved in complex processes with multiple steps, which generally take longer.
- The **unprotected group** has a higher rate of loan approvals, but when loans are denied, the processes are generally longer and more complex.

These differences suggest potential biases or systemic issues in the loan application process that may be disproportionately affecting the protected group. Further investigation is needed to determine the root causes and address these disparities.
