1) Process discovery and conformance checking

A. Preprocessing & integration (how I’d build a single event log)
- Define case(s). Two useful views:
  - Primary: Vehicle-Day (e.g., V12-20241205) — good for endtoend operational analysis (departure  return  depot).
  - Secondary / nested: Package delivery traces (per package) to analyze individual delivery outcomes and re-deliveries.
  - Keep linkage: each package event points to Vehicle-Day case so you can roll-up/down.
- Standardize timestamps & time zones. Reconcile clock skew across GPS, scanners and dispatch logs (use depot NTP anchor or align events that clearly pair, e.g., “Depart Depot” and GPS).
- Normalize event schema: for every source map to canonical fields: case_id, activity_name, timestamp, resource (vehicle/driver), location, event_type, package_id, planned_stop_id, notes, speed, vehicle_status, etc.
- Convert continuous GPS stream to discrete events:
  - Map-match GPS to road graph.
  - Detect stops/stationary periods using dwell thresholds (e.g., speed < 2 km/h for > X seconds/minutes) and cluster into “Arrive Customer / Depart Customer / Unplanned Stop / Traffic slow”.
  - Label travel segments between stops as “Drive from A->B” with travel start/end times and distances.
- Enrich with dispatch & maintenance:
  - Join planned routes and planned stop sequence to actual stops by spatial proximity (within radius) + time window overlap; attach planned_stop_id and planned_sequence.
  - Insert scheduled/unscheduled maintenance intervals as events inside vehicle-day traces.
- Add derived fields: travel_time, stop_service_time, delay_vs_plan (arrival_time - planned_window_start/ETA), fuel_estimate (if no fuel sensor: estimate with speed, distance, vehicle-specific consumption model), cumulative_km per day.
- Data quality checks & cleansing:
  - Detect missing package IDs or scanner misses; mark uncertain matches.
  - Filter GPS noise and short (< threshold) toggles.
  - Flag conflicting records (e.g., two different drivers same vehicle simultaneously).

Main challenges
- Heterogeneous granularity and semantics: GPS produces many fine-grain events; scanners produce discrete delivery events. Need consistent event abstraction.
- Clock skew and missing timestamps across devices.
- Matching actual stops to planned stops when customers close addresses or multi-stop sites exist.
- Missing/incorrect IDs (package or planned_stop_id) and privacy constraints (customer lat/lon).
- Volume and processing of GPS streams — need efficient stop-detection and map-matching.
- Edge cases: chained deliveries from multiple depots, vehicle swaps mid-shift.

B. Process discovery (visualize real endtoend process)
- Use performance-aware miners:
  - Fuzzy miner / Disco for a quick, human-readable map of frequent flows and exceptions.
  - Inductive/Heuristic miner for sound models allowing timing overlays and variant extraction.
  - Use hierarchical models: top-level for Vehicle-Day (Depot Depart  Drive  [ArriveServiceDepart]*  Unscheduled Stop?  Return Depot), lower-level for package handling (Scan Arrive  Delivery Success/Failure  Depart).
- Represent travel vs service explicitly:
  - Treat “Drive” segments and “Stop/Service” activities as first-class. Visualize aggregate travel-time and service-time per transition.
  - Overlay performance metrics on edges and nodes: median/95th travel times, counts.
- Include exception nodes: Unscheduled Stop, Engine Warning, Delivery Failed, Reroute, Overtime.
- Visualizations:
  - Process map annotated with frequency and timing (heatmap of thick edges for high frequency / long duration).
  - Trace clustering / variant explorer: show top N variants and the tail of exceptional sequences.
  - Spatial overlays: heatmap of stop density and delay hotspots on a map linked to process flows.

C. Conformance checking vs planned routes
- Align discovered traces to planned sequence using alignment algorithms (optimal alignment / conformance checking):
  - Token-based replay + alignment to quantify fitness (how much of planned route was executed) and precision/generalization.
- Deviations to look for:
  - Sequence deviations: visits executed in different order than planned (resquencing), skipped visits, extra/unplanned visits.
  - Timing deviations: arrival outside requested customer time window or large arrival ETA delta.
  - Unplanned stops: maintenance stops, long traffic slowdowns, unscheduled refuels.
  - Rework/loops: failed delivery  return for re-delivery later (repeat visits for same package).
  - Route abandonment: return to depot early or swap vehicle.
- Metrics from conformance:
  - Fitness (percentage of planned stops actually performed).
  - Costs/penalties per deviation type (minutes lost, km extra).
  - Alignment diagnostics for every deviation: where it happened in the route and the likely cause (traffic, driver decision, vehicle issue).

2) Performance analysis and bottleneck identification

A. KPIs (definitions and how to compute from event log)
- On-Time Delivery Rate (OTDR): number of deliveries within customer time window / total deliveries. Compute per day/route/driver.
  - Use arrival timestamp vs. dispatch ETA / requested window.
- Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time): mean(Depart_time - Arrive_time) for successful deliveries.
- Average Travel Time between Stops: mean(travel_time) for Drive segments. Also 95th percentile to capture extreme delays.
- Travel Time vs Service Time Ratio (T:S ratio): total_drive_time / total_service_time per vehicle-day.
- Fuel Consumption per km/package: if fuel sensor available use direct; else estimate fuel = sum_k (fuel_model(speed_profile, distance)). Normalize: fuel/km, fuel/package.
- Vehicle Utilization Rate: time driving + service_time divided by shift_duration (exclude scheduled breaks/maintenance).
- Frequency & Duration of Traffic Delays: count and total duration of low-speed segments (speed < threshold) or travel_time > expected_travel_time_by_segment.
- Rate of Failed Deliveries / Re-delivery Rate: failed_delivery_count / total_delivery_attempts and average extra km/minutes due to re-deliveries.
- Unscheduled Maintenance Rate and Impact: count of unscheduled stops for maintenance per 1,000 km and minutes lost + cost.
- Overtime Rate: driver overtime minutes / shifts.
- Cost per Delivery: estimated cost = (fuel_cost_per_km * km) + (driver_cost_per_min * shift_minutes) + maintenance_allocation. Useful for ROI modeling.

B. Process mining techniques to find bottlenecks
- Performance overlay on process map: color nodes/edges by median and 95th percentile times to spot stages causing most delay.
- Variant analysis: compare fastest vs slowest variants for same planned route — identify which deviations correlate with poor performance.
- Dotted chart / timeline: visualize when delays occur across day — reveals time-of-day patterns (rush hour).
- Trace clustering: cluster by similarity (route shape, sequence) to isolate problematic clusters (e.g., certain suburbs).
- Transition frequency + throughput times: find edges with long waiting queues (long travel times) or nodes with excess dwell times (parking difficulty, long customer interactions).
- Map-based hotspotting: geo-visualization of long dwell times and low-speed segments; combine with historical traffic data.
- Decision mining / correlation analysis: statistical tests or decision trees that predict “late delivery” using features: planned_sequence_pos, dwell_time, travel_time_between_prev, driver_id, vehicle_type, time_of_day, weather/traffic.
- Social network/resource analysis: see which drivers have more deviations or rework; identify if vehicle types (e.g., older vans) correlate with higher breakdowns/maintenance.

Quantifying impact
- For each identified bottleneck compute:
  - Mean additional minutes per affected stop/trace.
  - Extra km driven attributable to deviation (spatial difference vs plan).
  - Estimated additional fuel cost = extra_km * fuel_cost/km.
  - Labor cost = driver_cost_per_min * extra_minutes.
  - Aggregated across six months to estimate total cost increase and potential savings if mitigated.
- Use counterfactual comparison: compare similar planned routes where one followed plan and another deviated — compute delta KPIs.

3) Root cause analysis for inefficiencies

Potential root causes and how to validate them with process mining

A. Suboptimal route planning (static vs dynamic)
- Symptom: frequent sequence deviations, high extra-km, late arrivals concentrated on specific planned routes.
- Validation: compare planned sequence vs executed sequence across many days; measure frequency of reordering and compute cost of reordering.
- Additional check: correlate reordering with up-to-date traffic conditions or last-minute add-ons to dispatch.

B. Inaccurate travel time estimation
- Symptom: repeated late arrivals on specific legs or time windows; ETA errors correlated to certain times of day.
- Validation: for each planned leg, compute empirical travel_time distribution vs dispatch estimated_time; produce bias/variance stats and show routes/time-of-day where estimation is worst.

C. Traffic congestion patterns
- Symptom: prolonged low-speed segments at particular geolocations and times.
- Validation: overlay GPS slow-speed segments with road network; check recurrence by weekday/time. Correlate with traffic feeds (historic/real-time). Use percentiles: if 95th percentile travel_time spikes at rush hour, congestion is root cause.

D. High variability in service time at customer locations
- Symptom: wide variance in ArriveDepart times at stops; certain addresses/time windows with long dwell times (multi-package builds, building access).
- Validation: Distribution of service_time per stop/stop-type; cluster addresses by high median or high variance. Combine with package counts per stop.

E. Vehicle breakdowns & maintenance during shifts
- Symptom: unscheduled stops labeled engine warnings; routes with these stops have longer times and sometimes aborted deliveries.
- Validation: align unscheduled maintenance events with route performance, compute probability of delivery failures conditional on maintenance event during shift; use survival analysis to predict breakdown risk by cumulative km/age.

F. Driver behavior & skill differences
- Symptom: driver-level differences in OTDR, average service times, idling, route adherence.
- Validation: variant/decision mining conditioned on driver_id. Control for route difficulty and package load to isolate behavior. Use social network/resource performance charts.

G. Delivery failures (customer not home)
- Symptom: repeated failures on same addresses or time windows; redundant re-deliveries.
- Validation: extract failed_delivery traces and compute re-delivery intervals, reason codes; analyze correlation with time window mismatch, wrong ETA, or incorrect contact info.

Specific process mining analyses to validate root causes
- Variant analysis: split traces into high-performing vs low-performing and mine differences (which activities, segments, or resources differ).
- Conformance alignment diagnostics: show where sequence mismatches happen and whether they are clustered temporally or spatially.
- Correlation/regression/decision-tree models: predict lateness or fuel/km using features from log (driver, vehicle, time-of-day, planned sequence position, traffic slowdowns).
- Survival/event-time models: analyze time-to-failure for vehicles to build predictive maintenance signals.
- Spatial-temporal clustering: find road segments or blocks that frequently cause slowdowns.

4) Data-driven optimization strategies (concrete)

I will propose five concrete strategies (3 required). For each: targeted inefficiency, root cause, process-mining evidence, expected KPI impact, and implementation notes.

Strategy A — Dynamic routing with real-time traffic & rolling re-sequencing
- Targets: sequence deviations, long travel times, late deliveries during peak traffic.
- Root cause: static routes and inaccurate travel time estimates not accounting for current congestion.
- Process mining support: reveals where and when travel_time >> planned, frequent reroutings and sequence changes by drivers, hotspots of congestion.
- Implementation:
  - Integrate live traffic feeds + historical travel-time models derived from GPS logs.
  - Use online VRP-TW solver that can re-sequence remaining stops in-shift with constraints (time windows, capacity, driver hours).
  - Provide driver app with suggested re-sequence and reroute and quick accept/reject flows.
- Expected impact:
  - Reduce average travel_time between stops (improve Travel:Service ratio), increase On-Time Delivery Rate (est. +5–15% depending on current baseline), reduce extra km and fuel by eliminating ad-hoc detours.
- Constraints & notes: must respect customer time windows and driver hours; pilot on high-variance routes first.

Strategy B — Route resequencing and territory optimization using historic performance
- Targets: high variability routes, inefficient territory assignments, excessive km/day.
- Root cause: poorly balanced territories and sequences that ignore historical travel/service distributions.
- Process mining support: historical cluster analysis identifies routes/drivers with systematically worse KPIs; GTA (geographic) mapping shows suboptimal stop clustering.
- Implementation:
  - Recompute routes using historical median travel times and service times (not just straight-line distances).
  - Create territories balanced on workload (stops, expected service time) rather than count of stops.
  - Reassign stops so each route’s expected route time fits within standard shift length to reduce overtime.
- Expected impact:
  - Lower vehicle utilization overloads and overtime rate, improved OTDR, reduction in fuel/km via shorter routes. Estimate: reduce overtime minutes and lower cost-per-delivery by X% (pilot to quantify).
- Constraints: maintain customer time windows and special delivery constraints.

Strategy C — Predictive maintenance based on usage patterns and unscheduled-stop profiling
- Targets: unscheduled maintenance during shifts, increased downtime and repair costs.
- Root cause: reactive maintenance and uneven vehicle usage leading to failure during routes.
- Process mining support: survival analysis on maintenance logs + vehicle-day traces identifies features that predict breakdowns (km since last service, hard-braking events, number of engine warnings).
- Implementation:
  - Build a predictive model for failure probability; schedule maintenance proactively when risk passes threshold.
  - Integrate with dispatch to reserve replacement vehicle slots and avoid planned routes getting vehicles prone to mid-shift failure.
- Expected impact:
  - Decrease unscheduled stops, reduce minutes lost to maintenance, lower repair costs and re-delivery costs due to aborted shifts.
- Constraints: cost of increased scheduled maintenance must be balanced vs cost of failures.

Strategy D — Targeted driver coaching, gamification & exception workflows
- Targets: inefficient driver behaviors (idling, poor route adherence, long service times), higher failed deliveries.
- Root cause: inconsistent operational practices, poor time management, incomplete customer engagement.
- Process mining support: driver-level variant comparisons, resource performance charts show outliers and common bad behaviors (unnecessary idling, skipping scans).
- Implementation:
  - Provide individualized feedback reports and weekly dashboards with KPIs (OTDR, avg service time, idling minutes).
  - Targeted training for identified behaviors (fast-loading/unloading, access protocols, parking strategies).
  - Implement gamification for on-time deliveries with fair weighting by route difficulty.
  - Improve app UX for scanners to reduce missed scans which cause mis-attribution.
- Expected impact:
  - Reduce average service_time, fewer failed deliveries due to better customer contact, marginal fuel savings through less idling. Improve consistency across driver pool.
- Constraints: ensure fairness (normalize by route difficulty); avoid creating unsafe incentives.

Strategy E — Reduce failed deliveries via time-window optimization & improved customer communication
- Targets: failed deliveries and re-deliveries (costly extra trips).
- Root cause: mismatched expectations, poor ETA accuracy, no dynamic customer options.
- Process mining support: analysis shows clusters of failed deliveries correlated with certain time windows, poor ETA accuracy, or repeated attempts at same address.
- Implementation:
  - Use predictive ETA flows powered by current route state to send dynamic narrow delivery windows and real-time messages (SMS with 30minute window) and “reschedule/pickup” options.
  - Offer alternative delivery options for addresses with repeated failures: parcel locker, neighbor delivery, or scheduled appointment.
  - Pre-filter addresses with high failed rate and customer-not-home history to schedule during higher-probability windows.
- Expected impact:
  - Reduce re-delivery rate and extra km/cost. Expected OTDR increase and lower cost per delivery.
- Constraints: requires customer consent for messages, and backend to accept reschedule options.

5) Considering operational constraints and monitoring

A. Accounting for constraints in optimizations
- Driver working hours:
  - All routing solvers enforce driver shift start/end and legal rest breaks. Use Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows & driver shift constraints (VRPTW+shifts).
  - When re-sequencing dynamically, compute projected shift-overrun and limit reassignments that cause overtime unless authorized.
- Vehicle capacities & attributes:
  - Respect volume/weight capacities and special equipment needs (e.g., refrigerated vans).
  - Use vehicle profiles and predicted load per stop when building routes.
- Customer time windows & SLA:
  - Hard time-window constraints must be enforced for priority deliveries; soft constraints can be optimized with penalty costs.
  - Offer customers options for alternate delivery methods when strict windows are incompatible with efficient routing.
- Maintenance planning:
  - Integrate predictive maintenance into scheduling to reserve vehicles for service without violating route coverage — use rolling horizon planning.

B. Continuous monitoring plan with process mining dashboards
- Monitoring cadence:
  - Real-time / near-real-time (streaming) for operational alerts (vehicle breakdown, major deviation from planned route, ETA slip beyond threshold).
  - Daily operational dashboards for dispatchers and managers.
  - Weekly/monthly analytical dashboards for continuous improvement and policy changes.

- Key dashboard components & views
  - Live process map (vehicle-day) with performance overlay: current progress vs plan, color-coded lateness, ETA deltas.
  - KPI summary: OTDR, avg service time, avg travel time, fuel/km, vehicle utilization, re-delivery rate, unscheduled stops, overtime minutes — trended over time and by route/driver/vehicle.
  - Variant explorer: top executed variants and their KPIs; ability to drill into worst-performing traces.
  - Geo-heatmaps: delay hotspots, frequent unscheduled stops, or traffic slow segments.
  - Driver/vehicle leaderboards with normalized metrics (e.g., OTDR normalized by route difficulty).
  - Maintenance risk panel: vehicles at high predicted failure risk with recommended action.
  - Alerts & anomaly detection: automatic flags for sudden increases in late deliveries, spikes in travel_time on a road segment, or repeated failed deliveries to an address.

- Measurement & governance
  - Define SLA thresholds and set alert rules (e.g., any route with >15% expected lateness triggers review).
  - A/B test rollouts: pilot a new routing policy on a subset of routes and monitor KPIs vs control.
  - Monthly root-cause reviews: cross-functional team (dispatch, operations, maintenance, data) to review dashboard anomalies and approve interventions.

- Feedback loop & continuous improvement
  - Use process mining to measure changes pre/post-implementation, quantify savings (minutes, km, fuel, maintenance costs), and refine thresholds and solver parameters.
  - Retrain ETA and predictive models regularly with fresh GPS and scanner data and incorporate seasonality.

Implementation sequencing & quick wins
- Low-effort quick wins:
  - Fix data quality & map GPS stops to planned stops — immediately improves measurement.
  - Send better ETAs / SMS notifications on routes where ETA error is largest.
  - Targeted driver coaching for top 10% worst performers.
- Medium-term:
  - Territory rebalancing and updated route sequencing using historical travel times.
  - Pilot dynamic rerouting on a subset of routes with traffic feeds.
- Longer-term:
  - Integrate predictive maintenance and full-scale dynamic VRP solver.

Tools & technical notes
- Use a process mining platform that supports performance overlays, conformance checking and variant analysis (e.g., Celonis, Disco, PM4Py + custom tooling).
- Couple with GIS/route optimization stack (OSRM/GraphHopper, commercial solvers) and streaming for realtime updates.
- Ensure data pipeline robustness (ETL, event time sync) and governance (PII handling, retention).

Summary
- Start with rigorous data integration and stop-detection from GPS to build actionable event logs.
- Use discovery + performance overlays and conformance checking to localize problems (route deviations, traffic hotspots, driver/vehicle issues).
- Quantify bottlenecks using KPIs and counterfactual comparisons.
- Apply targeted interventions: dynamic routing, territory optimization, predictive maintenance, driver coaching, and better customer communications.
- Monitor continuously with process-mining dashboards, respecting operational constraints (driver hours, capacity, time windows) and using a staged rollout with A/B testing and ROI tracking.

If you want, I can:
- Propose a concrete data schema and stop-detection algorithm (parameters) tailored to Speedy Parcels’ sample data,
- Outline an initial pilot plan (which routes to choose, metrics to track, success criteria),
- Or draft example SQL/Python snippets for joining GPS and scanner records into vehicle-day traces.
