### **Explanation of Transformation Logic**

1. **Case Identification**  
   - Cases are based on unique document or email interactions.  
   - Word, Excel, and PDF activities are grouped by file name (e.g., *Document1.docx* → `DOC_Document1`).  
   - Emails are grouped by the subject or action taken (e.g., *Annual Meeting Email* → `EMAIL_AnnualMeeting`).  

2. **Activity Naming**  
   - `FOCUS` on a document is interpreted as *Open Document/Spreadsheet/PDF*.  
   - `TYPING` within Word or Excel is labeled as *Edit Document/Spreadsheet*.  
   - `SAVE` events are mapped to *Save Document/Spreadsheet*.  
   - `CLICK` on emails results in *Open Email, Reply to Email, or Send Email*, based on the action.  
   - `SCROLL` within an email or PDF is labeled as *Scroll Email/PDF*.  
   - `HIGHLIGHT` in a PDF is labeled as *Highlight Text*.  
   - `CLOSE` results in *Close Document*.  

3. **Temporal Context**  
   - Consecutive typing events in the same document are considered part of an ongoing *Edit* session rather than separate activities.  
   - Application switches help segment cases clearly (e.g., switching from Word to Chrome marks the transition from document editing to email handling).  

This transformed event log is now structured for process mining analysis in tools like **Disco** or **ProM**, allowing for discovery of user work patterns across documents, emails, and reports.
