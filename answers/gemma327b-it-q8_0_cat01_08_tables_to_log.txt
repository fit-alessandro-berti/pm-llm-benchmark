**Assumptions and Notes:**

*   **Case ID:** The `order_id` is used as the case ID, representing a single order process.
*   **Activity Derivation:** Activities are derived from key events in the tables.  "Order Created" is from the `Orders` table, "Item Picked" from `Order Lines`, "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" from `Delivery`, "Invoice Issued" from `Invoice`, and "Payment Received" from `Payments`.
*   **Timestamp Ordering:**  Timestamps are used to ensure chronological order within each case.
*   **Multiple Items:**  Each item picked generates a separate "Item Picked" event.
*   **Resource/Actor:** The `picker_id`, `billing_person_id`, and `sales_person_id` are used to identify the resource responsible for the activity. Carrier is also included.
*   **Missing Data:** If a resource ID is not found in the `Resources` table, it's left blank.
*   **Multiple Deliveries/Invoices:**  The event log handles cases where an order has multiple deliveries or invoices.
*   **Data Consistency:** Assumed that the data is consistent (e.g., an invoice always corresponds to an order).
*   **Simplification:**  The event log is simplified to focus on the core process flow. More detailed events could be added if needed.
*   **Optional Tables:** The `Products` and `Resources` tables were used to enrich the event log with additional information.
