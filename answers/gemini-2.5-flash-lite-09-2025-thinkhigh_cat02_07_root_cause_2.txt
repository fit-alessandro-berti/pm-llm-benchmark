## 1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues

To identify performance issues, we calculate the total duration for each case by subtracting the start time (first event) from the end time (last event).

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Complexity |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2001 | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | **1.5 hours** | Low |
| 2002 | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **26 hours** | Medium |
| 2003 | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **48 hours 20 min** | High |
| 2004 | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | **1 hour 25 min** | Low |
| 2005 | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **77 hours 5 min** | High |

**Cases with Performance Issues:**
Cases **2002, 2003, and 2005** are taking significantly longer than the low-complexity baseline established by cases 2001 and 2004 (which resolve in under 90 minutes). Case 2005 is the most severe outlier.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis: Attribute Correlation

We analyze the attributes of the slow cases (2002, 2003, 2005) against the fast cases (2001, 2004).

### A. Correlation with Complexity

| Complexity Level | Cases | Average Duration | Observation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Low | 2001, 2004 | $\approx 1.4$ hours | Very fast processing. |
| Medium | 2002 | 26 hours | Significant delay compared to Low. |
| High | 2003, 2005 | $\approx 62.7$ hours | The longest processing times. |

**Finding:** There is a **strong positive correlation between Claim Complexity and Total Duration**. Higher complexity directly leads to longer case lifecycles.

### B. Correlation with Activity Bottlenecks (Focusing on Document Requests)

The process step **"Request Additional Documents"** is unique to the slower cases:
*   Case 2002 (Medium): 1 Request
*   Case 2003 (High): 2 Requests
*   Case 2005 (High): 3 Requests

Furthermore, examining the time *between* document requests reveals major latency periods (waiting for the claimant or internal follow-up):

*   **Case 2005 Latency Example:**
    *   Request 1 completed: 2024-04-01 11:30
    *   Request 2 initiated: 2024-04-02 17:00 (Approx. 30 hours delay)
    *   Request 2 completed: 2024-04-03 15:00 (Approx. 22 hours delay)

**Finding:** The primary operational bottleneck is the **cycle time associated with gathering required documentation**. High complexity forces multiple requests, and the time taken between these requests (which likely involves claimant response time and internal follow-up) dramatically inflates the total duration.

### C. Correlation with Resource and Region

**Region:**
*   Region A cases (2001, 2003) show extremes (1.5 hours vs. 48 hours).
*   Region B cases (2002, 2004, 2005) also show extremes (1.4 hours vs. 77 hours).
**Conclusion:** Region is **not** a primary independent driver of poor performance.

**Resource (Focusing on Approval/Management):**
*   **Fast Approvers (Manager_Ann):** Approved cases 2001, 2002, 2004 (all resolved relatively quickly).
*   **Slow Approvers (Manager_Bill):** Approved cases 2003 and 2005 (the two longest cases). The time gap between the last Document Request and Manager_Bill's approval suggests potential scrutiny or backlog in that management queue.
    *   Case 2005: Last request completed 04-03 15:00; Approved 04-04 10:00 (nearly 19-hour gap, likely overnight/weekend gap).

**Finding:** While resources are involved in the delays, the delays seem triggered by the complexity/documentation issues preceding them, rather than the resource being inherently slow in all instances. However, **Manager_Bill's approval queue** appears associated with the highest complexity cases that took the longest.

## 3. Mitigation Suggestions

The analysis points clearly to **Claim Complexity driving the need for iterative information gathering**, which causes significant time wastage.

### Identified Root Causes:

1.  **Complexity-Induced Latency:** High complexity mandates more steps, especially repeated "Request Additional Documents" events.
2.  **Document Gathering Bottleneck:** The primary source of delay is the waiting time between when a document request is sent and when the required documentation is received or processed for the next step.
3.  **Managerial Review Scrutiny:** Approvals handled by Manager_Bill coincide with the most complex cases, suggesting these cases might undergo deeper, slower reviews or face scheduling/availability issues compared to Manager_Ann's queue.

### Mitigation Strategies:

| Root Cause | Mitigation Strategy | Expected Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Document Latency** | **Proactive Claim Intake & Automated Checks:** Implement a robust digital portal where claimants upload all initial documents based on complexity level upfront. Use AI/ML to immediately flag missing information upon submission, reducing the need for manual follow-up requests (e.g., if Complexity=High, require 5 specific documents upon submission). | Reduces the number of "Request Additional Documents" steps and shrinks the waiting time between iterations. |
| **Complexity Handling** | **Tiered Assignment/Specialization:** Route claims based on complexity. Low/Medium complexity claims are handled by teams specialized in rapid turnaround (like those working with Manager_Ann). High complexity claims are immediately routed to senior adjusters and managers (like Manager_Bill) who are better equipped to handle exhaustive requirements, preventing cascading delays. | Ensures complex work is handled efficiently by experts, minimizing the back-and-forth loops seen in Case 2005. |
| **Managerial Bottleneck** | **Approval SLOs and Visibility:** Establish Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for Managerial Approval steps. If a high-complexity case sits waiting for Manager_Bill for over 12 hours, trigger an automated alert or re-route the case to another available manager (like Manager_Ann) for review, provided they have the appropriate clearance. | Prevents high-value/complex cases from idling during the final review stage. |
