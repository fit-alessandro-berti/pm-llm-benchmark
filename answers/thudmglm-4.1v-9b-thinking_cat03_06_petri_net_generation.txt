<answer>To construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process, we'll define places (states), transitions (activities/loops), and markings (initial/final states) using the `pm4py` library. Here's the complete code and reasoning:


### Step 1: Import Required Modules
First, import the necessary classes for the Petri net (`PetriNet`, `Place`, `Transition`), utility functions (`petri_utils`), and marking (`Marking`):

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Place, Transition
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils
from pm4py.objects.marking import Marking
```


### Step 2: Initialize the Petri Net
Create a Petri net named "Insurance Claim Process" with the required places and transitions. Define all states (places) and activities (transitions) first:

```python
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# Define places (states) representing each state in the process
places = [
    Place(name="New Claim"),          # Initial start state
    Place(name="Registered"),         # After claim registration
    Place(name="Document Verified"),  # After successful verification
    Place(name="Fraud Checked"),      # After fraud check
    Place(name="In-depth Investigation"),  # Loop state for multiple investigations
    Place(name="Claim Assessment"),   # After fraud check/investigation
    Place(name="Approval"),           # After assessment
    Place(name="Payment"),            # After approval
    Place(name="Notification"),       # After payment
    Place(name="Closure")             # Final state
]

# Add all places to the Petri net
for p in places:
    net.places.add(p)

# Define transitions (activities) for each process step
transitions = [
    Transition(name="Claim Registration (CR)"),
    Transition(name="Document Verification (DV)"),
    Transition(name="Re-Document Submission (RDS)"),  # Loop for document re-submission
    Transition(name="Fraud Check (FC)"),
    Transition(name="In-depth Investigation (II)"),  # Loop for fraud investigation
    Transition(name="Claim Assessment (CA)"),
    Transition(name="Approval (AP)"),               # Conditional approval
    Transition(name="Payment (P)"),
    Transition(name="Notification (N)"),
    Transition(name="Closure (CL)"),                # Final state transition
]

# Add all transitions to the Petri net
for t in transitions:
    net.transitions.add(t)
```


### Step 3: Add Directed Arcs Between Places and Transitions
Use `petri_utils.add_arc_from_to` to connect places and transitions, modeling the process flow with loops for re-submissions/investigations:

```python
# 1. Connect "New Claim" (start) to "Claim Registration (CR)" and then "Registered"
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[0], transitions[0], net)  # New Claim  CR
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[0], places[1], net)  # CR  Registered

# 2. Connect "Registered" to "Document Verification (DV)" (success) and "Re-Document Submission (RDS)" (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[1], transitions[1], net)  # Registered  DV
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[1], transitions[2], net)  # Registered  RDS (loop back)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[1], places[2], net)  # DV  Document Verified
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[2], places[1], net)  # RDS  Registered (loop)

# 3. Connect "Document Verified" (DV pass) to "Fraud Check (FC)" (initiate fraud check)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[2], transitions[3], net)  # Document Verified  FC
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[3], places[3], net)  # FC  Fraud Checked

# 4. Connect "Fraud Checked" (FC pass) to "In-depth Investigation (II)" (investigate if needed) and loop back if needed
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[3], transitions[4], net)  # Fraud Checked  II
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[4], places[4], net)  # II  In-depth Investigation
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[4], transitions[3], net)  # In-depth Investigation  FC (loop back)

# 5. Connect "Fraud Checked" (FC pass) to "Claim Assessment (CA)" (proceed to assessment)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(places[3], transitions[5], net)  # Fraud Checked  CA
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(transitions[5], places[5
