## 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact:

### Instance-Spanning Constraints:
1. **Shared Packing Stations:**
   - Identify orders requiring Cold-Packing stations from event log data.
   - Measure waiting times for Cold-Packing stations and compare against standard packing.
   - Metrics: Average/median waiting time for Cold-Packing stations, frequency and duration of contention.

2. **Batching for Shipping:**
   - Identify orders forming batches (by region) in the Shipping Label Generation activity.
   - Measure delays in batch formation, waiting for additional orders.
   - Metrics: Average waiting time for batch formation, batch sizes, time to complete a batch.

3. **Priority Order Handling:**
   - Identify instances of express orders and analyze their interruptions to standard orders.
   - Measure delays on standard orders when an express order utilizes a shared resource.
   - Metrics: Frequency of interruptions, average delay caused by express orders.

4. **Regulatory Compliance for Hazardous Materials:**
   - Track orders flagged as hazardous materials and their concurrent processing.
   - Measure delays caused by adhering to the maximum limit.
   - Metrics: Number of concurrent hazardous materials’ orders, delays due to regulatory limits.

### Differentiating Waiting Times:
- **Between-Instance Factors:**
  - Resource Contention: When a shared resource (e.g., Cold-Packing station) is occupied.
  - Batching Delays: Waiting for other orders to form a batch.
  - Priority Interruptions: Delays caused by processing higher priority express orders.
  - Regulatory Constraints: Additional waiting due to hazard limits.

- **Within-Instance Factors:**
  - Activity Duration: Time taken by activities like Item Picking or Packing.
  - Process Steps: Delays inherent within the sequential process of individual orders.

## 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions:

Interactions leading to compounded delays:
- **Priority Handling & Shared Resources:**
  - Express orders requiring Cold-Packing might delay standard orders needing the same resource.
  - Metrics: Delays for standard orders due to express orders at shared Cold-Packing stations.

- **Batching & Hazardous Material Limits:**
  - Regions receiving higher hazardous material orders might face additional batching delays.
  - Metrics: Frequency of hazardous material orders delaying batch formation and shipment.

Understanding these interactions:
- Crucial in formulating strategies that address the compounded impact of these constraints.
- Prevent creating solutions that optimize one constraint but worsen another.

## 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies:

### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation for Cold-Packing Stations
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Packing Stations
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Implement predictive analytics to forecast Cold-Packing demand using historical data.
  - Dynamically allocate Cold-Packing stations based on real-time priority and demand.
- **Analysis Leverage:** Utilize predictive models tuned using historical event log data.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduce resource contention, minimize waiting time for Cold-Packing.

### Strategy 2: Dynamic Batch Formation Triggers
- **Constraint Addressed:** Batching for Shipping
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Develop a dynamic batching system that forms batches based on predefined optimization criteria (e.g., maximum batch wait time, minimum orders per batch).
  - Implement real-time monitoring to adjust batching triggers.
- **Analysis Leverage:** Optimize batch sizes and formation triggers using historical batch performance data.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Reduced batching delays, optimized delivery routes, and improved throughput.

### Strategy 3: Priority-Aware Scheduling Rules
- **Constraint Addressed:** Priority Order Handling, Regulatory Compliance
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Introduce scheduling rules that consider express priority and regulatory constraints concurrently.
  - Schedule hazardous material orders ensuring compliance with the limit while balancing express order priorities.
- **Analysis Leverage:** Historical analysis to determine optimal scheduling windows and balancing rules.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Minimized delays for express orders, sustained regulatory compliance, improved overall flow.

## 4. Simulation and Validation:

### Simulation Approach:
- **Setup:**
  - Model current process, identifying shared resources, batching logic, and regulatory constraints.
  - Implement proposed strategies within the simulation model.

- **Focus Areas:**
  - Resource Contention: Simulate utilization rates and waiting times.
  - Batching Delays: Simulate batch formation times and sizes.
  - Priority Interruptions: Simulate express order impacts on standard orders.
  - Regulatory Compliance: Simulate concurrent hazardous material order processing.

- **Validation Metrics:**
  - Resource utilization rates, batching efficiency, delay reduction, compliance adherence.

### Outcome Assessment:
- **Expected Metrics:** Lowered wait times, improved batch formation efficiency, reduced delays from express order interruptions, consistent regulatory compliance.
- **Iterative Testing:** Refine strategies based on simulation results to optimize process improvements.

## 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation:

### Key Metrics and Dashboards:
- **Resource Usage:** Monitor utilization rates of Cold-Packing and standard packing stations.
- **Batch Efficiency:** Track batch formation times, batch sizes, and waiting times.
- **Priority Impact:** Measure delays caused by express orders and improvements in standard order processing.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Monitor concurrent hazardous material orders to ensure limits are maintained.

### Dashboard Focus:
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Trigger alerts for significant resource contention, batch delays, or regulatory non-compliance.
- **Performance Trends:** Track trends over time to evaluate long-term effectiveness.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Utilize insights for ongoing process refinement and maintaining optimal performance.
