To create a comprehensive event log for process mining from the provided tables, we need to integrate the data logically, ensuring that each event is accurately represented with the correct timestamp, activity name, and other relevant attributes. Below is the structured event log in Markdown format, with explanations and assumptions documented where necessary.

### Assumptions and Considerations:
1. **Case ID**: The `order_id` is used as the unique identifier for each process instance.
2. **Activities**: Activities are derived from the lifecycle of each order, including order creation, item picking, dispatch, arrival, invoicing, and payment.
3. **Timestamps**: For activities with multiple timestamps (e.g., multiple item pickings), multiple events are created. The chronological order is maintained based on the timestamps provided.
4. **Resources**: The "Resource" column is populated using the `sales_person_id`, `picker_id`, `carrier_id`, `billing_person_id`, and `resource_id` from the `Resources Table`.
5. **Additional Attributes**: Relevant attributes such as `customer_id`, `customer_type`, `order_priority`, `delivery_note`, `invoice_amount`, `payment_method`, and `payment_reference` are included where appropriate.

### Notes:
- **Resource Mapping**: The `resource_id` from the `Resources Table` is used to map the appropriate resource names and roles.
- **Multiple Deliveries**: Orders with multiple deliveries (e.g., `order_id` 1002 and 1005) have corresponding "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events for each delivery.
- **Invoices and Payments**: Each invoice and payment is linked to the respective order, with corresponding events for "Invoice Issued" and "Payment Received".
- **Order Priority and Other Attributes**: These are included as additional attributes for context.
