### Event Log for Process Mining

The event log is constructed by integrating data from the provided tables to represent the lifecycle of each order. Each row corresponds to a single event, with the following columns:
- **Case ID**: Unique identifier (`order_id`).
- **Activity Name**: Descriptive name of the event.
- **Timestamp**: Date/time when the event occurred.
- **Resource**: Actor responsible for the event (e.g., sales person, picker, carrier, billing clerk).
- **Item ID**: Relevant for "Item Picked" events (optional attribute).
- **Quantity**: Relevant for "Item Picked" events (optional attribute).
- **Delivery ID**: Relevant for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events (optional attribute).
- **Delivery Note**: Relevant for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events (optional attribute).
- **Invoice ID**: Relevant for "Invoice Issued" and "Payment Received" events (optional attribute).
- **Invoice Amount**: Relevant for "Invoice Issued" events (optional attribute).
- **Payment ID**: Relevant for "Payment Received" events (optional attribute).
- **Payment Method**: Relevant for "Payment Received" events (optional attribute).
- **Payment Reference**: Relevant for "Payment Received" events (optional attribute).

#### Assumptions Made:
1. **Resource for Delivery Events**: The `carrier_id` is used as the resource for "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events, as the carrier is responsible for delivery.
2. **Resource for Payment Events**: The `resource` column is left blank for "Payment Received" events, as no specific actor is provided.
3. **Event Ordering**: 
   - Events are sorted chronologically per `order_id`.
   - For events with identical timestamps, priority is given in this order:  
     `Order Created` > `Item Picked` > `Order Dispatched` > `Order Arrived` > `Invoice Issued` > `Payment Received`.
   - For identical activities/timestamps, ties are broken by the natural key (e.g., `item_id` for "Item Picked", `delivery_id` for delivery events, `invoice_id` for invoices, `payment_id` for payments).
4. **Missing Data**: 
   - Order `1004` lacks delivery, invoice, and payment events (only "Order Created" and "Item Picked" are included).
   - Payments are linked to orders via `invoice_id` (using a mapping from the `Invoice` table).
5. **Data Integrity**: All timestamps are treated as UTC and parsed directly from the input.

### Key Insights:
- **Process Flow**: The event log captures the typical order-to-payment lifecycle, with variations (e.g., multiple deliveries/invoices for `1002`).
- **Resource Utilization**: Sales persons handle orders, warehouse staff pick items, carriers manage deliveries, and billing clerks issue invoices.
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: All timestamps are retained from source tables, ensuring chronological fidelity.
- **Anomalies**: 
  - Order `1004` was picked but never delivered/invoiced/paid (potential process gap).
  - Order `1002` had two deliveries and two invoices, with payments split across invoices.
