### Justification of Naming Choices

- **Initial Verify Documents** and **Follow-up Verify Documents**:
  - The initial verification happens during the first document check.
  - The follow-up verification occurs after additional documents are submitted or adjustments are made to the account.

- **Call for Verification**, **Call for Clarification**, **Follow-up Call**, and **Call for Return**:
  - **Call for Verification** specifies that the call is made due to incomplete verification.
  - **Call for Clarification** indicates the purpose of the call is to clarify account details.
  - **Follow-up Call** clarifies that the call is a follow-up to previous actions.
  - **Call for Return** specifies that the call is to have the customer return to the branch.

- **Submit Additional Documents**:
  - This name clearly indicates the customer is submitting additional documents, distinguishing it from the initial document submission.

By renaming the activities, the contextual differences are made explicit, aiding in understanding the process flow and the roles of each activity within the support workflow.
