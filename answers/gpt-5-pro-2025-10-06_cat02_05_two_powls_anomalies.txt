Baseline (normative) Hire-to-Retire flow
- Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case
- Optional real-life variants: multiple interview rounds; a no-hire branch that ends in closing without onboarding/payroll. For employees, payroll is mandatory.

How to read the models
- In a StrictPartialOrder, an edge A  B means A must occur before B. If there is no edge between two nodes, they may occur in any order (even interleaved).
- LOOP(A, B) with B = skip means A executes one or more times (A+).
- XOR(A, skip) makes A optional (0 or 1 time).

Analysis of Model 1
- Structure: Post  Screen; from Screen the model forks to both Decide and Interview; then Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. No operator nodes; all activities are mandatory and occur once.
- Anomalies
  Critical
  - Decision can be taken before (or in parallel with) interviews: only Screen  Decide and Screen  Interview are enforced; there is no Interview  Decide constraint. Consequence: you can Onboard/Payroll/Close while interviews are still pending. Example allowed order: Post, Screen, Decide, Onboard, Payroll, Close, Interview.
  - Close_Case is not guaranteed to be last with respect to Interview; as above, Interview can occur after Close.
  Moderate
  - No “no-hire” branch: every case leads to onboarding and payroll (the model only captures the hire path).
- What is good
  - Posting precedes screening, and screening precedes both interviews and decision.
  - The backbone after a decision is correct and linear: Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.
  - Payroll is mandatory and occurs before closing.

Analysis of Model 2
- Structure: Post precedes both Screen and Interview; Interview  Decide  LOOP(Onboard+)  XOR(Payroll or skip)  Close. Screen has no outgoing constraints beyond requiring Post first.
- Anomalies
  Critical
  - Screening is detached from the main flow: Screen need not precede Interview or Decide and can even happen after Close. Example allowed order: Post, Interview, Decide, Onboard, Payroll/skip, Close, Screen.
  - Interviews can start before screening (Post  Interview without Screen), and the hiring decision does not depend on screening at all (Decide only depends on Interview). This breaks the usual gatekeeping role of screening.
  - Payroll is optional (XOR with skip). For an employee-centric Hire-to-Retire, omitting payroll is a fundamental violation.
  Moderate
  - Onboarding is forced to occur one or more times via the loop. Repeating the whole Onboard_Employee activity indefinitely is unusual at this abstraction level; if rework is intended, it should be modeled more granularly.
- What is good
  - Interviews must happen before the decision and before Close (Interview  Decide  …  Close), so you cannot close before interviewing.

Which model is closer to a normative Hire-to-Retire?
- Model 1 is closer. It gets the overall backbone right (Post  Screen  …  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close) and keeps payroll mandatory. Its main flaw is missing the Interview  Decide precedence, which makes the model too permissive and can lead to deciding/onboarding/closing before interviews finish.
- Model 2 introduces multiple fundamental violations: screening is not gating the process and may occur after closure; payroll can be skipped; and onboarding can repeat arbitrarily. These issues undermine core integrity constraints of a standard Hire-to-Retire workflow.

Minimal repairs to reach a normative model
- Model 1: add Interview  Decide (optionally remove the redundant Screen  Decide). This also ensures Interview precedes Onboard/Payroll/Close by transitivity.
- Model 2: add Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide; remove XOR(skip) on Payroll (or place it under an explicit “hire vs. no-hire” XOR where only the hire branch includes Onboard and Payroll); replace the onboarding loop with either a single onboarding or a controlled sub-loop for specific onboarding sub-tasks.
