 Based on the provided data, the main differences between the process variants of both the protected and unprotected groups can be observed in the following aspects:

1. Frequency: The frequency of each process variant within the two groups is different. For example, the process of "Apply for Viewing Appointment" followed by various steps like screening, contract signing, moving in, and rent payments, has a higher frequency in the unprotected group compared to the protected one. This indicates that there are more instances of this process happening in the unprotected group.

2. Outcome: The most significant difference between the two groups is the outcome after the rent payment stages. In the protected group, there are fewer instances of tenant cancellations or terminations. For example, for the variant "Apply for Viewing Appointment" -> "Sign Contract" -> "Move In" -> "Pay Rent (7 times)" -> "Tenant Cancels", this process happens 56 times in the unprotected group compared to only 45 times in the protected group. This suggests that tenants in the protected group are more likely to stay for a longer duration after moving in, as there are fewer instances of cancellation.

3. Screening Process: The protected group appears to have an additional screening process ("Screen Prospective Tenant -> Extensive Screening") before signing the contract, which is not present in the unprotected group. This additional step might be responsible for the reduced number of cancellations or terminations in the protected group after the rent payment stages.

In summary, the main differences between the two groups are the frequency of certain processes, the presence of an extensive screening process, and the outcome after the rent payment stages (with a lower number of tenant cancellations in the protected group). These differences can be attributed to the implementation of protection measures that help ensure stable tenancy for the landlords or property managers.
