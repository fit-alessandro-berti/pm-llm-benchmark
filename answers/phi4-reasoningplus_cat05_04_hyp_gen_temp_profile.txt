<think>We are asked: "Below is a proposed scenario involving a temporal profile model for an insurance claim handling process." So we have a description of database tables: claims, adjusters, claim_events; they describe fields and intended process steps, etc.

Then there's explanation of temporal profile model with anomalies in terms of average times between events. The dictionary has pairs as keys mapping to tuples (AVG seconds, STDEV). Then potential anomalies are explained in text. But now our task is: "Your tasks are:

1. Identify the anomalies in the temporal profile model." We need to output a list of anomalies: e.g., R->P is suspiciously short average and low stdev, P->N etc.
2. Generate hypotheses on why these anomalies might exist: possible reasons such as delays due to manual data entry, automated steps that happen too quickly possibly skipping required checks, bottlenecks in certain activities causing extended waiting times, inconsistent resource availability leading to irregular timings.
3. Propose verification approaches using SQL queries: Suggest queries that check the claim_events table to identify specific claims where time between certain events is outside expected range. Correlate anomalies with particular adjusters or claim types etc.

The instructions require "do not reference the instructions or explanations above. Present the anomalies, possible reasons, and verification queries independently."

Thus we need to produce final answer that lists: anomalies, hypotheses, SQL queries (which are independent). We'll try to produce a final answer like below:

I'll now produce answer in plain text with bullet points maybe.

Let's produce answer that lists anomalies:
- Anomaly 1: "Receive to Approve" shows an average time of ~25 hours with very low standard deviation. This suggests rigid scheduling or forced delay.
- Anomaly 2: "Approve to Notify" showing a long average of 7 days with high variability, which may suggest inconsistent processing times due to backlogs or resource constraints.
- Anomaly 3: "Assign to Close" shows a short interval (2 hours on average) and could indicate premature closure without evaluation steps.
- Anomaly 4: "Evaluate to Notify" showing only 5 minutes average suggests that notifications occur immediately after evaluations, which might indicate skipping of additional steps.

Possible reasons:
- The R->P anomaly may be due to automated approvals happening on a fixed schedule or system glitch forcing delay.
- The P->N anomaly might be the result of processing bottlenecks causing inconsistent delays for notification, perhaps from overloaded adjusters or manual intervention.
- The A->C anomaly might indicate that claims are being closed prematurely possibly because of missing evaluation steps due to automation errors or misrouting of claims.
- The E->N anomaly may arise if notifications are triggered by an automated system immediately after evaluations without additional checks.

SQL queries: We need to propose queries on the claim_events table (or join with claims, adjusters) that can be used for verification. We'll produce sample SQL queries:

For instance:
Query 1: Identify specific claims where time difference between event 'R' and event 'P' is outside expected range:
 SELECT claim_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) ) as first_receive,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) ) as approve_time
  FROM claim_events 
  WHERE claim_id IN (some condition?) ... Actually, we need to join events properly. Alternatively, maybe a query that finds the difference between "R" and "P" event timestamps for each claim, then filter out those claims that are significantly outside expected average of 90000 seconds ± some factor.
 I can propose something like:
 
 SELECT ce1.claim_id,
        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce1.timestamp))) as time_diff
 FROM claim_events ce1, claim_events ce2
 WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'
   AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   AND ce2.claim_id = ce1.claim_id
 GROUP BY ce1.claim_id
 HAVING (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce1.timestamp))) NOT BETWEEN 90000 - 3 * some factor and 90000 + 3 * some factor. But maybe I'll propose a query that uses a window function.

We need to produce verification queries: Perhaps like below:

-- For anomaly R->P, detect claims where time difference is not within 2 standard deviations from expected value:
 SELECT claim_id,
        MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R') AS receive_time,
        MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P')) - MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R')) as time_diff
 FROM claim_events 
 GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING ... etc.

But need to be careful: we need to join events per claim. But note, in many cases claims may have multiple R and P events? Probably not. Usually one event for each. So I'll assume only one event of type 'R' and one of type 'P' per claim. Then can group by claim_id.

We can propose:
-- Query for anomaly detection: Identify anomalies where the difference between R and P is outside expected range.
 SELECT c.claim_id,
        MIN(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'R') AS receive_time,
        MAX(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'P') AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'P')) - MIN(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'R')) as r_to_p_diff
 FROM claim_events cet
 JOIN claims c ON cet.claim_id = c.claim_id
 GROUP BY c.claim_id
HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'P') - MIN(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'R'))) < 90000 - 600*3 -- for instance if the difference is less than expected minus 3 standard deviations
 OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'P')) - MIN(cet.timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cet.activity = 'R')) > 90000 + 3600*3;
 
Wait, but note that our expected average for R->P is given as (90000,3600). That means average time is 90000 seconds, standard deviation is 3600 seconds. So any anomaly detection can be computed if difference < (90000 - 2 or 3 times the standard deviation) or > (90000 + some multiplier).
 
We need to produce queries for each of these anomalies.

I'll propose:
 Query 1: Detect R->P anomalies.
 Query 2: Detect P->N anomalies.
 Query 3: Detect A->C anomalies.
 Query 4: Detect E->N anomalies.

Maybe also include queries that join with adjusters table to see if particular adjuster resource names are correlated. For instance, we might want to filter by resource column in claim_events and group by them. Possibly query:
 SELECT ce.resource,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_event.timestamp - r_event.timestamp))) as avg_r_to_p
 FROM claim_events ce JOIN ...
 But that's complicated.

I'll produce a list of queries:

I can propose something like:

-- Query to detect R->P anomalies
WITH event_times AS (
 SELECT claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time
 FROM claim_events
 GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) as r_to_p_diff,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) < 90000 - 3600*3 OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) > 90000 + 3600*3 THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END as status
FROM event_times;

-- Query to detect P->N anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
 SELECT claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
 FROM claim_events
 GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) as p_to_n_diff,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) < 604800 - 172800*3 OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) > 604800 + 172800*3 THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END as status
FROM event_times;

-- Query to detect A->C anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
 SELECT claim_id,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time
 FROM claim_events
 GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) as a_to_c_diff,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < 7200 - 3600*3 OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) > 7200 + 3600*3 THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END as status
FROM event_times;

-- Query to detect E->N anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
 SELECT claim_id,
        MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
        MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
 FROM claim_events
 GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id, 
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) as e_to_n_diff,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) < 300 - 60*3 OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) > 300 + 60*3 THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END as status
FROM event_times;

These queries assume that each claim has a single instance of the relevant activities, but if there are multiple events per claim, we might need to use window functions.

We can also propose additional queries which join with claims table to check for adjuster and region. For example, to find anomalies correlated with certain resources:
 SELECT ce.claim_id,
        c.customer_id,
        a.name as adjuster_name,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) as r_to_p_diff
 FROM claim_events ce
 JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 LEFT JOIN adjusters a on ... hmm, not exactly. But maybe we can join to check if resource from events is an adjuster id? But note that in claim_events, the "resource" column might be different than adjuster id. Actually, our tables have adjusters table with adjuster_id and name columns. In claim_events, there's a "resource" field which is probably reference to something. It says "the resource performing the activity." That might not necessarily match adjuster_id? We can assume that if activity 'A' then resource may be adjuster id, so we join adjusters table on resource = adjuster_id when activity='A'. But in our instructions, it's not specified.

I will produce a query for correlation:
 SELECT ce.claim_id,
        c.customer_id,
        ce.resource as responsible_resource,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) as r_to_p_diff
 FROM claim_events ce
 JOIN claims c on ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.customer_id, ce.resource;

I can produce a query to detect anomalies and then group by resource:
 SELECT ce.resource,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) ) as avg_r_to_p_diff
 FROM claim_events ce
 GROUP BY ce.resource;

Maybe also produce a query that detects claims closed immediately after assignment. That might be:
 SELECT c.claim_id,
        c.customer_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) as a_to_c_diff
 FROM claim_events ce
 JOIN claims c on ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id
 HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END))) < 3600;

I can produce similar queries for approve to notify anomalies:
 SELECT c.claim_id,
        c.customer_id,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) as p_to_n_diff
 FROM claim_events ce
 JOIN claims c on ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
 GROUP BY c.claim_id, c.customer_id
 HAVING EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) - MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END))) > 604800;

I need to produce verification queries that are independent of the instructions. I'll present them as a list.

Let's produce final answer in plain text with bullet points and then code blocks (but not markdown formatting by default but we can use plain text code block style if necessary.)

We can produce an answer with sections: "Anomalies", "Hypotheses" and "Verification Queries".

I'll produce final answer as:

-----
I will now produce answer text in plain text.

Answer:

Anomaly 1: Receive to Approve
- Average time between 'R' and 'P' is around 25 hours, with a very narrow standard deviation. This indicates that the approval timing is unusually rigid.
- Hypothesis: Possibly due to an automated process enforcing fixed scheduling or system override causing approvals at predetermined times rather than based on actual evaluation.

Anomaly 2: Approve to Notify
- The average delay between 'P' and 'N' is about 7 days, with high variability. This inconsistency may reflect internal backlogs or resource constraints.
- Hypothesis: There might be intermittent delays due to manual processing steps or a bottleneck in notification systems.

Anomaly 3: Assign to Close
- Claims are closed quickly (on average 2 hours) after assignment without following evaluation and approval processes, which suggests that some claims might be prematurely closed.
- Hypothesis: This could indicate missing intermediate checks possibly because of process shortcuts or data-entry errors leading to skipping necessary steps.

Anomaly 4: Evaluate to Notify
- The very short interval (5 minutes average) between 'E' and 'N' may suggest that notifications are triggered automatically immediately after evaluation, potentially bypassing additional review.
- Hypothesis: Automated triggers might be causing immediate notification regardless of whether further validations have occurred.

Verification Queries using SQL:

For detecting R to P anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) as receive_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) as approve_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) AS r_to_p_diff_seconds,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) < (90000 - (3600 * 3)) OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) > (90000 + (3600 * 3))
         THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END AS status
FROM event_times;

For detecting P to N anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) as approve_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) as notify_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_to_n_diff_seconds,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) < (604800 - (172800 * 3)) OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) > (604800 + (172800 * 3))
         THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END AS status
FROM event_times;

For detecting A to C anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) as assign_time,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) as close_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) AS a_to_c_diff_seconds,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < (7200 - (3600 * 3)) OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) > (7200 + (3600 * 3))
         THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END AS status
FROM event_times;

For detecting E to N anomalies:
WITH event_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) as evaluate_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) as notify_time
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT claim_id,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) AS e_to_n_diff_seconds,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) < (300 - (60 * 3)) OR
              EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) > (300 + (60 * 3))
         THEN 'Anomaly'
         ELSE 'Normal'
       END AS status
FROM event_times;

Additionally, to correlate anomalies with specific resources or claim types, consider queries like:
SELECT ce.claim_id,
       c.customer_id,
       ce.resource,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END))) AS r_to_p_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.customer_id, ce.resource;

SELECT a.adjuster_id,
       a.name,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END)))) AS avg_r_to_p_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource AND ce.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;

These queries help identify individual claims and resources whose timing deviations fall outside the expected ranges. They can be further refined by filtering on claim_type or region if needed.

I will now produce final answer in plain text with no markdown formatting instructions per default instructions.</think>Below is an independent overview of the anomalies found in the process model, potential reasons for these irregularities, and sample SQL queries that could help verify them.

  
Anomalies Identified

1. Receive to Approve (R  P)  
• Average duration: ~25 hours with a very narrow standard deviation.  
• Implication: The approval timing is unusually rigid, suggesting that approvals occur at fixed intervals rather than following a flexible evaluation process.

2. Approve to Notify (P  N)  
• Average duration: 7 days with high variability (standard deviation of 2 days).  
• Implication: There are inconsistent delays between approval and notification, hinting at intermittent processing slowdowns or resource bottlenecks.

3. Assign to Close (A  C)  
• Average duration: Approximately 2 hours.  
• Implication: Claims appear to be closed very quickly after assignment without evidence of intermediate steps like evaluation or approval; this may indicate premature closure.

4. Evaluate to Notify (E  N)  
• Average duration: Only about 5 minutes.  
• Implication: Notifications are triggered almost immediately following evaluations, which could mean that other necessary checks are being skipped or automated in a way that bypasses standard review procedures.

  
Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. R  P (Receive to Approve)  
• Automated scheduling might enforce fixed approval times regardless of actual claim conditions, resulting in a rigid time interval.  
• Alternatively, system overrides or ad hoc interventions could be forcing approvals at predetermined intervals.

2. P  N (Approve to Notify)  
• Internal bottlenecks—such as manual data entry slowdowns or resource constraints—could cause inconsistent delays between approval and notification.  
• There may also be intermittent backlogs in the notification process that lead to extended waiting times for some claims while others are processed rapidly.

3. A  C (Assign to Close)  
• The short interval from assignment to closure might suggest that necessary evaluation steps are being skipped or not recorded, possibly due to automation errors or data-entry shortcuts.  
• It could also indicate that certain claims are being prematurely closed without proper review.

4. E  N (Evaluate to Notify)  
• An almost instantaneous notification following evaluation may point to an overly aggressive automated trigger that bypasses additional verification steps.  
• This might be a result of system misconfiguration where notifications are sent immediately after evaluations regardless of whether further checks have been completed.

  
Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

The following sample queries demonstrate how one could extract and flag anomalies in the claim_events table by comparing observed time differences against expected ranges. Adjustments (such as using a multiplier for standard deviation) may be made based on business requirements.

1. Detecting Anomalies in Receive to Approve (R  P)

WITH event_times AS (
SELECT 
claim_id,
MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) AS receive_time,
MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
claim_id, 
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) AS r_to_p_diff_seconds,
CASE 
WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) < (90000 - (3600 * 3))
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) > (90000 + (3600 * 3))
THEN 'Anomaly'
ELSE 'Normal'
END AS status
FROM event_times;

2. Detecting Anomalies in Approve to Notify (P  N)

WITH event_times AS (
SELECT 
claim_id,
MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) AS approve_time,
MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
claim_id, 
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_to_n_diff_seconds,
CASE 
WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) < (604800 - (172800 * 3))
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) > (604800 + (172800 * 3))
THEN 'Anomaly'
ELSE 'Normal'
END AS status
FROM event_times;

3. Detecting Anomalies in Assign to Close (A  C)

WITH event_times AS (
SELECT 
claim_id,
MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS assign_time,
MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN timestamp END) AS close_time
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
claim_id, 
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) AS a_to_c_diff_seconds,
CASE 
WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < (7200 - (3600 * 3))
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) > (7200 + (3600 * 3))
THEN 'Anomaly'
ELSE 'Normal'
END AS status
FROM event_times;

4. Detecting Anomalies in Evaluate to Notify (E  N)

WITH event_times AS (
SELECT 
claim_id,
MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN timestamp END) AS notify_time
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
)
SELECT 
claim_id, 
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) AS e_to_n_diff_seconds,
CASE 
WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) < (300 - (60 * 3))
OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) > (300 + (60 * 3))
THEN 'Anomaly'
ELSE 'Normal'
END AS status
FROM event_times;

5. Correlating Anomalies with Resources or Claim Attributes

To further explore if certain resources or claim types are more prone to these timing irregularities, you might run queries such as:

SELECT 
ce.claim_id,
c.customer_id,
ce.resource,
EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END))) AS r_to_p_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
GROUP BY ce.claim_id, c.customer_id, ce.resource;

SELECT 
a.adjuster_id,
a.name,
AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) - MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END)))) AS avg_r_to_p_diff_seconds
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource AND ce.activity = 'A'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;

These queries help pinpoint which claims or resources consistently fall outside the expected time intervals and can guide further investigation into operational issues.

  
In summary, by combining careful analysis of the temporal model with targeted SQL queries against the claim_events (and related) tables, it is possible to identify process anomalies, hypothesize potential underlying causes, and verify these findings through data-driven methods.
