Certainly! To understand the declarative process model based on the constraints provided, let's break down the interactions and their dependencies:

### Entities Involved:
- **Request Payment**
- **Payment Handled**
- **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**
- **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**

### Constraints and Their Implications
1. **Responded Existence:** 
   - 'Request Payment' => 'Payment Handled'
   - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' => 'Payment Handled', 'Request Payment'
   - 'Payment Handled' => 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'
   - 'Payment Handled' => 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'

2. **Initialization:**
   - The trace must start with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

3. **Non Co-Existence:**
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs, then 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled', and 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' should not occur.

4. **Succession (Directly Follows Relation):**
   - There are specific direct dependencies like:
     - 'Request Payment' => 'Payment Handled'
     - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' => 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'
     - 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' => 'Request Payment', 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'

5. **Chain Succession (Imposes a Sequence with no repetition):**
   - There are specific sequences like:
     - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment'
     - 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled'

### Process Outline
Given the constraints, we can outline the following steps and their dependencies:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The trace starts with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

2. **Events and Dependencies:**
   - If 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' occurs:
     - It implies that 'Request Payment' must occur first.
     - After 'Request Payment', it triggers 'Payment Handled'.
     - From 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR':
       - This directly leads to 'Payment Handled'.
       - Also, it can lead back to 'Request Payment', which will then trigger another 'Payment Handled'.

3. **Non Co-Existence:**
   - If 'Request Payment' occurs:
     - 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Payment Handled', and any of the other events should not occur in sequence.

4. **Chain Succession:**
   - There are strict sequences defined that cannot be repeated.
     - The most clear chain is: 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' => 'Request Payment' => 'Payment Handled'.

### Process Model Visualization
Given all these constraints, a possible execution trace could look like this (using the specific events and ensuring they meet all dependencies):

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

2. **Event Sequence:**
   - Execution of 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' triggers:
     - Execution of 'Request Payment'
     - After 'Request Payment', execution of 'Payment Handled'
   - If the sequence starts with 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR':
     - Execution directly follows to 'Payment Handled'

3. **Avoid Co-Existence Violations:**
   - Ensure that if 'Request Payment' occurs, no other specific events like 'Declaration FINAL APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' or 'Payment Handled' occur in the immediate sequence.

### Conclusion
The process is a series of transactions starting with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", where each event has pre-defined and successively dependent actions. The constraints ensure that there are no unnecessary overlaps, ensuring each action is uniquely determined by its previous action. This model captures the flow of actions and their dependencies to achieve a coherent and structured process.
