Sure! Based on your list of 20 relevant questions and the responses, here are some questions that might be important to consider:

1. Were all changes made before payment was submitted?
2. Why did you not use the same budget owner multiple times for different requests?
3. How long had it been since you last submitted a request in your budget?
4. What has been the most successful payment outcome so far in this process?
5. Did any of the requests have delays or errors? If yes, how was that handled?

As for the confidence scores, here is an example:

Question: Were all changes made before payment was submitted?
Confidence Score = 90%
Explanation:
- All questions were asked within a specific timeframe and under strict guidelines. The response to each question was accurate.
- The response to some questions might be a bit less straightforward, especially for more complex requests or inquiries.

Question: Why did you not use the same budget owner multiple times for different requests?
Confidence Score = 90%
Explanation:
- This question is important because it shows that there may have been issues with the way the requests were submitted or handled. Understanding why the requests were made and processed in a specific way could be useful to address these potential problems.

Question: How long had it been since you last submitted a request in your budget?
Confidence Score = 80%
Explanation:
- The question is simple and directly related to payment processing, which is one of the most important aspects of any financial system. It allows us to assess how well the payment process has handled previous requests.

Question: What has been the most successful payment outcome so far in this process?
Confidence Score = 90%
Explanation:
- The response to this question might be surprising, as it focuses on a specific example rather than an overarching analysis of payment outcomes. Still, it highlights how well payment processing is able to handle different requests and the success of previous payments.

Question: Did any of the requests have delays or errors? If yes, how was that handled?
Confidence Score = 90%
Explanation:
- This question also deals with payment processing, which involves managing multiple transactions. Handling delays and errors requires a high level of attention to detail, especially in complex financial systems.
  
Please note that these scores are based on common questions about the payment process and handling of requests, not specific examples from your specific case.

It is important to note that for real-world projects or applications, it would be beneficial to have multiple people review each question and provide feedback. It can also help refine processes and improve overall efficiency through better understanding of how changes are being made and received.
  
Good luck with the project!
