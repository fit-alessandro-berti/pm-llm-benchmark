**1. Normative Rule Violations:**

- **Case 2**  
  - **Violation 1:** Risk Assessment (08:20) was performed before Credit Check (09:00).  
    *Normative rule: Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment.*  
  - **Violation 2:** Finalize Documentation was executed after a Loan Decision (Rejected).  
    *Normative rule: Documentation must not be finalized if the loan is rejected.*  

  **Severity:** These are **serious violations** as they break the strict sequence and logic of the process.  

- **Cases 1 and 3**  
  - No normative violations. Both follow the required sequence and decision logic.

**2. Desiderata Violations (Suboptimal Behavior):**

- **Case 1**  
  - **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was performed before closing the case.  
  - **Timing Compliance:**  
    - Credit Check (30 minutes after application) and Inform Applicant (2 hours after decision) meet timing recommendations.  

- **Case 2**  
  - **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was performed before closing the case.  
  - **Timing Compliance:**  
    - Credit Check (1 hour after application) and Inform Applicant (30 minutes after decision) meet timing recommendations.  

- **Case 3**  
  - **Desideratum Violation 1:** Credit Check occurred ~49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation).  
  - **Desideratum Violation 2:** Inform Applicant occurred ~51 hours after Loan Decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation).  
  - **Desideratum Violation 3:** No Follow-up Call was performed.  

  **Severity:** These are **not critical** but indicate inefficiencies (e.g., delays in communication, missed customer alignment opportunities).

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**

- **Case 2’s Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**  
  - *Possible justification:* The activity might represent administrative closure (e.g., archiving rejection records), but the process explicitly forbids "Finalize Documentation" after rejection. This is likely a logging error or misaligned activity naming.  

- **Case 3’s Delays:**  
  - *Possible justification:* The Credit Check delay (Jan 12–14) could involve non-business days (e.g., weekend) or resource constraints. The Inform Applicant delay (Jan 14–16) might reflect communication challenges (e.g., applicant unavailability).  

- **Missing Follow-up Calls:**  
  - *Possible justification:* Follow-up Calls may be omitted for efficiency or deemed unnecessary for rejected cases (though the desiderata does not distinguish between approval/rejection).
