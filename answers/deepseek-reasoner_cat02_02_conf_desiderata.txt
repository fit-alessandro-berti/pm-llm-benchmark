**1. Normative Rule Violations**  

- **Case 2**:  
  - **Violation 1**: *Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check*.  
    - The sequence requires Credit Check  Risk Assessment. Case 2 performed Risk Assessment at 08:20 (before Credit Check at 09:00), violating the strict order.  
  - **Violation 2**: *Finalize Documentation after rejection*.  
    - After a Loan Decision (Rejected), Finalize Documentation was incorrectly performed (10:00) before closing the case.  
  - **Violation 3**: *Skipped Inform Applicant*.  
    - The applicant was not informed of the rejection, which is required after Loan Decision.  

- **Case 1 & Case 3**: No normative violations. Both follow the required sequence and decision logic.

**2. Desiderata Failures**  

- **Case 1**:  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call**: No Follow-up Call was performed before closing the case.  
  - **Note**: Credit Check (30 minutes after application) and Inform Applicant (2 hours after decision) met timing recommendations.  

- **Case 2**:  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call**: No Follow-up Call was performed.  
  - **Note**: Credit Check was done promptly (1 hour after application), but normative violations overshadow desiderata issues.  

- **Case 3**:  
  - **Delayed Credit Check**: Credit Check occurred ~49 hours after application (exceeds 24-hour recommendation).  
  - **Delayed Inform Applicant**: Applicant was informed ~51 hours after Loan Decision (exceeds 48-hour recommendation).  
  - **Missing Follow-up Call**: No Follow-up Call was performed.

**3. Interpretations/Justifications**  

- **Case 3’s Delays**:  
  - The application was received on Friday (2024-01-12), and the Credit Check occurred on Monday (2024-01-14), likely due to weekend non-processing days. Similarly, the Loan Decision (2024-01-14) and Inform Applicant (2024-01-16) delays may reflect weekend backlog.  
  - **Follow-up Call omission**: Possibly deemed lower priority after approval, but still a missed best practice.  

- **Case 2’s Skipped Inform Applicant**:  
  - Could reflect an oversight in logging or an assumption that rejection notifications are handled automatically (e.g., via system-generated messages). However, the activity is strictly required.  

--- 

**Summary**:  
- **Case 2** violates strict rules and should be flagged for correction.  
- **All cases** have desiderata deviations (Follow-up Call missing universally; timing issues in Case 3). These represent suboptimal adherence but are not critical failures.
