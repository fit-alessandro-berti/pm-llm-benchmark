# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: Comprehensive Optimization Approach

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Integration Strategy:**
The multi-source event data requires careful preprocessing to create a cohesive event log:

- **Common Case ID Creation:** Establish consistent case identifiers combining Vehicle ID and operational date (e.g., "V12-20241205") to link events across all systems
- **Timestamp Synchronization:** Ensure all timestamps are in UTC and handle potential clock drift between GPS trackers, scanners, and dispatch systems
- **Location Standardization:** Convert GPS coordinates to consistent format and create location hierarchies (depot, customer zones, service areas)
- **Event Correlation:** Match GPS tracking data with scanner events using temporal proximity and location validation (GPS location should align with scanner location within acceptable radius)

**Key Challenges:**
- **Data Quality Issues:** Missing GPS signals in tunnels/buildings, scanner failures, or inconsistent driver behavior in using scanners
- **Temporal Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data at 30-second intervals vs. discrete scanner events
- **Multi-perspective Events:** Same delivery may have GPS movement data, scanner confirmation, and dispatch system updates
- **Unstructured Maintenance Data:** Converting maintenance logs into structured events with proper activity classifications

**Event Log Schema:**
```
Case_ID | Timestamp | Activity | Resource | Package_ID | Location | Speed | Duration | Additional_Attributes
```

### Process Discovery Implementation

**Algorithm Selection:**
- **Alpha Miner** for initial process structure discovery to understand basic flow patterns
- **Inductive Miner** for handling noise and incomplete traces common in GPS/logistics data
- **Fuzzy Miner** to manage high variability in delivery routes and handle the complexity of multiple customer stops

**Process Modeling Approach:**
1. **Macro-Process Level:** Depot departure  Customer zone navigation  Multiple deliveries  Depot return
2. **Micro-Process Level:** Individual delivery activities (arrive  scan  deliver/fail  depart)
3. **Multi-layer Analysis:** Separate process models for different vehicle types, drivers, and geographical zones

**Key Process Variants to Discover:**
- Standard successful delivery sequences
- Failed delivery patterns and retry mechanisms
- Emergency/unscheduled stop procedures
