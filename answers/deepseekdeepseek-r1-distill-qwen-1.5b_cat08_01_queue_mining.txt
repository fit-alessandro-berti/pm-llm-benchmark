**1. Queue Identification and Characterization**

**a. Calculating Waiting Times**

To identify and characterize queues, we will first analyze the **event log data** to calculate waiting times between consecutive activities. Events will be stored with their timestamps, and their order will be used to determine the duration of each activity. The **waiting time** in this context refers to the time a patient spends between completing one activity and starting the next activity. This can be calculated by subtracting the ** completion timestamp** of one activity from the **start timestamp** of the next activity.

For example, in the provided event log snippet:
- A patient completes registration at 09:02:15.
- The next activity is registration at 09:08:45, resulting in a waiting time of **06 minutes**.

**b. Key Metrics Calculation**

- **Average Waiting Time (AWT):** Sum of all waiting times divided by the number of cases.
- **Median Waiting Time:** Middle value of sorted waiting times.
- **Maximum Waiting Time:** Highest waiting time observed.
- **90th Percentile Waiting Time:** The waiting time required for 90% of patients.
- **Queue Frequency:** Number of cases processed per hour (calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total time period, e.g., 6 months).

**c. Identifying Most Critical Queues**

Critical queues are identified by:

1. **Longest Average Waiting Time:** Queues that process patients for the longest duration.
2. **Highest Frequency:** Queues where patients experience visits more often than others.
3. **Excessive waits in a way that significantly degrades patient experience or leads to dissatisfaction.**
4. **Impact on specific patient types (e.g., New vs. Follow-up):** Queues processed by urgency levels may need special attention.
5. **Capsule issues:** Such as extremely long waits that push away other resources, potentially rendering the system unworkable.

**2. Root Cause Analysis**

Root causes of significant queues may include:

1. **Resource Constraints (Bottlenecks):** 
   - **Staff Availability:** If staff are not available during activity start times, they may buffer patients before proceeding.
   - **Room/Equipment Utilization:** If resources like exam tables or imaging systems are underutilized, they may hold patients longer.
   
2. **Activity Dependencies and Handovers:**
   - Rushing or unnecessary handovers can lead to queues.
   
3. **Variability in Activity Duration:**
   - Patients with urgent needs may require extended time, creating unnecessary gaps in the workflow.
   
4. **AppPOINTMENT SCHEDULE POLICIES:**
   -rules that make appointments longer or disadvantage certain patients.
   
5. **Patient Arrival Patterns:**
   - If patients arrive at times inconsistent with expected Còns, it can exacerbate queues.
   
6. **Differences Based on Patient Type:**
   - Urgent patients or new patients may require longer stays than follow-ups.
   
7. **Operational Costs and Efficiency:**
   - Potential for inefficient routing through the system, even with minimal delays.

**3. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**

**a. Redesigning Parts of the Patient Flow**

- **Parallelizing Activities:** If two or more activities in sequence can be conducted simultaneously, it may reduce overall wait time. For example, transforming a registration and handover into parallel processes to streamline the workflow.

**b. Implementing New Coordination Mechanisms**

- **Combined Resource Allocation:** Assigning staffing and equipment to multiple queues simultaneously can reduce critical queue times.
- **Predictive Room Scheduling:** Using historical data to schedule patient visits in advance, preventing tight temporal constraints that may cause queues.

**c. Reducing Overhead**

- **Smaller Workload:** Breaking long discharge processes into separate, smaller visits can eliminate bottlenecks.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Enabling cross-functional teams to expedite complex procedures, such as urgent consultations with multiple specialists.

**4. Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints**

*Trade-offs* include balancing the critical queues with the need to maintain thorough care for individual patients. For example, reducing critical queues may require reallocating resources, which could decrease overall efficiency. *Constraints* include the potential reduction in patient satisfaction due to delays. Metrics such as patient scores and the impact on working hours are crucial to weigh these trade-offs.

*Choosing the right strategy* depends on the priority of improvement. If critical delays are severe, prioritizing cost reduction might be necessary. However, if the benefits outweigh the costs, a slightly lower-priority strategy might still reduce operational costs.

*Imaging* patient experience and satisfaction through surveys and patient feedback can provide clear metrics for measuring success and identifying areas for re-evaluation.

**5. Measuring Success**

The KPIs will include:

1. **Average Waiting Time Reduction (AWTR):** The reduction in average waiting times between critical queues.
2. **Patient Satisfaction Metrics:** Surveys measuring how satisfied patients are with the flowing process.
3. **Discharge Rate Increase:** The volume of patients who complete their visits without significant waiting times.
4. **Staff Productivity:** The increase in staff capacity used to process patients, reflecting improved efficiency.

Ongoing monitoring can ensure sustained improvement and highlight areas for further optimization.
