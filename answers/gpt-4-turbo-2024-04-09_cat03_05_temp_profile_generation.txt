To model the temporal profile for the global supply chain process described in the scenario, I will create a Python dictionary for several directly connected and indirectly connected pairs of activities. These pairs reflect potential sequences in which these activities could logically follow each other. The average times and standard deviations are estimations that might represent delays due to typical factors influencing business flows such as supplier efficiency, lead times, transportation, inspection thoroughness, etc.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (28800, 3600),  # 8 hours avg for placing an order post selection, 1 hour stddev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (172800, 21600),  # 2 days avg for receiving components, 6 hours stddev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),  # 2 hours avg for starting quality inspection, 0.5 hour stddev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),  # 4 hours avg to start assembly after inspection, 1 hour stddev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 5400),  # 6 hours avg to proceed to product testing after assembly, 1.5 hours stddev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (10800, 2700),  # 3 hours avg to package after testing, 45 minutes stddev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1200),  # 1 hour avg to store in warehouse post packaging, 20 minutes stddev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (43200, 10800),  # 12 hours avg before distribution after storage, 3 hours stddev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (259200, 43200),  # 3 days avg to provide after-sales support post-distribution, 12 hours stddev
    
    # Considering indirect relationships:
    ('SS', 'RC'): (180000, 28800),  # Longer periods combining multiple direct periods
    ('SS', 'CA'): (230400, 36000),
    ('OP', 'QI'): (200000, 32000),
    ('OP', 'CA'): (250000, 40000),
    ('RC', 'PT'): (43200, 10800),
    ('RC', 'PK'): (54000, 13500),
    ('QI', 'PK'): (39600, 9900),
    ('QI', 'WS'): (46800, 11700),
    ('CA', 'WS'): (32400, 8100),
    ('CA', 'DT'): (75600, 18900),
    ('PT', 'WS'): (21600, 5400),
    ('PT', 'DT'): (54000, 13500),
    ('PK', 'AS'): (302400, 50400)
}

print(temporal_profile)

### Explanation:
- Directly connected pairs have their times estimated based on typical workflow immediacies.
- Indirectly connected pairs have their average times and standard deviations derived by assuming cumulative effects from the activities in between, possibly lengthened by delays or inefficiencies in more complex sequences.
- This representation considers reasonable fluctuations in a high-tech manufacturing environment focusing on both efficiency and meticulousness in operations.
