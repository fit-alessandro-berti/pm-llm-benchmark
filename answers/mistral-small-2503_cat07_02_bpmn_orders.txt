The diagram is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) representation of a business process involving four main departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. The process begins in the Sales department on Monday morning, where customer orders are checked for completeness and verified against a database. If the customer is not in the database, they are added. Once verified, order details are sent to the Production department. In Production, the order details trigger planning and manufacturing processes, with checks for faulty materials. If materials are faulty, they are returned to the Procurement department, which involves a subprocess for ordering and checking materials. If materials are not faulty, production continues until completion. The completed product is then sent to the Warehouse, where it is prepared for shipping. The diagram illustrates the flow of information and materials between departments, highlighting key decision points, subprocesses, and interactions necessary to fulfill customer orders efficiently.
