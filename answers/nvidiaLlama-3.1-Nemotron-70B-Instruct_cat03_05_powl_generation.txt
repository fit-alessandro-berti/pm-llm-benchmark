Below is a Python code example that implements a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process using a POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) model in pm4py. This P2P process is simplified and includes the following main activities:

1. **Purchase Request**: The process starts with a purchase request.
2. **Approval**: The request is then sent for approval. This is modeled as an exclusive choice (XOR) between "Approved" and "Rejected". If rejected, the process ends with a silent transition (skip).
3. **If Approved**:
   - **Purchase Order Creation**: Create a purchase order.
   - **Concurrent Activities**:
     - **Goods Receipt**: Receive the goods.
     - **Invoice Receipt**: Receive the invoice.
   - **Payment**: After both goods and invoice are received, proceed with payment.
4. **End Process**: After payment, the process ends with a silent transition (skip).

Here is how you could model this using pm4py and POWL:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities as Transitions
purchase_request = Transition(label="Purchase Request")
approved = Transition(label="Approved")
rejected = Transition(label="Rejected")
purchase_order_creation = Transition(label="Purchase Order Creation")
goods_receipt = Transition(label="Goods Receipt")
invoice_receipt = Transition(label="Invoice Receipt")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")

# Silent Transitions for endpoints (start/end of sub-processes or the whole process)
skip_start = SilentTransition()  # Not actually needed in this example but shown for completeness
skip_rejected = SilentTransition()
skip_end = SilentTransition()

# XOR for Approval (Exclusive Choice between Approved and Rejected)
approval_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[approved, rejected])

# Sequence after Approval (Purchase Order Creation, then concurrent Goods/Invoice Receipt, then Payment)
# First, create a partial order for the concurrent receipt activities
concurrent_receipts_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[goods_receipt, invoice_receipt])
# Since they are in a partial order without specified edges, they are considered concurrent

# Now, sequence: Purchase Order Creation -> Concurrent Receipts -> Payment
# Since the POWL model for sequence isn't directly provided, we emulate it with a partial order
# that enforces the desired sequence
post_approval_sequence = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[purchase_order_creation, concurrent_receipts_po, payment])
post_approval_sequence.order.add_edge(purchase_order_creation, concurrent_receipts_po)
post_approval_sequence.order.add_edge(concurrent_receipts_po, payment)  #-edge from PO to Payment

# Connect Approved to the post-approval sequence, and Rejected to skip
approval_outcomes = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[approval_xor, post_approval_sequence, skip_rejected])
approval_outcomes.order.add_edge(approval_xor, post_approval_sequence)  # Assuming Approved goes next in sequence
approval_outcomes.order.add_edge(approval_xor, skip_rejected)  # Rejected ends with skip

# Final Process: Purchase Request -> Approval Outcomes -> End
final_process = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[purchase_request, approval_outcomes, skip_end])
final_process.order.add_edge(purchase_request, approval_outcomes)
final_process.order.add_edge(approval_outcomes, skip_end)

# To visualize or further analyze the model, you might need to convert it into a Petri Net
# or another compatible format that pm4py supports for analysis/visualization.
# For example, converting to a Petri Net:
# net, initial_marking, final_marking = pm4py.convert_to_petri_net(final_process)
#
# # Visualize or analyze the net as needed
# pm4py.visualize(net, initial_marking, final_marking)
```

Note:
- This example assumes that direct sequencing and exclusive choices are correctly interpreted through the POWL constructs provided by pm4py.
- For actual execution, analysis, or visualization of the process model in pm4py, you may need to convert this POWL model into another format like a Petri Net, as hinted at the end of the code snippet.
- The `pm4py.visualize` function used at the end is a placeholder for your desired method of visualization or analysis, which might require additional setup or libraries (e.g., Graphviz for Petri Net visualization).
