## Step 1: Define the concept of "Source" in the context of Petri nets
In the context of Petri nets, a "source" refers to an element that starts to generate or produce an element (transition or token) in the net. It is a location where the input to the net is flowing in, allowing the net to evolve or produce new elements.

## Step 2: Explain the concept of "Immediate Transition" in Petri nets
An "immediate transition" in Petri nets is a transition that has no carrying capacity, meaning it cannot produce any new elements. Instead, it allows a single new element to be generated in the net, but not indefinitely. This concept is opposite to the "Live Transition", which can produce an unlimited number of new elements.

## Step 3: Define the concept of "Live Transition" in Petri nets
A "live transition" in Petri nets is a transition that can produce an unlimited number of new elements. These transitions allow for the gradual increase of the net's capacity and the production of new elements, enabling the net to evolve over time.

## Step 4: Define the concept of "Bounded Net" in Petri nets
A "bounded net" in Petri nets is a net where every element can either be present or absent, but not both simultaneously. This means that there is no carrying capacity for the net, and every transition or element has a finite capacity.

## Step 5: Define the concept of "Free Choice Net" in Petri nets
A "free choice net" in Petri nets is a net where every element can be present or absent independently. This allows for the evolution of the net in any direction, as each element can be independently produced or consumed, without any constraint.

## Step 6: Provide an explanation for the more general concept of "Reversible Net"
A more general concept for a net is a "reversible net". A reversible net is a net that can be reversed or undone without any loss of elements. This concept is a natural extension of the "Bounded Net" concept, as it allows for the net to be in a state of balance and equilibrium.

## Step 7: Define the concept of "Erasable Net"
An "erasable net" is a net where the elements can be erased or deleted without any loss of net capacity. This concept is a natural extension of the "Free Choice Net" concept, as it allows for the net to be destroyed or eliminated completely.

## Step 8: Provide an explanation for the relationship between the more general concepts and the "Reversible" and "Erasable" concepts
The more general concepts of "Reversible Net" and "Erasable Net" can be seen as specific cases of the "Bounded Net" and "Free Choice Net" concepts, respectively. A reversible net can be viewed as a special case of a bounded net where every transition has a finite capacity, and an erasable net can be viewed as a special case of a free choice net where every element has a finite capacity.

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer to this problem, as it is a conceptual explanation of the Petri nets field and its related concepts.
