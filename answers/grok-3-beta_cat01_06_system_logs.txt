### Process Mining Event Log

Below is the transformed event log suitable for process mining analysis. It includes the required attributes: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, and additional attributes like Application and Document/Window for context.

### Explanation of Transformation Logic

1. **Case Identification:**
   - Cases are defined based on the specific document, file, or task the user is working on. Each unique document or task context (e.g., a specific Word document, email interaction, or PDF file) is treated as a separate case. This approach ensures that related events are grouped into meaningful process instances that reflect a user's focused work on a particular item.
   - Case IDs are prefixed with a type indicator (e.g., "Doc_", "Email_", "PDF_", "Budget_") followed by a unique identifier derived from the document name or task context (e.g., "Document1", "AnnualMeeting"). This makes it easy to distinguish between different types of tasks during analysis.
   - Temporal and application switches (e.g., using "SWITCH" events) helped determine boundaries between cases, although events returning to the same document (like "Document1.docx") were grouped under the same case ID.

2. **Activity Naming:**
   - Raw actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SCROLL") are abstracted into higher-level, standardized activity names that reflect the intent or purpose of the action. For example:
     - "FOCUS" or "SWITCH" to a document is mapped to "Start Document Editing" or "Resume Document Editing" depending on whether it is the first interaction or a return to the document.
     - "TYPING" in Word or Excel is mapped to "Edit Document Content" or "Edit Budget Data."
     - "SCROLL" and "HIGHLIGHT" in a PDF are mapped to "Review PDF Content" and "Annotate PDF Content."
     - Email interactions are broken into "Open Email," "Review Email Content," "Compose Email Reply," and "Send Email."
   - This abstraction reduces noise from low-level system events and creates a more analyst-friendly log for process discovery and conformance checking.

3. **Event Attributes:**
   - The log includes the mandatory attributes: Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp.
   - Additional attributes like "Application" and "Document/Window" are retained to provide context for the activities, which can be useful for detailed analysis or filtering in process mining tools.

4. **Coherent Narrative:**
   - The event log reflects a user's work session across multiple tasks: editing documents, handling an email, reviewing a PDF, and updating a budget spreadsheet. Each case tells the story of a specific task (e.g., drafting "Document1.docx" with multiple edits and saves) while maintaining temporal order across all tasks.

This transformation ensures the event log is suitable for process mining analysis, providing clear process instances and meaningful activities for tools like Disco, ProM, or Celonis to uncover user workflows, identify bottlenecks, or detect deviations in task handling.
