Here is an updated version of the DECLARE model that includes new constraints to mitigate potential biases related to sensitive attributes such as ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, and ApplicantRace. The constraints are designed to ensure fairness by enforcing a sequence of activities that prevent immediate biased decision-making after certain events involving these attributes.

```python
declare_model = {
    "existence": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0},
        "FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "absence": {},
    "exactly_one": {},
    "init": {
        "StartApplication": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}
    },
    "responded_existence": {},
    "coexistence": {
        "StartApplication": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: If FinalDecision is Reject, then ManualReview must coexist
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: If FinalDecision is Approve, then ManualReview must coexist 
        "Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "response": {
        "StartApplication": {"RequestAdditionalInfo": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: RequestAdditionalInfo must coexist with ManualReview 
        "ManualReview": {"ResponseBiasCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "precedence": {},
    "succession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
        # New constraint: ManualReview must precede any Reject decision 
        "Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "altresponse": {},
    "altprecedence": {},
    "altsuccession": {},
    "chainresponse": {},
    "chainprecedence": {},
    "chainsuccession": {},
    # New constraint: Chain to prevent immediate sequence from ManualReview after CheckApplicantRace 
    "ManualReview_ChackApplicantRace": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}},
    # New constraint: Non-succession constraints to avoid direct rejection of minorities
    "nonsuccession": {
        "RequestAdditionalInfo": {"Reject_Minority": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}
    },
    "nonchainsuccession": {}
}
```

### Rationale for Added Constraints:
- **Coexistence and ManualReview Linking**: By requiring a `ManualReview` to coexist with specific decision steps (e.g., `Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Minority`), the model ensures that there is an additional layer of scrutiny when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. This helps prevent biased outcomes from occurring without proper review.
  
- **Response Bias Check**: Ensuring that a `RequestAdditionalInfo` event must coexist with a `BiasMitigationCheck` before reaching certain decision points (like rejecting applications for minorities) adds another level of validation and fairness, allowing time to mitigate potential biases in the initial stages of processing.

- **Precedence Constraints**: By requiring `ManualReview` to precede any rejection decision involving minority applicants (`Reject_Minority`), the model enforces a rule that ensures fairness by mandating further scrutiny before making high-stakes decisions based on sensitive attributes.

- **Non-Succession and Non-Chaining Constraints**: These constraints prevent direct successions or chaining of activities that could lead to immediate biased outcomes, particularly ensuring that rejecting applications for minorities cannot follow immediately after initial checks without additional bias mitigation steps. This helps maintain a fair sequence in the decision-making process.
