Below is a detailed evaluation of each case with respect to the normative rules (strict sequence and prohibitions) and the desiderata (recommended best practices):

---

### 1. Normative Violations

**Case 1**  
- **Activities & Order Observed:**  
  Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
- **Analysis:**  
  - The sequence strictly follows the required normative order.  
  - After an approval decision, documentation is indeed finalized before closing the case.  
  - No steps are skipped or out of order.
- **Conclusion:** No normative violations.

**Case 2**  
- **Activities & Order Observed:**  
  Application Received → **Risk Assessment** (before Credit Check) → Credit Check → Loan Decision (Rejected) → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
- **Normative Issues Identified:**
  1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** This violates the rule that the credit check must occur before risk assessment.  
  2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** The process explicitly forbids finalizing documentation if the loan is rejected. The correct action after a rejection is to close the case without finalization.
  3. **Missing "Inform Applicant" Step:** After the loan decision is made, the applicant must be informed. In this case, the applicant was never informed, which breaks the required sequence.
- **Conclusion:** Multiple normative violations in Case 2.

**Case 3**  
- **Activities & Order Observed:**  
  Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case
- **Analysis:**  
  - All required activities are present.  
  - The order is correct: credit check occurs before risk assessment, risk assessment before loan decision, informing the applicant after the decision, and finalizing documentation before closing in the case of approval.
- **Conclusion:** No normative violations.

### 2. Desiderata Deviations

Desiderata are preferred but not mandatory. Not following them is considered suboptimal but not strictly incorrect.

**Case 1 (No Desiderata Violations):**  
- **Credit Check Timing:** Done 30 minutes after receiving the application—well within the recommended 24 hours.  
- **Inform Applicant Timing:** Informed on the same day, just 2 hours after the decision—far quicker than the recommended 48 hours.  
- **Follow-up Call:** Not present, but this is not mandatory. Considering the rest of the process is exemplary, there’s no issue here.

No significant desiderata deviations in Case 1.

**Case 2 (Not Relevant Due to Major Normative Violations):**  
While the case is overshadowed by major normative violations, we can note the following:  
- The credit check was done relatively quickly (within one hour of the application), so timing is fine from a desiderata standpoint.
- Informing the applicant promptly would have been ideal, but the applicant was never informed at all, which is actually a normative, not just a desideratum, issue.  
- No follow-up call is mentioned, but given the severe normative breaches, this is a minor concern in comparison.

**Case 3 (Desiderata Violations Only):**  
- **Late Credit Check:** The credit check was performed about 48 hours after the application was received. The recommendation suggests doing it within 24 hours, so this is suboptimal but not a strict violation.  
- **Delayed Informing the Applicant:** The decision was made at 12:00 on January 14, but the applicant was informed at 15:00 on January 16—exceeding the recommended 48-hour window. Again, not strictly forbidden, just not ideal.  
- **No Follow-up Call:** A follow-up call before closing the case is recommended but not mandatory. Skipping it is a minor suboptimality.

### 3. Potential Justifications for Observed Behaviors

**Case 1:**  
- Smooth execution might reflect a well-organized, highly efficient process. No justifications needed since everything adhered to both normative and desirable practices.

**Case 2:**  
- The out-of-order risk assessment could be due to a clerical error or a misunderstanding of process requirements. Perhaps the staff member conducting the assessment was unaware that the credit check results were not yet available.  
- Finalizing documentation after rejection might indicate a confusion or a training gap in the process.  
- Not informing the applicant might be an oversight or a system issue where the "Inform Applicant" step was mistakenly skipped.

**Case 3:**  
- The delayed credit check and late informing of the applicant could be due to external factors: waiting for external credit bureau responses, internal staff shortages, or technical delays in communication systems.  
- Skipping the follow-up call might reflect a conscious decision due to low perceived risk or resource constraints, rather than negligence.

---

**In Summary:**  
- **Normative Violations:** Only Case 2 violates the strict process rules.  
- **Desiderata Deviations:** Case 3 deviates from recommended timing and lacks a follow-up call, but these are not severe issues. Case 1 closely aligns with both the normative process and desirata. Case 2’s desirata considerations are moot given the more serious normative breaches.  
- **Justifications:** Errors in Case 2 might stem from training or system confusion; delays in Case 3 may be related to external logistical issues.
