### Inferred Case Groupings

The 18 events can be grouped into **3 distinct cases** (patient journeys) based on:
- **Patient demographics** (age + gender uniquely identify each patient: 45M, 62F, 28M).
- **Chronological progression** of logical hospital activities (e.g., register  triage  tests  consult  treatment  discharge).
- **Department consistency** (ER for emergencies, Surgery for scheduled procedure).
- **Timestamps** (events for each case are strictly increasing and interleaved realistically across cases).
- **Clinical coherence** (e.g., X-ray for leg fracture, lab for infection diagnosis, knee surgery sequence).

No events are ambiguous or shared across cases.
