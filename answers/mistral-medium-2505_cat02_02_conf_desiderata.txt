### **Analysis of Loan Application Process Cases**

#### **1. Normative Rule Violations**
Normative rules are strict and must be followed without deviation. Violations here are considered serious.

- **Case 2:**
  - **Violation 1:** The sequence is incorrect. The `Risk Assessment` occurs before the `Credit Check`, which violates the rule that `Credit Check` must precede `Risk Assessment`.
  - **Violation 2:** After a `Loan Decision (Rejected)`, the process incorrectly includes `Finalize Documentation`, which is only allowed for approved loans. This is a direct contradiction of the normative rules.

- **Cases 1 and 3:**
  - No normative violations are observed. Both follow the strict sequence correctly.

#### **2. Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) Violations**
Desiderata are best practices, and deviations are not severe but indicate suboptimal behavior.

- **Case 3:**
  - **Desideratum Violation 1:** The `Credit Check` occurs more than 24 hours after `Application Received` (2 days later), which is slower than recommended.
  - **Desideratum Violation 2:** The `Inform Applicant` step happens more than 48 hours after the `Loan Decision` (2 days later), which is slower than the recommended timeframe.
  - **Desideratum Violation 3:** There is no `Follow-up Call` before closing the case, which is encouraged but not mandatory.

- **Cases 1 and 2:**
  - **Case 1:** Follows all desiderata (timely credit check, prompt applicant notification, and includes no follow-up call—but since it's optional, this is not a violation).
  - **Case 2:** The normative violations overshadow any desiderata concerns, but if we ignore those, the timing appears acceptable (credit check and applicant notification are within reasonable windows).

#### **3. Possible Interpretations/Justifications**
- **Case 2:**
  - The `Risk Assessment` before `Credit Check` could be a manual error or a system misconfiguration.
  - The `Finalize Documentation` after rejection might be a clerical mistake or an incorrect process execution.

- **Case 3:**
  - The delays in `Credit Check` and `Inform Applicant` could be due to high workload, system delays, or external dependencies (e.g., waiting for third-party credit reports).
  - The missing `Follow-up Call` might be due to resource constraints or an oversight rather than a deliberate omission.

### **Summary of Findings**
| Case ID | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | Explanation |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1       | No                   | No                     | Fully compliant. |
| 2       | **Yes**              | (Overshadowed)         | Incorrect sequence and finalization after rejection. |
| 3       | No                   | **Yes**                | Delays in credit check, applicant notification, and missing follow-up. |

### **Recommendations**
- **For Case 2:** Correct the process flow to ensure `Credit Check` happens before `Risk Assessment` and remove `Finalize Documentation` for rejected loans.
- **For Case 3:** Improve timeliness in credit checks and applicant notifications. Consider adding a `Follow-up Call` for better customer experience.
- **General:** Monitor process adherence to normative rules strictly, while using desiderata as performance improvement targets.
