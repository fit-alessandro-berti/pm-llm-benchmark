### Merged Event Log Output:
Here is the merged event log, aligned in chronological order. Each row combines related events from **Log A** and **Log B** or preserves unmatched events from either log, noting their origin. The log includes all available attributes.

Format:  
`timestamp_primary, event_type, order_id, user_id, resource_id, notes, origin, timestamp_secondary`

### Reasoning and Alignment Decisions:

1. **Unified Timestamps (`timestamp_primary` and `timestamp_secondary`)**:  
   - When events in **Log A** and **Log B** were aligned, we used the earlier timestamp as the `timestamp_primary`. This maintains temporal accuracy based on the assumption that **Log B** often captures events earlier (e.g., `Order Received` captured first in `Log B`).
   - In these cases, the alternate timestamp was included as `timestamp_secondary` for traceability.

2. **Matching Events**:  
   - Events were matched based primarily on `order_id`, followed by proximity in time, and lastly by event name similarity.  
   - A **2-second tolerance window** was applied for timestamp matching, allowing minor deviations (e.g., `Order Validated` matched at `10:01:30Z` in **Log A** with `10:01:29Z` in **Log B**).
   - Event name mapping:
     - `Order Received` (A)  `OrderReceived` (B)
     - `Order Validated` (A)  `OrderValidation` (B)
     - `Payment Processed` (A)  `PaymentCheck` (B)
     - `Item Shipped` (A)  `Shipping` (B)

3. **Merged Attributes**:  
   - Where events were matched, all attributes from both logs were combined. For instance:
     - `Order Received` includes user_id (`u45`), resource_id (`r10`), and notes from **Log B** along with basic attributes from **Log A**.
     - We also resolved naming inconsistencies by selecting the more descriptive variant (e.g., `Payment Processed` instead of `PaymentCheck`).

4. **Handling Unmatched Events**:
   - For events that could not be confidently aligned:
     - The `Quality Check` event in **Log B** had no equivalent in **Log A**; it was included as-is, with its origin noted.
     - Similarly, the final `Item Delivered` event from **Log A** had no corresponding event in **Log B**, so it was preserved separately.

5. **Chronological Ordering**:  
   - The final output was presented in ascending order of `timestamp_primary`. When merging, earlier timestamps from **Log B** were respected because they likely reflect event initiation rather than receipt (as seen in **Log A**).

6. **Resolving Conflicts**:  
   - When timestamps differed slightly, we noted both timestamps but preferred the earlier time (usually from **Log B**) as more accurate.
   - Event naming differences were harmonized to align with process semantics (e.g., `OrderValidated`  `Order Validated`).

This integrated log provides a holistic, enriched view of the order fulfillment process, leveraging data from both systems while preserving provenance and resolving discrepancies logically.
