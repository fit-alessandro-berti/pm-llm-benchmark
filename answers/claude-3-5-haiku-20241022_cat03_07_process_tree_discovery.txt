Based on the event log and the observed process behavior, here's a proposed process tree that captures the process complexity:

```
* (
    -> (
        'Receive Application (RA)',
        X (
            -> ('Validate Form (VF)', 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'),
            'Request Missing Info (RMI)'
        ),
        -> (
            'Approval Decision (AD)', 
            'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
            'Archive Case (AC)'
        )
    )
)
```

Let me break down the reasoning:

1. The outermost `*` (loop) operator suggests that the entire process can potentially repeat if needed.

2. The first sequence `->` captures the main process flow:
   - Starts with 'Receive Application (RA)'
   - Then has an exclusive choice `X` between:
     a) A sequence of 'Validate Form (VF)' followed by 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
     b) 'Request Missing Info (RMI)'

3. After the initial validation/assessment, there's another sequence `->` that includes:
   - 'Approval Decision (AD)'
   - 'Send Confirmation (SC)'
   - 'Archive Case (AC)'

This process tree captures key observations from the event log:
- Some cases (like Case 1 and 3) require multiple 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' and 'Validate Form (VF)' steps
- The process has a consistent overall structure
- There's flexibility for re-validation and information gathering
- The final steps of approval, confirmation, and archival are sequential

The `*` loop allows for potential repeated cycles of validation and information gathering before moving to the final stages.
