Okay, let's analyze the event log and rename the activities.

**1. Activity Analysis & Renaming:**

The key activity that recurs is "Verify Documents."  It has different meanings:

*   **C001 & C002:**  "Verify Documents" refers to checking identity documents as part of a standard verification process.
*   **C003:** "Verify Documents" refers to re-verifying documents *after* an account adjustment has been made.

Therefore, we need to rename it to clearly distinguish these two scenarios.

**2. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities:**

```

**3. Justification of Naming Changes:**

*   **"Verify Documents"** was changed to **"Verify Identity Documents"** and **"Re-Verify Identity Documents"** to explicitly state the type of verification being performed.  The addition of "Re-" clarifies that this is a second verification, specifically triggered by a subsequent event (account adjustment).  This disambiguation is crucial for understanding the process flow.

This revised log provides a clearer representation of the support workflow, making it easier to analyze and understand the sequence of events.
