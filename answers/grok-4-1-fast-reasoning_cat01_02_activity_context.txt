### Justification of Naming Choices
- **Verify Documents** (recurs in C001, C003): Renamed to "Initial Document Verification" for first occurrences (clues: precedes issues like incomplete verification or customer stepping out; focuses on primary identity checks via docs or physical ID). "Document Re-verification" for subsequent ones (clues: explicitly "re-checks" or "re-verify" after additional docs or account adjustments).
- **Call Customer** (recurs in C002; appears once elsewhere): Renamed per context to disambiguate purpose— "Call to Request Missing Docs" (C001: triggered by incomplete initial verification, requests uploads); "Call to Clarify Account" (C002 first: addresses "account discrepancy"); "Call to Confirm Adjustments" (C002 second: "follow-up" post-adjustment); "Call to Recall Customer" (C003: customer "stepped out," non-account issue).
- **Submit Additional** (unique): Minor tweak to "Submit Additional Documents" for clarity (clue: "uploads the requested ID scan").
- **Adjust Account** (appears in C002, C003): Standardized to "Adjust Account Details" (clues: both are internal post-call corrections for discrepancies or missing info; no intra-case recurrence).
- **Initiate Request** and **Approve Request**: Unchanged (consistent start/end across cases; channel differences in resources/context, not activity semantics).
These names use position, preceding events, resources, and explicit context phrases to create unique, process-aware identifiers, improving log readability for analysis (e.g., process mining).
