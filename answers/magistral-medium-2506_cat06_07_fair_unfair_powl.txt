Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, with and without the potential unfairness due to community affiliations:

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (XOR bias branch)

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Create the data completeness loop (if data is incomplete, request more info and check again)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create the XOR branch for cultural fit assessment (with potential bias)
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order
nodes = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_fit_xor,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

root_biased = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add edges to enforce ordering
root_biased.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)  # Receive app before data check
root_biased.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)     # Complete data check before skill assessment
root_biased.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor)  # Skill assessment before cultural fit
root_biased.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview) # Cultural fit before review
root_biased.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision) # Review before final decision
```

In this model, the XOR branch (`cultural_fit_xor`) introduces potential unfairness because candidates can take either the standard cultural fit path or the community-affiliated path, which may give preferential treatment.

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (No XOR bias branch)

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (same as before, but no CommunityAffiliationCheck)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create the data completeness loop (same as before)
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# No XOR branch here - only standard cultural fit check
nodes = [
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    StandardCulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
]

root_unbiased = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

# Add edges to enforce ordering
root_unbiased.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)  # Receive app before data check
root_unbiased.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)     # Complete data check before skill assessment
root_unbiased.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck)  # Skill assessment before cultural fit
root_unbiased.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview) # Cultural fit before review
root_unbiased.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision) # Review before final decision
```

In this model, all candidates go through the same `StandardCulturalFitCheck`, eliminating the potential bias introduced by the XOR branch in the first model.

---

### Key Differences:
1. The biased model includes an XOR choice (`CommunityAffiliationCheck` vs `StandardCulturalFitCheck`), allowing preferential treatment.
2. The unbiased model removes the XOR branch, ensuring all candidates undergo the same cultural fit assessment.

Both models maintain the data completeness loop and sequential ordering of tasks, but the second model enforces fairness by removing the biased branching.
