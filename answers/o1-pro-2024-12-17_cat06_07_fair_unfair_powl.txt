Below are two POWL model representations. The first model includes a branching after the skill assessment that can introduce subtle unfairness by offering a different path for community-affiliated candidates. The second model removes this branching, treating all candidates the same in the cultural fit stage. Both models assume a sequence starting with application reception, a loop for data completeness, and then a skill assessment. The main difference lies in how the cultural fit evaluation step is handled.

**Note:** In both models, the POWL elements are constructed as follows:

- **Transitions (Activities):** Represented as `Transition(label="ActivityName")`
- **Loop:** Represented as `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])` meaning that A is executed, and if conditions require looping, B followed by A is repeated.
- **XOR (Choice):** Represented as `OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[A, B])` meaning a choice between A and B.
- **StrictPartialOrder:** Represents a partial order with nodes and order constraints. The `order.add_edge(source, target)` sets precedence.

### 1) POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

**Intended Logic:**  
- Receive the application.
- Ensure data completeness (loop: if incomplete, request more info and then re-check).
- Conduct skill assessment.
- XOR Choice:
  - Either perform a standard CulturalFitCheck, OR
  - Perform a CommunityAffiliationCheck that provides an advantage if the candidate has certain affiliations.
- After cultural evaluation (whichever branch chosen), perform a managerial review.
- Make the final decision.

**POWL Code Example:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
R = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DCC = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SA = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CAC = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
MR = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness:
# * (DCC, RMI) means: Execute DCC, if still incomplete, do RMI and then repeat DCC
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DCC, RMI])

# Define the XOR for cultural check vs community-based check:
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CFC, CAC])

# Create a partial order that arranges these elements in sequence
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[R, data_loop, SA, cultural_xor, MR, FD])
root.order.add_edge(R, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, cultural_xor)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, MR)
root.order.add_edge(MR, FD)
```

### 2) POWL Model Without Unfairness

**Intended Logic:**  
- Receive the application.
- Ensure data completeness (loop as before).
- Conduct skill assessment.
- Perform a uniform CulturalFitCheck for all applicants (no special XOR branch).
- Managerial review.
- Final decision.

**Changes from the Previous Model:**  
- The XOR branching after the skill assessment is removed. All applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation (CFC).

**POWL Code Example:**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities (no CommunityAffiliationCheck this time)
R = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DCC = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RMI = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SA = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CFC = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
MR = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FD = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DCC, RMI])

# No XOR this time; just a single cultural fit step
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[R, data_loop, SA, CFC, MR, FD])
root.order.add_edge(R, data_loop)
root.order.add_edge(data_loop, SA)
root.order.add_edge(SA, CFC)
root.order.add_edge(CFC, MR)
root.order.add_edge(MR, FD)
```

**Summary:**

- The first model (`POWL Model with Potential Unfairness`) uses an XOR operator to choose between a standard cultural fit check and a community affiliation check, introducing subtle bias.
- The second model (`POWL Model Without Unfairness`) removes this branching, ensuring that all candidates go through the same cultural fit evaluation, thus eliminating the identified source of potential unfairness.
