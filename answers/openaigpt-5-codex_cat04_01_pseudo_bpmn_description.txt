### 1. Process Overview  
The pseudo-BPMN models how the organization handles customer requests from first contact through confirmation. The process adapts to whether the request is for a standard product/service or one requiring customization. Along the way, it incorporates validations, possible parallel checks, approvals, and loop backs for rework if management rejects the outcome.

---

### 2. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### **Start Event  Task A: “Receive Customer Request”**  
- **Purpose:** Trigger point. The organization receives a new request (e.g., via portal, email, phone).  
- **Outcome:** The request is captured and ready for classification.

#### **Gateway (XOR): “Check Request Type”**  
- **Meaning:** Exclusive decision (one path only). The request is classified as either **Standard** or **Custom**.  
  - **Standard** path ensures routine requests follow streamlined checks.  
  - **Custom** path ensures special requirements are assessed for feasibility.

---

### 3. Standard Request Path

#### **Task B1: “Perform Standard Validation”**  
- **Purpose:** Baseline validation for standard orders (e.g., correct data, compliance with policy).  
- **Outcome:** Confirm the request is well-formed and ready for checks.

#### **Gateway (AND): “Run Parallel Checks”**  
- **Meaning:** Parallel split. Two checks happen simultaneously to reduce turnaround time.

  ##### **Task C1: “Credit Check”**  
  - **Purpose:** Verify customer creditworthiness.  
  - **Outcome:** Pass/fail or credit terms.

  ##### **Task C2: “Inventory Check”**  
  - **Purpose:** Confirm inventory availability.  
  - **Outcome:** Available/shortage.

- **Join:** When both C1 and C2 complete, the process re-joins. If either fails, follow-up actions (e.g., contacting customer or alternative arrangements) are triggered before moving forward.

#### **Task D: “Calculate Delivery Date”**  
- **Purpose:** Determine realistic delivery timeline based on confirmations from C1/C2.  
- **Outcome:** A delivery commitment that reflects actual capacity.

---

### 4. Custom Request Path

#### **Task B2: “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”**  
- **Purpose:** Evaluate technical and operational feasibility (engineering effort, materials, costs).  
- **Outcome:** Basis for decision on whether custom work is achievable.

#### **Gateway (XOR): “Is Customization Feasible?”**
- **Meaning:** Exclusive decision.

  ##### **If Yes  Task E1: “Prepare Custom Quotation”**  
  - **Purpose:** Compile tailored pricing, scope, timelines, and terms reflecting the custom solution.

  ##### **If No  Task E2: “Send Rejection Notice”**  
  - **Purpose:** Inform customer the request can’t be met.  
  - **Outcome:** Process ends here for that request (End Event after E2).

---

### 5. Converging Paths: Standard and Custom

After Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom feasible), both paths converge at the next XOR Gateway to decide if approval is needed.

#### **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Needed?”**  
- **Meaning:** Another exclusive decision.  
  - **Criteria examples:** High order value, special terms, risk thresholds.

  ##### **If Approval Needed  Task F: “Obtain Manager Approval”**
  - **Purpose:** Escalate to management or compliance for sign-off.  
  - **Outcome:** Approval status (granted or denied).

    ###### **Gateway (XOR): “Is Approval Granted?”**
    - **If Yes  Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**  
      - **Purpose:** Create the final billing document reflecting approved terms.

    - **If No  Task H: “Re-evaluate Conditions”**  
      - **Purpose:** Address reasons for rejection (pricing, terms, capabilities).  
      - **Loop-back:**  
        - For **custom** requests: back to Task E1 to revise the custom quotation.  
        - For **standard** requests: back to Task D to revisit delivery assumptions or terms.  
      - After adjustments, the request re-enters the approval cycle.

  ##### **If Approval Not Needed  Task G: “Generate Final Invoice”**  
  - Direct billing with no escalation required.

---

### 6. Finalization

#### **Task I: “Send Confirmation to Customer”**
- **Purpose:** Communicate the final outcome (invoice, terms, delivery date).  
- **Outcome:** Customer receives formal confirmation.

#### **End Event**
- Process completion. Customer request is closed.

---

### 7. Key Behavior by Request Type

| Step | Standard Request | Custom Request |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Initial Validation | Task B1 | Task B2 |
| Additional Checks | Parallel credit + inventory (C1, C2) | Feasibility decision |
| Pricing/Availability | Delivery date calculation (D) | Custom quotation prep (E1) |
| Approval Loop | Rework via Task D | Rework via Task E1 |
| Direct Rejection | Not present | Task E2 when infeasible |

---

### 8. Approval & Rework Conditions
- **Approval Triggered When:** Criteria (value thresholds, risk profiles) require oversight.
- **If Approval Granted:** Process continues to invoicing, then customer confirmation.
- **If Approval Denied:** Task H instructs teams to revisit key steps (calculate delivery date or custom quotation) before resubmitting for approval.
  
---

### 9. Gateways Explained

- **XOR (Exclusive) Gateways:** Choose exactly one path (e.g., Standard vs. Custom, Approval needed or not, Approval granted or denied).
- **AND Gateway:** Run multiple tasks in parallel (credit and inventory checks must both finish before proceeding).

---

### 10. Loops and Convergence

- **Loop:** Rework triggered by approval denial loops back to either Task D or Task E1, depending on request type.
- **Convergence:** After standard or custom paths, the process reconverges before the approval decision, keeping downstream steps consistent regardless of request type.

---

### Summary

The process ensures each customer request is handled appropriately: standard orders benefit from efficient parallel checks and delivery calculation; custom orders undergo feasibility analysis and tailored quotation. Approval decision points safeguard policy compliance. If approvals fail, the process loops back to refine specifics before final confirmation is sent to the customer.
