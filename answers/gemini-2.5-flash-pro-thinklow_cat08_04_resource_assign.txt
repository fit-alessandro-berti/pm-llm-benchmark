Of course. As a Process Improvement Consultant, here is a comprehensive, data-driven approach to optimize TechSolve's resource assignment practices using process mining.

***

### **Executive Summary**

TechSolve Solutions is facing critical operational challenges, including SLA breaches and inefficient resource utilization, which directly impact service quality and operational cost. The current resource assignment logic is a primary suspect. This proposal outlines a systematic, data-driven methodology using process mining to dissect the existing incident management process, pinpoint the root causes of inefficiency, and develop optimized, intelligent resource assignment strategies. By transitioning from anecdotal evidence to empirical data, we will transform the service desk from a reactive unit into a proactive, efficient, and high-performing organization.

### **1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns**

The first step is to create a transparent, factual baseline of how resources currently operate. We will use the provided event log to move beyond assumptions and understand the *as-is* process reality.

#### **Performance and Behavior Analysis**

We will create a resource-centric performance dashboard with the following key metrics:

*   **Workload Distribution:**
    *   **Metric:** Number of cases handled per agent, per team, and per tier over time.
    *   **Analysis:** This will immediately highlight overloaded and underutilized agents, validating or refuting management's suspicions of uneven distribution. We can filter this by ticket priority to see if high-priority work is also distributed unevenly.
*   **Activity Processing Time:**
    *   **Metric:** Average time spent by each agent/tier on specific activities (e.g., `Work L1 Start` -> `Work L1 End`).
    *   **Analysis:** Identifies which agents are faster or slower at certain tasks and can indicate training needs or expertise. Comparing L1 processing times for tickets that are resolved vs. those that get escalated can reveal if L1s are spending too much time on unsolvable issues.
*   **First-Call Resolution (FCR) Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of tickets resolved by the first assigned agent (primarily for L1) without any escalation or reassignment.
    *   **Analysis:** A core L1 efficiency metric. We can break this down by `Ticket Category` to see where L1 is strong and where they are weak. A low FCR for "Network" tickets, for instance, suggests a knowledge or tools gap.
*   **Ticket Type Specialization:**
    *   **Metric:** Frequency and distribution of `Ticket Category` and `Required Skill` handled by each agent/tier.
    *   **Analysis:** This shows who *actually* works on what, regardless of their official role. We may find "unofficial specialists" who are go-to people for certain problems.

#### **Revealing Actual Assignment Patterns with Process Mining**

We will employ specific process mining techniques to visualize and analyze the flow of work between resources:

*   **Process Discovery & Social Network Analysis:** By generating a process map and switching to a "resource" or "social network" view, we can visualize the handovers between agents.
    *   **How it works:** Each agent is a node, and each handover (assignment, escalation, reassignment) is a directed edge. The thickness of the edge represents the frequency of handovers.
    *   **Insights:** This will vividly display the "reassignment spaghetti" that causes delays. We can identify:
        *   **Bottleneck Resources:** Agents who receive a high volume of tickets but have a slow hand-off rate.
        *   **Problematic Handovers:** Frequent back-and-forth reassignments between two specific agents or teams.
        *   **Actual Escalation Paths:** The diagram will show if escalations follow the L1 -> L2 -> L3 hierarchy or if there are frequent, inefficient jumps (e.g., L1 -> L2 -> back to another L1). This directly compares the *de facto* process to the *de jure* process.
*   **Role Discovery:**
    *   **How it works:** This algorithm analyzes the activity profiles of all agents and groups them into clusters based on similar behavior.
    *   **Insights:** This can reveal if the formal roles (L1, L2, L3) match the actual work being done. We might discover a "Super L1" role (L1 agents who handle more complex tasks) or that some L2 agents are primarily performing L1-level work, confirming inefficient use of specialists.

#### **Analyzing Skill Utilization**

*   **How we'll analyze:** We will cross-reference the `Required Skill` attribute on the ticket with the `Agent Skills` attribute for the agent who performed the work.
    *   **Metric:** **Skill Match Rate:** The percentage of activities where the assigned agent's skills included the ticket's `Required Skill`.
    *   **Metric:** **Specialist Misuse Rate:** The percentage of tickets handled by L2/L3 specialists where the `Required Skill` was basic or could have been handled by L1.
    *   **Insights:** This provides hard data on skill gaps and the misallocation of expensive, highly skilled resources. We can quantify the time L3 specialists spend on "Software-App" tickets when their primary skill is "Security-IAM," pointing to a clear optimization opportunity.

### **2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues**

With the baseline analysis complete, we can pinpoint and quantify the specific problems.

*   **Skill-Based Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Identification:** By analyzing the waiting time (e.g., between `Assign L2` and `Work L2 Start`) and filtering by `Required Skill`, we can identify skills with a long queue. For example, if tickets requiring 'Networking-Firewall' have an average wait time of 4 hours vs. 30 minutes for other skills, we have a clear bottleneck.
    *   **Quantification:** "There is an average delay of 3.5 hours for tickets requiring 'Networking-Firewall' due to a shortage of available, skilled agents."
*   **Cost of Reassignments and Escalations:**
    *   **Identification:** We will filter the event log for all cases with one or more `Reassign` or `Escalate` activities.
    *   **Quantification:** By calculating the time difference between the reassignment/escalation event and the start of the next value-adding activity, we can state: "Each internal L2 reassignment adds an average of 1 hour and 45 minutes to the ticket resolution time." and "Each escalation from L1 to L2 adds an average of 2 hours and 30 minutes of non-productive time."
*   **Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments:**
    *   **Identification:** Compare the end-to-end resolution time of tickets resolved at FCR vs. those that were escalated.
    *   **Quantification:** "P2 tickets that are escalated from L1 take, on average, 80% longer to resolve than P2 tickets handled correctly by a specialist from the start." This builds a business case for improving initial triage.
*   **Identifying Overloaded/Underperforming Resources:**
    *   **Identification:** Our workload analysis will show the outliers. We can then correlate this with outcomes.
    *   **Quantification:** "The top 10% most overloaded agents have a 15% higher rate of ticket re-opens and handle their tickets 25% slower than the team average, indicating burnout and quality degradation."
*   **Correlation with SLA Breaches:**
    *   **Identification:** Using **conformance checking**, we will compare every P2 and P3 ticket's lifecycle against its defined SLA. For all breached tickets, we will analyze their resource patterns.
    *   **Quantification:** "75% of P2 SLA breaches are associated with at least one reassignment due to skill mismatch. 60% of P3 breaches involve tickets that waited more than 3 hours for a specialist with 'Database-SQL' skills."

### **3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies**

Now we dig deeper to understand *why* these problems are occurring.

*   **Potential Root Causes:**
    1.  **Deficient Assignment Rules:** The "round-robin" logic is a primary cause, as it ignores skill and current workload, leading directly to mismatches and uneven distribution.
    2.  **Poor Data Quality:** Agent skill profiles in the system may be outdated or incomplete. Initial ticket categorization might be inaccurate, leading to the wrong `Required Skill` being assigned.
    3.  **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The dispatcher or L1 agent escalating a ticket may not know who is available, who is best skilled, or who is already overloaded. They make decisions in an information vacuum.
    4.  **Insufficient L1 Empowerment/Training:** L1 may escalate prematurely because they lack the training, documentation, or access rights to solve slightly more complex but common issues, directly impacting the FCR.

*   **Using Advanced Process Mining for RCA:**
    *   **Variant Analysis:** We will compare the process map and attributes of the "best-case" variants (e.g., high-speed FCR) against the "worst-case" variants (multiple reassignments, SLA breaches). By comparing the starting attributes (`Ticket Category`, `Priority`), we can find patterns. For example, we might find that 90% of worst-case variants start with the category 'Software-OS' but are initially assigned to agents without that skill.
    *   **Decision Mining:** We can build a decision tree model to reverse-engineer the logic behind escalations. The model would predict the outcome (e.g., "Escalate: Yes/No") based on inputs like `Ticket Category`, `Priority`, and the initially assigned `Agent Tier`. This might reveal a hidden rule like: "IF Category is 'Security' THEN always escalate, regardless of L1 agent skill." This points to a policy or trust issue that needs to be addressed.

### **4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies**

Based on our findings, we propose the following three concrete strategies to re-engineer the resource assignment logic.

#### **Strategy 1: Implement Intelligent Skill-Based Routing**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Reassignments due to skill mismatch; inefficient use of specialists.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** Our analysis quantifying the delays caused by skill mismatches provides the business case. The skill utilization analysis identifies the most critical skills to include in the routing logic.
*   **Data Required:**
    1.  A validated and maintained `Agent Skills` database (potentially with proficiency levels: Basic, Intermediate, Expert).
    2.  Accurate `Required Skill` identification on ticket creation (can be improved with keyword analysis or better forms).
*   **Expected Benefits:** Drastic reduction in reassignments (est. 40-60%), faster time-to-match with the right expert, improved resolution times, and higher L2/L3 specialist satisfaction.

#### **Strategy 2: Develop Workload-Aware Dynamic Assignment**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Uneven workload distribution; agent burnout; bottlenecks caused by assigning tickets to already overloaded agents.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** The workload distribution and bottleneck analysis directly prove the failure of the round-robin system.
*   **How it Works:** This strategy layers on top of skill-based routing. The assignment engine would first filter for all agents with the required skill, then assign the ticket to the agent with the lowest current workload (e.g., fewest open tickets or lowest "time-committed").
*   **Data Required:** Real-time agent availability status and current open ticket count per agent integrated into the assignment engine.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Balanced workload, reduced agent burnout, elimination of artificial bottlenecks, and improved overall process throughput.

#### **Strategy 3: Create a Predictive Assignment & Escalation Model**
*   **Issue Addressed:** Incorrect initial assignments; L1 agents wasting time on tickets that will inevitably be escalated.
*   **How it Leverages Analysis:** Uses the insights from Variant Analysis and Decision Mining which identify the ticket characteristics that are highly predictive of an escalation.
*   **How it Works:** We will build a machine learning model that, upon ticket creation, analyzes its attributes (e.g., Category, user-submitted description keywords, user's department) to predict: (1) the probability of requiring escalation, and (2) the most likely `Required Skill`. If the escalation probability is >85%, the system can bypass L1 and route it directly to the L2 queue for the predicted skill.
*   **Data Required:** A large historical dataset of tickets with their initial attributes and final resolution path.
*   **Expected Benefits:** Significantly faster resolution for complex tickets, improved P1/P2 SLA compliance, and frees up L1 capacity to focus on solvable issues, thereby boosting FCR.

### **5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring**

A "big bang" implementation is risky. We will use a phased approach, starting with simulation and followed by continuous monitoring.

#### **Business Process Simulation**

Before deploying any new rules, we will use the discovered "as-is" process model as a baseline in a simulation tool. We will then create "to-be" models incorporating our proposed strategies (e.g., skill-based routing + workload balancing). By running the historical volume of tickets through both models, we can:
*   **Compare KPIs:** Evaluate the projected impact on average resolution time, SLA compliance, resource utilization, and operational cost.
*   **Stress-Test Scenarios:** Simulate a sudden increase in "Network" tickets to see how the new system copes compared to the old one.
*   **Build the Business Case:** Present management with quantitative forecasts, such as "Strategy 2 is projected to improve P2 SLA compliance from 78% to 95%."

#### **Post-Implementation Monitoring**

Once a strategy is implemented, process mining becomes a tool for continuous monitoring and improvement, not just a one-time analysis. We will set up live dashboards to track:

*   **Key KPIs:**
    *   **SLA Compliance Rate:** The ultimate measure of success.
    *   **Reassignment Rate:** Should decrease significantly.
    *   **Average Resolution Time:** Tracked by priority and category.
    *   **L1 First Call Resolution Rate:** Should improve as their workload is more focused.
    *   **Resource Utilization:** Monitored to ensure the new system is achieving a balanced workload.
*   **Process Views:**
    *   **Live Process Map:** To visually confirm that the "reassignment spaghetti" is gone and the process flow is cleaner.
    *   **Conformance Dashboard:** To automatically flag deviations from the new, ideal process in real-time.

This continuous feedback loop will allow us to fine-tune the assignment rules, update skill profiles, and ensure that the IT service desk not only resolves its current issues but is also equipped to adapt to future challenges.
