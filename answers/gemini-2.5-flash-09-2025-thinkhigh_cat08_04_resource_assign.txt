## 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

To diagnose TechSolve's issues, the event log data must be transformed into actionable resource profiles and flow networks.

### Performance and Behavior Metrics Focus

| Agent/Tier Focus | Metric                               | Calculation Basis (Log Fields)                                         | Purpose                                                                                                 |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L1 Tier          | **First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate** | (Cases resolved by L1 / Total cases assigned to L1)                   | Measures L1 effectiveness and identifies agents who escalate too often.                                   |
| L1 Tier          | **Escalation Rate by Category/Skill** | (Cases escalated / Total cases handled) grouped by *Ticket Category*   | Pinpoints specific areas where L1 is overwhelmed or lacks training (e.g., high escalation for 'Network'). |
| All Agents       | **Workload Distribution**            | Number of *Case ID* handles or total 'Work Start' duration per *Agent ID* | Identifies overloaded vs. underutilized resources.                                                        |
| All Agents       | **Activity Processing Time**         | Duration between 'Work Start' and 'Work End' per *Activity* and *Agent*  | Measures individual efficiency and identifies agents who introduce unexpected delays.                     |
| L2/L3 Agents     | **Skill Utilization Rate**           | Cases handled where *Agent Skills* matches *Required Skill* / Total cases | Determines if specialists are performing tasks below their documented expertise level.                     |

### Process Mining Techniques for Assignment Analysis

Process mining provides visibility into the *actual* flow, bypassing assumptions about the intended logic (round-robin).

#### A. Resource Interaction Analysis & Social Network Analysis (SNA)
*   **Methodology:** By mapping the sequence of *Agent IDs* associated with a single *Case ID*, we identify handovers, escalations, and reassignments.
*   **Output:** An SNA map where nodes are agents (or tiers) and edges represent the frequency and volume of ticket handoffs.
*   **Insights:**
    *   **"Ping-Pong" Reassignments:** High traffic loops between specific agents or tiers (e.g., L2 Agent B12 sends the ticket back to L1 Dispatcher, who returns it to L2 Agent B15).
    *   **Central Dispatcher Dependency:** High centralization metrics show that all tickets must flow back through a central dispatcher after L1 escalation, indicating a manual assignment bottleneck rather than direct skill-based routing.
    *   **Comparison to Intended Logic:** If the intended logic is round-robin within L1, but the SNA reveals L1 Agent A02 is receiving a disproportionately high volume of P2 Network tickets, the *actual* logic might be preferential self-assignment or manual bias, overriding the round-robin system.

#### B. Role and Skill Discovery
*   **Methodology:** Correlate the *Agent Tier* and documented *Agent Skills* with the complexity metrics (Priority, Required Skill) of the tickets they actually complete.
*   **Insights on Skill Utilization:**
    *   Identify instances where high-value skills (e.g., `Networking-Firewall`, `OS-WindowsServer`) are used to resolve low-priority (P4) tasks or tasks requiring only `Basic-Troubleshoot`. This quantifies the degree of **skill misuse** and helps justify redirecting high-skilled staff.
    *   Identify agents operating outside their defined tier (e.g., L2 agent B12 frequently performing L1 triage activities).

## 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues

By combining flow analysis with resource metrics, we can quantify the impact of resource issues on performance.

### A. Bottlenecks Caused by Skill Availability
*   **Identification:** Filter the log for tickets requiring a specific, specialized skill (e.g., `Database-SQL`). Measure the average time duration between the activity "Escalate L2/L3" and "Work L2/L3 Start" for these filtered tickets.
*   **Quantification:** If P2 tickets requiring `Networking-Firewall` wait an average of 45 minutes in the queue, while P2 tickets requiring `App-CRM` wait 5 minutes, the bottleneck lies specifically in the `Networking-Firewall` skill group availability or capacity.

### B. Delays from Frequent or Unnecessary Reassignments
*   **Identification:** Use the Case ID to isolate all traces containing the activity 'Reassign'.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Reassignment Rate:** Percentage of total tickets requiring $\ge 2$ internal resource changes.
    *   **Average Delay per Reassignment:** Calculate the difference in mean resolution time for the group of tickets with 0 reassignments versus the group with $\ge 1$ reassignment. If a reassignment adds an average of 40 minutes to the total resolution time (due to queue time, ramp-up time for the new agent, and administrative overhead), this delay is a direct cost of poor initial assignment.

### C. Impact of Incorrect Initial Assignments
*   **Identification:** Track tickets where the initial assigned agent's skills did not match the ultimate required skill, resulting in an immediate L1 'Work Start' followed quickly by an 'Escalate' or 'Reassign' action.
*   **Quantification (Skill Mismatch Cost):** Calculate the average time wasted by L1 agents (A05, A02) on tickets that were immediately escalated due to a skill mismatch. This represents non-value-added work for the L1 agent and unnecessary delay for the customer.

### D. Correlation with SLA Breaches
*   **Methodology:** Overlay the SLA target dates onto the process map.
*   **Insight:** Filter all P2 and P3 breached tickets. Use path analysis to discover the dominant sequence (the "bad path") leading to the breach. For example, 60% of P2 breaches might follow the path: *Ticket Created* $\rightarrow$ *Assign L1 (Agent A02)* $\rightarrow$ *Work L1 (30 minutes)* $\rightarrow$ *Escalate L2* $\rightarrow$ *Queue (2 hours)* $\rightarrow$ *Work L2 Start*. This proves that the *queue time* in the L2 pool, triggered by an L1 agent who lacked the ability to triage or resolve, is the primary driver of the breach.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies

Root cause analysis relies on *Decision Mining* and *Variant Analysis* to understand why poor assignments occur.

### A. Decision Mining for Assignment Rules
*   **Application:** Apply decision mining algorithms to the activities 'Assign L1', 'Escalate L2', and 'Reassign'.
*   **Input Data:** *Ticket Priority, Ticket Category, Initial Required Skill, Agent Tier, Agent Skills.*
*   **Output Insight:** The algorithm uncovers the actual decision rules being applied by agents or the dispatcher system.
    *   **Example 1 (Deficient Assignment Rules):** Decision mining might show that for 80% of cases, the rule is simply "Assign next available L1 agent (Round-Robin)," regardless of the *Required Skill* attribute, explaining why complex P2 Network tickets land on L1 Agent A05 who only has `Basic-Troubleshoot` skills.
    *   **Example 2 (L1 Over-Escalation):** The rules generated may show that L1 agents escalate P3 tickets if the *Required Skill* is *anything other than* `Basic-Troubleshoot`, indicating L1 is not empowered or trained to handle marginally complex tickets they potentially could resolve.

### B. Variant Analysis for Identifying Poor Triage
*   **Application:** Compare the traces of the best-performing tickets (FCR by L1, fast resolution) against the worst-performing variants (multiple reassignments, SLA breach).
*   **Root Cause Identification:**
    *   **Poor Initial Ticket Categorization:** If the breached variants often share an initial low-priority *Ticket Category* (e.g., initially logged as P4 Access, but escalated to P2 Security), it suggests L1 or the web portal failed to accurately identify the complexity or skill needed early on.
    *   **Inaccurate Skill Profiles:** If Agent B12 frequently reassigns tickets requiring `Database-SQL` even though their profile lists `DB-SQL`, it suggests their documented skill level is inaccurate or outdated, leading to forced handoffs.

### Potential Root Causes Summary
1.  **Deficiencies in Assignment Rules:** The current logic (round-robin + manual escalation) is naive and ignores critical inputs like *Required Skill* and current *Agent Workload*.
2.  **Poor Skill Identification:** Lack of robust natural language processing (NLP) on the initial ticket description, leading to inaccurate setting of the *Required Skill* attribute, causing misrouting.
3.  **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:** The dispatcher/system assigns based purely on availability, without visibility into the agent's current queue size or tickets nearing SLA breach.
4.  **Insufficient L1 Empowerment/Training:** L1 agents are forced to spend valuable time attempting to resolve tickets that historical data (variant analysis) shows are highly unlikely to be resolved at their level, wasting time before the inevitable escalation.

## 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies

Based on the quantified inefficiencies, three specific strategies are proposed.

### Strategy 1: Skill and Priority-Based Precision Routing

| Aspect | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Issue Addressed** | Skill mismatch, unnecessary L1 touch points, and frequent reassignments (INC-1002 flow). |
| **Leveraged Insights** | Decision mining identifies complex P2/P3 categories (e.g., Network, Security) that historically have an FCR rate of $<5\%$ in L1. Resource analysis quantifies the time wasted by L1 on these quick escalations. |
| **Strategy** | Implement **Multi-Dimensional Skill Routing**. Tickets flagged with high priority (P1/P2) AND specific high-level required skills (e.g., `Networking-Firewall`, `Security-IAM`) are automatically routed directly to the specialized L2/L3 skill pool queue, bypassing L1 triage entirely. The routing considers a weighted skill proficiency score (if available) to select the most capable agent within that pool. |
| **Data Required** | Highly validated Agent Skill Matrix (including proficiency level: Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) and real-time skill group queue status. |
| **Expected Benefits** | Significant reduction in L1 time spent on impossible tasks; faster time-to-specialist; reduction in reassignments by targeting the correct resource immediately. |

### Strategy 2: Dynamic Workload and SLA-Aware Balancing

| Aspect | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Issue Addressed** | Uneven workload distribution and delays caused by agents being overloaded while others are idle (bottlenecks in L2/L3). |
| **Leveraged Insights** | Workload distribution metrics show specific L2 agents consistently operate at 90%+ utilization, while others are at 50%. Correlation analysis highlights breaches linked to long queue times in overloaded skill groups. |
| **Strategy** | Develop a **Dynamic Workload Manager**. The system assigns the ticket not to the *next available agent* (pure round-robin), but to the *most available agent* possessing the required skills. Availability is calculated based on current active case count, total active duration (WIP), and predictive modeling of remaining work time for current tasks. Pushing tickets nearing their SLA deadline must be prioritized, potentially overriding the workload balance rule temporarily. |
| **Data Required** | Real-time agent status (Active, Idle, Break), current queue lengths per agent, and remaining time until SLA breach for all tickets. |
| **Expected Benefits** | Smoother workload distribution; reduction in queue times for high-priority tickets; direct mitigation of SLA breaches caused by resource unavailability. |

### Strategy 3: Predictive Triage and L1 Refinement

| Aspect | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Issue Addressed** | Wasteful L1 time on tickets destined for escalation; insufficient L1 resolution rate. |
| **Leveraged Insights** | Variant analysis shows clear patterns for tickets that L1 successfully resolves (e.g., P3/P4 Access Management, specific software restarts). Conversely, decision mining identifies characteristics of tickets that almost always lead to multi-step reassignments. |
| **Strategy** | **Refine L1 Triage Boundaries.**
    1.  **Empowerment:** Formally define the subset of tickets (by category/priority/skill) that L1 *must* handle (e.g., if FCR rate > 90% historically). Train and monitor L1 agents to eliminate escalation for these types.
    2.  **Predictive Routing:** Use machine learning, trained on the event log (ticket description keywords, category, required skill), to assign a "complexity score" at creation. If the score is above a threshold, the ticket is routed directly to L2 (Strategy 1). If below, it is routed to the empowered L1 pool. |
| **Data Required** | Historical success/failure rate of L1 by specific keyword or problem description; L1 agent training certification data. |
| **Expected Benefits** | Increased L1 FCR rate, freeing up L2/L3 specialists for complex work, and reducing the total number of agents touching a ticket. |

## 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring

### Simulation and Evaluation

Business Process Simulation (BPS) is crucial to test the effectiveness of the proposed strategies without disrupting live operations.

1.  **Model Creation:** Use the discovered process map (the AS-IS model) as the foundation. Resource profiles (based on mined average processing times, resource availability, and agent skills) are added to the model.
2.  **Scenario Definition (TO-BE Models):** Create digital twins incorporating the new assignment rules:
    *   *Scenario A:* Implementing Strategy 1 (Direct Skill Routing for P2/P3).
    *   *Scenario B:* Implementing Strategy 2 (Dynamic Workload Balancing).
    *   *Scenario C:* Implementing a combined approach.
3.  **Execution:** Run the simulation using historical workload data (e.g., the last year's ticket volume and pattern).
4.  **Evaluation:** Compare the outcomes of the TO-BE models against the current AS-IS performance baseline across critical KPIs:
    *   Predicted SLA compliance rate for P2/P3.
    *   Average time spent in L2/L3 queues.
    *   Average number of reassignments per ticket.
    *   Agent utilization rates (confirming Strategy 2 addresses imbalances).
    *   This ensures the new logic does not inadvertently create new bottlenecks (e.g., by overloading a different skill pool).

### Monitoring the Effectiveness Post-Implementation

After implementing the optimized assignment strategies, continuous process mining dashboards are necessary to track results and detect potential process drift.

#### Key Resource-Related KPIs to Track:

| KPI Category | Specific KPI | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Efficiency** | **Reassignment Rate Reduction** | Measures success of Strategies 1 & 3. Target: $\ge 50\%$ reduction in tickets with $>1$ reassignment. |
| **Quality** | **L1 FCR Rate (by Category)** | Monitors L1 empowerment success (Strategy 3). Should see FCR rise in targeted categories. |
| **Workload** | **Standard Deviation of Agent Utilization** | Measures success of Strategy 2. A lower standard deviation indicates a more balanced workload across the pool. |
| **Flow/Speed** | **Average Time to Specialist** | Measures the duration between *Ticket Creation* and *Work Start L2/L3*. Should decrease due to direct routing (Strategy 1). |
| **Compliance** | **SLA Compliance Rate (P2/P3)** | The ultimate business measure. Must show sustained improvement, confirming the resource changes solved the throughput issues. |

#### Process Views for Continuous Tracking:

*   **Conformance Checking:** Continuously compare the live process flow against the new, optimized target model (the TO-BE model from the simulation). Any deviations (e.g., L1 still handling P2 Network tickets) indicate non-conformance that requires immediate administrative correction or training.
*   **Case Duration Analysis (Filtering):** A real-time dashboard showing the duration of cases filtered by the *Agent Tier/Skill* currently handling them, highlighting where current backlogs are forming and enabling dynamic reallocation decisions by management.
*   **SNA Over Time:** Track the SNA map weekly. A reduction in the complexity and density of the network connections (fewer loops and handoffs) confirms the new skill-based routing is working effectively.
