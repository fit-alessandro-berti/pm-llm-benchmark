Okay, I need to create a BPMN-like textual process model based on the interviews provided. Let me start by reading through each interview carefully to extract the necessary information.

First, Interview 1 with Mary from Accounts Payable. She describes the initial steps: receiving the invoice, checking for a valid PO. If no PO, send back to supplier. If there's a PO, log it into the system. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of goods/services received. Once confirmed, match invoice line items with PO. If they match, send to manager for approval. If discrepancies, clarify with purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor (Rita). After resolution and approval, schedule payment.

Interview 2 with Dan. He mentions receiving the invoice from AP, checking PO details (quantities, prices, delivery charges). If discrepancies, contact supplier or ask AP to hold. If PO missing, tell Mary to get it. Once confirmed, send confirmation email to AP. Then manager approval. After that, AP schedules payment.

Interview 3 with Carlos. He gets notified after PO match and confirmation. System shows him the details. If okay, approve; if issues, reject or hold. Once approved, AP adds to payment cycle.

Interview 4 with Rita, the supervisor. She handles exceptions: when Mary can't match, or Purchasing has issues. She contacts suppliers or creates retrospective POs. Once resolved, back to normal flow: purchasing confirmation, manager approval, payment.

Interview 5 with Karen, Supplier Relationship Manager. She helps resolve discrepancies by contacting suppliers for missing POs or pricing issues but doesn't handle approvals directly.

Now, I need to structure this into BPMN elements: tasks, gateways, sequence flows, roles, artifacts, exceptions.

Starting with the main flow:

1. Receive Invoice (Mary) - artifact: invoice received via email.
2. Check for PO (Mary) - gateway: PO exists?
   - No: Send back to Supplier (Mary), then loop back to Receive Invoice.
   - Yes: Log Invoice into system (Mary)
3. Forward to Purchasing for confirmation (Mary  Dan)
4. Confirm Goods Received (Dan) - compare details. Gateway: discrepancies?
   - Yes: Clarify with AP (Dan emails Mary)
      - If can't resolve: Escalate to Supervisor (Rita)
   - No: Proceed to Match Invoice to PO (Mary)
5. Match Invoice to PO (Mary) - gateway: match?
   - No: Clarify with Purchasing (loop back to Dan)
      - Dan might contact Supplier (Karen) if needed.
   - Yes: Send to Manager Approval (Mary  Carlos)
6. Manager Approval (Carlos) - gateway: approve?
   - No: Reject, Hold for investigation (Mary)
   - Yes: Schedule Payment (Mary)

Exceptions:
- Escalation to Rita for unresolved issues.
- Karen assists in resolving discrepancies but isn't part of the main flow.
- Retrospective PO creation if needed (Rita works with department heads).

Roles involved: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen), Supplier.

Artifacts: Invoice, PO, Confirmation Email, Revised Invoice, Payment Schedule.

Gateways: Checking PO presence, discrepancies in Purchasing, matching invoice to PO, Manager Approval.

Now, putting this into a textual BPMN structure with tasks, flows, gateways, roles, and exceptions.

Need to note where there might be variations. For example, Mary mentioned sometimes discrepancies lead to escalation, Dan mentioned holding invoices, Carlos can reject. Rita handles exceptions which might loop back into the process.

Also, the system sends automatic emails for manager approval. So the trigger for Manager Approval is after matching and confirmation.

I should structure the main steps in order, include exclusive gateways for decisions, and note the exception paths.

Make sure to mention all roles and how they interact. Also, clarify when Karen is involved in resolving issues but not part of the system steps.

Possible structure:

Start Event: Invoice Received

Process:

- Receive Invoice (Mary)
- Check PO Existence (Gateway)
   - No PO: Send Back to Supplier, loop back
   - Yes: Log Invoice
- Forward to Purchasing (Dan)
- Confirm Goods Receipt (Dan)
   - Gateway: Discrepancies?
      - Yes: Clarify with AP; if unresolved, Escalate to Rita
      - No: Proceed
- Match Invoice to PO (Mary)
   - Gateway: Match Success?
      - No: Clarify with Purchasing (Dan may contact Karen)
      - Yes: Send for Approval
- Manager Approval (Carlos)
   - Reject: Hold, Investigate (Mary)
   - Approve: Schedule Payment

Exception handling paths for escalation to Rita, involving Karen in resolving discrepancies.

Need to note that after Rita resolves, the invoice goes back to normal flow.

Also, note that if Manager rejects, it's held for investigation, but how does it proceed from there? Maybe loop back to clarification steps.

Also, Dan might ask for a revised invoice from supplier, which would require Mary to receive the revised invoice and continue the process.

I think the textual model should list each task, who does it, the sequence flows, gateways with conditions, and exceptions.

Let me try to outline this step by step.

**Textual BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

---

### **Start Event**  
- **Invoice Received** (Trigger: Supplier submits invoice via email)  

---

### **Main Flow**  

1. **Receive Invoice**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Input:** Invoice (email attachment)  
   - **Next:** Check PO Existence  

2. **Check PO Existence** *(Exclusive Gateway)*  
   - **Condition:** Does the invoice include a valid Purchase Order (PO) number?  
     - **No:**  
       - **Send Back to Supplier**  
         - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Action:** Request missing PO details via email  
         - **Next:** Loop back to *Receive Invoice*  
     - **Yes:**  
       - **Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
         - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Output:** Logged invoice record  
         - **Next:** Forward to Purchasing Department  

3. **Forward to Purchasing Department**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Recipient:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Input:** Invoice + PO reference  
   - **Next:** Confirm Goods/Services Received  

4. **Confirm Goods/Services Received**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  
   - **Action:** Compare invoice details (quantities, prices, delivery charges) with PO  
   - **Outputs:** Confirmation email (if valid) or discrepancy notes  
   - **Next:** Check for Discrepancies *(Exclusive Gateway)*  

5. **Check for Discrepancies** *(Exclusive Gateway)*  
   - **Condition:** Are invoice and PO details aligned?  
     - **Yes:**  
       - **Proceed to Invoice Matching**  
         - **Next:** Match Invoice to PO  
     - **No:**  
       - **Clarify Discrepancy with Accounts Payable**  
         - **Role:** Purchasing Officer (Dan)  Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Possible Actions:**  
           - Contact Supplier *(via Supplier Relationship Manager Karen)* for revised invoice  
           - Hold invoice pending resolution  
         - **Escalation Path:**  
           - **Unresolved Discrepancy:** Escalate to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)  
             - **Role:** Resolve exceptions (e.g., create retrospective PO, reject invoice)  
             - **Next:** Re-enter process at *Forward to Purchasing Department*  

6. **Match Invoice to PO**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
   - **Action:** Validate line items in accounting system  
   - **Next:** Check Match Success *(Exclusive Gateway)*  

7. **Check Match Success** *(Exclusive Gateway)*  
   - **Condition:** Do invoice line items match PO?  
     - **No:**  
       - **Clarify with Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
         - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Next:** Re-enter at *Confirm Goods/Services Received*  
     - **Yes:**  
       - **Send for Manager Approval**  
         - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Recipient:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
         - **Trigger:** System-generated approval request email  
         - **Next:** Manager Approval Decision  

8. **Manager Approval Decision** *(Exclusive Gateway)*  
   - **Condition:** Does the manager approve the invoice?  
     - **Yes:**  
       - **Schedule Payment**  
         - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Output:** Payment added to next payment cycle  
         - **End Event**  
     - **No:**  
       - **Reject/Hold Invoice**  
         - **Role:** Department Manager (Carlos)  
         - **Action:** Flag for investigation by Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)  
         - **Next:** Investigate Issues *(Exception Path)*  

---

### **Exception Paths**  

- **Escalation to Supervisor:**  
  - **Trigger:** Unresolved discrepancies at steps *Clarify Discrepancy* or *Clarify with Purchasing*  
  - **Action:** Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) coordinates with departments/suppliers  
  - **Resolution:** Re-entry into process at *Forward to Purchasing Department*  

- **Supplier Involvement via Karen:**  
  - **Trigger:** Missing PO or pricing disputes  
  - **Action:** Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) contacts supplier for corrections  
  - **Output:** Revised invoice or updated PO terms  

- **Manager Rejection:**  
  - **Trigger:** Suspicious invoice details (e.g., budget mismatches)  
  - **Action:** Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) investigates and resolves before re-submitting  

---

### **Roles/Participants**  
1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**  
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**  
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**  
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**  
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**  
6. **Supplier**  

---

### **Artifacts/Data Objects**  
- Invoice (email)  
- Purchase Order (PO)  
- Confirmation Email  
- Revised Invoice (if needed)  
- Payment Schedule  

---

### **Key Notes**  
- **Automation:** System auto-generates approval requests for managers.  
- **Ambiguity:** The exact path after *Manager Rejection* is inferred as investigation + loopback.  
- **Variation:** Some discrepancies may require direct supplier contact without escalation to Rita.
