The diagram illustrates a process flow for handling a registration request, structured as a Petri net. It begins with the 'register request' task (a) and branches into three possible examination paths: thorough examination (b), casual examination (c), and ticket checking (d). Each path leads to a decision point (e), where the request is either accepted or rejected. If accepted, the process moves to paying compensation (g) and ends (z); if rejected, it leads to rejecting the request (h) and then ends. The diagram also includes a loop where the ticket checking path (d) can lead to reinitiating the request (f) if necessary. The lower section of the diagram explains different types of splits and joins: XOR-split and join, AND-split and join, and OR-split and join, which are used to represent different logical flows and decision points within the process. The overall concept conveyed is the structured and flexible handling of a registration request, accommodating various examination methods and decision outcomes, ensuring thorough and efficient processing.
