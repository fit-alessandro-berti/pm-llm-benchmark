### Matching approach (tolerance ±2 seconds, same `order_id`)
I treated **Log A** as the primary timeline (its timestamp becomes `timestamp_primary`) and attempted to match each A event to a B event with:
- same `order_id`
- timestamp difference  2 seconds
- semantically equivalent event name (naming normalization)

**Name mappings used**
- `Order Received`  `OrderReceived`
- `Order Validated`  `OrderValidation`
- `Payment Processed`  `PaymentCheck` (same business step; B note indicates gateway delay)
- `Item Shipped`  `Shipping`
- No B equivalent for `Item Delivered`
- No A equivalent for `Quality Check`

**Matches found**
- 10:00:00Z (A Order Received) matched to 09:59:58Z (B OrderReceived)  2s difference, merged
- 10:01:30Z (A Order Validated) matched to 10:01:29Z (B OrderValidation)  1s difference, merged
- 10:02:00Z (A Payment Processed) did **not** match to 10:02:05Z (B PaymentCheck)  5s difference exceeds tolerance, kept separate
- 10:05:00Z (A Item Shipped) matched to 10:05:02Z (B Shipping)  2s difference, merged
- 10:20:00Z (A Item Delivered) has no B match  kept (A-only)
- 10:03:00Z (B Quality Check) has no A match  kept (B-only)

**Conflict handling**
- For merged events, I kept **both timestamps** (`timestamp_A`, `timestamp_B`) and used Log A’s as `timestamp_primary`.
- For unmatched events, I preserved the original timestamp and marked `origin`.

If you want, I can also output this as a flat CSV table (one row per merged record) or adjust the matching to allow a wider tolerance for the payment step (e.g., 10 seconds) and merge `Payment Processed` with `PaymentCheck`.
