Below is a transformed event log in a tabular format. Each row represents a single event with the following columns: 

- **Case ID**: A unique identifier for the "case" (logical work unit).
- **Activity Name**: A standardized, meaningful description of the activity performed.
- **Timestamp**: Original timestamp from the system log.
- **Document/Context** (optional): The artifact or context associated with this event (e.g., filename or application window).
- **Application** (optional): The application in which the event occurred.

**Event Log:**

**Explanation of Case and Activity Naming Logic:**

- **Case Identification:**  
  Each case represents a logical work unit centered around a single artifact (document, email, PDF, spreadsheet) that the user interacted with.  
  - **Q1 (Quarterly_Report.docx):** From the first focus on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50 until it was eventually closed at 09:08:15.  
  - **D1 (Document1.docx):** From opening Document1.docx at 09:00:00 until its close at 09:07:00, encompassing all typing and saving events, even if the user temporarily switched to other applications.  
  - **E1 (Email - Inbox):** The work on the email inbox and a specific email message from when the user switched to Google Chrome (09:01:45) until switching away to Adobe Acrobat (09:04:00).  
  - **PDF1 (Report_Draft.pdf):** The PDF review session started when focus switched to Adobe Acrobat at 09:04:00 and ended at 09:05:00 when the user moved on to Excel.  
  - **B1 (Budget_2024.xlsx):** The Excel editing session from opening at 09:05:00 to switching away at 09:06:00.

- **Activity Naming:**  
  Low-level system actions were mapped to more meaningful, process-oriented names:  
  - **FOCUS/SWITCH (first time on an artifact):** "Open Document," "Open Email Inbox," "Open PDF," or "Open Spreadsheet." Subsequent returns to the same artifact without it being closed are labeled as "Refocus Document."  
  - **TYPING:** Became "Edit Document" or "Compose Email" or "Edit Spreadsheet" depending on the artifact.  
  - **SAVE:** "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."  
  - **CLICK Actions in Email:** "Open Email," "Reply to Email," "Send Email."  
  - **SCROLL:** "Scroll Email" or "Scroll PDF" to represent reading/reviewing.  
  - **HIGHLIGHT in PDF:** "Highlight PDF Content."  
  - **CLOSE:** "Close Document."

This approach groups related events into coherent cases representing complete work sessions on particular documents or communications. The resulting event log is suitable for process mining analysis, as it clearly defines distinct cases (process instances), activities (event steps), and timestamps.
