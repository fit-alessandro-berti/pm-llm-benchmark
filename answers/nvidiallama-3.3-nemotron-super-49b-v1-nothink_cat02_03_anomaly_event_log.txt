**Anomaly Analysis Report for Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log**

### **Identified Anomalies**

| **Case ID** | **Anomalous Sequence** | **Reason for Anomaly** | **Potential Problem** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1002** | Issue PO before Approving PR | Out of standard sequence (PR Creation -> Approval -> PO Issuance) | **Risk of Unauthorized Purchasing**. PO issued without approved PR, potentially leading to non-compliant or unauthorized purchases. |
| **1003** | Release Payment before Receiving Goods & Vendor Invoice | Payment released without confirmation of goods receipt or invoice receipt | **Financial Risk**. Payment made without verification of goods delivery or invoice accuracy, risking overpayment or payment for undelivered goods. |
| **1004** | Receive Goods before Issuing Purchase Order | Goods received without a preceding PO | **Contractual and Inventory Risk**. Receiving goods without a PO might imply no formal agreement, potentially leading to inventory discrepancies or legal issues. |

### **Detailed Explanation of Anomalies**

#### 1. **Case ID 1002: Issue PO before Approving PR**

* **Anomalous Sequence**: `Create Purchase Requisition` -> `Issue Purchase Order` -> `Approve Purchase Requisition` (out of order)
* **Reason for Anomaly**: In standard P2P processes, a Purchase Requisition (PR) must be approved before a Purchase Order (PO) can be issued to ensure that the purchase is authorized and aligned with budgetary and policy requirements.
* **Potential Problem**: 
  * **Risk of Unauthorized Purchasing**: The PO was issued without an approved PR, which could lead to purchases not aligned with organizational needs or budget, potentially violating procurement policies.
  * **Lack of Transparency and Control**: Bypassing approval steps can make it harder to track and manage procurement activities centrally.

#### 2. **Case ID 1003: Release Payment before Receiving Goods & Vendor Invoice**

* **Anomalous Sequence**: `Release Payment` occurs before `Receive Goods` and `Vendor Invoice Received`
* **Reason for Anomaly**: Standard practice dictates that payment should be released after goods are received (to ensure delivery) and after the vendor's invoice is received and matched to the PO (to ensure accuracy of the amount paid).
* **Potential Problem**:
  * **Financial Risk**: Payment without confirmation of goods receipt risks paying for undelivered or defective goods. Paying before invoice receipt might lead to overpayment if the invoice amount differs from the PO.
  * **Difficulty in Dispute Resolution**: Without a received invoice or goods, resolving any payment discrepancies with the vendor becomes more challenging.

#### 3. **Case ID 1004: Receive Goods before Issuing Purchase Order**

* **Anomalous Sequence**: `Receive Goods` before `Issue Purchase Order`
* **Reason for Anomaly**: Goods should not be received without a preceding PO, as the PO serves as a contractual agreement for the purchase.
* **Potential Problem**:
  * **Contractual Risk**: Receiving goods without a PO might imply no formal contractual agreement, leading to uncertainties in terms, pricing, or delivery obligations.
  * **Inventory Management Issues**: Unordered goods can disrupt inventory management, causing stock discrepancies or unnecessary storage costs.

### **Recommendations for Correction and Prevention**

| **Anomaly** | **Corrective Action** | **Preventive Measures** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1002** | Revalidate PR Approval post-hoc if possible | Enforce workflow rules in the procurement system to mandate PR approval before PO issuance. |
| **1003** | Verify goods receipt and invoice before re-processing payment if necessary | Implement system checks to only allow payment release after goods receipt and invoice matching. |
| **1004** | Investigate goods source, ensure retroactive PO if applicable | Train personnel on the importance of POs before goods acceptance. Configure the system to alert on receipts without a matching PO. |
