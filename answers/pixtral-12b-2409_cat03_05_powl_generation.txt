Certainly! A hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process can include several steps such as "Create Purchase Requisition", "Approve Purchase Requisition", "Create Purchase Order", "Receive Goods", "Invoice Processing", and "Payment".

Here's an example of how to implement this P2P process using POWL in pm4py:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
create_requisition = Transition(label="Create Purchase Requisition")
approve_requisition = Transition(label="Approve Purchase Requisition")
create_po = Transition(label="Create Purchase Order")
receive_goods = Transition(label="Receive Goods")
invoice_processing = Transition(label="Invoice Processing")
payment = Transition(label="Payment")
skip = SilentTransition()

# Define choice between receiving goods and invoice processing
receiving_or_invoicing = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[receive_goods, invoice_processing])

# Define a loop between receiving goods and invoice processing
loop_receiving_invoicing = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[receive_goods, invoice_processing])

# Define the main workflow using strict partial order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    create_requisition,
    approve_requisition,
    create_po,
    loop_receiving_invoicing,
    payment
])

# Set the execution order
root.order.add_edge(create_requisition, approve_requisition)
root.order.add_edge(approve_requisition, create_po)
root.order.add_edge(create_po, loop_receiving_invoicing)
root.order.add_edge(loop_receiving_invoicing, payment)

# Display the POWL model
print(root)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Define Activities**: Each step in the P2P process is represented by a `Transition` object.
2. **Choice Structure**: The choice between "Receive Goods" and "Invoice Processing" is represented using an `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`.
3. **Loop Structure**: A loop between "Receive Goods" and "Invoice Processing" is represented using an `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`.
4. **Strict Partial Order**: The main workflow is defined using a `StrictPartialOrder`, and the execution order of the activities is set using the `add_edge` method.

This code constructs a POWL model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process, capturing the essential steps and their dependencies.
