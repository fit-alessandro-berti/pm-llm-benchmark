To produce a single, integrated event log, we need to parse both logs, define matching criteria based on `order_id`, event semantics, and timestamp proximity, and then combine attributes from matched events while retaining unique events.

### Reasoning for Merging and Handling Events:

**1. Timestamp Parsing and Tolerance:**
   - All timestamps were parsed into Python `datetime` objects for accurate comparison.
   - A timestamp tolerance of `2 seconds` (`timedelta(seconds=2)`) was applied for matching events. This means if an event in Log A occurred at T, and a corresponding event in Log B occurred at T ± 2 seconds, they were considered a match. This interpretation addresses the ambiguity of "less than 2 seconds" by allowing differences *up to and including* 2 seconds, which aligns with common "within X seconds" interpretations and allows matching the first two pairs in the example logs.

**2. Event Name Normalization & Mapping:**
   - A `event_type_mapping` dictionary was established to normalize varying event names between Log A and Log B into a single, consistent `event_name` for the merged log.
     - `Order Received` (Log A) / `OrderReceived` (Log B) -> `Order Received`
     - `Order Validated` (Log A) / `OrderValidation` (Log B) -> `Order Validated`
     - `Payment Processed` (Log A) / `PaymentCheck` (Log B) -> `Payment Processed` (identified as semantically equivalent despite different terms)
     - `Item Shipped` (Log A) / `Shipping` (Log B) -> `Item Shipped`
   - Events unique to one log (`Item Delivered` from Log A, `Quality Check` from Log B) were kept with their original (or closest normalized) names.

**3. Matching Strategy:**
   - The process iterates through each event in **Log A** first, as it's designated the "primary timeline".
   - For each Log A event, it attempts to find a matching event in **Log B** based on three criteria:
     a.  **Matching `order_id`**: Both events must refer to the same order.
     b.  **Normalized Event Name Match**: The normalized event types/names must be the same (e.g., `Order Received` from Log A matches `OrderReceived` from Log B).
     c.  **Timestamp Proximity**: The absolute difference between their timestamps must be within the 2-second tolerance (`<= 2 seconds`).
   - If a match is found, the Log B event is marked as 'matched' to prevent it from being merged again or added as a standalone event later.

**4. Attribute Merging and Conflict Resolution:**
   - **`timestamp`**: For merged events, the timestamp from Log A is used as the primary `timestamp` in the final log, as Log A is designated as the "primary timeline". The original timestamps from both logs (`timestamp_A`, `timestamp_B`) are preserved as separate attributes for auditing or detailed analysis.
   - **`event_name`**: A single, standardized `event_name` field is used. The original names from both logs (`original_name_A`, `original_name_B`) are kept for context.
   - **`order_id`**: Common to both, directly carried over.
   - **Enrichment from Log B**: Attributes unique to Log B (`user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`) are added to the merged event record if available. If an event is only from Log A, these fields will be `None`.

**5. Handling Non-Overlapping Events:**
   - **Log A Events without Log B Match**: If a Log A event (e.g., `Item Delivered`) does not find a suitable match in Log B, it is included in the final log as a standalone event, with its `origin` explicitly marked as `Log A`.
   - **Log B Events without Log A Match**: After processing all Log A events, any remaining Log B events that were not part of a merge (e.g., `Quality Check`) are added to the final log as standalone events, with their `origin` explicitly marked as `Log B`.

**6. Final Output Ordering:**
   - The final integrated log is sorted chronologically based on the chosen primary `timestamp` (Log A's for merged/Log A-only events, Log B's for Log B-only events).
