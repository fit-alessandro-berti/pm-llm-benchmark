# **Enhancing Precision Parts Inc.’s Scheduling with Data-Driven Process Mining**

## 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

### Process Mining Framework Application
To understand the current operational dynamics at Precision Parts Inc., we'll employ process mining on the MES event logs to reconstruct the actual execution of jobs and tasks, revealing hidden performance dynamics.

**Process Mining Steps:**
- **Event Log Analysis:** We’ll first import the detailed event log into a process mining tool (e.g., Celonis, AnyLogic). This involves mapping events such as job release, task initiation/termination, machine usage changes, breakdowns, priority adjustments, and disruptions.
  
- **Workflow Reconstruction:** The system will generate a visual workflow diagram illustrating how jobs move through the shop floor, highlighting where tasks are queued or delayed. Nodes representing each resource (machine ID) and operators help in pinpointing bottlenecks.

**Key Process Mining Metrics:**
1. **Job Flow Times & Lead Times Distribution:** Calculate cumulative distribution functions to understand typical job completion times, revealing variability and outliers.
2. **Task Waiting Times:** Compute average waiting time per machine by tracking the interval between task entry into a queue and its start. This will reveal machines causing high queues (WIP accumulation).
3. **Resource Utilization Metrics:**
   - **Productive vs. Idle Time:** Use process mining to differentiate actual active operation from idle periods due to unavailability or waiting for setups.
   - **Setup Time Attribution:** Apply sequence analysis techniques to quantify setup durations based on preceding job characteristics, allowing identification of patterns in task sequencing that affect total setup times.
4. **Schedule Adherence & Tardiness Metrics:**
   - **Deviation Measurement:** Calculate the percentage and magnitude of jobs completed after their due dates, segmented by priority levels (e.g., medium vs. high).
   - **Tardiness Frequency Analysis:** Use time-series analysis on tardiness rates to detect if specific times of day or machine sequences correlate with delays.
5. **Impact of Disruptions:**
   - **Breakdown and Priority Change Logs:** Analyze the frequency and duration of interruptions (e.g., machine breakdowns) and their downstream effects on job schedules using process interruption analysis.

### Diagnosis of Scheduling Pathologies
Using insights from the performance analysis, we pinpoint specific inefficiencies:

- **Bottleneck Identification:** Process mining reveals machines with prolonged idle times or high queue lengths. For instance, CUT-01 may show consistent delays due to frequent setup changes tied to JOB-7001’s sequence-dependent setups.
- **Poor Task Prioritization:**
  - Analyze the scheduling order of tasks using the “variant analysis” technique, comparing jobs completed on-time with those tardy. This highlights whether lower-priority jobs are consistently delayed by higher-priority but lengthy operations (e.g., JOB-7001’s setup causing CUT-01 starvation).
- **Setup Time Suboptimality:**
  - Sequence dependency analysis uncovers that certain job sequences increase total setup time, especially when unrelated or low-demand tasks precede high-priority ones.
- **Resource Starvation:**
  - Process mining logs show upstream jobs exhausting resources like MILL-03 before downstream machines are free. This causes cascading delays in later workstations (WIP buildup).
- **Bullwhip Effect in WIP Levels:**
  - Variance analysis reveals erratic job arrival patterns causing inventory spikes at various stages, indicating a lack of synchronization between work center capacities and job demands.

### Root Cause Analysis
Process mining provides nuanced insights:

- **Static Dispatching Rules Limitation:** The current rules (FCFS, Earliest Due Date) fail to consider dynamic factors like machine load or task priority. Process mining highlights deviations from these defaults during high-demand periods.
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility:**
  - Machine status and queue lengths are not dynamically reflected in scheduling decisions due to insufficient real-time data capture, leading to suboptimal resource allocation.
- **Inaccurate Duration Estimations:**
  - Historical task duration logs show variance from planned times, especially for high-complexity jobs. This leads to overallocation of resources or underutilization of idle periods.
- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Challenges:**
  - Process mining uncovers that job order impacts setup durations, with specific sequences causing notable increases (e.g., JOB-7001 before JOB-6998).
- **Coordination Gaps:**
  - Disruptions like breakdowns and priority changes expose the need for better communication between work centers. Mining reveals how these events propagate delays throughout the workflow.

### Leveraging Process Mining Differentiation
Process mining helps distinguish issues by:
- **Quantitative vs. Qualitative Differences:** Identifying whether tardiness is due to machine bottleneck (quantitative delay) or suboptimal sequencing (qualitative inefficiency).
- **Factor Attribution:**
  - Correlating job delays with specific resource, scheduling rule applications, and disruption occurrences enables targeted remediation.

## 2. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Enhanced Dispatching Rules
**Core Logic:**
- Implement dynamic dispatch rules incorporating task duration estimates (historical), priority levels, due dates, and downstream machine load.
- Utilize a weighted scoring system to select the next job/task:
  - **Task Duration Score:** Higher weight for shorter tasks with tighter deadlines.
  - **Priority Weighting:** Assign higher scores to high-priority jobs or those approaching their deadline.
  - **Machine Load Factor:** Reduce selection of resources already near capacity by incorporating real-time availability metrics from the event logs.

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Use historical data on task durations and machine load patterns to calibrate weights for dynamic scoring. For instance, CUT-01’s setup times might be adjusted based on past sequence analyses to avoid long delays if JOB-7001 precedes it.
- Address bottlenecks by preferentially scheduling high-priority jobs on underutilized machines (e.g., SHIFTING MILL-03 usage away from peak loads).

**Expected Impact:**
- **Tardiness Reduction:** By aligning high-demand tasks with available resources and avoiding setup chains that cause delays, overall tardiness should decrease significantly.
- **WIP Optimization:** Dynamic dispatch reduces idle periods at resource-constrained machines, lowering WIP levels.

### Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling
**Core Logic:**
- Leverage historical task duration distributions to predict completion times for upcoming tasks. Incorporate predictive maintenance insights where available (e.g., early signs of machine wear).
- Use a lead-time estimation model that factors in:
  - **Task Type Probabilities:** Analyze the frequency and duration of similar tasks based on past job sequences.
  - **Operator Skill Variation:** Adjust task durations based on operator performance metrics captured in the logs.

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Create predictive models using machine learning algorithms trained on historical process mining data (task times, setup patterns) to forecast completion probabilities. This allows proactive rescheduling of downstream tasks before bottlenecks occur.
  
**Expected Impact:**
- **Proactive Bottleneck Avoidance:** By predicting and mitigating potential delays early, lead time variability is reduced.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Predictive models help balance load across machines by anticipating resource saturation.

### Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization
**Core Logic:**
- Implement batch scheduling for similar jobs to minimize sequence-dependent setup times. Use historical analysis of setups to identify optimal orderings that reduce overall lead time.
- Develop a sequencing algorithm based on the log data, optimizing job order at bottleneck machines (e.g., CUT-01 and MILL-03) to eliminate or shorten redundant setups.

**Process Mining Integration:**
- Perform variant analysis comparing jobs completed with minimal setup delays versus those causing significant bottlenecks. This identifies patterns that inform optimal batch sequences.
- Adjust machine precedence rules dynamically, based on real-time feedback from the MES logs (e.g., reassigning a job to MILL-02 if MILL-03 is unavailable).

**Expected Impact:**
- **Setup Time Reduction:** By grouping similar jobs or sequencing them according to historical optimization patterns, setup times can be cut by up to 30%.
- **Resource Utilization Improvement:** Efficient sequencing balances the load across machines, reducing idle periods and WIP accumulation.

## 3. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

### Discrete-Event Simulation Framework
Using the data from process mining:

1. **Simulation Model Setup:**
   - Build a discrete-event model of Precision Parts Inc.’s shop floor using simulation software (e.g., AnyLogic). Parameters are drawn directly from mined data such as task duration distributions, setup patterns, machine availability logs, and disruption events.
   
2. **Scenario Testing:**
   - Simulate scenarios with varying loads (high production vs. low), frequent breakdowns, urgent job arrivals, and different priority configurations to evaluate the impact of each strategy.
   - Compare simulated outcomes against historical performance metrics (e.g., tardiness rates, WIP levels) to quantify improvements.

3. **Key Scenarios for Testing:**
   - **High Load Periods:** Assess how strategies perform under peak demand where resource contention is highest.
   - **Disruption Events Simulation:** Model unexpected breakdowns and priority changes to evaluate robustness against disruptions.
   - **Predictive Accuracy Checks:** Test predictive scheduling’s ability to anticipate delays due to machine wear or operator performance variations.

### Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation Framework
Implement a continuous improvement loop:

1. **KPI Tracking:**
   - Continuously monitor KPIs such as on-time delivery rate, average WIP level, resource utilization (%), and lead time distribution.
   
2. **Process Mining for Drift Detection:**
   - Periodically re-run process mining analyses to detect shifts in the workflow (e.g., new bottlenecks, changes in setup times).
   - Use anomaly detection algorithms to flag deviations from baseline performance patterns, indicating potential areas for strategy adjustment.

3. **Feedback Loop Integration:**
   - Adjust scheduling parameters dynamically based on real-time data and KPI outcomes. For instance, if predictive models consistently overestimate task durations, recalibrate the model using updated historical logs.
   
4. **Adaptive Scheduling Logic Update:**
   - Regularly revise dynamic dispatch rules and optimization algorithms (e.g., reweighting of factors in scheduling logic) based on mining insights to ensure they remain optimal.
