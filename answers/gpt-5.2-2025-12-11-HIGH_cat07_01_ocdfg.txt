The visualization is a multi-variant **process flow map** (directed graph) showing how several business object types move through an order-to-cash / procure-to-pay style process.

- **Starting object types (top)**:  
  *VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)*, *ReturnOrderItem (0.8M)*, *PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M)*, *SalesOrderItem (3.5M)*, and *PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M)* each feed into their own **Start** node.

- **Main activities (boxes)** with volumes shown as **“Overall: X.M”**:
  - Procurement side: **Create Requisition (3.0M)**  **Approve Requisition (5.7M)**  options such as **Send Order (5.2M)**, **Check Stock (1.0M)**, **Approve Payment (1.5M)**, and **Create Invoice (2.0M)**  **End**.
  - Order fulfillment side (right): **Create Order (8.5M)**  **Pack Goods (2.0M)**  **Ship Goods (1.8M)**  **Confirm Delivery (1.7M)**  **Close Order (1.7M)**  **End**.
  - Returns branch: **Process Return (0.8M)** connects into the broader flow (e.g., invoicing/closure paths).

- **Arrows/edges** connect activities and are labeled with **typical transition times in milliseconds** (e.g., 300ms, 400ms, 600ms), indicating the latency/time between steps.

- **Color-coding**: Different colored lines (and small colored dots on activity boxes) indicate which object type(s) or variants contribute to each activity/transition.

Overall, it summarizes **volumes and timing** across multiple interconnected process variants, from creating/approving requisitions and orders through fulfillment, invoicing, returns, and closure.
