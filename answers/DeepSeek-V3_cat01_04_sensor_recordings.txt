### Analysis and Labeling of Activities

Based on the provided event log, I identified distinct patterns in the sensor readings and grouped related events into meaningful manufacturing activities. Below is the labeled process with explanations for each activity:

---

#### **1. Activity: Idle/Standby**
- **Events:** 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Low temperature (20–21°C)
  - Low pressure (1 bar)
  - No vibration (0 Hz)
  - No material flow (0 units/s)
  - Tool position at 0 mm
  - Low energy consumption (0.40–0.50 kWh)
- **Rationale:**
  - The machine is inactive, with minimal energy usage and no significant sensor activity. This suggests the machine is in an idle or standby state.

---

#### **2. Activity: Heating/Preparation**
- **Events:** 4, 5, 6
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature increases sharply (50–58°C)
  - Pressure slightly increases (1–1.5 bar)
  - Vibration rises (30–38 Hz)
  - Material flow starts (5 units/s)
  - Tool position moves slightly (5–10 mm)
  - Energy consumption increases (2.00–3.00 kWh)
- **Rationale:**
  - The rise in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption indicates the machine is heating up or preparing for an operation, such as cutting or welding.

---

#### **3. Activity: Cutting/Welding**
- **Events:** 7, 8
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature stabilizes at a moderate level (40°C)
  - Pressure increases further (2 bar)
  - Vibration drops but remains present (10 Hz)
  - Material flow decreases (2 units/s)
  - Tool position moves to 15 mm
  - Energy consumption remains moderate (2.00 kWh)
- **Rationale:**
  - The combination of moderate temperature, pressure, and vibration, along with tool movement, suggests a cutting or welding operation.

---

#### **4. Activity: High-Energy Operation**
- **Events:** 9
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature spikes sharply (80°C)
  - Pressure remains stable (2 bar)
  - Vibration increases significantly (50 Hz)
  - Material flow stops (0 units/s)
  - Tool position remains at 15 mm
  - Energy consumption peaks (5.00 kWh)
- **Rationale:**
  - The sharp increase in temperature, vibration, and energy consumption indicates a high-energy operation, such as intense welding or a finishing process.

---

#### **5. Activity: Cooling/Reset**
- **Events:** 10, 11, 12
- **Sensor Patterns:**
  - Temperature drops rapidly (30–25°C)
  - Pressure returns to baseline (1 bar)
  - Vibration decreases significantly (1–5 Hz)
  - Material flow resumes at a low rate (0–1 units/s)
  - Tool position moves to 20 mm
  - Energy consumption decreases (1.00–1.60 kWh)
- **Rationale:**
  - The drop in temperature and energy consumption, along with reduced vibration, suggests the machine is cooling down or resetting after a high-energy operation.

|-----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Idle/Standby          | 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 | Low temperature, pressure, vibration, and energy; no material flow or tool movement. |
| Heating/Preparation   | 4, 5, 6      | Rising temperature, vibration, and energy; slight tool movement and material flow.  |
| Cutting/Welding       | 7, 8         | Moderate temperature, pressure, and vibration; tool movement and reduced flow.      |
| High-Energy Operation | 9            | Sharp temperature and vibration spikes; high energy consumption; no material flow.  |
| Cooling/Reset         | 10, 11, 12   | Rapid temperature drop; reduced vibration and energy; slight tool movement.         |

### Explanation of Deduction

1. **Idle/Standby:** The consistent low values across all sensors indicate inactivity.
2. **Heating/Preparation:** The gradual increase in temperature, vibration, and energy suggests the machine is preparing for an operation.
3. **Cutting/Welding:** The moderate sensor values and tool movement align with a cutting or welding process.
4. **High-Energy Operation:** The sharp spikes in temperature, vibration, and energy point to an intense operation.
5. **Cooling/Reset:** The rapid decrease in temperature and energy indicates the machine is cooling down or resetting.
