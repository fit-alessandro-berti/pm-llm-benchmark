Below is a structured, end-to-end approach to analyze Speedy Parcels’ operations with process mining and convert insights into actionable, cost-saving improvements.

1) Process discovery and conformance checking

A) Preprocessing and data integration
- Define cases and levels of analysis
  - Vehicle-day case (end-to-end operational day): Start Shift  Depart Depot  multiple Stop cycles  Return Depot  End Shift.
  - Stop/package case (each delivery attempt): Arrive Customer  Delivery Success/Fail  Depart Customer.
  - Maintenance case: Maintenance Start  Maintenance End (and link to affected vehicle-days).
  - Use object-centric process mining (OC-PM) or maintain two synchronized logs (vehicle-day and stop-level) with keys to link events: VehicleID, DriverID, RouteID, StopID/PackageID, Date.

- Canonical activity model and event harmonization
  - Standardize activity names across systems into a canonical set, e.g., Start Shift, Route Assigned, Depart Depot, Arrive Customer, Delivery Success/Failed, Depart Customer, Unplanned Stop, Refuel, Breakdown Detected, Arrive Depot, End Shift, Maintenance Start/End.
  - Add lifecycle transitions if available (e.g., start/complete) to separate instantaneous vs duration activities.

- Time normalization and ordering
  - Normalize all timestamps to a single timezone; handle DST changes. Correct known device clock skews using identifiable anchors (e.g., depot scans, scheduled maintenance events).
  - Resolve out-of-order events by sequence rules and proximity checks (e.g., Delivery Success must be between Arrive and Depart Customer for the same StopID).

- GPS enrichment and geofencing
  - Build geofences for depot and planned customer coordinates with configurable radii (urban vs suburban).
  - Infer Arrive Customer from vehicle entering stop geofence, Depart Customer from leaving it; tag dwell time between those as service time.
  - Derive travel segments between geofences; compute actual distance, mean speed, idle time (ignition on, speed < 3 km/h outside stop geofences), and traffic delay episodes (sustained speed < X km/h for Y minutes).
  - Detect unplanned stops when prolonged stationary periods occur outside known geofences.

- Plan-to-actual linking
  - Join dispatch plan to actual by RouteID, VehicleID, planned sequence, and spatial-temporal proximity.
  - For multi-package same-address stops, group packages into a stop cluster and link all package scans to the same Arrive/Depart window.

- Data quality handling
  - Deduplication and conflict resolution for duplicate scanner events.
  - Missing events imputation (e.g., Arrive inferred from first scan if GPS gap).
  - Flag uncertain inferences with quality scores; keep raw and cleaned versions.
  - Maintain event lineage to trace every derived field to sources.

Challenges you might encounter
- Clock drift and inconsistent time sources; intermittent scanner offline uploads causing bursts of late events.
- GPS noise and sampling gaps; multiple deliveries at the same location; ambiguous scans not matched to any geofence.
- Re-sequencing during the day (dynamic changes) complicating plan-to-actual alignment.
- Multiple drivers on one vehicle-day (shift handover); vehicles swapped mid-day.
- Maintenance overlap with operational windows; late backfill of maintenance logs.

B) Process discovery
- Discover the actual process with Inductive Miner (with infrequent behavior handling) or Split Miner to obtain a sound, comprehensible model that supports concurrency and loops (e.g., reattempts, refuels).
- Build two complementary maps:
  - Vehicle-day map: shows the macro-flow from Start Shift to End Shift with loops around Stop cycles, including Unplanned Stops, Breakdown, Refuel, and Return Depot.
  - Stop-level map: Arrive  Deliver Success/Fail  Depart; with branches for Fail  Possible Reattempt Later or Return-to-Depot for reschedule.
- Overlay performance metrics (median/percentiles of travel time, service time, idle time) on edges and nodes to visualize slow segments and waiting hotspots.
- Use animation or temporal playbacks to see flow intensity across the day and detect peak-period congestion.

C) Conformance checking against the plan
- Represent the dispatch plan as a reference model per vehicle-day:
  - Sequence of planned stops with allowed time windows, planned travel times, and soft/firm constraints.
  - Turn this into a data-aware Petri net or a linear trace with annotated timing constraints.
- Perform alignment-based conformance checking:
  - Fitness: fraction of actual events that can be matched to the plan.
  - Precision: degree of extraneous, unplanned behavior (e.g., unscheduled stops).
  - Timing conformance: compare actual arrival to planned ETA and customer time windows.
  - Route-sequence conformance: use Kendall-tau or adjacency-break metrics to quantify resequencing; detect skipped, inserted, or repeated stops.
  - Spatial conformance: extra distance ratio = (actual driven km / planned km)  1; detour hotspots.
- Deviations to look for
  - Sequence deviations: high resequencing rate; stop inversions.
  - Activity insertions: Unplanned Stop, Refuel, Breakdown during shift.
  - Timing deviations: significant early/late arrivals vs plan and vs customer windows; prolonged leave-depot delays.
  - Service-time deviations: outliers for customer interaction time; long Arrivefirst-scan lags (parking/search time).
  - Maintenance conformance: vehicles dispatched too close to maintenance windows; unscheduled repairs cutting routes short.

2) Performance analysis and bottleneck identification

A) KPIs and how to calculate them
- On-Time Delivery (OTD) Rate: delivered within the customer time window. OTD = count(Delivery Success with Arrival  [window_start, window_end]) / count(stops with windows).
- Average Time per Delivery Stop: mean(Depart Customer  Arrive Customer).
- Travel vs Service Time Ratio: sum(all travel time) / sum(all service time) per vehicle-day or route.
- Idle Time Share: idle_time_outside_geofences / (travel_time + idle_time_outside_geofences).
- Fuel Consumption per km/per package:
  - If OBD/fuel card data available: liters/km and liters/package.
  - If not: estimate using speed profiles, idle time, and vehicle-specific consumption curves; flag as model-based.
- Vehicle Utilization Rate: (driving + service + planned breaks) / shift length.
- Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays: count and total minutes of low-speed episodes outside stop geofences per route/time-of-day.
- First-Attempt Delivery Success Rate: successful first attempt / total first attempts.
- Failed Delivery Rate and Reattempt Rate: failed / total and proportion reattempted same day.
- Excess Distance vs Plan: actual_km  planned_km, and % difference.
- Overtime Share: routes exceeding planned shift window.
- Maintenance reliability: MTBF (mean time between breakdowns), unscheduled maintenance incidence per 1,000 km, MTTR (mean time to repair).

B) Techniques to find bottlenecks and quantify impact
- Performance overlays on discovered models to identify which transitions accumulate the most delay.
- Dotted charts and timeline views to find morning depot congestion, lunch-time dips, or end-of-day crunch.
- Variant analysis: compare the most frequent execution variants vs slower ones; quantify time deltas and attribute differences (driver, vehicle, region).
- Geospatial heatmaps: map prolonged Arrivefirst-scan times to identify parking-constraint zones; map low-speed corridors to detect chronic congestion.
- Process cube slicing: analyze KPIs by weekday, hour-of-day, region, driver, vehicle type, stop density, and package attributes.
- Statistical modeling:
  - Mixed-effects regression or gradient-boosting models predicting stop cycle time; isolate effects of driver, time-of-day, address density, and vehicle.
  - Segment-level travel time error analysis: planned vs actual by time slices to spot systematic underestimation.
- Quantifying impact:
  - Lost time: sum of minutes above median benchmark for the same stop type/time-of-day.
  - Excess fuel: idle time fuel + detour fuel above baseline.
  - Cost of failed deliveries: extra km, time, fuel, and handling for reattempts.
  - Pareto analysis: top 10 corridors/areas contributing to 80% of delay minutes.

3) Root cause analysis for inefficiencies

Potential root causes and how to validate them with process mining

- Suboptimal route planning and static plans
  - Evidence: high resequencing rates, large excess distance vs plan, uneven workload per route, high end-of-day overtime.
  - Analysis: alignments comparing planned vs executed sequences; simulation of alternative sequences using historical travel/service time distributions.

- Inaccurate travel time estimates
  - Evidence: positive residuals (actual > planned) by corridor and time-of-day; consistent per-area underestimation.
  - Analysis: error heatmaps by hour/segment; update travel-time priors using quantile travel times to reflect variability.

- Traffic congestion patterns not reflected in plan
  - Evidence: recurrent low-speed episodes along certain corridors in specific time windows.
  - Analysis: overlay delay episodes with external traffic APIs/historic speeds; build time-dependent travel time matrices.

- High variability in service time at customer locations
  - Evidence: heavy tails in ArriveDepart duration; large Arrivefirst-scan times indicating parking/elevator/security waits.
  - Analysis: classify stops by building type/zone proxies (if unknown, derive a “stop difficulty index” from historical dwell); quantify required signature effect, apartment vs house proxies from coordinates/land-use data.

- Vehicle breakdowns/maintenance during shifts
  - Evidence: occurrences of Breakdown or Unplanned Stop events; routes truncated; repairs soon after engine warnings.
  - Analysis: hazard models linking warning-light events, mileage since last service, and load to breakdown probability; compute lost minutes and missed stops.

- Driver behavior/skill differences
  - Evidence: persistent driver fixed effects after controlling for route attributes; differences in idling, resequencing, parking search.
  - Analysis: compare top-quartile vs bottom-quartile drivers on normalized KPIs; socialization or mentoring opportunities.

- Failed deliveries (re-delivery burden)
  - Evidence: high failure rates for certain time windows, buildings, or customer segments; misalignment of arrival times and customer presence patterns.
  - Analysis: logistic models for first-attempt success; partial dependence on arrival time, day-of-week; evaluate gains from re-timing or pre-notification.

4) Data-driven optimization strategies

Strategy 1: Dynamic routing and ETA-driven resequencing during the day
- Targeted inefficiency: delays from congestion, static sequences ignoring unfolding conditions, and cascading lateness.
- Root cause: static routing and outdated travel-time estimates.
- Data support: alignment results showing frequent resequencing; corridor/time-of-day delay heatmaps; systematic plan underestimation.
- What to implement:
  - Build an ETA engine using historical speed profiles + real-time traffic; re-estimate stop-level travel and on-time risk every few minutes.
  - Trigger resequencing when predicted lateness probability at future time-windowed stops exceeds a threshold; respect constraints (time windows, driver hours, vehicle capacity).
  - Give drivers in-app dynamic guidance; capture acceptance/compliance in logs for learning.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - OTD +5–12%, travel vs service ratio improvement 3–8%, overtime 10–20%, excess distance 3–6% (typically slight increase or neutral if resequencing is smart).

Strategy 2: Territory and route balancing using a stop difficulty index
- Targeted inefficiency: uneven workload and chronic overtime on certain routes; high service-time variance in dense urban zones.
- Root cause: territory design based on stop counts rather than difficulty and temporal traffic patterns.
- Data support: route-level cycle time distributions; Arrivefirst-scan durations concentrated in inner-city zones; Pareto areas driving most delay minutes.
- What to implement:
  - Compute a per-stop difficulty index from historical service time, parking/search time, signature requirements, floor/elevator proxies, and time-of-day traffic multipliers.
  - Redesign territories and daily route assignments to equalize expected total work time, not just stop counts, with solver constraints (time windows, skills, vehicle types).
  - Pilot twice-weekly dynamic territory balancing for peak days.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - Overtime 20–35% on rebalanced routes; OTD +3–7%; more predictable shift lengths; improved driver satisfaction/attrition reduction.

Strategy 3: Reduce failed deliveries with time-window refinement and proactive customer engagement
- Targeted inefficiency: high re-delivery rates inflating costs and later-day congestion.
- Root cause: misaligned arrival vs customer presence; limited communication.
- Data support: failure hot hours/segments; logistic models showing higher success probabilities at specific times; elevated failure when early/late relative to requested windows.
- What to implement:
  - Offer narrower, data-informed time windows for segments with predictable presence; widen or shift windows for chronic mismatch areas.
  - Proactive notifications with live ETA updates; allow customers to confirm availability, choose safe-drop/neighbor/locker options, or reschedule mid-day.
  - Same-day micro-reattempts: if a failure occurs but later availability predicted, resequence to retry near route’s end if feasible.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - First-attempt success +10–25%; failed deliveries 20–40%; excess km 5–10%; OTD +2–6%.

Strategy 4: Predictive maintenance to prevent in-shift breakdowns
- Targeted inefficiency: unscheduled stops and shortened routes due to breakdowns.
- Root cause: reactive maintenance; warning signals not actioned pre-shift.
- Data support: hazard models linking warning codes, mileage since last service, and load to breakdown risk; conformance showing route interruptions.
- What to implement:
  - Predict risk per vehicle-day; schedule preemptive maintenance for vehicles crossing risk thresholds; adjust vehicle assignments to avoid risky units on long or critical routes.
  - Align scheduled maintenance with low-demand periods; ensure spare vehicle availability for swaps.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - Unscheduled repairs 30–50%; OTD +1–3%; overtime 3–6%; maintenance cost per km stabilized or reduced.

Strategy 5: Targeted driver coaching and idling/parking best practices
- Targeted inefficiency: excessive idle time, long pre-scan parking searches, inconsistent scanning practices.
- Root cause: behavior differences and local knowledge gaps.
- Data support: driver fixed effects in models after controlling for route mix; high idle share and Arrivefirst-scan time for specific drivers/areas.
- What to implement:
  - Personalized scorecards with fair comparisons (normalize for route difficulty); coaching on anti-idling, pre-parking planning, and scanning discipline.
  - Share micro-parking tips per address cluster; create a knowledge base inside the app; gamified goals with safety guardrails.
- Expected KPI impact:
  - Idle share 10–25% for targeted drivers; average stop time 5–10% in affected zones; fuel per km 3–7%.

5) Considering operational constraints and monitoring

A) Accounting for constraints in all strategies
- Driver working hours and breaks: route solver and dynamic resequencing must enforce maximum driving/shift time, mandatory breaks, and overtime limits; use soft penalties for near-violations to steer decisions early.
- Vehicle capacities and special requirements: include weight/volume, temperature control, and ADR constraints; no resequencing that violates capacity or skill certifications.
- Customer time windows and SLAs: treat hard windows as inviolable; soft windows with graded penalties; account for priority customers.
- Safety and compliance: speed limits, idling regulations, and low-emission zones; avoid suggesting routes that breach restrictions.
- Change management: provide drivers with clear, stable instructions; rate-limit dynamic changes and require confirmations for big resequences.

B) Continuous monitoring and control plan
- Dashboards and alerts
  - OTD and lateness minutes by route/day/region; control charts to detect drifts.
  - Travel vs service time ratio and idle share; hotspot maps for parking/search delays.
  - First-attempt success and failure reasons; reattempt costs; customer churn proxies if available.
  - Conformance scores: sequence adherence, excess distance vs plan, unplanned stop rate.
  - Real-time ETA risk and future-late-stop alerts to trigger dynamic resequencing.
  - Maintenance reliability: MTBF, unscheduled maintenance rate; risk flags for tomorrow’s assignments.
  - Cost lens: fuel per km/package, overtime incidence, cost per successful delivery by segment.

- Governance and cadence
  - Weekly ops review: top delay corridors, driver scorecards, failure hotspots, and territory balance KPIs; agree on quick wins and experiments.
  - Monthly continuous improvement: re-train ETA and service-time models; refresh stop difficulty indices; update territory designs for seasonality.
  - A/B tests and pilots:
    - Dynamic routing vs static on matched routes.
    - Territory rebalancing in selected zones.
    - Enhanced notifications for a customer subset.
    - Predictive maintenance thresholds on a subset of vehicles.
  - Success criteria: pre-defined KPI lift targets with statistical significance checks; rollback criteria if side effects appear (e.g., too many resequencing prompts).

- Data quality and drift monitoring
  - Track missing GPS proportion, scan-to-geofence match rate, clock drift corrections applied; alert when data reliability degrades.
  - Model drift: compare predicted vs actual arrival/service time residuals; retrain when drift exceeds thresholds.

Putting it into motion: practical phasing
- Phase 1 (4–6 weeks): ETL, canonical event log build, base discovery models, KPI baselines, conformance against plans; identify top 3 bottlenecks by minutes lost.
- Phase 2 (6–10 weeks): build ETA/service-time models, dynamic resequencing pilots, territory difficulty indices, and failure reduction program; set dashboards, alerts, and A/B tests.
- Phase 3 (ongoing): scale successful interventions, implement predictive maintenance, refine driver coaching, and institutionalize monthly process mining reviews.

With this approach, Speedy Parcels moves from a fragmented data view to a cohesive, continuously improving delivery operation. Process mining becomes both the diagnostic engine and the control tower for sustained improvements in punctuality, cost, and customer experience.
