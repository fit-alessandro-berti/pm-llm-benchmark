Let's analyze each case in the event log against the normative process description to identify deviations and explain the violations.

---

### **Case 1:**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
This case follows the expected flow for a successful order fulfillment:
1. "Receive order" is the correct starting activity.
2. "Check inventory" occurs before "Authorize payment," as required.
3. "Authorize payment" precedes "Package items," which is correct.
4. "Package items" occurs before "Ship order," as expected.
5. "Ship order" is followed by "Close order," which is the correct final step.

**Conclusion:** **No violations.** This case adheres to the normative process.

### **Case 2:**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
1. "Receive order" and "Check inventory" are correctly ordered.
2. **Violation:** "Package items" occurs **before** "Authorize payment." According to the normative description, payment must be authorized **before** packaging because "payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known" and "items must be prepared before they can be shipped." Packaging before authorization is illogical and violates the expected sequence.
3. The rest of the sequence ("Ship order"  "Close order") is correct, but the earlier violation invalidates the case.

**Conclusion:** **Violation:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment," which is not allowed.

---

### **Case 3:**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
1. "Receive order" and "Check inventory" are correct.
2. "Authorize payment" occurs after "Check inventory," which is correct.
3. **Violation:** After "Authorize payment," the order is canceled ("Cancel order"). This is problematic because:
   - The normative description states that cancellation should occur **only if inventory is insufficient**. However, in this case, payment was authorized, implying inventory was sufficient (since payment is only authorized after confirming inventory sufficiency).
   - Even if we assume inventory was insufficient (and the payment authorization was a mistake), the normative process does not allow for "Ship order" after "Cancel order." Shipping after cancellation is explicitly forbidden ("it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment").
4. "Ship order" after "Cancel order" is a clear violation.

**Conclusion:** **Violations:**
   - "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment," which is illogical (payment should not be authorized if inventory is insufficient).
   - "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order," which is explicitly forbidden.

### **Case 4:**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

**Analysis:**
1. "Receive order" and "Check inventory" are correct.
2. "Cancel order" follows "Check inventory," which is correct if inventory was insufficient.
3. "Close order" is the final step, as expected.

**Conclusion:** **No violations.** This case adheres to the normative process for insufficient inventory.

---

### **Case 5:**
**Sequence:**
Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Analysis:**
1. "Receive order" and "Check inventory" are correct.
2. "Authorize payment" follows "Check inventory," which is correct.
3. **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs **before** "Package items." The normative description explicitly states that "Package items" must occur **before** "Ship order" ("items must be prepared before they can be shipped"). Skipping packaging is a violation.
4. "Close order" is the final step, which is correct.

**Conclusion:** **Violation:** "Ship order" occurs without "Package items" preceding it.

### **Summary of Violations:**
| Case ID | Violation(s)                                                                                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2       | "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment."                                               |
| 3       | 1. "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment" (illogical).<br>2. "Ship order" after "Cancel order" (forbidden). |
| 5       | "Ship order" occurs without prior "Package items."                                               |

### **Non-Violating Cases:**
- **Case 1:** Perfectly follows the normative process.
- **Case 4:** Correctly follows the cancellation path.
