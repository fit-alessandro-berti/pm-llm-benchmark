### 1. Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times

To identify significantly longer resolution times, I calculated the total cycle time for each case as the duration from the "Receive Ticket" event to the "Close Ticket" event. The average total resolution time across all cases is approximately 20.4 hours, with a standard deviation of 17.6 hours. Cases exceeding the average plus one standard deviation (i.e., >38 hours) are considered significantly delayed. However, for a more practical view of "significantly longer than average," I also flagged cases more than 3x the average of the quick cases (101 and 103, which average ~1.8 hours), resulting in thresholds over ~5.4 hours.

Based on this:
- **Quick cases** (under 3 hours total): 101 (2.25 hours) and 103 (1.33 hours).
- **Delayed cases** (significantly longer, over 24 hours total):
  - Case 102: 25.17 hours.
  - Case 104: 24.17 hours.
  - Case 105: 49.08 hours (the most extreme outlier).

These delayed cases account for the bulk of the process variance, pulling the overall average up.

| Case ID | Total Resolution Time (Hours) | Relative to Average | Escalation Present? |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 101    | 2.25                         | Quick              | No                  |
| 102    | 25.17                        | Delayed            | Yes                 |
| 103    | 1.33                         | Quick              | No                  |
| 104    | 24.17                        | Delayed            | No                  |
| 105    | 49.08                        | Delayed (Extreme)  | Yes                 |

### 2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues

By examining the sequence of activities and time intervals between consecutive events for the delayed cases, the following patterns emerge as key contributors to delays:

- **Presence of Escalations**: 
  - Seen in Cases 102 and 105 (both delayed). Escalation to Level-2 Agent occurs after initial investigation attempts by Level-1, but it introduces handoff friction. For example, in Case 102, escalation at 11:30 leads directly into a 2.5-hour wait before Level-2 investigation starts at 14:00. In Case 105, escalation at 10:00 results in a massive 28-hour gap before Level-2 investigation begins the next day at 14:00.
  
- **Long Waiting Times Between Activities**:
  - **Pre-Investigation Delays**: In Case 104 (no escalation), there's a 3.5-hour wait from assignment (09:30) to investigation (13:00), suggesting agent availability or prioritization issues at Level-1.
  - **Post-Investigation/Overnight Delays**: All delayed cases show extended gaps spanning overnight periods:
    - Case 102: 19 hours from investigation end (14:00 on Day 1) to resolution (09:00 on Day 2).
    - Case 104: 19 hours from investigation end (13:00 on Day 1) to resolution (08:00 on Day 2).
    - Case 105: 19 hours from Level-2 investigation end (14:00 on Day 2) to resolution (09:00 on Day 3), compounding the earlier 28-hour post-escalation wait.
  - These overnight gaps indicate non-24/7 operations, where tickets "park" until the next business day.

- **Other Factors**:
  - No evidence of unnecessary loops or rework (e.g., no repeated triage or assignments).
  - Initial steps (Receive → Triage → Assign) are consistently quick (<1 hour) across all cases, so bottlenecks start post-assignment.
  - Escalated cases (102, 105) average 37 hours total vs. 24 hours for non-escalated delayed cases (104), hinting at escalation amplifying delays.

### 3. How These Factors Lead to Increased Cycle Times and Recommendations

**Explanation of Impact on Cycle Times**:
- **Escalations as a Multiplier**: These require specialized Level-2 resources, which appear less available (e.g., starting investigations later in the day or next business day). This creates sequential dependencies: Level-1 must fail/exhaust options before handover, and Level-2 pickup isn't immediate. In Case 105, the 28-hour post-escalation wait alone adds ~1.5 days, turning a potentially same-day ticket into a multi-day ordeal. Without escalation, cases like 101/103 resolve in under 3 hours, showing the baseline process is efficient.
- **Overnight/Waiting Delays as Accumulators**: Business-hour constraints force idle time, especially if investigations wrap up mid-afternoon (common in delayed cases). A 19-hour overnight gap effectively triples cycle time for same-day starters. Combined with escalations, this creates compounding effects—e.g., Case 105's total delay is ~80% waiting time vs. active work.
- **Overall Effect**: Delays shift from value-adding activities (e.g., Investigate/Resolve, which take ~1-2 hours) to non-value-adding waits, inflating cycle times by 10-20x in outliers. This could erode customer satisfaction and overload the queue, as quick cases (like 101/103) likely represent simpler issues.

**Insights and Recommendations**:
- **Insight**: ~40% of cases (2/5) involve escalations, but they drive 60% of total delay variance. Non-escalated delays (e.g., Case 104) point to Level-1 capacity issues, while overnights affect all delayed cases uniformly.
- **Streamline Escalations**: Implement a "hot handover" protocol where Level-2 is paged immediately upon escalation (e.g., via Slack/automated alerts) to start within 1 hour. Train Level-1 agents on common escalation triggers to preempt them—e.g., route complex tickets directly during triage using simple rules (issue type, keywords).
- **Reduce Waiting Gaps**: Extend support to partial evenings (e.g., until 18:00) or introduce an on-call rotation for post-14:00 escalations. Use AI triage tools to flag high-priority tickets for faster assignment, minimizing pre-investigation waits like in Case 104.
- **Process Monitoring**: Track "wait time" as a KPI separate from active work. Set alerts for intervals >4 hours. Analyze more logs to correlate ticket complexity (e.g., via activity patterns) with escalation likelihood.
- **Quick Wins**: Batch overnight tickets for morning priority queues and pilot self-service resources (e.g., knowledge base) to reduce escalation rates by 20-30%.

Implementing these could cut average cycle time by 30-50%, focusing quick cases on <2 hours and capping delayed ones at <12 hours.
