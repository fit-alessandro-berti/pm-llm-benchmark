Bias appears in **Group B (Unprotected)**.  
The tell-tale sign is the systematic, score-changing “Community Boost” that is **only** applied to cases that already have the attribute `LocalResident=TRUE`.  
Because the boost is **never given to the protected group (A)**, it creates a persistent advantage for local residents that is not justified by the applicant’s raw credit risk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. What the data show
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected (A)  
- LocalResident is FALSE for every case.  
- ScoreAdjustment is always 0.  
- Final decision is driven by the **original** PreliminaryScore (720, 710, 740, …).

Unprotected (B)  
- LocalResident is TRUE for every case.  
- Whenever CommunityGroup is “Highland Civic Darts Club”, the scoring engine adds +10 to the score.  
- The adjusted score (not the original) is what the Rules Engine sees when it makes the approve/reject cut.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How the bias manifests
--------------------------------------------------------------------
a. **Threshold shift**  
   Assume the cut-off for approval is 720.  
   - U001: original 720  730 (Approved)  
   - U003: original 695  705 (Approved)  
   Without the +10, U003 would have stayed below the cut-off and been rejected.

b. **Zero-sum exclusion**  
   Because the boost is **conditional on LocalResident=TRUE**, every protected applicant is effectively held to the higher (original) bar.  
   In other words, the same 695-score applicant would automatically be rejected in Group A but can be accepted in Group B **solely** because of the resident-linked boost.

c. **Systematic disparity**  
   - Approval rate in the small sample:  
     – Group A: 2 / 3  67 %  
     – Group B: 2 / 3  67 %  
     *but* the two approvals in B required an artificial +10 that was **unavailable** to A.  
   - If the rule were removed, U003 would flip to “Rejected”, driving B’s approval rate down to 33 %, revealing the latent disadvantage for non-residents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Root fairness issue
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The “Community Boost” policy confuses **community participation** with **credit worthiness**, and it intertwines that confusion with the **residency** flag.  
Because protected-group applicants are never residents, they are locked out of the bonus, so identical risk profiles produce **systematically worse outcomes** for them.  
That is the textbook definition of **disparate impact**, even if the policy was never intended to discriminate.
