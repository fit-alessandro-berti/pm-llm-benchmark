### 1. Normative (Hard) Rule Compliance

#### Case 1  
**Normative status:** Fully compliant.

- Sequence followed exactly:  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- All ordering constraints satisfied:
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment: 09:30 < 10:00  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: 10:00 < 11:00  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: 13:00 > 11:00  
  - Approved decision  Finalize Documentation before Close Case: 13:30 < 14:00  
- No forbidden actions (no documentation finalization after rejection, no skipped mandatory steps, no reordering).

---

#### Case 2  
**Normative status:** Violates multiple hard rules.

**Violations:**

1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering violation)**  
   - Application Received: 08:00  
   - Risk Assessment: 08:20  
   - Credit Check: 09:00  
   - Rule requires: Credit Check  Risk Assessment.  
     Here, Risk Assessment happens before Credit Check.

2. **Skipping “Inform Applicant” after Loan Decision (mandatory step missing)**  
   - Loan Decision (Rejected): 09:30  
   - No “Inform Applicant” activity at all.  
   - This breaks the required sequence:  
     Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.

3. **Finalize Documentation after a Rejection (contradictory action)**  
   - Loan Decision (Rejected): 09:30  
   - Finalize Documentation: 10:00  
   - Close Case: 10:30  
   - Normative rule:  
     - If **Approved**: Finalize Documentation before Close Case.  
     - If **Rejected**: **Do not** finalize documentation before closing the case.  
   - Here, the loan is rejected but “Finalize Documentation” is still performed before closing  direct violation.

Overall, Case 2 conflicts with the strict process specification on ordering, mandatory activities, and decision-dependent behavior.

---

#### Case 3  
**Normative status:** Compliant.

- Sequence (despite delays) is correct:  
  Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case  
- Ordering constraints respected:
  - Credit Check before Risk Assessment: 10:00 < 11:00  
  - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: 11:00 < 12:00  
  - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: 15:00 on Jan 16 > 12:00 on Jan 14  
  - Approved decision  Finalize Documentation before Close Case: 09:00 < 10:00 on Jan 17  
- No forbidden actions and no skipped mandatory steps.  
- The only issues here are with timing desiderata (not hard rules), covered next.

---

### 2. Desiderata (Soft) Conditions

Desiderata (violations are **not** severe, just suboptimal):

- Credit Check ideally within **24 hours** of Application Received.  
- Inform Applicant ideally within **48 hours** of Loan Decision.  
- Follow-up Call is encouraged before Close Case, but optional.

#### Case 1 – Desiderata

- **Credit Check timing:**  
  - Application: 09:00, Credit Check: 09:30 (same day).  
  - Within 30 minutes  satisfies the “within 24 hours” recommendation.
- **Inform Applicant timing:**  
  - Decision: 11:00, Inform Applicant: 13:00 (same day).  
  - 2 hours  satisfies “within 48 hours.”
- **Follow-up Call:**  
  - No “Follow-up Call” event logged before Close Case.  
  - This **deviates from the recommendation**, but it is not a serious violation.

**Desiderata verdict for Case 1:**  
Compliant with timing recommendations; does not meet the “Follow-up Call” desideratum.

---

#### Case 2 – Desiderata

Note: Case 2 already has serious **normative** violations. For completeness:

- **Credit Check timing:**  
  - Application: 08:00, Credit Check: 09:00.  
  - 1 hour  satisfies the “within 24 hours” recommendation.
- **Inform Applicant timing:**  
  - No Inform Applicant event at all.  
  - This is primarily a **normative** violation. It also means the “inform within 48 hours” desideratum cannot be met.
- **Follow-up Call:**  
  - No Follow-up Call before Close Case.  
  - This misses the recommended practice.

**Desiderata verdict for Case 2:**  
Timing of the Credit Check is fine, but there is no Follow-up Call and no logged notification to the applicant (which is already a hard-rule breach).

---

#### Case 3 – Desiderata

- **Credit Check timing (recommendation:  24 hours):**  
  - Application: 2024-01-12 09:00  
  - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00  
  - Delay  49 hours  **violates** the 24-hour desideratum.

- **Inform Applicant timing (recommendation:  48 hours):**  
  - Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00  
  - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00  
  - Delay  51 hours  **violates** the 48-hour desideratum.

- **Follow-up Call:**  
  - Explicitly noted as “No Follow-up Call.”  
  - Again, this **misses** the recommendation but does not break any hard rule.

**Desiderata verdict for Case 3:**  
Normatively correct but suboptimal: late Credit Check, late notification, and no Follow-up Call.

### 3. Possible Interpretations / Justifications

#### For Case 2 (Normative Violations)

1. **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
   - Possible interpretation:  
     - The “Risk Assessment” might be a preliminary or automatic scoring step based on application form data, with the formal “Credit Check” (e.g., querying an external credit bureau) logged later.  
     - If so, the semantic meaning of “Risk Assessment” in the log is broader than in the rule, and the process model or event labels may need refinement.

2. **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
   - Possible interpretation:  
     - “Finalize Documentation” could, in practice, include compiling rejection letters or internal documentation, not only approval paperwork.  
     - If the model intended “Finalize Documentation” only for approved loans, then the event is misused; if not, the normative rule may be too strict or too narrowly worded.

3. **Missing “Inform Applicant”**
   - Possible interpretation:  
     - The applicant may have been informed via a channel that is not logged in this system (e.g., external CRM, manual phone call, or automatic email not integrated with the event log).  
     - That would imply the process is *operationally* compliant but *not traceably compliant* in this log.

Even with these interpretations, according to the given rules, Case 2 remains non-compliant at the normative level.

---

#### For Case 3 (Desiderata Violations Only)

1. **Late Credit Check (49 hours)**
   - Possible explanations:
     - High workload or backlog in the credit department.  
     - Need for additional documents from the applicant before a credit check could be performed (e.g., missing income proof).  
     - System downtime or public holidays delaying access to external credit bureaus.

2. **Late Applicant Notification (51 hours after decision)**
   - Possible explanations:
     - Internal review or quality-control checks between decision and communication.  
     - Difficulty reaching the applicant (e.g., wrong contact details, customer requested specific time windows).  
     - Prioritization of other urgent cases, with this case handled later.

3. **No Follow-up Call**
   - Possible explanations:
     - The applicant may have indicated no need for a follow-up or preferred email only.  
     - The organization might only perform follow-up calls selectively (e.g., high-value loans, risky cases), and this case did not qualify.  
     - Resource constraints (limited staff for outbound calls).

These deviations are operationally understandable and, per the definition, are **not serious violations**, just departures from best practice.

---

#### For Case 1

- Fully compliant normatively and strong on timing.  
- Missing Follow-up Call may simply reflect:
  - A policy where follow-up calls are optional and triggered only by specific circumstances (e.g., complex terms or disputes), which did not arise here.  
  - Or a call took place but was not formally logged as a “Follow-up Call” activity.

---

### Summary

- **Normative violations:**  
  - **Only Case 2** violates hard rules (wrong activity order, missing “Inform Applicant,” and finalizing documentation after a rejection).

- **Desiderata (soft) violations:**  
  - **Case 1:** Only misses the Follow-up Call recommendation.  
  - **Case 2:** Misses the Follow-up Call; no timely notification logged (also a hard-rule issue).  
  - **Case 3:** Late Credit Check, late notification to applicant, and no Follow-up Call, but all within an otherwise normatively correct sequence.

Normatively, Case 1 and Case 3 are acceptable; Case 2 is problematic. Desiderata-wise, all cases show some room for improvement, especially Case 3.
