### Identified Anomalies and Explanations:

#### **Case 1002**  
- **Anomaly 1:** The purchase order (PO) was issued *before* the requisition was approved.  
  - *Problem:* Approval of the requisition is a critical control step to ensure the purchase is authorized and budget-compliant. Skipping this step risks unauthorized spending.  

- **Anomaly 2:** Payment was released *before* goods were received and *before* the invoice was matched to the PO.  
  - *Problem:* Payment should only occur after verifying that goods/services were delivered (via "Receive Goods") and that the invoice matches the PO (to prevent overpayment or fraud). Paying upfront creates financial risk (e.g., paying for undelivered goods or incorrect invoices).  

- **Anomaly 3:** The requisition was approved *after* the PO was issued and payment was released.  
  - *Problem:* This violates the fundamental sequence of P2P, where approvals must precede downstream actions like PO issuance and payment.

#### **Case 1003**  
- **Anomaly:** Payment was released *before* the invoice was received and goods were delivered.  
  - *Problem:* Payments should only occur after the invoice is validated against the PO and goods receipt. Paying in advance risks discrepancies (e.g., incorrect invoice amounts, unmatched deliveries) and potential fraud.

#### **Case 1004**  
- **Anomaly:** Goods were received *before* the PO was issued.  
  - *Problem:* A PO serves as a formal agreement with the vendor. Receiving goods without a PO indicates a lack of contractual control, risking acceptance of unordered/incorrect goods and disputes over payment terms.

### **Why These Anomalies Are Problematic**  
1. **Control Failures:**  
   - Skipping approvals (e.g., requisition approval) or critical checks (e.g., matching invoices to POs) weakens financial controls, increasing fraud and error risks.  

2. **Financial Risks:**  
   - Paying before goods receipt or invoice validation can lead to overpayment, duplicate payments, or payments for undelivered goods.  

3. **Operational Inefficiencies:**  
   - Out-of-sequence steps (e.g., receiving goods before issuing a PO) disrupt inventory management and vendor relationships, potentially causing stock discrepancies or contractual disputes.  

4. **Compliance Violations:**  
   - Deviating from the standard P2P process may breach internal policies or regulatory requirements (e.g., SOX compliance for financial controls).

### **Summary**  
Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 exhibit significant deviations from the standard P2P process. These anomalies reflect weakened controls, financial exposure, and operational risks, requiring investigation to prevent fraud, errors, and inefficiencies.
