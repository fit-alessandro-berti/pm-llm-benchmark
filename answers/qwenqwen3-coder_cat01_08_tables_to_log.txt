# Integrated Event Log

Below is the integrated event log derived from the ERP tables, organized by **Case ID** (`order_id`) and ordered chronologically. Each row represents a discrete event in the lifecycle of an order.

```markdown

## Notes and Assumptions:
- **Chronological Ordering**: Events are sorted by timestamp to reflect the actual sequence of the business process.
- **Resource Enrichment**: The `Resource/Actor` column is populated using data from the `Resources Table`.
- **Multiple Deliveries**: For orders with multiple deliveries (e.g., order 1002), each dispatch and arrival is treated as a separate event.
- **Item-Level Detailing**: Item picking is recorded as individual events per item to preserve granularity.
- **Payment Linking**: Payments are linked to invoices and then traced back to orders using the `invoice_id` foreign key.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Where data was not explicitly provided (e.g., no invoice for order 1004), only the events supported by the data are included.

This event log can now be used for process mining analysis to discover, monitor, and improve business processes.
