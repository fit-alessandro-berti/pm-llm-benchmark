### Rationale for Added Constraints

1. **`existence` of `BiasMitigationCheck`**:  
   Guarantees that a fairness-aware validation step is always part of any trace where sensitive attributes might influence outcomes, ensuring systematic bias review.

2. **`coexistence` between sensitive-group decisions and `ManualReview`**:  
   If a decision is made for an applicant from a sensitive group (represented via proxy activities like `FinalDecision_Minority`), a human `ManualReview` must also occur in the same trace. This enforces human oversight for potentially high-risk decisions.

3. **`response` from sensitive attribute checks to `BiasMitigationCheck`**:  
   Whenever the system accesses sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, etc.), it must eventually trigger a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This prevents silent use of sensitive data without accountability.

4. **`precedence` of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` before sensitive decisions**:  
   Ensures that fairness safeguards occur *before* final decisions for vulnerable groups, preventing post-hoc justification.

5. **`nonsuccession` and `nonchainsuccession` constraints**:  
   Explicitly forbid direct transitions from sensitive attribute checks to approval or rejection decisions. This blocks "snap judgments" based on protected attributes and forces intermediate fairness steps (e.g., `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`).

Together, these constraints encode a fairness-by-design policy into the process model: sensitive attributes can be used only if accompanied by mandatory bias-mitigation activities, and automated decisions cannot follow sensitive data access without human or algorithmic review. This reduces the risk of discriminatory outcomes while preserving process functionality.
