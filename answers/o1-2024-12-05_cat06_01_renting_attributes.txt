In the context of fairness analysis, **sensitive attributes** are those that can identify or strongly correlate with legally or ethically protected categories of individuals, potentially making them vulnerable to discrimination. In typical fairness scenarios, such attributes include demographic or socio-economic characteristics upon which discrimination has historically occurred or is legally prohibited.

Looking at the attributes provided, the following stand out as sensitive attributes:

1. **case:gender**  
   - Indicates whether the individual is of a particular gender (True/False in this encoding likely means some specific classification, but presumably relates to a protected characteristic: gender).
   - Gender is commonly considered a protected characteristic under anti-discrimination laws and fairness guidelines.

2. **case:citizen**  
   - This attribute likely indicates citizenship status (True/False).  
   - Citizenship or national origin is often protected, as treating individuals differently based on their citizenship can lead to discrimination against certain nationalities or ethnic groups.

3. **case:german speaking**  
   - This attribute indicates whether the individual is a German speaker (True/False).
   - While language is not always explicitly a protected attribute, it often correlates with ethnic origin, nationality, or cultural background. In many contexts, treating individuals differently based on language proficiency can amount to indirect discrimination.

4. **case:married**  
   - This attribute indicates marital status (True/False).
   - Marital status can be protected in many jurisdictions. Moreover, differing treatment based on whether someone is married or not could raise fairness concerns, depending on the legal context and the purpose of the analysis.

**Non-sensitive attributes** in this context would be those related purely to the event or process execution, such as the activity, resource, or timestamps. For example:

- **activity**: The specific events in the process (like "Pay Rent", "Apply for Viewing Appointment") are process steps, not personal attributes, and thus are not inherently sensitive.
- **resource**: Roles such as "Tenant" or "Real Estate Agent" are related to the process workflow and do not inherently reflect protected classes. They might identify a stakeholder type, but these roles are not typically considered sensitive personal characteristics.  
- **timestamps** and **performance metrics**: Times and durations are procedural attributes, not personal characteristics, and are thus not sensitive from a fairness standpoint (unless indirectly combined with other attributes that lead to discrimination).

**Summary:**  
The attributes that are sensitive for fairness considerations are those capturing inherent personal or socio-demographic characteristicsâ€”namely, **case:citizen, case:gender, case:german speaking, and case:married**.
