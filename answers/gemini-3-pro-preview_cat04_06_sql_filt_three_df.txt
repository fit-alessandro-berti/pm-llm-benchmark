Here is the DuckDB SQL query to solve the problem.

This query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with window functions (`LEAD`) to look ahead at the next two rows for every event. This allows us to detect the specific sequence and calculate the time difference between the second and third events in that sequence on a single row basis.

```sql
WITH SequenceCheck AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        -- Look ahead 1 row (the potential 2nd event in the sequence)
        LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
        -- Look ahead 2 rows (the potential 3rd event in the sequence)
        LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
        LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
),
CasesToExclude AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        case_id
    FROM SequenceCheck
    WHERE 
        -- 1. Check for the specific sequence: A -> B -> C
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
        AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
        
        -- 2. Check the timing condition: (C time - B time) > 5 days
        AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 DAY
)
-- 3. Return all events, excluding cases found above
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM CasesToExclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### Explanation of the Steps:

1.  **`SequenceCheck` CTE:**
    *   We partition the data by `case_id` and order by `timestamp`.
    *   We use `LEAD(..., 1)` to get the activity and timestamp of the *immediately following* event.
    *   We use `LEAD(..., 2)` to get the activity and timestamp of the event *two steps ahead*.
2.  **`CasesToExclude` CTE:**
    *   We filter the previous CTE. We look for rows where the current activity is **'Approve Purchase Requisition'**, the immediate next is **'Create Order'**, and the one after that is **'Confirm Order'**.
    *   We apply the timing constraint: We subtract the `next_timestamp` ('Create Order') from the `next_next_timestamp` ('Confirm Order'). If the difference is greater than `INTERVAL 5 DAY`, the `case_id` is flagged for exclusion.
3.  **Final SELECT:**
    *   We select all columns from the original `event_log`.
    *   We filter out any rows belonging to the `case_id`s identified in the `CasesToExclude` list.
