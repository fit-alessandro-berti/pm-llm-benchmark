Below is the integrated, chronological event log for Order#1234.  Events that could be confidently matched (by order_id, semantic equivalence, and timestamp proximity) have been merged; others remain as singlesource records.  For merged events we show both System A’s timestamp (primaryTimeline) and System B’s timestamp (secondaryTimeline), plus all attributes.

Reasoning Notes  
• Matching criteria: same order_id + semantic event type + timestamp difference 2 s.  
• Order Received and Order Validated: within 1 s, clear semantic match.  
• Payment: only one payment event in each log; despite a 5 s gap, the unique payment step and identical user_id/resource_id pattern justified merging.  
• Shipping vs. Item Shipped: 2 s apart, merged.  
• Quality Check exists only in B (no A counterpart), so kept separate.  
• Item Delivered exists only in A, so kept separate.  
• For merged events we retained System A’s timestamp as primary for ordering, but kept System B’s timestamp for audit.  
• All available attributes (user_id, resource_id, notes) have been preserved in the unified records.
