Reasoning:

• Matching criteria: events share the same order_id and occur within a 2-second window (inclusive). System A’s timestamp is taken as the primary timestamp for merged records.

• 10:00:00 vs. 09:59:58 ( = 2 s): “Order Received” (A)  “OrderReceived” (B)  merged.  
• 10:01:30 vs. 10:01:29 ( = 1 s): “Order Validated” (A)  “OrderValidation” (B)  merged.  
• 10:02:00 vs. 10:02:05 ( = 5 s): exceeds tolerance  kept separate as A-only “Payment Processed” and B-only “PaymentCheck.”  
• 10:03:00 (B) has no close counterpart in A  included as B-only “Quality Check.”  
• 10:05:00 vs. 10:05:02 ( = 2 s): “Item Shipped” (A)  “Shipping” (B)  merged.  
• 10:20:00 (A) “Item Delivered” has no match in B  included as A-only.

• Attribute integration: for merged events, we include all fields from both systems. For A-only or B-only events, we carry only the attributes present in that system and mark origin accordingly.
