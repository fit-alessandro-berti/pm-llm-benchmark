Below is a compact POWL description that reproduces every behaviour that can be observed in the five example cases while remaining as simple as possible.

1.  Activities that may repeat are captured with LOOP nodes.  
    • Assembly may be followed by an arbitrary number of (IQC  Assembly)” cycles  
    • An initial test may be followed by an arbitrary number of (RT  Test)” cycles  
2.  Labelling is optional, therefore it is modelled as an XOR-choice between the real activity (LB) and a silent transition ().  
3.  All other activities occur exactly once and in a strict order, so a single StrictPartialOrder node is sufficient (no concurrency was observed in the log).

Python style construction of the model
--------------------------------------------------------------------
```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# elementary transitions ------------------------------------------
OR  = Transition(label="OR")    # Order Received
MS  = Transition(label="MS")    # Material Sourcing
QS  = Transition(label="QS")    # Quality Screening
AS  = Transition(label="AS")    # Assembly
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")   # In-line Quality Check
TST = Transition(label="TST")   # Testing
RT  = Transition(label="RT")    # Re-Testing
PK  = Transition(label="PK")    # Packaging
LB  = Transition(label="LB")    # Labelling
DP  = Transition(label="DP")    # Distribution Planning
D   = Transition(label="D")     # Dispatch
   = SilentTransition()        # skip / silent step

# repeating fragments ---------------------------------------------
loop_AS_IQC = OperatorPOWL(              #  AS ( IQC  AS )*
    operator = Operator.LOOP,
    children = [AS, IQC])

loop_TST_RT = OperatorPOWL(              #  TST ( RT  TST )*
    operator = Operator.LOOP,
    children = [TST, RT])

# optional labelling ----------------------------------------------
xor_LB = OperatorPOWL(                   #  XOR( LB,  )
    operator = Operator.XOR,
    children = [LB, ])

# global partial order (pure sequence here) -----------------------
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes = [
        OR, MS, QS,          # front-end acquisition & checks
        loop_AS_IQC,         # assembly with in-line re-work
        loop_TST_RT,         # testing with possible re-test
        PK,                  # packaging
        xor_LB,              # optional labelling
        DP, D                # distribution & dispatch
])

root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, loop_AS_IQC)
root.order.add_edge(loop_AS_IQC, loop_TST_RT)
root.order.add_edge(loop_TST_RT, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, xor_LB)
root.order.add_edge(xor_LB, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)
```

Interpretation of the resulting model
• Every case starts with OR  MS  QS.  
• At least one Assembly (AS) is performed.  After it, the process may either continue or execute the pair (IQC  AS) one or more times – exactly the pattern seen in Cases 3 and 5.  
• After testing (TST) the product may leave the loop immediately or take the RT  TST” branch any number of times (Cases 1, 3, 5).  
• Packaging (PK) always follows the last successful test.  
• Labelling (LB) is optional (Cases 2 & 4 skip it); this is modelled with XOR(LB, ).  
• Finally Distribution Planning (DP) and Dispatch (D) complete the process.

The model thus covers:
– the simple path of Case 4 (no IQC, no RT, LB executed),  
– the medium paths of Cases 1 & 2 (some IQC, single RT, optional LB),  
– the long path of Case 5 (many IQC and RT repetitions),  

and any combination that these loops and the labelling XOR allow, staying faithful to the behaviour seen in the log.
