```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('Purchase Order', 'Invoice Generation'): (50400, 86400),  # Average time: 1 day, Standard deviation: 2 days
    ('Invoice Generation', 'Payment Request'): (18000, 36000),   # Average time: 3 hours, Standard deviation: 6 hours
    ('Payment Request', 'Payment Processing'): (24000, 48000),   # Average time: 5 hours, Standard deviation: 10 hours
    ('Payment Processing', 'Invoice Approval'): (36000, 96000),  # Average time: 1 day, Standard deviation: 2 days
    ('Invoice Approval', 'Goods Receipt'): (18000, 36000),   # Average time: 3 hours, Standard deviation: 6 hours
    ('Goods Receipt', 'Payment Execution'): (12000, 24000),    # Average time: 1 day, Standard deviation: 2 days

**Explanation:**

This is a simplified example to illustrate the concept.  The specific times will depend heavily on your actual Purchase-to-Pay process and can be adapted based on industry standards and data analysis. 


 **Important Considerations:**

* **Data Source:** This profile relies on hypothetical values, but you would ideally derive these from historical data in your system for each activity within the Purchase-to-Pay process (PO creation, invoice generation, etc.).
* **Process Variability:** The standard deviations represent typical variations in execution times. Real processes often show fluctuations and delays, requiring more dynamic updates to the profile. 
* **Activity Order:**  The temporal profile is based on ordering activities chronologically. You may need adjustments if your process has non-sequential dependencies between stages.
* **ZETA & STDEV:** The `ZETA` and `STDEV` parameters are used for identifying deviations from the average times between activities. 
    *  **ZETA:** A threshold value that can be adjusted to control how much deviation is considered an error or anomaly in your process. A smaller ZETA indicates a stricter tolerance, while a larger ZETA offers more flexibility and allows for natural variations in execution.
    * **STDEV:** This measures the spread or variability in the times between activities. A higher STDEV suggests more variation in the process. 

**Additional Notes:**

* **Dynamic Profiles:** For more realistic tracking, consider building a system to update this profile dynamically based on recent process data and feedback loops.
* **Data Collection & Analysis:**  A key part of building reliable temporal profiles is carefully collecting and analyzing real-world process data to inform the average times and standard deviations used in your dictionary.
