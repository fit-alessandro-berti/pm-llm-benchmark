To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, I have integrated the provided ERP tables. The `order_id` serves as the **Case ID**. 

### Assumptions and Data Handling:
1.  **Multiple Items/Deliveries**: Where an order had multiple items picked or multiple deliveries, each is recorded as a separate event to capture the true granularity of the warehouse and logistics process.
2.  **Resource Mapping**: I have mapped the IDs (e.g., SP-001, WH-001) to their respective names and roles using the provided **Resources Table** to make the "Resource" column more descriptive.
3.  **Payment Actor**: Since the `Payments` table does not specify an internal resource, the actor is listed as "Customer/System" (representing the external payment trigger).
4.  **Chronology**: Events are ordered by timestamp per Case ID. For Order 1002, which features split deliveries and multiple invoices, the log reflects the interleaved nature of these steps.

### Process Insights & Missing Data Observations:
*   **Order 1004 (Bottleneck/Incomplete)**: This process stops after the "Item Picked" activity. There are no delivery or invoice records. This suggests either a cancellation, a stock issue, or that the process is still ongoing in the warehouse.
*   **Order 1002 (Complexity)**: This case demonstrates a "Split Delivery." It involves two carriers and two separate invoices. In process mining, this will show as parallel paths or loops in the process model.
*   **Timing**: Order 1001 shows an "Invoice Issued" event *after* the order arrived, whereas for other orders, invoicing and delivery overlap differently, suggesting flexibility (or inconsistency) in the billing trigger.
