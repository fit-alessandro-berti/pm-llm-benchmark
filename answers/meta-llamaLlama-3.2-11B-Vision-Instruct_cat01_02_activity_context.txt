**Task Analysis and Renaming**

Upon analyzing the provided event log, the "Verify Documents," "Call Customer," and "Submit Additional" activities stand out as they recur within the same cases but carry varying meanings.

1.  **Verify Documents** (recurring):

    *   Context: This activity first appears in Case C001 with a stated purpose of "Agent checks identity documents." However, it reappears in Case C002 as "Identity verification" and in Case C003 as "Physical verification of ID." The emphasis on physical verification in Case C003, and the variation in settings (i.e., branch vs. office) suggests a nuanced contextual distinction.
    *   **Renamed Activities:** _Verify \(x\) Documents_ in Case \(x\)\(;\)_Check Identity Documents_; _Verify Documents (Physical)_ will be used for separate logs and separate explanations for each action.

2.  **Call Customer** (recurring):

    *   Context: This activity is named as making "Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs" (Case C001) and "Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy" or "Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made" in Cases C002 and C003, respectively. This contextual variation suggests different call purposes.
    *   **Renamed Activities:**

        *   Call Customer to Resolve Incompleteness
        *   Call to Clarify Discrepancy
        *   Follow-up Call to Confirm Adjustments

3.  **Submit Additional** (once with unique context)

    *   Context: Although this single occurrence has a different associated activity (type, web software for on-time_info submission within Case C001) compared to the first occurrences of the other activities, it points towards a meaningful sub-correction role.
    *   **Renamed Activities:** Clarly _Submit Added \(x\) Info_

**Revised Event Log:**

Below is the revised event log incorporating the newly renamed activities. The additional proper changes are appended at each line with the very useful remark which detail what action needs to be taken=
