First, the normative process:


## Outlining normative process  
- The process begins with receiving an order.  
- Next, inventory is checked to determine stock availability.  
- If inventory is sufficient, the process continues with authorizing payment.  
- After payment, items are packaged and the order is shipped, then closed.  
- If inventory is insufficient, the process requires further steps to handle shortages.

## Examining process constraints  
- Payment authorization must occur after inventory check and before packaging items.  
- Packaging happens after payment authorization and before shipping, with shipping never following order cancellation.  
- Closing the order is the final step, regardless of the process path, with no deviations like shipping after cancellation allowed.  

## Reviewing case examples  
- Case 1 shows a valid flow: receive order, check inventory, authorize payment, package, ship, and close, aligning with sufficient inventory norms.  
- Case 2 violates norms by packaging before authorizing payment and shipping after improper authorization, breaking the required sequence.

## Reviewing case examples  
- Case 3 violates norms by authorizing payment after inventory check, then canceling, which contradicts sufficient inventory expectations.  
- It further errs by shipping after cancellation, against the rule that shipping never follows cancellation, and skips packaging before shipping.

Below, I'll address the task step by step. First, I'll briefly summarize my interpretation of the normative process description to ensure clarity, as it contains some ambiguities (e.g., it allows for "interpretation" in extraordinary circumstances but emphasizes the key constraints and expected sequences). Based on this, I'll identify which cases deviate from the normative flow and explain the violations, referencing the description's guidance.

### Interpretation of the Normative Process
The process is designed to handle orders based on inventory sufficiency, with two main branches:
- **Sufficient inventory path**: Receive  Check  Authorize Payment  Package Items  Ship Order  Close Order.
- **Insufficient inventory path**: Receive  Check  Cancel Order  Close Order.

Key rules from the description (interpreted to resolve ambiguities):
- The process **always starts with "Receive order"** and **must include "Check inventory"** next, as it's the foundation for all decisions.
- **"Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory"** (to confirm sufficiency) **and before "Package items"** (as it only makes sense once inventory is known and items aren't yet prepared). It's illogical and a violation to authorize before checking or after packaging.
- **"Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment"** (to ensure payment is valid before preparing items) **and before "Ship order"** (items must be prepared to ship).
- **"Ship order" must occur after "Package items"** and **never after "Cancel order"** or in a cancellation scenario (as shipping fulfilled items contradicts cancellation).
- **"Cancel order" should only occur after "Check inventory"** if inventory is insufficient, and it should lead directly to "Close order" (no fulfillment activities like packaging or shipping afterward).
- **"Close order" is always the final activity**, ending the process.
- Ambiguities (e.g., "whether it’s ever acceptable to authorize payment before certain conditions" or "a cancellation step can precede certain checks") are resolved by adhering to the description's "general principles" and "expected flow." Deviations like skipping steps, reordering them improperly, or mixing branches (e.g., fulfillment after cancellation) are violations unless extraordinary circumstances are clearly implied—but none are in the log, so I stick to the normative intent.
- Overall, sequences must respect causality (e.g., no shipping without packaging) and avoid contradictions (e.g., fulfillment after cancellation).

I analyzed each case against this, focusing on activity order, presence/absence of required steps, and adherence to branches. Cases that fully align are not flagged as deviating.

### Identification of Deviating Cases
Out of the 5 cases, the following deviate from the normative process:
- **Case 2**: Deviates.
- **Case 3**: Deviates.
- **Case 5**: Deviates.

Cases 1 and 4 do not deviate (explanations below for completeness).

### Explanations of Violations
I'll explain each deviating case, referencing the relevant parts of the normative description and how the sequence violates the rules or expectations. I'll also note any ambiguities resolved (e.g., prioritizing the "general principles" over potential exceptions).

- **Case 2**:
  - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
  - **Violations**:
    - The description states that "Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging," as payment authorization "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known." Here, "Authorize payment" occurs after "Package items," violating this by reversing the order—items are packaged before confirming payment validity.
    - Additionally, "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping," since "items must be prepared before they can be shipped" but only after payment is authorized. Packaging before authorization contradicts this, as it implies preparation without confirming payment (a potential waste of resources if payment fails).
    - While the description allows some "room for interpretation" (e.g., questioning if authorization can precede certain conditions), the "general principles" emphasize the expected flow: authorization before packaging to avoid illogical preparation. No extraordinary circumstances are evident here, so this is a clear deviation.
    - The sequence does start correctly (Receive  Check) and ends with Close order, but the reordering of authorization and packaging disrupts the causal logic of the sufficient inventory path.

- **Case 3**:
  - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
  - **Violations**:
    - After "Check inventory," the case proceeds to "Authorize payment," which implies the inventory check found sufficiency (as authorization is part of the fulfillment branch). However, it then immediately "Cancel order," creating a contradiction: if inventory was sufficient enough to authorize payment, canceling suggests insufficiency, but the description specifies that cancellation should occur "directly" after checking if inventory is insufficient, without proceeding to fulfillment steps like authorization.
    - Following cancellation, the case performs "Ship order," which violates the rule that "Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation." The description explicitly states that after cancellation, "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping)," and the process should go directly to "Close order" for insufficient inventory scenarios. Shipping after cancellation contradicts this and mixes branches inappropriately.
    - The ambiguity around "whether a cancellation step can precede certain checks" is resolved by the description's emphasis on checking inventory first (as it's "the next logical step" after receiving) and not mixing fulfillment with cancellation. Here, authorization (a fulfillment step) precedes cancellation, which is illogical unless inventory was sufficient—but then canceling and shipping afterward is still a violation of the "never after a cancellation" principle.
    - The sequence starts correctly but deviates by attempting fulfillment (authorization) before canceling, then continuing with shipping, which undermines the normative intent for cancellation scenarios.

- **Case 5**:
  - **Sequence**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
  - **Violations**:
    - The description outlines that for sufficient inventory, the flow is Authorize Payment  Package Items  Ship Order. Here, "Package items" is entirely missing, and "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment."
    - This violates "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping," as "items must be prepared before they can be shipped." Skipping packaging means shipping unprepared items, which contradicts the causal requirement that packaging precedes shipping.
    - The description's "key constraints" emphasize that shipping "should only occur after packaging," and any deviation (like omitting a required step) is a violation of the "general principles" and "expected flow." While ambiguities exist around extraordinary circumstances, none are implied here—the omission disrupts the normative sequence without justification.
    - The sequence starts correctly (Receive  Check  Authorize) and ends with Close order, but the absence of packaging before shipping is a clear gap in the sufficient inventory path.

### Cases That Do Not Deviate
For completeness, here are the non-deviating cases, with brief explanations of why they align:
- **Case 1**: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. This perfectly matches the sufficient inventory path, with all steps in the correct order and no missing or extra activities.
- **Case 4**: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order. This aligns with the insufficient inventory path, proceeding directly to cancellation and closure without any fulfillment steps.

In summary, the deviations in Cases 2, 3, and 5 stem from improper ordering (e.g., packaging before authorization), contradictions (e.g., fulfillment after cancellation), or omissions (e.g., skipping packaging), all of which violate the description's emphasis on logical causality and branch-specific flows. If ambiguities arose (e.g., potential exceptions for extraordinary cases), I prioritized the "general principles" and expected sequences, as the log shows no evidence of such circumstances. If additional context were provided, interpretations could be refined.
