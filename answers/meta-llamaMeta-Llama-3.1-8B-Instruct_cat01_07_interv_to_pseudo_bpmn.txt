**Invoice Approval Process Model**

**Activities/Tasks:**

1. **Invoice Receipt**: The process starts with the receipt of an invoice, usually by email, by the Accounts Payable clerk (Mary).
2. **PO Validation**: Mary checks if the invoice is associated with a valid purchase order number. If not, she sends it back to the supplier requesting more details.
3. **Invoice Logging**: If the invoice has a valid PO, Mary logs it into the accounting system.
4. **Purchasing Confirmation**: Mary forwards the invoice to the purchasing department for confirmation that the goods or services were received.
5. **Invoice Matching**: Mary matches the invoice line items against the PO in the system.
6. **Discrepancy Resolution**: If there’s a discrepancy, Mary emails the purchasing team to clarify. If the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, she escalates it to her supervisor.
7. **Manager Approval**: The manager approves the invoice once all issues are resolved and after receiving automatic confirmation from the system.
8. **Scheduling for Payment**: Mary schedules the invoice for payment.

**Sequence Flow:**

1. Invoice Receipt  PO Validation (IF valid PO, THEN proceed to Invoice Logging)
2. PO Validation (IF invalid PO, THEN send back to supplier)
3. Invoice Logging  Purchasing Confirmation
4. Purchasing Confirmation  Invoice Matching
5. Invoice Matching (IF no discrepancies, THEN proceed to Manager Approval)
6. Invoice Matching (IF discrepancies, THEN Discrepancy Resolution)
7. Discrepancy Resolution  Manager Approval
8. Manager Approval  Scheduling for Payment

**Gateways/Decision Points:**

1. **Exclusive Gateway**: At the end of step 4 (Purchasing Confirmation), the process splits into two paths based on the outcome of the invoice matching against the PO (YES  proceed to Manager Approval; NO  Discrepancy Resolution).
2. **Inclusive Gateway**: After resolving discrepancies, the process rejoins the main flow at the Manager Approval step.

**Roles/Participants:**

1. **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**: Receives and processes invoices, communicates with Purchasing and suppliers, and schedules payments.
2. **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**: Verifies invoice details against purchase orders, communicates with Accounts Payable, and sends confirmation emails.
3. **Department Manager (Carlos)**: Reviews invoices, confirms receipt of goods and services, and approves invoices.
4. **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**: Handles exceptions, such as invoice discrepancies or missing information, and ensures problem invoices don’t get stuck indefinitely.
5. **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**: Resolves issues with suppliers, such as missing PO numbers or pricing discrepancies, and helps invoices move forward.

**Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**

1. **Invoice**: Received by email and processed by Accounts Payable.
2. **Purchase Order (PO)**: Used for verifying invoice details and confirming receipt of goods or services.
3. **Confirmation Emails**: Sent between Accounts Payable and Purchasing.
4. **System Notifications**: Used for notifying the Department Manager and other stakeholders.
5. **Supplier Communication**: Used for resolving issues with suppliers.

**Exceptions/Variations:**

1. **Missing PO Number**: The process diverges with an exception when the invoice lacks a valid PO number.
2. **Discrepancies**: The process diverges with an exception when there are discrepancies in the invoice details against the PO.
3. **Exceptions Handling**: Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) handles exceptions, and Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) is involved in resolving issues with suppliers.
4. **Informal Services Contracts**: Invoices for services contracted informally might not have a valid PO number, requiring a retrospective PO or rejection.
