Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand what's going on with the temporal profile model provided. The database schema has tables for claims, adjusters, and claim events, which track each activity in the claim process.

Looking at the anomalies mentioned:

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average is around 25 hours but with a very low standard deviation. That's suspicious because it suggests a strict timeline that might not be flexible, possibly due to automated approval processes without enough human oversight.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** An unusually long average delay of 7 days with high variability. This could indicate either backlogs causing delays or sometimes notifications are sent out quickly when there's no backlog.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** Only 2 hours on average might mean claims are being closed too fast, possibly skipping necessary evaluation steps.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** The short time between these two suggests either automation or bypassing of normal procedures.

For each anomaly, I need to think about possible reasons:

- For R-P: Maybe the system is set up to auto-approve after a certain period if no action is taken.
- P-N: Could be manual processing delays where notifications are batched at the end of the week.
- A-C: Adjusters might close claims prematurely, not following proper procedures.
- E-N: Automation scripts running evaluations and immediate notifications without human checks.

Now, for verification using SQL:

1. **Identify long P to N times:** Query the claim_events table, calculate time between approve and notify events, filter out those exceeding 7 days average with high standard deviation.

2. **Check R-P anomalies:** Look for claims where approve happened immediately after receive, which might indicate auto-approvals.

3. **Review A-C timing:** Find claims closed within 2 hours of assignment without any other activities in between.

4. **Examine E-N short intervals:** Filter out cases where notify happens shortly after evaluation, check if other steps are missing.

I need to structure these queries properly with PostgreSQL syntax, using window functions and date arithmetic. Also, consider joining with adjusters table to see if certain regions or specialists have more anomalies.

### Anomalies Identified

1. **R to P (Receive  Approve)**
   - Average: ~25 hours
   - Low STDEV suggests artificial scheduling constraints

2. **P to N (Approve  Notify)**
   - Long average delay (7 days)
   - High variability indicates inconsistent notification timing

3. **A to C (Assign  Close)**
   - Unusually short duration (2 hours)
   - May indicate skipping of intermediate steps

4. **E to N (Evaluate  Notify)**
   - Extremely rapid transition (5 minutes average)

### Hypotheses for Anomalies

1. **R to P (Automated Approvals)**
   - System might auto-approve claims after a fixed period
   - Human oversight could be bypassed in routine cases

2. **P to N (Batch Processing)**
   - Weekly batch notification processing
   - Resource constraints causing delays in some cases
   - Possible system errors leading to rapid notifications

3. **A to C (Premature Closure)**
   - Adjusters closing claims without proper evaluation
   - System allowing shortcuts due to high claim volume
   - Regional differences in handling times

4. **E to N (Automation or Skipped Steps)**
   - Direct notification after automated evaluation
   - Bypassing of approval step in certain cases

### Verification Queries

1. **Identify Potential Automated Approvals:**
```sql
SELECT ce.*, a.name as adjuster_name, c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce 
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id IN (
    SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE activity = 'A' AND claim_id = ce.claim_id)
WHERE ce.activity = 'P'
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e2 
    WHERE e2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
    AND e2.activity = 'R'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - e2.timestamp)) < 90000
);
```

2. **Analyze Batch Notification Patterns:**
```sql
SELECT claim_id, activity, timestamp,
       LAG(timestamp) OVER (
           PARTITION BY claim_id 
           ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity_timestamp,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - LAG(timestamp)
                           OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp))) / 86400 AS days_between
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
ORDER BY claim_id, timestamp;
```

3. **Identify Premature Closures:**
```sql
SELECT ce.*, a.region, c.claim_type
FROM claim_events ce
JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ce.resource
JOIN claims c ON ce.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE ce.activity = 'C'
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e2 
    WHERE e2.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
    AND e2.activity = 'A'
    AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce.timestamp - e2.timestamp)) < 7200)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e3 
    WHERE e3.claim_id = ce.claim_id 
    AND e3.activity IN ('E', 'P')
    AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp
);
```

4. **Examine Evaluate to Notify Transitions:**
```sql
WITH claim_activities AS (
  SELECT ce.*, LAG(ce.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) as prev_timestamp,
         LAG(ce.activity) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.claim_id ORDER BY ce.timestamp) as prev_activity
  FROM claim_events ce
)
SELECT ca.*, c.claim_type, a.name as adjuster_name
FROM claim_activities ca
JOIN claims c ON ca.claim_id = c.claim_id
LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON a.adjuster_id = ca.resource
WHERE ca.activity = 'N'
AND ca.prev_activity = 'E'
AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ca.timestamp - ca.prev_timestamp)) < 360;
```

These queries aim to identify patterns that could confirm or contradict the hypotheses, helping to understand whether these anomalies are due to systemic issues, human error, or potential fraud in claim processing.
