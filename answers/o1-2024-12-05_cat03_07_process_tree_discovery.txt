Below is a process tree model that captures the main flow and the optional repeating loop of requesting and re-validating information.

**Rationale**

1. **Main sequence:**  
   The core process always starts with:  
   - **Receive Application (RA)**  
   - **Validate Form (VF)**  
   - **Assess Eligibility (AE)**

   After assessing eligibility, the process eventually leads to:  
   - **Approval Decision (AD)**  
   - **Send Confirmation (SC)**  
   - **Archive Case (AC)**

   This forms the main linear flow:  
   `->('RA', 'VF', 'AE', ..., 'AD', 'SC', 'AC')`

2. **Optional looping for missing information:**  
   The loop occurs after **Assess Eligibility (AE)** if information is missing. In that loop:  
   - One or more **Request Missing Info (RMI)** activities occur.  
   - After receiving the missing info, the form must be re-validated (**VF**).

   This pattern can repeat multiple times. We have observed the possibility of multiple RMIs before another VF, and we have also observed that in some cases no RMI is needed.

   The loop operator `* (A,B)` means:
   - Execute `A` once.
   - Then either exit the loop or execute `B` and then `A` again.

   To model zero or more cycles of RMI(s) + VF, we place a loop after AE. We choose `A = tau` (a silent step) so that the first check can lead to immediate exit if no missing info is needed. If missing info is needed, we perform `B`, which includes the sequence of RMI(s) and a VF.

   Within `B`, we handle multiple RMI occurrences using another loop. A suitable pattern is `*('RMI', tau)`, which ensures at least one RMI and allows repetition of RMI as needed:
   - First iteration: do `RMI`.
   - If more RMI needed: do `tau` (no operation) and `RMI` again, and so forth.

   After collecting the necessary info (one or multiple RMI), we execute `VF` to re-validate the form.

   Thus the loop after AE can be represented as:  
   `* (tau, ->(*('RMI', tau), 'VF'))`

   - `tau` allows for zero iterations (no missing info scenario) if we choose to exit immediately.
   - `->(*('RMI', tau), 'VF')` represents an iteration of requesting missing info once or multiple times and then performing a VF.

**Final Process Tree**

Combining these elements, we get the complete process tree:

```
-> (
  'RA',
  'VF',
  'AE',
  * (
    tau,
    -> (
      * ('RMI', tau),
      'VF'
    )
  ),
  'AD',
  'SC',
  'AC'
)
```

**Interpretation:**

- The process starts with `RA -> VF -> AE`.
- Then it enters a loop:
  - If no missing info is required, it just does `tau` and exits the loop immediately, proceeding to `AD -> SC -> AC`.
  - If missing info is required, from the `tau` step it moves to `B`:
    - In `B`, it executes `*('RMI', tau)` one or more times (allowing one or multiple RMI events),
    - Then performs a `VF` to re-validate.
    - After this iteration, it returns to the `tau` step, and can either repeat the pattern (if more info is needed) or exit the loop.
- Finally, once no more missing info is needed, it proceeds to `AD -> SC -> AC`.

This process tree thus captures the main flow, the optional repeating loops of missing information requests and re-validation, and the eventual approval, confirmation, and archival.
