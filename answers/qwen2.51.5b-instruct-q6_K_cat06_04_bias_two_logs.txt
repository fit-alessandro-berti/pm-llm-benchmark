The event logs for both groups exhibit different biases that can be identified through examination of the key attributes involved.

### Group A (Protected Group)

- **LocalResident**: All cases in this log have a `FALSE` value, indicating that no residents were explicitly involved.
  
- **CommunityGroup**: In all cases, `None` is listed as the CommunityGroup. This suggests an absence of any community-specific context or involvement.

- **PreliminaryScore**: The preliminary score remains consistently at 720 across all activities in this log (ApplicationReceived, DataValidation, PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, FinalDecision).

- **CommunityBoost Adjustment**: Since `FALSE` values indicate no community involvement, there are no instances where a CommunityBoost adjustment is applied.

### Group B (Unprotected Group)

- **LocalResident**: All cases in this log have a `TRUE` value, indicating that residents were explicitly involved.
  
- **CommunityGroup**: In all cases, the CommunityGroup attribute shows different values (`None`, "Highland Civic Darts Club", etc.), reflecting community-specific contexts or affiliations.

- **PreliminaryScore**: The preliminary score fluctuates between 710 and 740 across various activities (ApplicationReceived, DataValidation, PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, FinalDecision). This variability suggests that the score is not consistently managed for residents as in Group A.

- **CommunityBoost Adjustment**: Instances where `TRUE` values are present indicate a community-specific boost to the preliminary score. For example:
  - U001: +10 (Community Boost) after DataValidation and PreliminaryScoring.
  - U002: No adjustments for ManualReview or FinalDecision, but +10 after ApplicationReceived and DataValidation if LocalResident is `TRUE`.
  - U003: +10 (Community Boost) both during DataValidation and ManualReview.

### Bias Manifestation

**Bias in Group A:**

- **Lack of Resident Involvement**: The absence of resident involvement across all activities suggests that the protected group does not consider community-specific factors or residents' opinions. This results in a uniform score for everyone without distinguishing between different situations involving residents versus non-residents.

**Bias in Group B:**

- **Community-Related Score Adjustments**: While this introduces variability, it can be seen as a form of bias when applied to resident cases (LocalResident = TRUE) and not applied uniformly to non-resident cases. The +10 CommunityBoost adjustment indicates that residents' activities are given more weight or consideration compared to those without explicit community affiliations.

### Conclusion

- **Group A** exhibits no bias in its handling of residents as the score remains consistent for everyone regardless of whether they are resident or not.
  
- **Group B**, on the other hand, demonstrates a form of bias where the final decision is influenced by the presence of residents. This can lead to inconsistent outcomes when considering decisions made solely based on non-resident activities versus those involving residents.

This difference highlights how different communities within an organization might have varying expectations or needs regarding community involvement and its implications for decision-making processes.
