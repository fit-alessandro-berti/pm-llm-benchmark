### Analysis of POWL Models

#### Model 1:
This model follows a linear sequence where activities are executed one after another based on dependencies defined through explicit edges in the `StrictPartialOrder` structure.

Post_Job_Ad -> Screen_Candidates -> (Screen_Candidates -> Make_Hiring_Decision)
                                      \-> Conduct_Interviews ->
                                                    |
                                                   /
                                                  V
                                          Make_Hiring_Decision
                                                 |
                                                 v
                                          Onboard_Employee 
                                                 |
                                             Add_to_Payroll
                                                 |
                                                Close_Case
```

#### Model 2:
This model introduces loop and choice structures, allowing for more flexible execution paths. However, this flexibility can also introduce potential anomalies when compared to a standard Hire-to-Retire process.

Post_Job_Ad -> Screen_Candidates
               \-> Conduct_Interviews ->
                                       V
                                  Make_Hiring_Decision 
                                      / \
                                     /   \
                                    /     X
                                   V       Skip_Payroll_Addition
                          Onboard_Employee -> 
                                             | (loop)
                                             v
                                          Loop_Onboarding
                                                  |
                                                  v
                                              Payroll_Addition_or_Skip ->
                                                                           V
                                                                         Close_Case
```

### Identification of Anomalies

#### Model 1:
- **Anomaly:** The model does not include conducting interviews after screening candidates. Typically, interviews are a critical step in the hiring process and should follow the candidate screening phase.
  
#### Model 2:
- **Potential Severity: Conducting Interviews Directly After Posting Job Ad** - This might be seen as less severe since the activity can still fit logically into the sequence if an organization decides to conduct pre-screening interviews alongside job postings. However, it's non-standard and introduces a deviation from typical hiring processes.
  
- **Anomaly:** The loop structure for onboarding (`*(Onboard, skip)`) is unclear in its purpose. Typically, onboarding involves a series of activities that are completed only once the employee starts working (i.e., thereâ€™s no need to re-onboard employees). This loop might be mistakenly representing an iterative or repetitive process that doesn't fit the typical hiring scenario.
  
- **Anomaly:** The choice structure for payroll (`X(Payroll, skip)`) allows skipping the addition of new hires into the payroll system. This is a severe anomaly because adding employees to the payroll is a critical step in the onboarding phase and crucial for ensuring timely payment.

### Decision and Justification

**Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process:
- **Reasoning:** While Model 1 does not include the interview activity post-screening, this can be addressed by redefining the transition sequence to ensure that interviews are conducted after screening. The remaining steps in Model 1 form a logical and coherent flow consistent with typical hiring processes.

**Model 2** introduces more severe anomalies due to its flexibility:
- **Flexibility Issues:** The loop onboarding structure disrupts process integrity as it implies repetitive onboarding activities, which is not standard.
- **Critical Step Skip:** Allowing the potential skipping of payroll addition post-onboarding can have serious financial and operational implications. This step is non-negotiable in most organizations.

In conclusion, while both models introduce deviations from a normative Hire-to-Retire process, Model 1 remains closer to standard practices by maintaining critical steps in a coherent sequence, albeit with the identified gap of missing interviews post-screening, which can be rectified.
