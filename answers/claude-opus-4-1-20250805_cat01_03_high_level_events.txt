## Analysis and Grouping of Manufacturing Events

Based on the event log analysis, I've identified **four distinct high-level process steps** that represent coherent stages in this metal sheet manufacturing workflow.

### 1. High-Level Process Steps Identified

#### **Step 1: Material Staging & Preparation**
**Low-level events included:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Timeframe:** ~25-30 seconds per case

#### **Step 2: Welding Assembly**
**Low-level events included:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Timeframe:** ~15-20 seconds per case

#### **Step 3: Surface Treatment**
**Low-level events included:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Timeframe:** ~15-20 seconds per case

#### **Step 4: Quality Validation**
**Low-level events included:**
- Measure weld integrity
- Visual check

**Timeframe:** ~10-15 seconds per case

### 2. Rationale for Groupings

#### **Material Staging & Preparation**
- **Logical Cohesion:** All activities prepare the raw material for the main manufacturing process
- **Resource Pattern:** Involves initial operator handling transitioning to automated positioning/heating
- **Purpose:** Establishes material traceability (barcode), proper positioning, and thermal conditioning
- **Sequential Dependency:** These steps must occur before any fabrication can begin

#### **Welding Assembly**
- **Logical Cohesion:** Core transformation activities that permanently alter the material
- **Resource Pattern:** Single operator (Operator B) performs all welding operations with consistent tooling
- **Purpose:** Primary value-adding fabrication step
- **Temporal Clustering:** Events occur in rapid succession (5-second intervals)

#### **Surface Treatment**
- **Logical Cohesion:** Post-assembly finishing operations
- **Resource Pattern:** Automated units performing complementary coating operations
- **Purpose:** Protective finishing that requires both application and curing
- **Sequential Dependency:** Must occur after assembly but before final inspection

#### **Quality Validation**
- **Logical Cohesion:** All verification and inspection activities
- **Resource Pattern:** Mix of automated (sensor) and manual (operator) quality checks
- **Purpose:** Ensures product meets specifications before completion
- **Note:** While weld integrity measurement occurs between welding and coating, it logically belongs to quality validation as it's a verification step

  }
}

### 4. Alternative Grouping Consideration

An alternative approach could separate quality checks into:
- **In-process quality** (weld integrity measurement immediately after welding)
- **Final quality** (visual check after coating)

However, I chose to group all quality activities together because:
1. They share the same purpose (verification/validation)
2. This grouping provides clearer process visibility for quality management
3. It aligns with typical manufacturing quality frameworks where all inspection points are tracked together

### 5. Benefits of This Aggregation

- **Process Visibility:** Reduces 12-13 granular events to 4 meaningful stages
- **Performance Analysis:** Enables comparison of cycle times for each major step
- **Resource Utilization:** Clear view of which resources are involved in each phase
- **Quality Tracking:** Consolidated view of all quality checkpoints
- **Process Mining:** Facilitates discovery of process variants and bottlenecks at a manageable level of abstraction
