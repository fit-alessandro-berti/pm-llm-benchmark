### **Inspection and Marketing**
10. How are inspection and photography appointments coordinated with landlords who may have limited availability? Is there a specific window of time within which both tasks must be completed?
11. In cases where inspection issues are identified, how are repairs prioritized and tracked? Who is responsible for ensuring timely completion of the necessary fixes?
12. What typical challenges arise when collaborating with landlords on marketing materials, and how are these mitigated (e.g., disagreements over photographs, descriptions, or pricing)?

### **Tenant Screening and Lease Negotiation**
14. How do you handle a situation where multiple suitable tenants apply for the same property? Are there policies in place to prioritize one applicant over another?
15. Can you describe the negotiation process when a tenant requests different lease terms (e.g., lower rent, a shorter lease)? How is this balanced with the landlord’s preferences or company pricing guidelines?
16. Are there any scenarios where a prospective tenant’s application is escalated to higher-level approval before finalizing the lease?

### **Compliance and Internal Quality Checks**
17. How do compliance officers ensure that properties meet fair housing regulations during the onboarding process? Are there specific checklists or tools they rely on?
18. What triggers a financial analyst’s review of the rental price? Are there thresholds or warning signs that require extra scrutiny?
19. How does the IT department verify the accuracy and integration of a property’s listing and data? What happens if discrepancies are identified?

20. What is the most common type of exception that arises during the onboarding process, and how is it typically resolved?
21. How do you handle landlords with unique insurance requirements or custom lease clauses? Are these stored in a centralized way for future reference?
22. For properties that require extensive pre-launch repairs or remediation (e.g., post-inspection), is there ever a case where onboarding is delayed or halted entirely?

26. Are there any specific timeframes or service-level agreements (SLAs) that each stage of the onboarding process must adhere to? If so, what are the consequences of missing these deadlines?
27. Are any stages of the process required to run in parallel to save time (e.g., tenant screening starting before marketing is finalized)?

---

### **Process Improvement**
28. What are the biggest bottlenecks in the onboarding process, and how are they typically addressed?
29. Has the onboarding process evolved over time? If so, what were the major changes, and what prompted those adjustments?
30. Are there any ongoing efforts to streamline or automate portions of the process, such as document verification or tenant screening?
