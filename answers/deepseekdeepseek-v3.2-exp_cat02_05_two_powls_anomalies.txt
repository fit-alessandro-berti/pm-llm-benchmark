Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Standard Hire-to-Retire Process Logic**

A typical “Hire-to-Retire” process follows roughly this order:

1. **Post Job Ad**   
2. **Screen Candidates**   
3. **Conduct Interviews**   
4. **Make Hiring Decision**   
5. **Onboard Employee**   
6. **Add to Payroll**   
7. **Close Case**

Key logical constraints:

- You cannot interview before screening (though in some variations, screening may overlap with interviews, but usually screening comes first).
- You cannot onboard before deciding to hire.
- You cannot add to payroll before onboarding.
- Closing the case should be the final step after payroll setup.

## **2. Analysis of Model 1**

**Model 1** is a `StrictPartialOrder` with edges:

```
Post  Screen
Screen  Decide
Screen  Interview
Decide  Onboard
Onboard  Payroll
Payroll  Close
```

**Observations:**

- `Screen  Interview` and `Screen  Decide` are both present, but **no edge from Interview to Decide**.
- This means after `Screen`, both `Interview` and `Decide` are enabled in parallel.
- This is an anomaly: you can make a hiring decision without conducting interviews.
- Also, `Interview` and `Decide` are concurrent — so you could decide before interviewing, which is illogical.

**Anomaly severity:** High — violates the fundamental hiring logic (decision without interview possible).

---

## **3. Analysis of Model 2**

**Model 2** structure:

```
Post  Screen
Post  Interview
Interview  Decide
Decide  loop_onboarding
loop_onboarding  xor_payroll
xor_payroll  Close
```

Where:
- `loop_onboarding = LOOP(Onboard, skip)` means: do Onboard, then either exit or do skip then Onboard again (but skip is silent, so effectively: Onboard can be repeated).
- `xor_payroll = XOR(Payroll, skip)` means: either do Payroll or skip it.

**Observations:**

- `Post  Interview` exists without requiring `Screen` to be done first.  
  This means you can interview candidates without screening — possible but unusual; maybe acceptable in some processes, but generally screening precedes interviews.
- `Post  Screen` and `Post  Interview` are concurrent, so screening and interviewing can happen in any order or parallel — less severe than deciding without interview.
- Loop on onboarding: unusual but possible if onboarding is a multi-step repeatable process — not a major logical flaw.
- XOR on payroll: skipping payroll is a severe anomaly — you cannot hire without adding to payroll (unless it’s an unpaid volunteer, but in standard HR, payroll is mandatory).

**Anomaly severity:**  
- Skipping payroll: High severity (violates business rule).  
- Interview without screening: Medium severity (violates good practice but not impossible).  
- Loop onboarding: Low severity (can be reasonable).

## **4. Comparison & Decision**

**Model 1** allows: Decide without Interview  **Makes hiring process nonsensical**.

**Model 2** allows: Skip payroll  **Violates legal/operational requirement**, and Interview without Screening  less critical.

Between the two, **Model 1’s flaw** is more severe from a *process correctness* perspective because it breaks the causal link between interviewing and deciding, which is core to hiring.  
Model 2’s payroll skip is also severe, but it’s an optional skip (XOR), so in some paths payroll happens. In Model 1, the concurrency between Interview and Decide is unavoidable in the model — it’s not a choice but a design flaw in partial order.

However, note: in Model 2, the `Post  Interview` and `Post  Screen` concurrency means interviews could happen before or without screening — but not as severe as deciding without interview.

---

If we imagine a “normative” model, it would be:

```
Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close
```

Neither model matches perfectly, but **Model 2** is closer if we ignore the `skip` in payroll (which is a big issue) and the screening-interview order issue.  
But Model 1’s flaw is worse in terms of logical soundness.

---

Given the task’s focus on which “more closely aligns with a normative version,” I’d say:

**Model 2** is closer, because:

- It has `Interview  Decide` order preserved.
- It does not allow deciding before interviewing.
- The screening-interview order is less critical than interview-decision order.
- The payroll skip is bad, but it’s an explicit choice, not a structural concurrency flaw; in practice, you’d remove the skip option to fix it.

---

**Final Answer:**

Model 2 more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process, because it maintains the essential ordering of interviews before hiring decisions, whereas Model 1 allows a hiring decision to be made without interviews, which is a fundamental logical flaw.
