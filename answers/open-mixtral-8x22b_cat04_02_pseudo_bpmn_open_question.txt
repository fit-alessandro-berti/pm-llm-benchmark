To optimize the process and reduce turnaround times, we can make use of automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics. Here's a proposed redesigned process:

1. **Receive Customer Request (Task A):** Implement an automated system that categorizes requests based on standard or custom criteria. This can be achieved through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms that analyze incoming requests, helping to speed up the initial request handling.

2. **Perform Standard Validation (Task B1):** Automate this task using predefined rules and criteria. An automated system can validate customer requests in real-time, allowing for faster processing and error reduction.

3. **Run Parallel Checks (Task C1 and C2):** Ensure that credit and inventory checks are performed in parallel to reduce turnaround time. Implement an automated system that can quickly check creditworthiness and available inventory, thus minimizing delays.

4. **Calculate Delivery Date (Task D):** Implement a predictive analytics algorithm to estimate delivery dates based on historical data. This will provide more accurate delivery estimates and improve customer satisfaction.

5. **Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis (Task B2):** Incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns that indicate whether a custom request is feasible or not. This will help to predict the feasibility of custom requests with higher accuracy and reduce the time spent on manual analysis.

6. **Prepare Custom Quotation (Task E1) or Send Rejection Notice (Task E2):** Automate the generation of custom quotations or rejection notices based on the feasibility analysis. This will reduce turnaround times and improve customer satisfaction by providing quicker responses.

7. **Obtain Manager Approval (Task F):** Implement a dynamic resource allocation system that identifies the most suitable manager to review and approve each request based on their expertise, workload, and availability. This will ensure that requests are handled efficiently and reduce turnaround times.

8. **Generate Final Invoice (Task G):** Automate the invoice generation process to ensure accuracy and reduce manual intervention. This will also improve turnaround times and customer satisfaction.

9. **Re-evaluate Conditions (Task H):** Incorporate predictive analytics to identify the root cause of the rejection and provide recommendations for overcoming any issues. This will help to streamline the process and avoid unnecessary delays.

10. **Send Confirmation to Customer (Task I):** Implement an automated system that sends confirmation emails to customers upon completion of the request. This will ensure that customers are kept informed and improve overall customer satisfaction.

**New Decision Gateways and Subprocesses:**

1. **Predictive Decision Gateway:** Implement a predictive analytics algorithm that analyzes incoming requests and identifies those likely to require customization. This will enable proactive routing of requests to the appropriate path, reducing turnaround times and improving overall performance.

2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation Subprocess:** Develop a subprocess that dynamically reallocates resources based on the complexity of the request, workload, and expertise. This will ensure that resources are utilized efficiently and improve overall performance.

**Potential Impact on Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Operational Complexity:**

* **Performance:** The proposed changes will improve overall performance by reducing turnaround times, minimizing manual intervention, and improving resource utilization.
* **Customer Satisfaction:** Automating various tasks, providing accurate delivery estimates, and sending timely confirmations will improve customer satisfaction.
* **Operational Complexity:** While the initial implementation may increase operational complexity, the long-term benefits of automation and predictive analytics will ultimately simplify the process and reduce operational complexity.
