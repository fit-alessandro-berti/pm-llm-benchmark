Below is an analysis of each model with a discussion of their deviations from what one would expect in a standard “Hire-to-Retire” process, followed by a conclusion on which model is closer to the normative process.

### **1. Analysis of Model 1**

**Intended Normative Sequence:**  
A typical Hire-to-Retire process would follow the order:  
1. **Post_Job_Ad**  
2. **Screen_Candidates**  
3. **Conduct_Interviews**  
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision**  
5. **Onboard_Employee**  
6. **Add_to_Payroll**  
7. **Close_Case**

**What Model 1 Does:**  
- **Sequence Defined:**  
  - **Post_Job_Ad** is followed by **Screen_Candidates**.
  - From **Screen_Candidates**, two edges go out:
    - One edge leads to **Make_Hiring_Decision**.
    - Another edge leads to **Conduct_Interviews**.
  - After **Make_Hiring_Decision**, the flow continues with **Onboard_Employee**, then **Add_to_Payroll**, and finally **Close_Case**.

**Anomalies in Model 1:**  
- **Ambiguous Positioning of Interviews:**  
  - In the normative process, interviewing should typically occur **before** making the hiring decision. Here, however, the **Interview** activity is not clearly sequenced relative to **Make_Hiring_Decision**.  
  - Because both **Decide** and **Interview** are directly preceded by **Screen_Candidates**, the model allows for the hiring decision to be taken without a properly sequenced interview, or for interviews to run in parallel with decision-making.  
  - This misplacement could lead to a situation where a hiring decision is made without the benefit of the candidate interview, thereby deviating from good practice.

- **Overall Integrity:**  
  - Aside from the interview’s ambiguous ordering, the main chain—Post → Screen → Decide → Onboard → Payroll → Close—matches the standard process.  
  - The anomaly here is more about the “where does the interview fit” question rather than a complete breakdown of essential steps.

### **2. Analysis of Model 2**

**What Model 2 Does:**  
- **Initial Steps:**  
  - **Post_Job_Ad** is followed by two parallel edges: one to **Screen_Candidates** and one to **Conduct_Interviews**.  
  - **Conduct_Interviews** is then followed by **Make_Hiring_Decision**, which forces the interview to precede the decision.
- **After Decision – Onboarding and Payroll:**  
  - Instead of a straightforward **Onboard_Employee** activity, the model uses a **LOOP** operator with children `[Onboard_Employee, skip]`. According to the loop semantics, this means that after onboarding, the process may repeat the onboarding activity one or more times.
  - After onboarding, the process enters an **XOR** operator with children `[Add_to_Payroll, skip]`, meaning that adding the employee to payroll becomes optional—the process may choose to “skip” this step.
- **Finally,** the process ends with **Close_Case**.

**Anomalies in Model 2:**  
- **Screening vs. Interview Ordering:**  
  - By placing both **Screen_Candidates** and **Conduct_Interviews** immediately after **Post_Job_Ad** (with no enforced order between them), the model implies that interviews can start concurrently with or even before candidate screening. This deviates from the standard approach where screening is used to filter candidates before inviting them for an interview.
  
- **Loop on Onboarding:**  
  - The use of a **LOOP** operator for **Onboard_Employee** suggests that onboarding could be repeated. In a normative Hire-to-Retire process, onboarding is a one-time, well-defined activity—not something that should iterate.
  
- **Optional Payroll Addition:**  
  - The **XOR** operator around **Add_to_Payroll** means that the process may choose to skip adding the employee to the payroll system. Since adding a new hire to payroll is a fundamental part of hiring, making it optional undermines the process integrity.
  
- **Overall Integrity:**  
  - While the interview does correctly precede the decision, the decoupling of candidate screening and the introduction of a looping and an optional step for two key activities (onboarding and payroll) represent more severe deviations from the normative process.

### **3. Which Model Is Closer to the Normative Process?**

**Decision:**  
**Model 1** more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process.

**Justification:**  
- **Core Sequence Preservation:**  
  - In Model 1, aside from the problematic placement of the interview activity, the main sequence (Posting → Screening → Decision → Onboarding → Payroll → Closure) is maintained. This is the backbone of a standard hiring process.
  
- **Impact of Anomalies:**  
  - **Model 1’s anomaly** (the ambiguous position of interviews) could potentially be fixed by enforcing a proper ordering (i.e., making sure interviews occur before the decision). Although important, this is a “local” sequencing issue.
  - **Model 2’s anomalies** are more fundamental:
    - The parallel execution of screening and interviewing distorts the candidate evaluation process.
    - Allowing onboarding to loop introduces the possibility of repeating a one-time activity.
    - Making the payroll addition optional compromises a core aspect of hiring.
  
- **Process Integrity:**  
  - The deviations in Model 2 affect multiple critical steps and could lead to scenarios where a candidate might be hired without ever being properly screened, onboarded repeatedly, or even added to the payroll system. These issues undermine the integrity and correctness of the overall process.

### **Conclusion**

While **both models introduce anomalies compared to a normative Hire-to-Retire process**, **Model 1** retains the essential ordering of steps (with the primary flaw being the misplaced interview) and thus is closer to the standard process. In contrast, **Model 2**’s use of concurrent execution for screening and interviewing, a looping construct for onboarding, and an optional payroll step represent more severe and disruptive deviations.

Thus, **Model 1** is the preferable (or more normative) version when considering process correctness and integrity.
