**Explanation:**

1. **Root:** The process starts with a true concurrency operator '+' where you can either receive an application (RA) or proceed to the main process flow.

2. **Main Flow:**  
   -  `-> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',  -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE', ... ))` represents the sequential execution of Validate Form (VF) and Assess Eligibility (AE).

3. **Loop:**
   - The loop operator '*'  is used to handle the potential repetition of requesting missing information (RMI) and re-validating the form.

4. **Loop Iterations:**  
   - Inside the loop:
      - Request Missing Info (RMI) is executed immediately.
      - Then, the process seqentialy  Validates the form (VF) again, followed by Assessing Eligibility (AE).
      - The loop continues until it exits.

5. **Final Steps:** 
   - Once the loop finishes or if there is no need for it:
      -  'Approval Decision (AD)' is made.
      -  'Send Confirmation (SC)' and 'Archive Case (AC)' are executed sequentially to complete the process.




This process tree captures the main flow in a sequential manner while allowing for the flexibility of the repetitions in a structured way.
