Okay, let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id based on their timestamps. Since the events are ordered by timestamp within a case, we can use ROW_NUMBER() or RANK() functions with partitioning by case_id and ordering by timestamp. That should give us an ordered list of activity names per case.

Next, we need to group these sequences together to identify unique process variants. To do this, I'll concatenate the activities into a single string for each case, making sure they're in order. The STRING_AGG function with ORDER BY should work here.

Once we have the unique variants and their counts, we need to find the top K most frequent ones. Using RANK() or DENSE_RANK(), ordered by the count in descending order, will help us identify these top variants.

Finally, we filter the original event_log to include only events from cases that belong to these top K variants. This involves joining the original data with a subquery that identifies the case_ids of interest based on their variant ranks.

I should also handle any potential NULL values and ensure proper ordering in all steps. Let's structure the SQL query accordingly.

Here's a solution using DuckDB SQL:

```sql
WITH activity_sequences AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE_ID,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '->' ORDER BY timestamp) as variant_sequence
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    variant_sequence,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rank
  FROM activity_sequences
  GROUP BY variant_sequence
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN activity_sequences a ON e.case_id = a.case_id
JOIN variant_counts v ON a.variant_sequence = v.variant_sequence
WHERE v.rank <= K;
```

Let's break down how this works:

1. **activity_sequences** CTE:
   - Uses `STRING_AGG` with ordering by timestamp to create an ordered sequence of activities for each case
   - This ensures we capture the exact order in which activities occurred within each process instance

2. **variant_counts** CTE:
   - Groups sequences and counts their frequency across all cases
   - Uses `RANK()` to assign a rank to each variant based on its frequency
   - Higher ranks correspond to more frequent variants

3. Final SELECT statement:
   - Joins the original event_log with the filtered sequences from top K variants
   - Returns only events that belong to cases matching these top variants
   - The value of `K` should be replaced with your desired number of top variants (e.g., 5 for top 5)

This query ensures we:
- Preserve the temporal ordering within each case using timestamp
- Identify unique process patterns across all instances
- Efficiently count and rank variant frequencies
- Filter out cases that don't match our top K variants

The result will be a filtered event log containing only events from cases that follow one of the most frequently occurring process variants.
