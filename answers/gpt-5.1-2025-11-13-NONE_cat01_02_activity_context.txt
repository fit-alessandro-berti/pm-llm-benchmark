Below is a contextualized reinterpretation of the log, with recurring activities renamed so their role in the process is clear. I only rename where the **same label recurs in a case with different meanings or purposes**.

---

## 1. Contextual differences for recurring activities

### A. “Verify Documents”
Occurs multiple times in C001 and C003.

- **C001**
  - 1st occurrence: Initial ID check right after online submission.
  - 2nd occurrence: Re-check after missing ID scan is submitted.
- **C003**
  - 1st occurrence: Initial physical ID check at branch.
  - 2nd occurrence: Re-verification after account details are corrected.

**Interpretation:**  
The first verification is an **initial identity check**; the second is a **post-correction or post-submission re-check**. Also, the channel (online vs branch) slightly changes context (digital vs physical), but the main distinction is **initial vs repeat verification** triggered by a prior issue.

### B. “Call Customer”
Occurs multiple times in C001, C002, and C003.

- **C001**
  - Single call: To request missing docs after incomplete verification.
- **C002**
  - 1st call: To clarify an account discrepancy uncovered after verification.
  - 2nd call: To confirm that internal adjustments have been made.
- **C003**
  - Single call: To ask the customer to return to the branch.

**Interpretation:**  
Different calls serve different purposes: requesting missing documents, clarifying issues, confirming changes, or recalling the customer to branch.

## 2. Renamed activities (by type and context)

**Verify Documents:**
- Initial digital ID check after online submission  `Verify Documents - Initial ID Check (Digital)`
- Re-check after extra documents uploaded  `Verify Documents - Recheck After Additional Docs`
- Initial physical ID check at branch  `Verify Documents - Initial ID Check (Branch)`
- Re-check after account adjustment  `Verify Documents - Recheck After Account Adjustment`

**Call Customer:**
- Call to request missing documents  `Call Customer - Request Missing Documents`
- Call to clarify account discrepancy  `Call Customer - Clarify Account Discrepancy`
- Call to confirm adjustments  `Call Customer - Confirm Account Adjustments`
- Call to have customer return to branch  `Call Customer - Request Customer Return to Branch`

Other activities (Initiate Request, Submit Additional, Adjust Account, Approve Request) do not recur with meaningfully different roles within the same case, so they can remain as-is.

## 4. Justification of naming choices (brief)

- **Initial vs Recheck (Verify Documents):**  
  - “Initial” comes from being the first verification step immediately after request initiation.  
  - “Recheck” indicates a repeated verification prompted by a prior problem (missing docs or incorrect account data).  
  - The qualifiers “(Digital)” vs “(Branch)” capture channel/resource differences that could matter in process analysis.

- **Purpose-based call naming (Call Customer):**  
  - The **Additional Context** field explicitly states why each call is made (request missing docs, clarify discrepancy, confirm adjustments, ask customer to return).  
  - Names are aligned with these purposes so that “call” events can be distinguished in models or analytics (e.g., calls that generate work vs calls that close work).

These renamed activities make the underlying process variants visible and disambiguate what would otherwise look like repeated identical steps.
