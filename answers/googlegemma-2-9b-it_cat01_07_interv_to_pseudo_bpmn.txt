## BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval

**Goal:** Process an incoming invoice for payment.

**Start Event:** New invoice received (via email or another method).

**Activities:**

1. **Invoice Verification:**  
    -  Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) checks if the invoice has a valid purchase order (PO) number.  
    - **Gateway:** If no valid PO number:
        - Send a request for information back to the supplier.
    - **If PO number valid:** Log invoice into accounting system.

2. **Purchasing Confirmation:**

    - Forward invoice to Purchasing Officer (Dan) for confirmation on goods/services receipt and accuracy of invoice details.
    - **Gateway:** If PO number is missing: 
        - Purchasing informs Mary and halts workflow until PO number is provided.

3. **Invoice Matching:**
    - If confirmation received from Purchasing, Mary matches invoice line items against the PO in the accounting system.

4. **Discrepancy Handling:**
    -  **Gateway:** If discrepancies found:
        - Mary emails Purchasing team for clarification.
        -  **Branch:** If discrepancies cannot be easily resolved:
            - Mary escalates to her supervisor (Rita).
            - Rita works with suppliers, departments, and potentially creates a retrospective PO for non-PO related invoices.
            - Back-tracking to the invoice matching step once discrepancies are resolved. 

5. **Manager Approval:**

    - Once invoice is matched (or discrepancies resolved), trigger Manager approval request.  
    - Manager (Carlos) reviews invoice details, PO, and confirmation, and can:
        - **Approve:** Invoice proceeds to payment scheduling.
        - **Reject:** Requires further investigation by Mary/Rita.

6. **Payment Scheduling:**

    - After manager approval, Accounts Payable schedules the invoice for payment.


**End Event:** Invoice payment processed.

**Notes:**


* Roles may overlap based on workload or specific situation.
* The exception handling process can introduce complexities and delays. 
* Some activities like supplier communication may not be clearly defined in the interviews. 



This model captures a general flow based on the interviews.  Further data refinement and clarification around unclear steps or decision points would yield a more precise  and detailed model.
