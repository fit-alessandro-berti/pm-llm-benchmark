To identify potentially sensitive attributes related to fairness, we focus on characteristics that might be protected by anti-discrimination laws or ethical considerations in the context of lending (as implied by the process involving loan applications). Sensitive attributes typically include, but are not limited to:

1. **Gender**
2. **Ethnicity/National Origin** (sometimes inferred through language proficiency or citizenship)
3. **Age** (not directly listed, but could be inferred from other data if available, e.g., through date of birth derived from `start_timestamp` and assuming a constant age range for applicants)
4. **Disability Status** (not explicitly mentioned, but in some contexts, certain medical examinations or assessments might indirectly relate to this; however, there's no clear indication here)
5. **Religious Affiliation** (not mentioned)
6. **Sexual Orientation** (not mentioned)

Given the attributes listed in your event log:

- **`case:gender`**: This is a straightforward sensitive attribute regarding fairness, as gender discrimination is a concern in many jurisdictions.
  
- **`case:citizen`**: While not always considered a traditional sensitive attribute like gender or ethnicity, citizenship status can intersect with fairness concerns, especially in contexts where loan opportunities might disproportionately affect certain citizen groups versus others. However, its sensitivity can depend on the jurisdiction's laws and the context of how it's used.

- **`case:german speaking`**: Language proficiency can sometimes serve as a proxy for ethnicity or national origin, which are protected characteristics. Discrimination based on language proficiency is not always illegal but can be problematic if it disproportionately affects certain groups in a way that aligns with protected statuses (e.g., ethnic minorities). The sensitivity here is context-dependent and might be more about ensuring equal access rather than direct discrimination concerns.

**Attributes Not Directly Related to Traditional Notions of Fairness but Worth Considering for Process Equity:**

- **`resource`**: While not traditionally sensitive, analyzing how different resources (e.g., loan officers, online systems) impact the process's outcomes can reveal systemic inequalities or biases in service provision. For instance, if certain demographic groups are more likely to interact with a particular resource that has a higher loan denial rate, it could indicate an indirect fairness issue.

**Conclusion:**
The attributes directly related to fairness concerns in your dataset are:

1. **`case:gender`** (clearly sensitive)
2. **`case:citizen`** (contextually sensitive, depending on jurisdiction and application)
3. **`case:german speaking`** (potentially sensitive as a proxy for ethnic/national origin, with context-dependent implications)

Always consider the specific legal framework of your operation's jurisdiction and the ethical guidelines your organization follows when assessing fairness in processes.
