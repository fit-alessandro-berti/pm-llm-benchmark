The process described in your DECLARE declarative model appears to be a workflow related to financial declarations, specifically focusing on processes such as submission, approval, and payment handling. Here's a detailed breakdown of how these activities interact based on the constraints:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE". This means that every trace in this workflow begins when an employee submits a declaration.

2. **Exactly 1 Occurrence**: Each of the following activities occurs exactly once in each trace:
   - Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
   - Request Payment
   - Payment Handled
   - Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR

3. **Co-Existence** and **Responded Existence** together imply that these activities must all be present within the same trace and they occur in pairs or groups:
   - "Request Payment" and "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR"
   - "Payment Handled" with both "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Request Payment"
   
4. **Alternate Response**: This constraint adds an alternating pattern for some activities:
   - After a "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", either "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" or "Request Payment" can occur, but not both in succession without the other.
   - Similarly, after "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", only "Payment Handled" can follow, and vice versa for "Request Payment".

5. **Precedence and Succession**:
   - The precedence constraints dictate that "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" must precede both "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" and "Payment Handled".
   - Additionally, "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" must come before "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled".
   
6. **Chain Response/Precedence/Succession**: These constraints imply a direct dependency between activities:
   - After "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", the sequence continues with "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", then "Request Payment", followed directly by "Payment Handled".

7. **Absence**: Certain activities are not part of this workflow and should never occur, such as any rejection or intermediate approval steps ("Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER", etc.).

From these constraints, the process can be summarized as follows:
- An employee submits a declaration.
- This triggers a sequence where the supervisor must finalize the approval.
- After final approval, a payment request is issued.
- Finally, this request leads to the handling of the payment.

This workflow ensures that each step is performed exactly once in an alternating but logical order, reflecting a well-defined process from submission through to payment.
