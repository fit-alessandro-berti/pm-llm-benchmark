Below is a textual BPMN-like process model that consolidates the interview narratives into a structured flow. Ambiguities and exception paths are noted where the accounts differ or indicate conditional behavior.

**BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process**

**Participants/Roles:**
- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)**
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**
- **Department Manager (Carlos)**
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)**
- **System (automated notifications, logging, etc.)**

---

### **Process Flow**

1. **Start Event: Invoice Received**
   - **Trigger:** An invoice arrives (typically by email).

2. **Task A: Check Invoice for Valid PO Number**  
   *(Performed by Accounts Payable Clerk, Mary)*  
   - **Artifact:** Received invoice  
   - **Decision:** Is a Purchase Order (PO) number present?
   
3. **Exclusive Gateway A: PO Number Present?**
   - **No Branch:**
     - **Task B: Request Additional Information from Supplier**  
       *(Performed by Mary, sometimes involving Karen for follow-up)*  
       - **Action:** Email the supplier asking for a valid PO or additional details.
     - **Outcome:** Process may restart upon receiving a corrected invoice.
   - **Yes Branch:**
     - **Proceed to Task C.**

4. **Task C: Log Invoice in the Accounting System**  
   *(Performed by Mary)*  
   - **Artifact:** Logged invoice record.

5. **Task D: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation**  
   *(Performed by Mary)*  
   - **Action:** Send the invoice to the Purchasing Department to confirm that the ordered goods or services have been received.

6. **Task E: Confirm Receipt and Validate Invoice Details Against PO**  
   *(Performed by Purchasing Officer, Dan)*  
   - **Artifact:** PO details and invoice line items.
   - **Action:** Compare quantities, prices, delivery charges, etc.
   - **Note:** If the PO number is missing or details do not match, Dan may:
     - **Option A:** Contact the supplier directly (with possible support from Karen), or
     - **Option B:** Ask Mary to hold the invoice until clarification is obtained.
     
7. **Exclusive Gateway B: Does the Invoice Match the PO?**
   - **Yes Branch:**
     - **Proceed to Task F.**
   - **No Branch (Discrepancy Identified):**
     - **Task F: Initiate Discrepancy Resolution Process**  
       *(Involves Mary and Dan; may also loop in Karen for pricing/contractual verification)*  
       - **Action:**  
         - Email the Purchasing team and/or supplier to clarify issues.
         - **Gateway F1:** After clarification, check if discrepancy is resolved.
             - **If Resolved:** Loop back to **Task E** to re-confirm details.
             - **If Not Resolved:** Escalate the issue.
     - **Task F2 (Exception): Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)**  
       *(For issues that cannot be resolved at the operational level)*  
       - **Action:** Rita coordinates with supplier, Purchasing, and relevant department heads to either obtain a retrospective PO or decide on invoice rejection.
       - **After Resolution:** The invoice is reinserted into the normal flow (typically returning to confirmation in **Task E** or proceeding to approval).

8. **Task G: Trigger Manager Approval Request**  
   *(Initiated by Mary/System after successful matching)*  
   - **Action:** The system sends an automatic notification (email) to the Department Manager.
   - **Artifact:** Invoice details, PO information, and confirmation from Purchasing.

9. **Task H: Review and Approve Invoice**  
   *(Performed by Department Manager, Carlos)*  
   - **Decision:**  
     - **Review Criteria:** Quantities, pricing, budget alignment, and any special notes.
   - **Exclusive Gateway C: Manager Approval Decision**
     - **Yes Branch (Approved):**
       - **Task I: Schedule Invoice for Payment**  
         *(Performed by Mary/AP team)*  
         - **Action:** Add the approved invoice to the next payment run.
         - **End Event:** Invoice Scheduled for Payment.
     - **No Branch (Not Approved/Requires Further Investigation):**
       - **Task J: Hold Invoice for Further Investigation**  
         *(Performed by Carlos, with instructions to Mary)*  
         - **Action:** Mark the invoice as “on hold” and initiate an investigation.
       - **Task K (Exception): Escalate to AP Supervisor (Rita)**  
         *(When investigation reveals persistent issues)*  
         - **Action:** Rita intervenes to coordinate resolution between departments (and possibly with Karen/suppliers).
         - **After Resolution:** The invoice is reinserted into the normal flow at the appropriate step (usually returning to confirmation or re-triggering approval).

---

### **Additional Notes and Exceptions**

- **Supplier Involvement:**  
  - When the invoice is missing a PO or contains pricing discrepancies, the Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) may be looped in to verify contract terms and request a corrected invoice.
  
- **Loop-Backs:**  
  - Discrepancy resolution (Tasks F and F1) may require looping back to re-validate the invoice details.
  
- **Ambiguities:**  
  - In some accounts, after discrepancy resolution the invoice is confirmed by Purchasing (Task E) before being sent for manager approval.
  - Manager rejections (Task J) are rare but, when they occur, result in escalation and further investigation by AP Supervisor (Task K).
