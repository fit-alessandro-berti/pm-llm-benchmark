# Dispatch of Goods — BPMN Process Diagram

## Overview
This is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** diagram for the **"Dispatch of Goods"** process at a **Computer Hardware Shop**. The process is organized into three **swim lanes** representing different organizational roles/departments:

## Swim Lanes

### 1. **Logistics**
- Contains a single task: **"Insure parcel"**, which is triggered conditionally when insurance is determined to be necessary by the Secretary.

### 2. **Secretary**
- The process **starts** with the **"Ship goods"** start event.
- A **parallel gateway (+)** splits the flow into two concurrent paths:
  - **Upper path**: Uses **"Order details"** (document) and **"Customer information"** (data store) to **"Check if insurance is required."**
    - If insurance is necessary, it routes to Logistics to **"Insure parcel."**
    - The flow **always** continues to **"Write package label."**
    - An **intermediate event** follows before merging back.
  - **Lower path**: **"Clarify shipment method"**  an **exclusive gateway (X)** asks **"Special handling?"**
    - **No**: Routes directly downward to the Warehouse.
    - **Yes**: **"Get 3 offers from logistic companies"**  **"Select logistic company and place order."**
- Both paths converge at an **exclusive merge gateway (X)** before connecting to the Warehouse.

### 3. **Warehouse**
- **"Package goods"** is performed in parallel.
- A **timer boundary event** of **48 hours** is attached — if exceeded, it triggers **"Notify customer about delay."**
- After packaging, an **event-based gateway** waits for completion.
- A **parallel join gateway (+)** synchronizes the Warehouse packaging and Secretary's administrative tasks.
- Then: **"Fill out shipment paperwork"**  **"Move package to pickup area"**  **"Shipment prepared"** (end event).

## Key BPMN Elements Used
| Element | Symbol | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Start Event** | Circle | "Ship goods" initiates the process |
| **End Event** | Bold circle | "Shipment prepared" concludes the process |
| **Parallel Gateway** | + diamond | Splits/joins concurrent paths |
| **Exclusive Gateway** | X diamond | Decision points (e.g., special handling?) |
| **Event-Based Gateway** | Pentagon-in-circle diamond | Waits for events |
| **Timer Event** | Clock icon | 48-hour delay trigger |
| **Data Object** | Document icon | "Order details" |
| **Data Store** | Cylinder | "Customer information" |
| **Intermediate Events** | Double-circle | Signal flow progression |

## Summary
The diagram models how a computer hardware shop dispatches goods by coordinating across **Logistics** (insurance), a **Secretary** (administrative decisions about shipping and labeling), and a **Warehouse** (physical packaging and shipment preparation), with proper handling of parallel tasks, conditional branching, and delay notifications.
