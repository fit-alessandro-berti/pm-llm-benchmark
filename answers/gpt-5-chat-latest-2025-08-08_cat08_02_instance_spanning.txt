Got it  — this is a complex **process mining for operations optimization** case with **instance-spanning constraints** (i.e., constraints that exist between separate cases / orders in the process, rather than just within a single order).  
Let’s go step-by-step.

---

# **1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact**

We have **four types** of inter-case constraints. Process mining can help detect, quantify, and differentiate their impact using the event log.

---

## **1.1 Shared Cold-Packing Stations**
**Description:** Only 5 Cold-Packing stations exist. Orders requiring cold-packing compete for them, causing queues when all are in use.

**How to identify in log:**
- Filter log to events where `Requires Cold Packing = TRUE` and `Activity = Packing`.
- Look at **timestamps** for `START` and see if overlap exists among > 5 concurrent users of cold stations (resource IDs like `Station C*`).
- Any order starting later even though its preceding step completed earlier may reflect waiting due to occupied cold stations.

**Metrics:**
- **Average Wait to Start Packing** for cold orders.
- **Cold-Packing Station Utilization Rate** (busy / total available time).
- **Frequency of Peak Resource Load** (5 concurrent cold orders).
- Queue length variability.

---

## **1.2 Shipping Batching**
**Description:** Orders to the same region wait for batch completion before ‘Shipping Label Generation.’

**Identification:**
- Identify last pre-shipping activity completion time for each order.
- Identify when its batch ID (e.g., `Batch B1`) starts.
- Difference = **Wait due to batching**.

**Metrics:**
- Average **Batch Wait Time** per region.
- **Batch Formation Size** and time intervals between batches for each region.
- % Orders delayed beyond target only due to batching.

---

## **1.3 Priority Order Handling (Express Preemption)**
**Description:** Express orders can interrupt resource usage by standard orders.

**Identification:**
- For each shared resource’s timeline, detect context switches: when a standard order is paused or delayed mid-process because an Express started.
- Compare start time of standard orders before and after express arrival at the same station.

**Metrics:**
- **Interruptions**: count per day/week per resource.
- **Delay for preempted standard orders**.
- Average throughput impact on standard vs express orders.

---

## **1.4 Hazardous Materials Limits**
**Description:** No more than 10 hazardous orders can be in ‘Packing’ or ‘Quality Check’ at the same time.

**Identification:**
- For each timestamp, count concurrent hazardous orders in these activities.
- Orders delayed from starting despite resource availability  limited by policy.

**Metrics:**
- Average hazardous orders concurrency.
- Number of times >10 would have occurred without limit.
- Wait time for hazardous orders specifically due to regulatory constraint.

---

## **Key Differentiation: Waiting Due to Within- vs Between-Instance Causes**
- Within-instance: slow work by the resource (duration of the ‘START–COMPLETE’ interval on same order).
- Between-instance: gap between **end of one activity** and **start of next**, where:
  - Resource is available but policy prevents starting (hazardous limit).
  - Required shared station is occupied by another order.
  - Batch is incomplete.
  
Process mining technique: **Performance Spectrum and Resource Calendar overlap analysis** to segment **idle waiting due to dependency** vs. **long processing**.

---

# **2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions**

---

## **Examples of Interactions:**
- **Express + Cold-Packing:** An express order needing cold-packing might preempt a standard cold-packing order, increasing queue length for perishable orders.
- **Batching + Hazardous Limit:** Hazardous orders destined for the same region may be ready but stuck because no more than 10 can be in packing/QC, delaying batch formation.
- **Cold-Packing + Hazardous:** If some perishable orders are also hazardous, they compete in both constraint sets, compounding the delay.
- **Express + Batching:** Express orders are delayed despite fast processing if batch trigger logic is inflexible.

---

**Why Interaction Analysis is Crucial:**
If we optimize one constraint in isolation (e.g., add cold-packing capacity) but ignore batching delays, delivery time improvements may not materialize. We need **multi-constraint modeling** to prevent shifting the bottleneck rather than removing it.

---

# **3. Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies**

---

## **Strategy 1 — Dynamic Resource Allocation for Shared Cold-Packing Stations**
**Constraints addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing, Express priority.
**Change:**
- Introduce a **predictive cold-station scheduler** using process mining forecasts of upcoming orders that need cold packing.
- Preemptive time-slot booking for express orders but with guardrails (no more than X preemptions/hour).
- Use a **virtual queue** where standard cold orders are pulled from picking in sync with cold station availability to avoid floor congestion.
**Data leverage:**
- Forecast cold demand from historical log per hour/day.
- Resource utilization trends.
**Expected outcome:**
- Reduced queue length/wait for cold-packing.
- Less disruption to standard cold orders due to express preemption.

---

## **Strategy 2 — Dynamic, Size-Time Hybrid Batching**
**Constraints addressed:** Batching for shipping, Express orders trapped in batch delays.
**Change:**
- Instead of only region-based size batching, introduce a **time limit**: after max wait (e.g., 20 min) ship existing batch to avoid long waits.
- Enable **partial batching** for high-priority orders (ship express orders immediately or in smaller high-priority batch).
**Data leverage:**
- Historical batch formation times, demand patterns per region.
- Simulation of shipment fuel cost vs. delay cost.
**Expected outcome:**
- Significantly reduced batch-induced waits, especially for express orders.
- Balanced shipping cost vs. speed metrics.

---

## **Strategy 3 — Hazardous Materials Staggered Scheduling with Buffer Zones**
**Constraints addressed:** Hazardous material concurrency limits; interaction with shipping batches.
**Change:**
- Implement a **rolling start policy** to ensure hazardous orders are introduced into packing/QC smoothly, avoiding long hazard-specific queues.
- Combine with **non-overlapping regional batching windows** so hazardous orders for one region are cleared before next hazardous group starts.
**Data leverage:**
- Historical concurrency peaks analysis from event log.
- Safety compliance incident window mapping.
**Expected outcome:**
- Compliance maintained while reducing hazardous start delays.
- Faster hazardous batch turnover.

---

## **Optional Cross-Cutting Strategy 4 — Introduce Buffer Decoupling for Preemption**
**Constraints addressed:** All, esp. preemption and batching.
**Change:**
- Add **mini-staging areas** after picking and after packing for orders to wait without blocking resource.
- Allows standard orders to complete a step without being blocked indefinitely by express preemption.
**Expected outcome:**
- Reduces cross-order blocking.
---

# **4. Simulation and Validation**

---

**Approach:**
- Use **Discrete Event Simulation** (DES) with parameters learned from event log:
  - Activity durations per type (standard/express, cold/non-cold, hazardous).
  - Resource counts and schedules.
  - Preemption rules.
  - Batch trigger logic.
  - Regulatory caps.

**Simulation focus:**
- Reproduce observed bottlenecks and queue lengths from historical log (validation step).
- Implement each strategy in simulation to test **KPIs** before real-world deployment.

**KPI projections in simulation:**
- End-to-end throughput time (mean, 90th percentile).
- Queue lengths for constrained stations (cold, hazardous activities).
- Late delivery percentage.
- Utilization of resources.
- Compliance violations (must be zero).

---

# **5. Monitoring Post-Implementation**

---

**Key dashboard elements in process mining tool (e.g., Celonis, Disco, PM4Py):**

---

**For Shared Cold-Packing:**
- **Cold-Packing Queue Length over Time**.
- Average/Max Waiting Time for cold orders.
- Utilization % per station.

**For Batching:**
- Average batch formation time per region.
- % Orders waiting > threshold due to batch.

**For Express Preemption:**
- Frequency of standard order interruptions.
- Turnaround time variance between express and standard.

**For Hazardous Material Limit:**
- Max concurrent hazardous orders.
- Wait time for hazardous start when under hard cap.

---

**Outcome Tracking:**
- Automated alerts when queue length > historical p90.
- Weekly bottleneck report: highlight shifts in bottleneck location.
- Cycle Time decomposition into within-instance vs. between-instance wait.

**Success criteria:**
- Reduction in constraint-induced wait times by  X%.
- Improvement in on-time delivery KPI while maintaining compliance.
- Balanced resource load without excessive cost increase.

If you’d like, I can **design the *actual process mining query logic and Python (PM4Py) code*** to extract wait times specifically caused by **between-instance dependencies** for cold-packing, batching delay, and hazardous limit breaches.  
Do you want me to prepare that? That would give you the exact formulas for the analysis phase.
