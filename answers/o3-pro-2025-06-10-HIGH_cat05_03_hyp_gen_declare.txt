ANOMALIES IN THE DECLARE MODEL  

1. DeadActivity / Contradiction  
   • “C” (Close Claim) is mandatory (existence rule).  
   • “E” (Evaluate Claim) is forbidden to co-occur with “C” (non-coexistence rule E  C).  
    Result: “E” can never appear in a valid trace, which clashes with the intended process where every claim must be evaluated before it is closed.  

2. Vacuous Responded-Existence  
   • Rule: Every “E” must be accompanied by at least one “A” (Assign Adjuster).  
   • Because “E” is impossible (see #1), the constraint is always satisfied without being tested. It is therefore meaningless.  

3. Redundant / Over-specified Start Condition  
   • init(R) already enforces that the first event must be “R”.  
   • precedence(C,R) repeats the same idea indirectly (if C occurs, R must have happened before). It adds no additional behaviour restrictions and clutters the model.  

4. Missing Safety Nets  
   • Nothing obliges “A”, “E”, “P” or “N” to occur at all. As long as “R” appears first and “C” appears somewhere later, the trace is deemed conformant—even if essential activities are skipped.  

5. Order-of-events Ambiguity  
   • The model does not state that “A” must precede “E”, that “E” must precede “P”, or that “P” must precede “N”/“C”. In theory an adjuster could be assigned after closing, or approval could happen before evaluation.

POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE ANOMALIES  

1. Requirement Misinterpretation  
   - A business analyst may have translated “E and C must never overlap” into a strict non-coexistence, forgetting that both are needed in the normal flow.  

2. Incremental Policy Changes  
   - If evaluation was moved to an upstream system (e.g., automated risk engine), someone could have added non-coexistence(E,C) without removing the “E”-related rules already present.  

3. Data-Driven Mining Errors  
   - A discovery algorithm run on an incomplete or noisy event log may have inferred rules that hold only because of missing data (e.g., evaluation events were not recorded).  

4. Performance Pressure  
   - Management might have demanded faster settlement, leading technicians to allow closing immediately after reception; later, other constraints were added piecemeal, producing contradictions.

SQL-BASED INVESTIGATION STRATEGIES  

1. Claims closed without an evaluation (should NOT happen in the intended process, is ALLOWED by the model).  
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') = 0;
```  

2. Traces that violate the model’s non-coexistence (i.e., both E and C in the same claim). If the model is obeyed, the result set should be empty.  
```sql
SELECT claim_id
FROM claim_events
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'C') > 0
   AND COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'E') > 0;
```  

3. Evaluation steps that lack any adjuster assignment, testing the “responded-existence” intention.  
```sql
WITH trace_flags AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'E') AS has_e,
         BOOL_OR(activity = 'A') AS has_a
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id
FROM trace_flags
WHERE has_e = TRUE
  AND has_a = FALSE;
```  

4. Order check: evaluation that occurred before an assignment (undesired even if both exist).  
```sql
WITH first_times AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN timestamp END) AS first_a,
         MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN timestamp END) AS first_e
  FROM claim_events
  GROUP BY claim_id)
SELECT claim_id
FROM first_times
WHERE first_e IS NOT NULL               -- an evaluation exists
  AND (first_a IS NULL OR first_e < first_a);  -- came earlier or no assignment
```  

5. Start-event compliance: traces whose first logged event is NOT “R”.  
```sql
WITH ordered AS (
  SELECT claim_id,
         activity,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
  FROM claim_events)
SELECT claim_id, activity AS first_activity
FROM ordered
WHERE rn = 1
  AND activity <> 'R';
```  

6. Frequency check: does “E” appear at all in real data? A surprisingly low count may hint at logging or processexecution problems.  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_evaluations
FROM claim_events
WHERE activity = 'E';
```  

Running these queries will reveal whether the contradictions in the DECLARE model are merely theoretical or actually reflected in day-to-day claim handling.
