**Explanation:**

The raw system log was transformed into an event log suitable for process mining by grouping related actions into coherent "cases" representing distinct work activities.  Here's the logic:

1. **Case Identification:**  The primary case identifier is the document or file being worked on.  Changes in the "Window" attribute within an application were used to separate cases.  For example, editing "Document1.docx" is one case (Case ID 1).  Switching to "Email - Inbox" starts a new case (Case ID 2), and so on.  This approach assumes that user interaction with a specific document or application window constitutes a logical unit of work.

2. **Activity Naming:** Low-level actions like "FOCUS," "TYPING," "CLICK," and "SCROLL" were generalized into higher-level, process-oriented activity names.  For instance, "TYPING" within a Word document becomes "Write Document," while "CLICK" to open an email becomes "Read Email."  This abstraction makes the event log easier to understand and analyze from a process perspective.  "FOCUS" events were generally absorbed into the next meaningful action unless they signaled the start of a new case (e.g., focusing on a new document).  "SWITCH" events were not included as activities themselves but triggered a new case.

3. **Event Attributes:**  The event log includes the Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp.  Although the raw log includes other attributes (Keys, Direction, Action, etc.) these were incorporated into the activity name where appropriate (e.g., "Reply to Email").  This keeps the event log concise while still capturing the essential information about the user's actions.  The focus is on creating a clean, analyst-friendly event log.
