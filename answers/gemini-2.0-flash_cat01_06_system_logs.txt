### Explanation of Event Log Generation

The system log was transformed into an event log representing user activities. Here's the logic used:

*   **Case Identification**:
    *   **`Report_Drafting`**: Events related to drafting and editing documents in Microsoft Word were grouped under the "Report Drafting" case. The switching between different documents (.docx files) was considered part of the same overarching drafting process. Actions like creating, editing, saving, and closing documents were all included.
    *   **`Email_Handling`**: Events occurring within Google Chrome and specifically related to the "Email - Inbox" window were grouped as "Email Handling." Activities included reading, replying to, editing, and sending emails.
    *   **`Report_Review`**: Events related to reviewing "Report\_Draft.pdf" in Adobe Acrobat were grouped under a "Report Review" case.
    *   **`Budget_Planning`**: Events related to editing "Budget\_2024.xlsx" in Microsoft Excel were grouped as "Budget Planning."

*   **Activity Naming**:
    *   Generic actions like "FOCUS" and "TYPING" were translated into more descriptive activity names:
        *   `Edit Document`
        *   `Save Document`
        *   `Create Document`
        *   `Close Document`
        *   `Read Email`
        *   `Reply to Email`
        *   `Edit Email`
        *   `Send Email`
        *   `Review Document`
        *   `Edit Spreadsheet`
        *   `Save Spreadsheet`
    *   `SWITCH` actions were named `Switch Application` to indicate a change in application context.

*   **Event Attributes**:
    *   **Case ID**: Identified based on the document/activity context.
    *   **Activity Name**: As described above.
    *   **Timestamp**: Taken directly from the system log.
    *   **Application**: Application in which the event occurred.
    *   **Window**: Window in which the event occurred.
    *   **Additional Info**: Includes details such as typing content, specific actions (e.g., opening an email), and scroll direction, where available. This provides additional context to the activity.
