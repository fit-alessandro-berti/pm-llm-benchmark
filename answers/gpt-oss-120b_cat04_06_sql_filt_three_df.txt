We need to produce a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events except those from cases that have the specific sequence and the time diff >5 days. Steps: find cases with that sequence in direct succession (no other events between). Since we have timestamps, we can order by timestamp per case. Need to ensure consecutive rows have those activities.

Approach: Use window functions to get lead/lag. For each event, we can check if activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and lead(1) activity = 'Create Order' and lead(2) activity = 'Confirm Order' for same case, and also ensure no other events in between (by definition of lead). Then compute time diff between lead(1).timestamp and lead(2).timestamp > interval '5' day.

Select case_ids that satisfy. Then final query: select * from event_log where case_id not in (select case_id from ...). Ensure we exclude all events of those cases.

Write query with CTE.

Let's craft final answer with proper formatting.

**DuckDB SQL query**

```sql
-- 1️⃣  Find the cases that contain the exact three‑step sequence
--     with no other events in between, and where the time between
--     “Create Order” and “Confirm Order” exceeds 5 days.
WITH sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        -- timestamps of the three consecutive events
        ts_approve   AS approve_ts,
        ts_create    AS create_ts,
        ts_confirm   AS confirm_ts,
        -- time difference (in days) between Create → Confirm
        DATE_DIFF('day', ts_create, ts_confirm) AS diff_days
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp AS ts,
            -- look ahead 1 and 2 rows within the same case,
            -- ordered by timestamp
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS act1,
            LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS ts1,
            LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS act2,
            LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS ts2
        FROM event_log
    ) AS ordered
    WHERE
        activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'          -- first step
        AND act1 = 'Create Order'                           -- second step
        AND act2 = 'Confirm Order'                          -- third step
        -- capture the timestamps of the second and third steps
        AND ts1 IS NOT NULL
        AND ts2 IS NOT NULL
        AND DATE_DIFF('day', ts1, ts2) > 5                  -- > 5 days
    QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY ts) = 1   -- keep one row per case
),

-- 2️⃣  Exclude all events belonging to those cases
filtered_events AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM event_log
    WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM sequence_cases)
)

-- 3️⃣  Return the remaining events
SELECT *
FROM filtered_events
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

### What the query does

1. **`sequence_cases` CTE**  
   - Uses `LEAD` to look at the next two events for every row of a given `case_id` (ordered by `timestamp`).  
   - Keeps only rows where the three consecutive activities are exactly  
     *Approve Purchase Requisition → Create Order → Confirm Order*.  
   - Computes the day‑difference between the *Create Order* and *Confirm Order* events; the row qualifies only if this difference is **greater than 5 days**.  
   - Returns one row per matching case (the `QUALIFY` clause ensures we don’t keep duplicate matches for the same case).

2. **`filtered_events` CTE**  
   - Selects all rows from `event_log` whose `case_id` is **not** in the set of cases identified by `sequence_cases`.

3. **Final `SELECT`**  
   - Returns every event from the original log that belongs to a case **not** matching the specified sequence‑plus‑timing condition, ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for readability.
