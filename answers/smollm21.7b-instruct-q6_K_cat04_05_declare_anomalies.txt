Sure! I can help with that. Here are some potential anomalies or issues in your proposed process model:

1. Alternate Succession: The chain succession constraint is strengthened by specifying the directly-follows relation, and the alternate succession constraint must be alternated without repetitions. However, there seems to be an error here as both "Request Payment" activities can be followed by either "Payment Handled" or "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE".

2. Succession: The chain successions are strengthened by imposing the directly-follows relation. However, in the case of "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR", there can be no other activities directly following it because it is a final approval activity and should only have one successor.

3. Response: The alternate response constraint seems to require that both "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" must be alternated, but this conflicts with the directly-follows relation between the two "Request Payment" activities. There could also be an issue if there are multiple requests payment activities in a row without any other activity intervening.

4. Alternate Precedence: The chain precedence constraint is strengthened by specifying the directly-precedes relation, and the alternate preconditions must be alternated without repetitions. However, there seems to be an error here as both "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activities can be preceded by either "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" or "Request Payment".

5. Succession: The chain successions are strengthened by imposing the directly-follows relation. However, in the case of "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE", there can be no other activities directly following it because it is a submission activity and should only have one successor.

6. Co-Existence: The alternate co-existence constraint requires that both activities cannot happen at the same time but this seems to be contradicted by the presence of multiple "Request Payment" or "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" activities in a row without any other activity intervening.

7. Succession and Non Co-Existence: In the case of non co-existence constraints, there is an issue with the successions where both the request payment and payment handled could be followed by either declaration finalized or final approval, but this contradicts the statement that they cannot happen at the same time due to a contradiction with the non co-existence constraint.

I hope you find these observations useful!
