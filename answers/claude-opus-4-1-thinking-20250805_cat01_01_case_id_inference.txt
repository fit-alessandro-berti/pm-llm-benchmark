Looking at this interleaved sequence, I can identify **three distinct cases** based on patient demographics, logical activity flow, and departmental consistency. Here's my analysis:

## **Case 1: 45-year-old Male - ER Fracture Treatment**
**Events: 1, 4, 7, 12, 15**

Timeline:
- 08:05:13 - Register patient (ER)
- 08:10:50 - Initial triage (ER, triage code 3)
- 08:15:42 - X-ray imaging (Radiology, left leg)
- 08:23:10 - Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosed with hairline fracture)
- 08:30:05 - Patient discharged (ER, follow-up at outpatient clinic)

This represents a typical ER journey for a non-critical fracture case.

## **Case 2: 62-year-old Female - ER Infection Treatment**
**Events: 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17**

Timeline:
- 08:07:02 - Register patient (ER)
- 08:12:29 - Initial triage (ER, triage code 2)
- 08:16:10 - Lab test requested (ER, blood panel)
- 08:20:27 - Lab test completed (Laboratory, normal levels)
- 08:22:54 - Doctor consultation (ER, diagnosed with minor infection)
- 08:27:00 - Prescription created (ER, antibiotics)
- 08:35:29 - Patient discharged (ER, pharmacy pickup)

This shows a complete ER workflow for diagnosing and treating an infection.

## **Case 3: 28-year-old Male - Scheduled Knee Surgery**
**Events: 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18**

Timeline:
- 08:07:15 - Register patient (Surgery department)
- 08:13:00 - Doctor consultation (Surgery, scheduled knee surgery)
- 08:16:45 - Surgery preparation (general anesthesia)
- 08:25:19 - Surgery performed (arthroscopy)
- 08:31:37 - Recovery room (stable condition)
- 08:40:13 - Patient discharged (Surgery, physiotherapy follow-up)

This represents a planned surgical procedure from admission to discharge.

## **Key Indicators Used for Case Identification:**

1. **Patient Demographics**: Each case has unique age/gender combinations
2. **Department Consistency**: Each patient stays within their primary department pathway (ER or Surgery)
3. **Logical Activity Sequences**: Each follows expected medical workflows
4. **Resource Continuity**: Same doctors handle related activities (e.g., Dr. Smith for Case 2, Dr. Lee for Cases 1 and 3)
5. **Temporal Coherence**: Events within each case follow chronologically sensible patterns

The interleaving occurs naturally as the hospital handles multiple patients simultaneously, but each individual patient journey maintains its internal logical consistency.
