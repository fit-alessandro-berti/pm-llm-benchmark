1. Supplier  
2. Accounts Payable Clerk (AP Clerk)  
3. Purchasing Officer  
4. Accounts Payable Supervisor (AP Supervisor)

------------------------------------------------------------  
Supplier  
  T1  Send Invoice <Invoice> (usually by e-mail)  
  -> AP Clerk.Start

AP Clerk  
  E1  START EVENT  “Invoice Received” <Invoice>  
  [ExG]  PO included?  
      YES  -> T2  
      NO   -> T1.1  Request PO / more details from Supplier  
                   -> wait for corrected invoice -> back to PO included?  
  T2  Log Invoice in Accounting System <Invoice record>  
  -> T3  
  T3  Forward Invoice & PO to Purchasing for goods-receipt confirmation  
        {Interview 1 notes this is “always”; Dan confirms.}  
  -> PurchasingOfficer.Start

Purchasing Officer  
  T4  Verify goods/services received & compare Invoice vs PO  
  [ExG]  Discrepancy?  
      NO  -> T4.1  Send “Confirmation OK” e-mail to AP Clerk  
                  -> AP Clerk.T5  
      YES -> T4.2  Contact Supplier OR instruct AP Clerk to hold invoice <Discrepancy note>  
           [ExG]  Discrepancy resolved?  
               YES -> T4.1 (send confirmation)  
               NO  -> AP Supervisor.Start

AP Clerk  
  T5  Match Invoice line items against PO in system  
  [ExG]  Lines/prices match?  
      YES -> T6  
      NO  -> T5.1  Email Purchasing for clarification  
             [ExG] Clarified?  
                 YES -> repeat T5  
                 NO  -> AP Supervisor.Start  
  T6  Trigger Manager Approval Request (System auto-email) <Approval request>  
  -> System.S1

Accounting System  
  S1  Generate approval notification to Department Manager  
  -> DepartmentManager.Start

Department Manager  
  T7  Review & Approve / Reject Invoice  
  [ExG]  Approved?  
      YES -> System.S2  
      NO  -> T7.1 Reject / Request Investigation  
              -> AP Clerk.T8

Accounting System  
  S2  Notify AP Clerk of approval status  
  -> AP Clerk.T9

AP Clerk  
  T8  Hold invoice & investigate (may resend to Purchasing or escalate to AP Supervisor)  
      -> appropriate step as needed  
  T9  Schedule Invoice for Payment Run <Scheduled payment>  
  END EVENT “Invoice Scheduled for Payment”

------------------------------------------------------------  
EXCEPTION / ESCALATION LANE (handled by AP Supervisor & SR Manager)

AP Supervisor  
  E2  INTERMEDIATE EVENT “Invoice Escalated – Unresolved Discrepancy / Missing PO / Service without PO”  
  T10  Investigate & coordinate resolution (contact departments, suppliers)  
  [ExG]  Resolution possible?  
      YES -> route back to the point that failed (usually AP Clerk.T5 or Purchasing.T4)  
      NO  -> T10.1 Decide:  
              a) Create retrospective PO with Department Head (if permissible) -> back to Purchasing.T4  
              b) Reject Invoice -> END EVENT “Invoice Rejected”

Supplier Relationship Manager  
  T11  Engage Supplier to obtain missing PO / corrected invoice / contract pricing  
  -> returns info to AP Supervisor or Purchasing -> process continues

------------------------------------------------------------  
NOTES & AMBIGUITIES  
• “Goods-receipt confirmation” occasionally happens implicitly when the PO is fully receipted in the ERP; if so, step T3 may skip directly to T5 (uncertain—mentioned by Dan as an assumption).  
• Manager rejections are rare (“maybe once every couple of months”); rejected invoices re-enter investigation loop via T8/T10.  
• Invoices without any PO for informal services follow the AP Supervisor path (T10) for retrospective PO creation or rejection.  
• Parallelism was not reported; therefore all gateways are exclusive.  
• No system tasks exist between scheduling and actual payment run; those activities are outside interview scope and therefore omitted.
