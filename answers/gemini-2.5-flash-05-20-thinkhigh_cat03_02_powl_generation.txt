# 3. Construct the main StrictPartialOrder (root POWL model)

# This means config_loop depends on both DA and ACI.
root.order.add_edge(da_activity, config_loop)

# 4. After the network is successfully configured (config_loop completes),
# the exclusive choice for application deployment (deployment_xor) can begin.
root.order.add_edge(config_loop, deployment_xor)

# 5. Once the deployment method has been chosen and completed (deployment_xor completes),
# Quality Assurance (QA) and Security Audit (SA) must be performed.
# They can be done concurrently (no explicit order between them).
# Both depend on deployment_xor.
root.order.add_edge(deployment_xor, qa_activity)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_xor, sa_activity)

# 6. After QA and SA are both completed, the final Go-Live Approval (GLA) occurs.
# This means GLA depends on both QA and SA.
