Okay, I understand the task. Here's the breakdown of the query and the resulting output:

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE_ID,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    CASE WHEN activity = 'process_variant' THEN
        case_id,
        ...
    END
FROM event_log
WHERE
    timestamp > INTERVAL '10s';
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`SELECT CASE_ID, activity, timestamp, CASE WHEN activity = 'process_variant' THEN case_id, ... END`**: This selects the `CASE_ID`, `activity`, and `timestamp` columns from the `event_log` table. The `CASE` statement checks if the `activity` is 'process_variant' and then returns the `case_id` and the relevant `activity` for that case.  The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include cases where the `timestamp` is greater than '10s' (10 seconds).

2. **`FROM event_log`**: This specifies the table to query from.

3. **`WHERE timestamp > INTERVAL '10s'`**: This is the crucial part. It filters the results to include only rows where the `timestamp` is greater than '10s'.  This means that the `timestamp` column must be within the last 10 seconds of the current row's timestamp.

4. **`SELECT ... FROM event_log WHERE ...`**: This is the core of the query. It selects the `CASE_ID`, `activity`, `timestamp`, and the `CASE WHEN activity = 'process_variant' THEN case_id, ... END` clause.  The `CASE` statement then checks if the `activity` is 'process_variant' and returns the `case_id` and the relevant `activity` for that case.  The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include cases where the `timestamp` is greater than '10s'.

**Output:**

The query will return a table with the following columns:

*   **`CASE_ID`**: A unique identifier for each process variant.
*   **`activity`**: A list of the activities that occurred within that case.
*   **`timestamp`**: The datetime of when the activity took place.

**Example:**

Let's say the `event_log` table has the following data:

| case_id | activity | timestamp |
| :--- | :------ | :---- |
| 1     | process_variant | 2023-10-27 |
| 2     | process_variant | 2023-10-28 |
| 3     | process_variant | 2023-10-29 |
| 4     | process_variant | 2023-10-30 |
| 5     | process_variant | 2023-10-31 |
| 6     | process_variant | 2023-10-32 |
| 7     | process_variant | 2023-10-33 |
| 8     | process_variant | 2023-10-34 |
| 9     | process_variant | 2023-10-35 |
| 10     | process_variant | 2023-10-36 |
| 11     | process_variant | 2023-10-37 |
| 12     | process_variant | 2023-10-38 |

The query would return:

| case_id | activity | timestamp |
| :--- | :------ | :---- |
| 1     | process_variant | 2023-10-27 |
| 2     | process_variant | 2023-10-28 |
| 3     | process_variant | 2023-10-29 |
| 4     | process_variant | 2023-10-30 |
| 5     | process_variant | 2023-10-31 |
| 6     | process_variant | 2023-10-32 |
| 7     | process_variant | 2023-10-33 |
| 8     | process_variant | 2023-10-34 |
| 9     | process_variant | 2023-10-35 |
| 10     | process_variant | 2023-10-36 |
| 11     | process_ same as other_  |  1000000_10 |
