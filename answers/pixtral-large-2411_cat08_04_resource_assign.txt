### 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns

#### Performance and Behavior of Individual Agents and Support Tiers
To analyze the performance and behavior of individual agents and support tiers (L1, L2, L3), we will focus on the following metrics and techniques:

- **Workload Distribution:** Measure the number of tickets assigned to each agent and tier. Identify agents who are consistently overloaded or underutilized.
- **Activity Processing Times:** Calculate the average time taken by agents to complete activities (e.g., first response time, resolution time) segmented by tier and ticket category.
- **First-Call Resolution Rate:** Determine the percentage of tickets resolved by L1 agents without escalation.
- **Frequency of Handling Specific Ticket Types/Skills:** Analyze the frequency with which agents handle specific ticket categories and required skills.

#### Process Mining Techniques
- **Resource Interaction Analysis:** Use social network analysis to visualize handovers between agents and tiers. This helps identify frequent interaction patterns and potential inefficiencies in escalations and reassignments.
- **Role Discovery:** Identify roles within the process based on
