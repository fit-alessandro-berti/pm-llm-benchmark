### Anomalies Identification

**1. Loop Between Evaluate and Approve:**
The model includes a loop structure where the `Evaluate` step can potentially lead back to another `Evaluate` without necessarily proceeding to an `Approve`. This structure suggests that claims might get stuck in a continuous cycle of evaluation without moving forward to approval, which contradicts the intended process flow.

**2. XOR for Skipping Customer Notification:**
The XOR operator introduces a choice to either notify the customer (`N`) or effectively skip this step (`skip`). This setup implies that there is a possibility for the customer notification step to be ignored, which goes against the expected sequential process flow.

**3. Premature Closing of Claims:**
The partial order `root.order.add_edge(A, C)` allows for the closing of a claim (C) without having necessarily passed through an evaluation (E) and approval (P) step, or even through proper interaction with an adjuster, depending on how activities are mapped in practice.

### Hypotheses

**1. Changes in Business Rules:**
It's possible that there have been changes in the business rules governing claim processing which were not fully implemented or communicated properly across teams.

**2. Miscommunication Between Departments:**
There could have been a miscommunication between different departments, like operations and IT, leading to an incomplete or incorrect process model being deployed.

**3. Technical Errors:**
The anomalies might be due to technical errors in the workflow system that allow non-standard execution paths. This could include bugs or limitations in the process modeling tool used.

### Verification Using Database Queries

To verify these hypotheses using the database, one can perform the following queries:

1. **Identify Claims Closed Without Proper Evaluation and Approval:**
   ```sql
   SELECT C.claim_id
   FROM claims C
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM claim_events CE
       WHERE CE.claim_id = C.claim_id AND CE.activity = 'E'
   );
   ```

2. **Locate Claims Approved Multiple Times:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*) as approval_count
   FROM claim_events CE
   JOIN claims C ON CE.claim_id = C.claim_id
   GROUP BY claim_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

3. **Check Frequency of Customer Notification Skips:**
   ```sql
   SELECT N.customer_id, COUNT(*) as skipped_notifications
   FROM claim_events CE
   JOIN transitions T ON CE.event_id = T.event_id
   JOIN transitions NT ON NT.event_id = CE.event_id + 1 AND NT.label = 'N'
   WHERE NT.label = 'skip'
   GROUP BY CE.customer_id;
   ```

These queries will help in identifying whether the anomalies observed in the process model actually manifest in the operational data. The results can then be analyzed to draw conclusions about the potential causes behind these anomalies, informing further investigation or corrective actions.
