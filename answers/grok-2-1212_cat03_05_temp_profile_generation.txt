To create a temporal profile for the given global supply chain process, I'll estimate average times and standard deviations for a representative subset of activity pairs. These estimates will be based on typical delays and variability in such processes, but the exact numbers are fictional and meant to illustrate the concept.

Here's the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Directly connected pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),  # 1 day avg, 4 hours std dev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400),  # 1 week avg, 1 day std dev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 14400),   # 12 hours avg, 4 hours std dev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 28800),   # 1 day avg, 8 hours std dev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (172800, 36000),  # 2 days avg, 10 hours std dev

This temporal profile includes:

1. Directly connected pairs of activities
2. Pairs separated by one to eight steps

The estimated times and standard deviations are based on typical delays in supply chain processes:

- Supplier selection and order placement might take around a day
- Receiving components could take a week due to shipping times
- Quality inspection might take half a day to a full day
- Assembly and testing could take several days
- Packaging and storage are typically quick processes
- Distribution might take a week
- After-sales support could start a month after distribution

The standard deviations increase as the number of steps between activities increases, reflecting the cumulative uncertainty in longer process segments.

This profile can be used to analyze process executions and identify deviations from expected temporal patterns using the ZETA value as described in the prompt.
