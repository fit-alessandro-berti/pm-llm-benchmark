### 1. Identifying Violations of Normative Rules

#### Case 2:
- **Violation:** The Risk Assessment was performed before the Credit Check.
- **Explanation:** According to the normative rules, the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment. In this case, the Risk Assessment was done first, which is not allowed.

#### Case 2:
- **Violation:** Finalize Documentation was performed after the Loan Decision was Rejected.
- **Explanation:** According to the normative rules, if the loan is rejected, documentation should not be finalized before closing the case. In this case, Finalize Documentation was performed after the Loan Decision, which is not allowed.

#### Case 3:
- **Violation:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the Application was Received.
- **Explanation:** According to the normative rules, the Credit Check should be completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours). In this case, the Credit Check was performed much later than the recommended time frame, which is not allowed.

### 2. Identifying Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

#### Case 3:
- **Desideratum Violation:** Finalize Documentation was performed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision.
- **Explanation:** According to the desiderata, the applicant should be informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision). In this case, Finalize Documentation was performed later than the recommended time frame, which is not ideal but not a strict violation.

#### Case 3:
- **Desideratum Violation:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision.
- **Explanation:** According to the desiderata, the applicant should be informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision). In this case, the applicant was informed much later than the recommended time frame, which is not ideal but not a strict violation.

#### Case 3:
- **Desideratum Violation:** There was no Follow-up Call before closing the case.
- **Explanation:** According to the desiderata, it is encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant to ensure all parties are aligned. In this case, there was no Follow-up Call, which is not ideal but not a strict violation.

### 3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors

#### Case 2:
- **Possible Interpretation:** The Credit Check was likely performed after the Risk Assessment because the system or process was not properly configured or monitored to ensure the correct sequence of activities. This suggests a need for enhanced process monitoring and control mechanisms.

#### Case 2:
- **Possible Interpretation:** The Finalize Documentation step was performed after the Loan Decision was Rejected because the system or process did not enforce the rule that documentation should not be finalized after a rejection. This suggests a need for stronger enforcement mechanisms within the process.

#### Case 3:
- **Possible Interpretation:** The Credit Check was performed more than 24 hours after the Application was Received because the system or process did not enforce the time window for completing the Credit Check. This suggests a need for better time management and resource allocation.

#### Case 3:
- **Possible Interpretation:** The applicant was informed more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision because the system or process did not prioritize timely communication. This suggests a need for enhanced communication channels and staff training.

#### Case 3:
- **Possible Interpretation:** The Follow-up Call was not performed because the system or process did not prioritize this step. This suggests a need for better process design and staff training to ensure all recommended actions are taken.

In summary:
- **Cases 2 and 2:** Violate normative rules due to incorrect sequence and improper handling of rejected loan cases.
- **Case 3:** Violates normative rules for improper timing of Credit Checks and Finalize Documentation. Also, fails to meet desiderata for timely communication and follow-up calls.
- **Recommendations:** Enhance process monitoring, enforcement, and communication to ensure adherence to both normative rules and desiderata.
