Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to write a DuckDB SQL query that does several things: determine the sequence of activities for each case, group by those sequences, count how many cases each sequence has, find the top K by frequency, and then return the events from those top cases. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, the process variant is the ordered sequence of activities in a case when sorted by timestamp. So for each case_id, I need to order the activities by their timestamp and then represent that sequence as a string or some identifiable format. DuckDB has functions like STRING_AGG which can help here. So the first step is to create a query that for each case_id, generates the ordered list of activities.

So step 1: For each case_id, order the activities by timestamp, then aggregate them into a sequence string. The SQL for that might look like:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id;

Wait, but the GROUP BY case_id would group all entries of the same case together. Then STRING_AGG would combine their activities in the order sorted by timestamp. That should give the variant for each case.

Then step 2 is to group by this variant and count how many cases each variant has. So the next part would be:

SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
) AS case_variants
GROUP BY variant;

This would give each variant and the number of cases that have that exact sequence.

Then step 3 is to find the top K variants by their count. So we need to order by count descending and take the top K. Let's say K is a parameter, but in the problem statement, it's probably passed as an input. So adding ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT K here. Wait, but how to structure this in the query?

Wait, the problem says "determine the top K variants by their frequency". So after getting the count per variant, we need to select the top K. Let's assume that K is a variable, but in the SQL, perhaps we can use a parameter like K = 5 or something. But the problem says to return the query, so maybe the user is expected to use a placeholder like K.

So the next step would be to get the top K variants. Let's say after the previous step, we have:

WITH counted_variants AS (
    SELECT variant, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
)
SELECT variant
FROM counted_variants
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT K;

But this gives the variants themselves. Then, the next part is to filter all the original events to those that belong to cases which are part of these top K variants. Wait, but how do we link the original events to the top variants?

Hmm, perhaps the approach is:

1. For each case, determine its variant and count how many cases have each variant.
2. Find the top K variants based on their counts.
3. For each case, check if its variant is among the top K variants. If yes, include all its events in the result.

But how to do this efficiently in SQL?

Alternative approach:

First, get all the case variants and their counts. Then, find the top K variants. Then, for each case in the original log, check if its variant is in the top K. To do this, perhaps we can use a subquery that first gets the top K variants, then join that with the original events.

Wait, let's think step by step.

First, let's get all the case variants and their counts. Then, get the top K variants. Let's store those top K variants in a temporary table or a CTE. Then, for each event in the original log, we need to check if the case_id's variant is in the top K.

But how to get the variant of each event's case_id? Because each event is part of a case, so for each event, the case_id's variant is the same as the variant computed for that case_id. So perhaps the first step is to compute for each event the variant of its case. Then, we can filter those events where the variant is in the top K.

Wait, but how to compute the variant for each event's case? Let's see.

The initial step is to compute for each case_id its variant. So perhaps the first part is to create a CTE that maps each case_id to its variant.

So:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
), 
counted_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(*) AS count 
    FROM case_variants 
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant 
    FROM counted_variants 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    e.* 
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but this would work only if the case_variants CTE is correctly computed. Let me check:

The case_variants CTE groups by case_id and aggregates the activities in order of timestamp. That gives each case's variant. Then, the top_k_variants selects the top K variants based on their counts (number of cases with that variant). Then, joining the original events with their case's variant and the top K variants would filter to only those events whose case's variant is in the top K.

But there's a problem here: the case_variants CTE groups by case_id, so each case_id has one row with its variant. So when we join the event_log with case_variants on case_id, each event in the event_log will get the variant of its case. Then, joining with top_k_variants would filter those events where the case's variant is in the top K.

Yes, that seems right. So putting it all together, the full query would be something like:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
counted_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(*) AS count 
    FROM case_variants 
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant 
    FROM counted_variants 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    e.* 
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but the problem says to return all events from the original log that belong to cases in the top K variants. So this approach should work. However, there's a possible issue with the STRING_AGG function's ordering. Because when we group by case_id in the case_variants CTE, the STRING_AGG is ordered by the timestamp of each activity in the case. But the GROUP BY case_id groups all entries of the same case, so the ORDER BY in STRING_AGG would order the activities in the correct sequence. That should be okay.

Another thing to note is that the STRING_AGG uses the ORDER BY clause inside the aggregate function. The syntax for STRING_AGG in DuckDB allows specifying the order. Let me confirm the syntax.

In DuckDB, the STRING_AGG function's syntax is:

STRING_AGG(expr, separator, ORDER BY ...)

So in the case_variants CTE, the STRING_AGG is aggregating the activities with '|' as the separator, and ordering them by the timestamp. But since the activities are from the same case, their timestamps are already in order when they are part of the same case. Wait, but the GROUP BY case_id groups all events of the same case, so the activities in the same case are ordered by their original timestamp. Wait, no. The STRING_AGG's ORDER BY is applied to the expressions in the ORDER BY clause. Since the activities are from the same case, but in the event_log, each row is an individual event. When you group by case_id, the activities in the same case are all together, but their order in the group is not necessarily sorted by timestamp. Wait, but the ORDER BY in the STRING_AGG will sort the activities in the group by their timestamp. So even if the original events are not ordered by time, when you group by case_id and then use STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp, the activities will be ordered by their timestamp within the case. That's exactly what the problem requires. So that part is correct.

Another possible issue is that if two activities have the same timestamp in the same case, the order between them might be non-deterministic. But the problem says to sort by timestamp, so that's acceptable.

Now, putting all together, the query would first compute the variant for each case, count how many cases per variant, select the top K variants, then filter the original events to those whose case's variant is in the top K.

But the problem also says to return the corresponding events from those filtered cases. So this approach should work.

Now, let's check the steps again as per the problem's requirements:

1. Determine the sequence of activities per case, ordered by timestamp. That's done in the case_variants CTE.

2. Group by the variant and count. That's in counted_variants.

3. Find top K variants by frequency. That's in top_k_variants.

4. Return events from cases in top K variants. The final SELECT does that by joining with the top variants.

Now, the problem mentions that K is a parameter. So in the query, K should be a placeholder. For example, if the user wants the top 5, they can set K=5. So in the query, we can use K as a variable, perhaps using a parameter.

Another thing to note is that the problem says "group cases by their complete activity sequence". So the grouping is exact match of the sequence. So two cases with the same sequence (same activities in same order) are considered the same variant, even if they have different case_ids. That's handled correctly by the STRING_AGG, as the variant is the same.

Now, possible edge cases: what if a case has no activities? Probably not, since each event is part of a case. But the problem states that the event_log has case_id, so each event is part of a case. So each case has at least one event.

Another edge case: when multiple cases have the same variant. The count would correctly accumulate them.

Testing the query with sample data would help, but since I can't do that here, I have to rely on logic.

Wait, but in the case_variants CTE, when we group by case_id, each case's events are aggregated into a single row with the variant. Then, the counted_variants group by variant and count the number of case_ids (since each case contributes one row to case_variants). So the count is the number of cases per variant, which is correct.

Yes, that's right. Because for each case, there's exactly one row in case_variants. So COUNT(*) in counted_variants gives the number of cases per variant.

So the query should work as intended.

Now, the problem requires that the final result includes all events from the original log that belong to cases in the top K variants. The final SELECT does that by joining the original event_log with the case_variants (to get the variant of the case) and then with the top K variants.

Therefore, the final query should look like the one I wrote above, with the CTEs and the final SELECT.

But let me check the exact steps again:

The problem says:

"Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

So the events must belong to cases whose variant is in the top K. The query does that by joining the event's case_id to the case_variants to get the variant, then to the top K variants.

Yes.

Another thing to note is that the problem says to "exclude cases not matching the top K variants". So the events from cases not in the top K are excluded. The query does that by only including events where the case's variant is in the top K.

Therefore, the query should satisfy all the requirements.

Now, the problem mentions that in DuckDB, so the syntax should be compatible with DuckDB's features. For example, the STRING_AGG function is available in DuckDB 2.0 and above, so assuming that's acceptable.

Another possible optimization: the case_variants CTE could be computed once and reused, which the query does via CTEs.

Now, putting all together, here's the final query:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, '|', ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
counted_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant, 
        COUNT(*) AS count 
    FROM case_variants 
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        variant 
    FROM counted_variants 
    ORDER BY count DESC 
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT 
    e.* 
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_k_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Wait, but in the final SELECT, we need to return all events from the original log that are part of the top K cases. However, the event_log includes all events, so joining with the case_variants (which has one row per case) and then with the top K variants would include all events from those cases. That's correct.

But perhaps the problem requires that the events are only those that belong to the top K variants. Since each event is part of a case, and the case's variant is in the top K, all events of those cases are included, which is exactly what is needed.

Yes, this should be correct.

Now, the problem mentions that the final answer code should be enclosed within code blocks. So the final answer would be the SQL query as above, with K being a parameter (like a variable that the user can set). For example, if K is 5, then LIMIT 5.

But in the problem statement, the user is to write a query that can be executed with K as a parameter. So the query as written uses K, which would need to be replaced with an actual number when executed, but in the problem's context, perhaps the user is to leave it as K, assuming that it's passed as an argument.

Alternatively, if the problem expects K to be a specific value, but since it's not given, the solution should use K as a placeholder.

Therefore, the final answer is the SQL query as written above, with the CTEs and the final SELECT.
