To address the task of transforming granular machine events and operator actions into high-level process steps, we'll analyze the provided subset of the event log for each case (A1 and B2) and propose a structured representation of these activities.

### Identified High-Level Activities

**Case A1:**

1. **Material Preparation**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Justification:**  
   These steps are sequential and temporally close, indicating the initial stage of preparing the material for further processing. The actions are logically connected as they prepare a single piece (raw metal sheet) for assembly or welding.

2. **Assembly**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   **Justification:**  
   These steps involve joining parts to form the desired structure, which is the core of the manufacturing process in this context. The actions are continuous and directly related to constructing or forming a complete component.

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating
   - Visual check

   **Justification:**  
   These steps ensure that the product meets quality standards before being completed in the manufacturing process. They include assessing and enhancing the work done during assembly to ensure functionality and durability.

**Case B2:**

1. **Material Preparation**
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

   **Justification:**  
   Similar to Case A1, these are the initial preparatory steps for preparing a new piece of material ready for assembly or processing.

2. **Assembly**
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B

   **Justification:**  
   These actions follow the same pattern as in Case A1, focusing on joining parts to create a complete product.

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - Measure weld integrity
   - Apply protective coating
   - Dry coating
   - Visual check

   **Justification:**  
   This phase ensures that the final steps of the manufacturing process meet quality standards, similar to Case A1.

}
```

### Conclusion

By grouping the low-level events into these higher-level activities, we provide a clear and understandable overview of the manufacturing workflow. This structured representation facilitates easier analysis and communication within the team about the manufacturing process, ensuring that all steps are logically coherent and operationally meaningful.
