Yes, I can help with that. From the BPMN 2.0 XML provided, the tasks in the process model are as follows:

1. decide
2. pay compensation
3. check ticket
4. examine casually
5. register request
6. reject request
7. examine thoroughly
8. reinitiate request

These tasks are identified by the `<bpmn:task>` elements in the XML, each with a unique `id` and a `name` attribute that describes the task.
