**Transformed Event Log (Example Format)**

Below is an example event log table. Each row represents a single event. The log is grouped by case (i.e., each distinct document or resource). The activities have been standardized to reflect higher-level conceptual actions rather than raw system events. Timestamps and case IDs are retained for process mining analysis.

**Explanation of the Logic**

1. **Case Identification:**  
   Each case was defined as a single "work item," typically associated with a specific document or resource name in the "Window" attribute. For example, all events relating to "Document1.docx" form one case, and all events related to "Quarterly_Report.docx" form another. Similarly, interactions with the email inbox, PDF file, and Excel spreadsheet are each grouped into their respective cases.

2. **Activity Naming:**  
   Low-level system actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SCROLL," "SAVE," "CLICK") were mapped to higher-level conceptual activities:
   - **FOCUS / SWITCH to a document:** "Open Document" if itâ€™s the first time, or "Resume Document" if returning to it.
   - **TYPING in Word/Excel:** "Edit Document" or "Edit Spreadsheet."
   - **SAVE actions:** "Save Document" or "Save Spreadsheet."
   - **CLOSE actions:** "Close Document."
   - **Email-related CLICK and TYPING:** "Open Email," "Scroll Email," "Reply to Email," "Compose Reply," and "Send Email."
   - **PDF SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT:** "Scroll PDF," "Highlight PDF Content."

   This translation makes the event log more meaningful for process analysis, highlighting what the user was conceptually doing rather than which keys they pressed.

3. **Temporal & Contextual Clues:**  
   The sequence of events and the transitions between applications were used to identify when a user stopped working on one resource and started on another. For example, focusing back on "Document1.docx" after working in Excel is represented as "Resume Document."

4. **Coherent Narrative:**  
   By grouping events by the document/application in focus and translating them into higher-level activities, each case now reads as a small workflow: opening a document, editing it, saving changes, possibly returning to it later, and finally closing it. For emails, the narrative involves opening the email application, reading an email, composing a reply, and sending it.

This transformed event log is now suitable for import into standard process mining tools, allowing analysts to discover, model, and analyze the user's workflow patterns at a higher conceptual level.
