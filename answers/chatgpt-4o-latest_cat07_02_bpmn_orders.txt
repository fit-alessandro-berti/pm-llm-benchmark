This diagram is a **Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)** flowchart that illustrates the process of handling a customer order across multiple departments in a company. The swimlanes represent different departments involved: **Sales, Production, Procurement,** and **Warehouse**. Here's a breakdown of the process:

---

###  **Sales Department**
- **Start Event**: The process initiates early Monday morning.
- **Check order for completeness**:
  - The order is reviewed for all necessary details.
- **Check if customer is already in the database**:
  - If **not**, the customer is **added** to the database.
  - If **yes**, the process continues.
- **Send order details** to production (data-based flow).
- **Draft invoice** once the product has been sent.

---

###  **Production Department**
- **Event-based gateway**: Waits for order details to arrive.
- **Plan production**: Production is scheduled.
- **Check materials**:
  - Ensures materials are not faulty (exclusive gateway).
  - If faulty, request for material compensation is triggered to procurement.
  - If good, manufacturing happens.
- **Manufacture product**
- **Product complete** triggers the warehouse to prepare the product for shipping.

---

###  **Procurement Department**
- **Event-based gateway**: Waits for order details.
- **Material Compensation Subprocess**:
  - **Order materials**
  - If necessary, **return material**
- **Check materials**:
  - Final inspection before approval.
  - If incorrect, it can lead to **order cancellation**.

---

###  **Warehouse Department**
- **Send product**:
  - Triggered after the product is marked complete by production.
  - Once the product is sent, a message is relayed back to **Sales** for invoicing.

---

###  **Process Flow Highlights**
- **Conditional flows** (diamonds) are used to make decisions.
- **Message flows** (dotted lines) show interaction between departments.
- **Subprocesses** are encapsulated, e.g., material compensation.
- **Gateways** are used for routing process logic such as decisions or divergence/convergence of paths.

###  Overall Summary:
This BPMN model gives a visual representation of an integrated order processing system. It seamlessly connects customer order validation, production planning, materials procurement, product manufacturing, and shipment, ultimately leading to invoice generation.
