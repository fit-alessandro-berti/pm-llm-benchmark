Here’s a concise description of the visualization:

- It’s a BPMN-style process diagram for preparing and shipping goods.
- The diagram is divided into three swimlanes:
  - Logistics
  - Dispatch of goods / Computer Hardware Shop Secretary
  - Warehouse
- The process starts with “Ship goods.”

Key flow in the Secretary lane:
- Clarify shipment method (after a gateway).
- Decision: “Special handling?”
  - If no:
    - “Check if insurance is required” (uses customer information).
    - Gateway:
      - If insurance is necessary  “Insure parcel.”
    - In all cases  “Write package label.”
  - If yes:
    - “Get 3 offers from logistic companies.”
    - “Select logistic company and place order.”
- These paths merge again via gateways to continue the process.

Key flow in the Warehouse lane:
- “Package goods.”
- If packaging takes more than 48 hours, trigger “Notify customer about delay.”
- Package completion is synchronized (gateway) with the administrative steps from above.

Final steps:
- “Fill out shipment paperwork.”
- “Move package to pickup area.”
- End event: “Shipment prepared.”

Overall:
The visualization shows how the secretary (admin tasks), logistics (insurance/label decisions), and warehouse (physical packing) coordinate, including decisions for special handling, insurance, carrier selection, and delay notifications, ending with a fully prepared shipment ready for pickup.
