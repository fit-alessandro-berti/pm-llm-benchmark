Below is an integrated, data-driven approach that uses process mining to diagnose Precision Parts Inc.’s scheduling issues and to design advanced, practical scheduling strategies suited to a high-mix, low-volume job shop with sequence-dependent setups and frequent disruptions.

1) ANALYZING HISTORICAL SCHEDULING PERFORMANCE AND DYNAMICS

How to reconstruct the actual flow
- Build a clean event log with a case notion for jobs and operations:
  - Case levels: Job (order), Operation (job × routing step), and Resource (machine, operator).
  - Key timestamps: queue entry, setup start/end, task start/end, breakdown start/end, priority change, job release/complete.
  - Calendars: machine and operator working time, planned maintenance.
- Use process mining discovery:
  - Directly-Follows Graphs (DFGs) and Inductive Miner per product family/route to show actual precedence and rework loops.
  - Object-centric mining (OC-PM) to connect jobs, machines, and operators simultaneously (many-to-many relationships).
  - Performance-enhanced variants: annotate DFG edges with waiting and processing times; annotate nodes (machines) with utilization and queue metrics.

What to measure and how
- Job flow times and lead/makespan distributions:
  - Flow time per job = job completion  job release.
  - Lead time distributions by product family, priority class; p50/p90/p95; time-series of these KPIs.
  - Makespan per job (release to last operation) and inter-operation times (handovers).
- Task waiting/queue times by machine:
  - Waiting in queue = setup start (or task start if no setup)  queue entry.
  - Decompose into pre-setup wait, setup duration, processing duration.
  - Queue length trajectories: count of jobs with Queue Entry and not yet started; compute time-weighted average queue length.
- Resource utilization and time balance:
  - For each machine: productive (task processing), setup, idle (no jobs available), blocked/starved (jobs upstream not arriving), down (breakdown).
  - Availability-adjusted utilization: productive/(available time). Setup ratio and its trend.
  - Operator utilization by station/skill; overlap analysis for multi-machine staffing.
- Sequence-dependent setup analysis:
  - For each machine, build a transition matrix: previous-job attributes  next-job attributes.
  - Feature engineering for job “family” similarity: material, thickness, tolerance class, tool list (Jaccard similarity), heat-treatment requirement, fixture, coolant, program.
  - Compute empirical setup duration distributions conditional on the transition (AB). Visualize as heatmaps; identify “bad transitions.”
  - Fit predictive models for setup time: gradient boosting or GAM with features of previous vs next job; produce expected setup times and prediction intervals per candidate sequence.
- Schedule adherence and tardiness:
  - Tardiness T = max(0, completion  due date); earliness; percentage late; average and p95 tardiness by priority.
  - Task-level schedule slippage: actual task start  planned task start; aggregate per machine/route.
  - Rolling lateness propagation: measure lateness after each operation; where does delay originate/amplify?
- Impact of disruptions:
  - Merge breakdown events; compute MTBF/MTTR per machine; non-exponential survival if needed.
  - Causal impact on KPIs: compare windows before/after breakdowns for queue growth, WIP spikes, tardiness increments; estimate time-to-recovery.
  - For hot jobs: measure preemption effects, displacement costs on existing WIP; quantify induced tardiness elsewhere.

Tools/techniques
- Discovery: Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner, OC-PM.
- Conformance: alignments against master routings to detect skips/rework/unplanned steps.
- Bottleneck analysis: performance DFGs, waiting-time heatmaps, work-in-progress over time.
- Resource/social network mining: handover-of-work and collaboration networks.
- Statistical modeling: survival analysis for breakdowns; distribution fitting for process/setup times; predictive models for setup and processing durations.

2) DIAGNOSING SCHEDULING PATHOLOGIES

Evidence and how to surface it with process mining
- Structural and dynamic bottlenecks:
  - Machines with availability-adjusted utilization >85–90%, very high queue times, and long WIP tails.
  - Bottleneck drift: which resource is the bottleneck by time-of-day/week? Use time-sliced performance DFGs.
  - Quantify throughput sensitivity: correlation between bottleneck busy time and shop output.
- Poor prioritization:
  - Variant analysis: compare on-time vs late jobs; observe more time waiting at certain stages for late jobs despite high priority.
  - Priority response lag: time from priority change to first processing start; frequency of high-priority jobs queued behind low-priority ones.
- Suboptimal sequencing and setup inflation:
  - Excess setups relative to a “family-first” ordering: compare actual daily sequence against heuristic lower bounds; compute avoidable setup time = actual  expected best-of-heuristic.
  - Identify “bad transition” edges consuming disproportionate setup time; frequency and percentage of day spent on them.
- Starvation and blocking:
  - Downstream starvation windows overlapped with upstream bottleneck congestion. Cross-correlation of upstream completions with downstream idle time.
  - Blocking at constrained buffers; time jobs await move due to downstream queues.
- WIP bullwhip:
  - Variance amplification of WIP from upstream to downstream centers; coefficient of variation increases along the route.
  - Oscillatory release/processing cycles visible in WIP-over-time plots; link to breakdowns/hot-job injections.
- Disruption sensitivity:
  - Quantify KPI deltas during breakdown periods: p95 waiting increases, tardiness spikes.
  - Identify machines whose breakdowns cause the largest marginal tardiness increase per hour lost.

3) ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF SCHEDULING INEFFECTIVENESS

Likely root causes
- Static local dispatch rules (FCFS/EDD) ignore:
  - Sequence-dependent setup costs, causing frequent “bad transitions.”
  - Remaining processing across entire route, causing local myopia and downstream starvation.
  - Time-varying bottlenecks and disruption risk.
- Limited real-time visibility and coordination:
  - No shop-wide view of queues and predicted completions; work centers optimize locally.
  - No formal WIP control or release gating; arrivals are bursty, inflating queues and lead times.
- Data and modeling gaps:
  - Planned vs actual task and setup times diverge; planning models underestimate variability and setup dependency.
  - No predictive maintenance; breakdowns blindside schedules; no contingency buffers.
- Response to disruptions and hot jobs:
  - Hot-job preemption is unmanaged; it causes large displacement penalties on critical bottlenecks without mitigation plans.

Separating scheduling logic issues from structural capacity limits
- Decomposition of job lead time:
  - Measure shares of time in queue vs processing vs setup vs breakdown/repair.
  - If queues dominate while utilizations are well below availability-adjusted capacity, scheduling/policies are the culprit.
  - If a few machines are constantly >90–95% busy even under “best” historical days, capacity is the constraint; scheduling can only buffer and prioritize but not eliminate tardiness.
- Counterfactuals via log replay:
  - Remove breakdown intervals; estimate hypothetical completion times to quantify breakdown contribution to lateness.
  - Replace actual sequences with setup-efficient sequences using the learned setup model; estimate avoidable setup time and resultant tardiness reduction.
- Predictive models for tardiness:
  - Train model using features: initial slack, bottleneck queue at release, expected setup transitions, breakdown exposure. Feature importance and SHAP analyses reveal whether lateness is primarily driven by queues (policy), setup transitions (sequencing), or pure capacity (processing time mass).

4) DEVELOPING ADVANCED DATA-DRIVEN SCHEDULING STRATEGIES

Strategy 1: Dynamic, setup-aware, due-date-and-congestion-sensitive dispatching
- Core logic
  - At each machine decision, compute a composite priority index for each candidate job in queue:
    - Due date urgency: slack = due date  now  remaining processing (across remaining route).
    - Processing time: predicted task duration for the current machine (from mined distributions or ML).
    - Setup penalty: expected setup time from the learned transition model given the currently completed job on that machine.
    - Downstream congestion risk: predicted queue at the next machine(s) at the job’s ETA; penalize sequences that will block downstream or induce starvation elsewhere.
    - Priority multiplier: hot jobs get higher weight; apply caps to prevent starvation of standard work.
    - Breakdown risk: reliability-adjusted availability in the next window; avoid starting long tasks just before high breakdown-risk windows unless urgent.
  - The index generalizes ATC/ATCS: score  exp(slack/k1) / (proc_time + expected_setup + k2·downstream_load) with priority and reliability multipliers; weights k1,k2 tuned via simulation.
- Process mining inputs
  - Predicted processing and setup distributions; downstream arrival forecasts from event log regressions; machine calendars and breakdown survival models.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Reduces “bad transitions” (setup inflation), improves on-time performance for urgent jobs, and balances flow by factoring downstream congestion.
- Expected impact
  - Tardiness reduction 20–35%; p95 lead time reduction 15–25%; total setup time reduction 10–20%; better bottleneck service levels with minimal additional instability (when paired with small freeze windows).

Strategy 2: Predictive, rolling-horizon scheduling with stochastic durations and maintenance risk
- Core logic
  - Every 30–60 minutes (and on major events) solve a short-horizon schedule for key bottlenecks and their feeders:
    - Use ML-predicted task and setup times with prediction intervals; propagate uncertainty across the route.
    - Incorporate predictive maintenance: schedule micro-opportunistic maintenance in low-risk windows; avoid assigning long tasks into high-failure-risk intervals.
    - Compute job completion risk (probability of tardiness) and propose reallocation to alternate machines when risk exceeds threshold.
  - Use CP/MILP or metaheuristics with uncertainty buffers; protect stability via a freeze window for tasks already started or within 15–30 minutes of start.
- Process mining inputs
  - Per-task predictive models (features: job family, size, operator, time-of-day); breakdown survival/Weibull models; data-driven alternate-route performance.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Lateness stemming from underestimated durations and unexpected breakdowns; improves schedule realism; proactive load balancing.
- Expected impact
  - Tardiness reduction 25–40% in variable environments; schedule reliability improved (forecast error drops 30–50%); fewer emergency preemptions.

Strategy 3: Setup-time optimization via family sequencing and intelligent batching on bottlenecks
- Core logic
  - Daily (or per shift) construct setup-efficient sequences on the dominant bottlenecks:
    - Cluster jobs into families using learned features (tools, material, tolerances); maintain due-date feasibility.
    - Solve a sequence-dependent single-machine problem with tardiness and setup penalties for the bottleneck(s) using metaheuristics (e.g., iterated local search, simulated annealing) on the mined setup matrix.
    - Create time-boxed “family waves” (mini-batches) with bounded window so urgent jobs can still be inserted with minimal penalty.
  - Coordinate release to feed these sequences: gate upstream releases (or queue orders) so jobs arrive just-in-time for the family wave.
- Process mining inputs
  - Empirical setup transition matrix; family similarity model; historical due-date adherence distributions to choose batch window sizes without jeopardizing SLAs.
- Pathologies addressed
  - Eliminates high-cost changeovers; smooths WIP; stabilizes bottleneck output; reduces starvation downstream via coordinated releases.
- Expected impact
  - Setup time reduction 20–40% on target machines; throughput +5–15% at the bottleneck; WIP reduction 15–30% in upstream queues; due-date performance improves where setup dominated lateness.

Strategy 4 (complementary): Pull-based WIP control and smart order release (CONWIP/POLCA-style)
- Core logic
  - Establish WIP caps per routing segment and a global CONWIP limit tuned from log-derived Little’s Law relationships.
  - Release orders only when predicted load at bottlenecks is below a threshold; use Equivalent Workload (EWL) or load-based release by family to keep flow leveled.
  - Couple with Strategy 1 for intra-center dispatch.
- Process mining inputs
  - Empirical cycle times vs WIP curves; load sensitivity by product family; queue-length distributions.
- Pathologies addressed
  - WIP bullwhip, long queues, unpredictable lead times; reduces starvation/blocking patterns by smoothing arrivals.
- Expected impact
  - Mean lead time reduction 20–35%; p95 lead time reduction 25–40%; WIP reduction 30–50% with minor throughput loss (often none if bottleneck managed well).

Implementation notes
- Begin with one or two bottlenecks and their feeders; deploy Strategy 1 with modest weights; add Strategy 3’s batched sequences on those bottlenecks; gate releases (Strategy 4) to support the planned sequences; layer Strategy 2’s rolling-horizon scheduling for resilience to disruptions.

5) SIMULATION, EVALUATION, AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Discrete-event simulation (DES) to test before deployment
- Model structure
  - Entities: jobs with routings; resources: machines and operators; buffers with finite capacity.
  - Time elements from mining:
    - Processing and setup times by machine and job family; conditional setup distributions from the transition model.
    - Transport and move times if relevant (from log timestamps).
    - Arrival process of orders by product family and priority.
    - Breakdown/repair modeled from MTBF/MTTR distributions or survival models; optionally time-of-day effects.
  - Policies to compare: Baseline FCFS/EDD, Strategy 1, Strategy 2, Strategy 3 (with and without WIP gating), plus hybrid combinations.
- Validation
  - Backtest: replay last quarter’s arrivals; ensure simulated distributions for waiting, processing, setups, and utilization match logs (KS tests, QQ plots).
  - Face validity with supervisors: compare predicted bottlenecks and queues to real experience.
- Experimental design
  - Scenarios:
    - Load levels: 90%, 100%, 110%, 130% of average demand.
    - Disruptions: baseline vs high-breakdown (20% MTBF), and hot-job surges.
    - Due-date tightness variations; setup-intensity variations (simulate family mix).
    - Alternative staffing calendars or cross-training levels.
  - Replications: 20–30 runs per scenario; warm-up removal; 95% confidence intervals.
- Evaluation metrics
  - Service KPIs: mean/median/p90/p95 tardiness, on-time delivery % by priority.
  - Flow KPIs: mean/p90 flow time, WIP levels per center, queue-time shares.
  - Resource KPIs: utilization, setup ratio, blocking/starvation time, breakdown sensitivity.
  - Stability: reschedules per shift, schedule changes within freeze window.
  - Multi-objective analysis: Pareto front; choose policy via weighted utility reflecting business priorities.
- Parameter tuning
  - Use Bayesian optimization or grid search over Strategy 1 weights, batch window sizes (Strategy 3), and WIP caps (Strategy 4).
  - Stress-test with unseen demand mixes to ensure robustness.

Continuous monitoring and adaptation with ongoing process mining
- Near real-time monitoring
  - Streaming event ingestion; recompute key KPIs every 5–10 minutes: WIP, queue times by machine, bottleneck identity, risk-of-tardiness by job, adherence to planned sequences.
  - Control charts for WIP and lead time; alert on out-of-control signals.
- Drift detection and model refresh
  - Detect shifts in processing/setup time distributions (ADWIN/CUSUM); retrain duration/setup models weekly or when drift detected.
  - Re-estimate breakdown survival monthly; update maintenance risk profiles.
  - Update family clustering and transition matrix quarterly, or sooner when new product types arrive.
- Policy adaptation
  - Periodically re-optimize Strategy 1 weights based on recent performance; enforce guardrails (e.g., minimum service level for non-urgent jobs).
  - Adjust WIP caps with Little’s Law targets to maintain desired lead-time percentiles.
  - A/B test small policy variations; promote winners.
- Governance and usability
  - Dashboards linking decisions to outcomes: show why a job was prioritized (slack, setup savings, downstream load).
  - Freeze windows and escalation rules for hot jobs to avoid chaos.
  - Post-mortems on late orders: automatic attribution to queue, setup, breakdown, or data error.

Closing expectations
- With the above, Precision Parts Inc. should expect substantial improvements: 20–40% reduction in tardiness and p95 lead time, 15–30% reduction in total setup time on target bottlenecks, and 30–50% reduction in WIP under pull-based release—validated in DES before rollout. The combined effect comes from three levers: sequencing to cut changeovers, dispatching that looks beyond the local queue, and WIP control to stabilize flow, all continuously informed by process mining and refreshed as the operation evolves.
