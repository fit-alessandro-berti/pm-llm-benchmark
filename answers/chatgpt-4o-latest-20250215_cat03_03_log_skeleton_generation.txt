Here's the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process:  

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC')},  # If 'Receive Order' occurs, 'Invoice Customer' occurs the same number of times
    'always_before': {('RI', 'CA'), ('PI', 'RI'), ('QC', 'PI'), ('PO', 'QC'), ('GSL', 'PO'), ('D', 'GSL'), ('RP', 'IC')},  
    # Example: 'Reserve Items' (RI) always happens after 'Check Availability' (CA)  
    
    'always_after': {('CA', 'RO'), ('RI', 'CA'), ('PI', 'RI'), ('QC', 'PI'), ('PO', 'QC'), ('GSL', 'PO'), ('D', 'GSL'), ('IC', 'RO'), ('RP', 'IC')},  
    # Example: 'Check Availability' (CA) must always occur after 'Receive Order' (RO)  
    
    'never_together': {('RP', 'RO')},  # Example: 'Record Payment' (RP) and 'Receive Order' (RO) never occur in the same case  
    
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {0, 1}, 'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
    },  
    # Example: 'RO' (Receive Order) happens exactly once, 'QC' (Quality Check) may happen 0 or 1 time  
    
    'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('IC', 'RP')}  
    # Example: 'RO' is immediately followed by 'CA' (Check Availability)  
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence:** `'RO'` and `'IC'` occur the same number of times since every received order must be invoiced.  
- **Always Before:** Each step must have been completed before the next one (e.g., picking items must happen before quality check).  
- **Always After:** Ensures dependencies in the reverse direction (e.g., checking availability must happen after receiving an order).  
- **Never Together:** `'RP'` (Record Payment) and `'RO'` (Receive Order) never occur in the same case, assuming payment is handled separately.  
- **Activity Occurrences:** Defines how often each activity can occur per case. `'QC'` and `'RP'` may or may not happen.  
- **Directly Follows:** Specifies strict sequences where one event must immediately follow another (e.g., picking is immediately followed by quality check).
