Here’s a concise description of what the visualization shows:

- Type: A crossfunctional business process diagram (BPMNstyle) with four swim lanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.
- Start and flow: It begins in Sales on Monday morning and shows how an order moves through the organization to fulfillment and shipping.
- Key steps by lane:
  - Sales: Check order completeness  Check if the customer is in the database  If not, add the customer to the database  Send order details downstream  Draft invoice.
  - Production: Receive order details  Plan production  Manufacture product  Complete product.
  - Procurement (with a sub-process): Order materials  Check materials  (loops for material issues) Return material or cancel order as needed  Material/Procurement checks.
  - Warehouse: Receive the completed product  Send product to the customer (ship).
- Information and data flow:
  - Dashed arrows indicate information/data flowing between departments (order details), not physical movement.
  - A database symbol is shown where customer data is stored/updated.
- Notation: Uses standard BPMN-like symbols—tasks (rounded rectangles), gateways/decisions (diamonds), subprocess box, and data stores (cylinder).
- Purpose: To illustrate end-to-end order fulfillment—from order receipt and customer verification in Sales, through production and material procurement, to storage/packing and shipping in Warehouse—with loops for exceptions (e.g., material issues, cancellations).
