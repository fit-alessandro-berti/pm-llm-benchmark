Certainly! Let's start by identifying where potential bias might exist in the loan application process and then add the necessary constraints to mitigate it. Based on the provided model and the context of loan application review, we will add constraints that ensure fairness and consistency.

### Updated DECLARE Model with Bias-Mitigating Constraints

### Explanation of Added Constraints

1. **Coexistence Constraints:**
   - `Approve_Minority`: Ensures that if `Approve` (`FinalDecision`) is made for a minority applicant, `ManualReview` must be present.
   - `Reject_Minority`: Ensures that if `Reject` (`FinalDecision`) is made for a minority applicant, `ManualReview` must be present.
   - This ensures that decisions for applicants from sensitive demographics are reviewed by a human to prevent biased outcomes.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`: `BiasMitigationCheck` must be performed before any decision is made. This ensures that no decision is made directly based on sensitive attributes.
   - `Reject_Minority`: `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview` must be present before a `Reject` is made for a minority applicant.
   - This mitigates the risk of decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

3. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`: Ensures that `Approve` and `Reject` cannot immediately follow `CheckApplicantRace` without a `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`.
   - `Reject_Minority`: Ensures that `Approve` and `Reject` cannot be made directly after `CheckApplicantRace` for minority applicants without additional checks.
   - This prevents decisions from being made immediately after sensitive attribute checks, reducing the likelihood of biased outcomes.

By adding these constraints, we ensure that the loan application process is fair and unbiased, with all decision steps being reviewed and validated by additional checks, especially for sensitive applicant attributes.
