The textual specification describes a very simple, linear “happy path” when stock is available – Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close – and a direct cancellation path when stock is not available – Receive  Check  Cancel  Close. The key ordering constraints it highlights are:

- No payment work until after the inventory check.
- Payment authorisation belongs before any fulfilment steps.
- Packaging belongs between authorisation and shipping.
- Shipping only after packaging and never after a cancellation.
- Cancellation, if it happens, shortcircuits the fulfilment; the next reasonable step is closing the order.

Applied to the logged cases:

- Case1 follows the receive/check/authorize/package/ship/close sequence exactly; there is no deviation.

- Case2 does check the inventory first, but then packages the items before authorising payment. That violates the stated ordering: “Authorize payment … before packaging,” and “Package items should only occur after authorization.” Payment is also approved after packaging, which is the reverse of the intended order.

- Case3 mixes the branches. After checking inventory it authorises payment and then cancels the order; in the cancellation scenario the description says to “directly proceed to ‘Cancel order’,” making authorisation inappropriate. It then goes on to “Ship order” after cancellation and without any packaging step. Both shipping after a cancellation and shipping without prior packaging conflict with “Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.”

- Case4 follows the cancellation path – receive, check, cancel, close – so it is consistent.

- Case5 follows the fulfillment path up to authorisation but jumps directly to shipping, omitting “Package items.” Shipping without a packaging step violates “Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping,” and “Ship order” should only occur after packaging.

Accordingly, cases2,3 and5 deviate from the described process.
