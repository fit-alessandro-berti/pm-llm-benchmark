# Bias Analysis of the Application Process

## Identified Sources of Bias

### 1. **Community Group Affiliation Bias**

The most explicit bias appears in the **+10 point adjustment** given to members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club":

- **C001**: Score boosted from 710  720, resulting in **Approval**
- **C004**: Score boosted from 690  700, resulting in **Approval**

**Critical Issue**: C004 is particularly problematic. With an original score of 690, this applicant likely fell below the approval threshold. The community bonus elevated them to 700, crossing into approval territory. Meanwhile, C003 with a score of 715 (25 points higher organically) was **rejected**.

**Disparity**: An applicant with demonstrably lower creditworthiness (C004: 690) receives approval while a more creditworthy applicant (C003: 715) faces rejection, solely due to club membership.

### 2. **Local Residency Bias**

The "LocalResident" attribute shows a stark pattern:

| LocalResident | Outcomes |
|---------------|----------|
| TRUE (C001, C002, C004) | 3/3 Approved (100%) |
| FALSE (C003, C005) | 1/2 Approved (50%) |

**Key Observation**: C003 (non-local, score 715) was rejected, while C002 (local, score 720) was approved. The 5-point difference seems marginal, but the local residency may be a hidden factor influencing the threshold or manual review process.

### 3. **Compounding Advantage**

Applicants with **both** local residency AND community group membership receive maximum advantage:
- Direct score adjustment (+10 points)
- Possible implicit bias during manual review
- These benefits compound, creating a substantial advantage over otherwise similar applicants

## Fairness Implications

### **For Marginalized Groups**

1. **Geographic Discrimination**: Non-local residents face higher barriers, potentially discriminating against:
   - Recent immigrants or migrants
   - Workers who relocated for employment
   - Students from other regions
   - Anyone unable to establish "local" status

2. **Social Capital Discrimination**: The community group bonus favors those with:
   - Time and resources to join civic organizations
   - Cultural knowledge of local groups
   - Social networks providing information about beneficial affiliations
   - No caregiving or work constraints preventing participation

3. **Intersectional Disadvantage**: Applicants who are both non-local AND lack community affiliations face double penalties

### **Creditworthiness vs. Social Factors**

The system conflates **actual financial risk** with **social integration**:

- **C004** (690 base score) represents higher credit risk than **C003** (715 base score)
- Yet C004 is approved and C003 rejected
- This suggests community connection is valued over financial reliability

## Structural Issues

### **Lack of Transparency**
- Applicants may not know that club membership affects scoring
- No evidence that the +10 adjustment is disclosed or that its rationale is justified
- Creates an "insider knowledge" advantage

### **Arbitrary Adjustments**
- Why +10 points specifically?
- Why this particular club?
- Are other community groups eligible, or only certain ones?
- No evidence of actuarial justification for the adjustment

### **Manual Review Concerns**
All cases undergo manual review, but:
- Reviewers may harbor implicit biases favoring local residents
- The community group attribute is visible to reviewers, potentially anchoring decisions
- No evidence of bias training or decision auditing

## Equity Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Remove community group adjustments** unless actuarially justified by default data
2. **Audit the local residency factor** to ensure it's not a proxy for protected characteristics
3. **Implement blind review** where possible, hiding non-credit-relevant attributes

### **Systemic Changes**
1. **Evidence-based scoring**: Any adjustment must be statistically validated as predictive of actual outcomes
2. **Adverse impact analysis**: Regularly test whether policies disproportionately affect protected groups
3. **Alternative pathways**: If community integration is genuinely valued, create multiple ways to demonstrate it beyond exclusive club membership
4. **Transparency**: Disclose all factors affecting decisions and their weights

### **Monitoring**
1. Track approval rates by demographic characteristics
2. Analyze whether adjusted scores predict outcomes better than base scores
3. Review rejected applications with higher base scores than approved applications

## Conclusion

This process exhibits **structural bias** that systematically advantages socially connected local residents over potentially more creditworthy outsiders. The +10 community bonus operates as a discriminatory mechanism that lacks transparent justification and produces inequitable outcomes. Case C004's approval over C003's rejection exemplifies how social factors override financial merit, raising serious fairness and potentially legal concerns about disparate impact on protected classes.
