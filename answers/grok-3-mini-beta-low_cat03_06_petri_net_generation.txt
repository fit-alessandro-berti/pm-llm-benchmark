<think>
First, the scenario describes an insurance claim process with activities: C (Insurance Claim), CR (Claim Registration), DV (Document Verification), FC (Fraud Check), CA (Claim Assessment), AP (Approval), P (Payment), N (Notification), and CL (Closure). There are also loops: after DV, if documents are incomplete, go to RDS (Re-Document Submission), and after FC, if doubts, go to II (In-depth Investigation), which can happen multiple times.

I need to model this as a Petri net. In Petri nets, places represent states, transitions represent activities, and tokens represent the flow.

Key elements:

- Places: These will be states like "after C and before CR", "after CR and before DV", etc. Also, special places for loops.

- Transitions: Labeled with the activities: C, CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL, RDS, II.

- Arcs: Connect places to transitions and vice versa.

Initial marking: A token in a start place, say "new claim".

Final marking: A token in a place representing the closed claim.

Let me sketch a rough sequence:

1. Start with a place for the new claim.

2. Transition: C (Insurance Claim) – but the prompt says "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C)", so maybe C is the starting point, but the process starts after that. The description says "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place:", so perhaps the net starts with CR.

To be precise, the initial marking is for a new claim arriving, so let's have a source place.

Standard Petri net for processes often has a source place with a token.

So, let's define places:

- p_start: Initial place with a token.

- Then, transition: CR (Claim Registration)

- After CR, place: p_after_CR

- From p_after_CR, transition: DV (Document Verification)

- After DV, we have a choice: if documents are ok, go to FC; if not, go to RDS.

For the loop: After DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV.

So, probably:

- From p_after_DV, two possibilities: directly to FC if ok, or to RDS.

In Petri nets, we use separate places or transitions to model choices.

A common way is to have the DV transition lead to a place, and from that place, arcs to different transitions based on conditions. But since Petri nets are for concurrency and sequences, for choices, we might need to model it with multiple outgoing arcs.

For loops:

After DV, if documents need re-submission, go to RDS, and after RDS, back to DV.

After FC, if investigation needed, go to II, and after II, back to FC (since it can happen multiple times).

The description: "if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA)."

So, probably: After FC, if no doubts, go to CA; if doubts, go to II, and after II, back to FC.

That makes sense for multiple investigations.

Main flow:

p_start -> C? Wait, does C need to be a transition? The process starts with C, but perhaps C is the first transition.

The prompt says: "A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place: 1. CR, etc."

So, perhaps the net starts with a place, then transition C, then to CR, etc.

To match the initial marking: "representing a new claim arriving", so maybe p_start has the token, and firing C moves it forward.

In the example, they have source -> execute_activity -> sink.

So, let's list the places and transitions.

Transitions:

- t_C: "Insurance Claim"

- t_CR: "Claim Registration"

- t_DV: "Document Verification"

- t_RDS: "Re-Document Submission"

- t_FC: "Fraud Check"

- t_II: "In-depth Investigation"

- t_CA: "Claim Assessment"

- t_AP: "Approval"

- t_P: "Payment"

- t_N: "Notification"

- t_CL: "Closure"

Places:

- p_start: initial place

- p_after_C: after filing the claim

- p_after_CR: after registration

- p_ready_for_DV: before DV

I need to think carefully.

A simpler way: places between transitions.

- p_start

- t_C -> p_after_C

- t_CR -> p_after_CR

- t_DV -> p_after_DV  (but from p_after_DV, need to handle the loop)

For the DV loop:

From p_before_DV -> t_DV -> p_after_DV

From p_after_DV, if documents ok, go to p_before_FC

If not, go to p_before_RDS

Then, t_RDS -> p_after_RDS -> back to p_before_DV

In Petri nets, transitions are enabled based on tokens, so I need to model the choice.

One way is to have p_after_DV connect to two transitions: one for "proceed" and one for "re-submit", but since the choice is based on some condition, in standard Petri nets, it's non-deterministic.

For modeling, we can have:

From p_after_DV, an arc to t_FC (if ok), and an arc to t_RDS (if not).

To make it a loop, after t_RDS, go back to p_before_DV or directly to t_DV.

Let's define it properly.

Perhaps:

- ... -> p1 -> t_DV -> p2

From p2, arc to t_FC  (for normal flow)

And from p2, arc to t_RDS

Then, t_RDS -> p3 -> t_DV  (back to DV)

Yes.

For FC and II:

After t_FC -> p_after_FC

From p_after_FC, arc to t_CA (if no doubts)

And arc to t_II (if doubts)

Then, t_II -> p_after_II -> t_FC (back to FC)

After the last t_FC (no doubts), it goes to t_CA.

Yes.

Then, the rest is sequential: t_CA -> p_after_CA -> t_AP -> p_after_AP -> t_P -> p_after_P -> t_N -> p_after_N -> t_CL -> p_end

Finally, p_end is the final place.

So, let's list the places:

1. p_start

2. p_after_C

3. p_after_CR

4. p_before_DV  (or just p_after_CR can lead to t_DV)

To minimize, I can have:

p_start -> t_C -> p1

p1 -> t_CR -> p2

p2 -> t_DV -> p3  // p3 is after DV

From p3 -> t_FC  // if ok

From p3 -> t_RDS

t_RDS -> p4  // after RDS

p4 -> t_DV  // back to DV

From t_FC -> p5  // after FC

From p5 -> t_CA  // if no doubts

From p5 -> t_II

t_II -> p6  // after II

p6 -> t_FC  // back to FC

Then, from t_CA -> p7

p7 -> t_AP -> p8

p8 -> t_P -> p9

p9 -> t_N -> p10

p10 -> t_CL -> p_end

Yes, that works.

Initial marking: token in p_start

Final marking: token in p_end

In code, I need to create the Petri net, add places, transitions, arcs, and define im and fm.

Using pm4py, as in the example.

First, import necessary:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Then, net = PetriNet('insurance_claim')

Add places:

p_start = PetriNet.Place('p_start')

net.places.add(p_start)

Similarly for others.

Add transitions:

t_C = PetriNet.Transition('t_C', 'Insurance Claim')

net.transitions.add(t_C)

And so on.

Add arcs:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_start, t_C, net)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_C, p1, net)  // where p1 is p_after_C

Etc.

Finally, im = Marking({p_start: 1})

fm = Marking({p_end: 1})

I need to define all these in code.

List them explicitly:

Places:

p_start

p_after_C

p_after_CR  # p2

p_after_DV  # p3

p_after_RDS  # p4  (after RDS, before DV again)

In my earlier sketch, t_RDS -> p4 -> t_DV

So, p4 could be called p_before_DV_again, but to keep it simple, let's call it p_after_RDS_and_ready_for_DV

For brevity, I'll name them descriptively.

p_after_FC  # p5

p_after_II  # p6, which leads back to t_FC

p_after_CA  # p7

p_after_AP  # p8

p_after_P   # p9

p_after_N   # p10

p_end       # after t_CL

p_after_II leads to t_FC, so p_after_II -> t_FC

Yes.

In code:

First, create net.

Then, create all places and add to net.

Create all transitions and add to net.

Then, add arcs.

Finally, define im and fm.

One potential issue: in Petri nets, for the loops, as long as there's a token in p3, it can go to either t_FC or t_RDS, depending on which is enabled, but since both would be enabled if they have no input places other than p3, wait no.

t_FC would have input p3, and t_RDS would have input p3, so when there's a token in p3, both t_FC and t_RDS are enabled, so the net is non-deterministic, which models the choice.

Similarly for p5: token in p5 enables both t_CA and t_II.

That's fine for this model.

Alright, let's write the code step by step.

First:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet('insurance_claim_process')

# Places

p_start = PetriNet.Place('p_start')

p_after_C = PetriNet.Place('p_after_C')

p_after_CR = PetriNet.Place('p_after_CR')

p_after_DV = PetriNet.Place('p_after_DV')

p_after_RDS = PetriNet.Place('p_after_RDS')  # This will lead back to t_DV

p_after_FC = PetriNet.Place('p_after_FC')

p_after_II = PetriNet.Place('p_after_II')  # Leads back to t_FC

p_after_CA = PetriNet.Place('p_after_CA')

p_after_AP = PetriNet.Place('p_after_AP')

p_after_P = PetriNet.Place('p_after_P')

p_after_N = PetriNet.Place('p_after_N')

p_end = PetriNet.Place('p_end')

# Add places to net

net.places.add(p_start)

net.places.add(p_after_C)

net.places.add(p_after_CR)

net.places.add(p_after_DV)

net.places.add(p_after_RDS)

net.places.add(p_after_FC)

net.places.add(p_after_II)

net.places.add(p_after_CA)

net.places.add(p_after_AP)

net.places.add(p_after_P)

net.places.add(p_after_N)

net.places.add(p_end)

# Transitions

t_C = PetriNet.Transition('t_C', 'Insurance Claim')

t_CR = PetriNet.Transition('t_CR', 'Claim Registration')

t_DV = PetriNet.Transition('t_DV', 'Document Verification')

t_RDS = PetriNet.Transition('t_RDS', 'Re-Document Submission')

t_FC = PetriNet.Transition('t_FC', 'Fraud Check')

t_II = PetriNet.Transition('t_II', 'In-depth Investigation')

t_CA = PetriNet.Transition('t_CA', 'Claim Assessment')

t_AP = PetriNet.Transition('t_AP', 'Approval')

t_P = PetriNet.Transition('t_P', 'Payment')

t_N = PetriNet.Transition('t_N', 'Notification')

t_CL = PetriNet.Transition('t_CL', 'Closure')

# Add transitions to net

net.transitions.add(t_C)

net.transitions.add(t_CR)

net.transitions.add(t_DV)

net.transitions.add(t_RDS)

net.transitions.add(t_FC)

net.transitions.add(t_II)

net.transitions.add(t_CA)

net.transitions.add(t_AP)

net.transitions.add(t_P)

net.transitions.add(t_N)

net.transitions.add(t_CL)

# Now, add arcs

# p_start -> t_C

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_start, t_C, net)

# t_C -> p_after_C

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_C, p_after_C, net)

# p_after_C -> t_CR

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_C, t_CR, net)

# t_CR -> p_after_CR

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CR, p_after_CR, net)

# p_after_CR -> t_DV

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_CR, t_DV, net)

# t_DV -> p_after_DV

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_DV, p_after_DV, net)

# From p_after_DV -> t_FC  (for normal flow)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_DV, t_FC, net)

# And p_after_DV -> t_RDS  (for re-submission)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_DV, t_RDS, net)

# t_RDS -> p_after_RDS

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_RDS, p_after_RDS, net)

# p_after_RDS -> t_DV  (back to DV)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_RDS, t_DV, net)

# t_FC -> p_after_FC

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_FC, p_after_FC, net)

# From p_after_FC -> t_CA  (if no doubts)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_FC, t_CA, net)

# And p_after_FC -> t_II  (if doubts)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_FC, t_II, net)

# t_II -> p_after_II

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_II, p_after_II, net)

# p_after_II -> t_FC  (back to FC)

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_II, t_FC, net)

# t_CA -> p_after_CA

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CA, p_after_CA, net)

# p_after_CA -> t_AP

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_CA, t_AP, net)

# t_AP -> p_after_AP

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_AP, p_after_AP, net)

# p_after_AP -> t_P

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_AP, t_P, net)

# t_P -> p_after_P

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_P, p_after_P, net)

# p_after_P -> t_N

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_P, t_N, net)

# t_N -> p_after_N

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_N, p_after_N, net)

# p_after_N -> t_CL

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_after_N, t_CL, net)

# t_CL -> p_end

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_CL, p_end, net)

Finally,

im = Marking({p_start: 1})

fm = Marking({p_end: 1})

That should be it.

In the code, I need to ensure all places and transitions are correctly referenced.

In the example, they used net.places.add(source), which I did.

I think that's complete.

This code constructs an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process. The net includes:
- **Places** representing states between activities.
- **Transitions** labeled with the activity names.
- **Arcs** forming the sequence, including loops for re-document submission (between DV and RDS) and in-depth investigation (between FC and II).
- **Initial marking (im)** with a token in `p_start`, representing a new claim.
- **Final marking (fm)** with a token in `p_end`, representing a closed claim.
