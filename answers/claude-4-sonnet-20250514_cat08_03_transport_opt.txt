# Process Mining Analysis for Speedy Parcels: A Comprehensive Optimization Approach

## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Data Preprocessing and Integration

**Integration Strategy:**
The multi-source event log requires careful preprocessing to create a unified, analysis-ready dataset:

**Data Harmonization:**
- **Timestamp Synchronization:** Align all timestamps to a common timezone and format, accounting for potential clock drift between GPS units and handheld scanners
- **Location Standardization:** Convert all location data to a consistent coordinate system (WGS84) and geocode depot/customer addresses for spatial analysis
- **Case ID Strategy:** Use "Vehicle-Day" as primary case identifier, with sub-cases for individual delivery routes or package journeys when needed
- **Activity Mapping:** Create a standardized activity taxonomy mapping scanner events, GPS states, and dispatch milestones to consistent process activities

**Key Challenges:**
- **Data Quality Issues:** GPS signal loss in urban canyons, delayed scanner synchronization, and missing events requiring interpolation techniques
- **Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data (30-second intervals) vs. scanner events (milestone-based) requiring temporal correlation algorithms
- **Multi-perspective Integration:** Balancing vehicle-centric, driver-centric, and package-centric views through hierarchical case structures

### Process Discovery Implementation

**Discovery Approach:**
Using a combination of algorithms to capture different process aspects:

**Primary Discovery:**
- **Directly-Follows Graphs (DFG)** for high-level process flow visualization showing major activity transitions
- **Inductive Miner** for structured process models handling noise and incomplete traces
- **Fuzzy Mining** to manage process complexity and identify dominant patterns while filtering infrequent behavior

**Multi-Level Analysis:**
- **Macro-Level:** Complete delivery rounds (Depot  Multiple Stops  Depot)
- **Meso-Level:** Individual delivery attempts (Arrive Customer  Service  Depart)
- **Micro-Level:** Detailed location-based movement patterns and dwell time analysis

**Specialized Models:**
- **Geospatial Process Maps:** Overlaying discovered processes on geographic maps to identify spatial patterns
- **Temporal Process Variants:** Separate models for different time periods (rush hour, off-peak, seasonal variations)

### Conformance Checking Strategy

**Planned vs. Actual Comparison:**
- **Route Adherence Analysis:** Compare planned stop sequences against actual delivery order using alignment-based conformance checking
- **Time Window Compliance:** Measure deviations from planned arrival times and customer time windows
- **Resource Allocation Conformance:** Verify actual driver assignments, vehicle usage, and package loading against dispatch plans

**Deviation Categories to Monitor:**
- **Sequence Deviations:** Stops visited out of planned order (potential route optimization opportunities)
- **Unplanned Activities:** Emergency maintenance, fuel stops, extended breaks not in original schedule
- **Time Deviations:** Significant delays or unexpectedly fast completion times indicating planning accuracy issues
- **Geographic Deviations:** Detours from planned routes due to traffic, road closures, or driver decisions

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
