### Justification:

- **C001:** Renamed `Verify Documents` activities to reflect their roles in the verification process and context of being repeated.
- **C002:** Modified the call-related steps to include specifics like follow-up calls or clarifications, distinguishing between them clearly.
- **C003:** Changed the branch office interaction to highlight physical presence ("CustomerRequestInitiationBranch") along with more specific agent actions during document verification and re-verification.

This renaming ensures each activity is clear about its context and role within the support workflow.
