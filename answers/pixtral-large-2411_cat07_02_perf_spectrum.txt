The image is a Sankey diagram, which is a type of flow diagram used to visualize the flow of quantities over time. Here's a detailed summary of the diagram:

1. **Horizontal Axis (Time):**
   - The horizontal axis represents time, spanning from January 25, 2000, to April 24, 2013.

2. **Vertical Layers:**
   - The diagram is divided into three horizontal layers, each representing different stages in a process.

3. **Top Layer (Send Fine):**
   - This layer consists of numerous vertical lines that represent instances of sending fines.
   - The lines are densely packed, indicating a high frequency of fines being sent over the time period.

4. **Middle Layer (Insert Fine Notification):**
   - This layer shows the insertion of fine notifications.
   - The lines flow from the top layer down to this middle layer, indicating the progression from sending fines to inserting fine notifications.
   - The density of lines decreases compared to the top layer, suggesting fewer fine notifications relative to the number of fines sent.

5. **Bottom Layer (Send for Credit Collection):**
   - This layer represents the final stage where fines are sent for credit collection.
   - The lines flow from the middle layer down to this bottom layer, showing the transition from fine notifications to credit collection.
   - The lines are even more sparse here, indicating that only a subset of the fine notifications proceed to the credit collection stage.

6. **Flow Lines:**
   - The red lines connecting the layers represent the flow of fines through the different stages.
   - The thickness of the lines varies, indicating the volume of fines moving through each stage at different times.
   - There are noticeable clusters of lines at certain points, suggesting periods of higher activity or concentration of fines moving through the system.

7. **Overall Flow:**
   - The diagram illustrates the entire process from sending fines to collecting them, showing how the quantity diminishes at each stage.
   - The flow lines provide a visual representation of the efficiency and progression of the fine collection process over the specified time period.

In summary, the Sankey diagram effectively visualizes the flow and reduction of fines through different stages (sending fines, inserting fine notifications, and sending for credit collection) over a period from 2000 to 2013.
