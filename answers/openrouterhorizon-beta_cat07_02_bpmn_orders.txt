The image is a BPMN process diagram showing an endtoend order fulfillment workflow across four swimlanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse.

Key flow:
- Sales lane starts on Monday morning. The order is checked for completeness, then a subprocess checks whether the customer exists in the database; if not, the customer is added. After validation, Sales sends order details and later drafts the invoice once the product is sent.
- Production lane receives order details, plans production, and proceeds if materials are not faulty. It manufactures the product and signals when the product is complete.
- Procurement lane receives order details and runs a “Material Compensation Subprocess.” It orders materials, may return materials via an intermediate event, and then checks materials. If materials are faulty, an order cancellation event is possible; otherwise, the process continues.
- Warehouse lane waits for the “product complete” signal, sends the product, and emits a “product sent” event back to Sales for invoicing.

The diagram uses gateways for decisions, events for messages/signals, and dashed message flows connecting lanes to coordinate steps.
