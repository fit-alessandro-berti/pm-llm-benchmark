Understood! Let's walk through the event log in light of the **normative rules** (strict requirements) and the **desiderata** (recommended best practices) to deliver a clear, structured analysis.

---

### **1. Cases Violating Normative Rules (Strict Process Constraints)**

####  **Case 1: No Violations**
- **Sequence:**  
  `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case`  
- Every required activity occurs, in the correct order.
- Documentation is finalized only after an approved decision, and before closing—compliant.
- **Conclusion:** Fully compliant with all normative rules.

####  **Case 2: Violates Normative Rules (Serious Issues)**
- **Deviation 1:**  
  - **Risk Assessment** occurs at `2024-01-11 08:20`  
  - **Credit Check** only occurs at `2024-01-11 09:00`  
  -  *Violation*: **Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment**, but here it’s reversed.

- **Deviation 2:**  
  - **Loan Decision** is **Rejected** at `2024-01-11 09:30`  
  - Yet, **Finalize Documentation** occurs at `2024-01-11 10:00`  
  -  *Violation*: **Documentation must NOT be finalized after a rejection**—this directly contradicts process rules.

- **Conclusion:** Case 2 violates **two strict normative constraints**:
  - Incorrect order of activities (Risk Assessment before Credit Check)
  - Performing a forbidden action (Finalize Documentation after Rejection)

####  **Case 3: No Violations (Normative Level)**
- Sequence is correct:  
  `Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation (after approval)  Close Case`
- No out-of-order steps.
- Finalize Documentation occurs only after an **Approved** decision—valid.
- Case is properly closed.
- **Conclusion:** Fully compliant with normative rules.

>  *Note:* While this case has delays and skips a follow-up, **those are desiderata**, not normative violations.

### **2. Cases Failing Desiderata (Recommended Practices)**

These are **not process violations**, but **suboptimal behaviors**:

####  Case 2:
- **Credit Check** occurs just **20 minutes after Application Received**  ** Meets timing recommendation** (within 24 hours).
- **Inform Applicant** missing: There is no "Inform Applicant" activity at all.
  -  *Violation of desideratum*: Failing to inform the applicant is a **missed best practice**, even if not a strict rule.
- **Follow-up Call** is missing  Not required, but **encouraged**. Its absence is a desideratum failure.

>  While missing **Inform Applicant** may seem like a bigger issue, it wasn't listed as normative—only recommended. But note: **in practice**, not informing the applicant would likely be considered critical. Based on *your rules*, however, it's treated as a desideratum, not a hard constraint.

####  Case 3:
- **Credit Check** occurs on `2024-01-14 10:00`, over **48 hours** after Application Received (`2024-01-12 09:00`)   Misses 24-hour ideal.
  - *Desideratum not met*.

- **Inform Applicant** occurs at `2024-01-16 15:00`, which is **~51 hours** after the Loan Decision was made (`2024-01-14 12:00`).
  - Exceeds the 48-hour recommendation   *Missed prompt notification desideratum*.

- **No Follow-up Call**  Not required, but *encouraged*   *Missed opportunity*.

> While all desiderata are violated in Case 3, the **normative sequence is intact**—so the case is technically valid, just sluggish and less customer-centric.

### **3. Interpretations & Possible Justifications**

We can try to make sense of the deviations in context:

####  **Case 2: Risk Before Check — Possible Justification?**
- Maybe an **urgent risk flag** was raised manually (e.g., known fraud pattern), prompting an early risk evaluation.
- But **post-facto**, a Credit Check was still run (though too late in the sequence).
- However, **this doesn’t excuse the violation**: The normative model requires checks before risk.
- **Additional red flag:** Finalizing documentation after rejection suggests either:
  - A clerical error (e.g., confusing this case with another),
  - Or possibly an attempt to reprocess, but without updating the decision.
- **Missing "Inform Applicant"** for a rejected case risks **legal or compliance issues** in real-world settings, even if not codified here.

>  *Recommendation:* Investigate whether Case 2 was handled by a new employee or a misconfigured automation rule.

####  **Case 3: Delays — Possible Justification?**
- The long delay between **Application Received** and **Credit Check** may reflect:
  - Backend credit bureau delays,
  - Weekend/holiday lag (if 1/12–1/14 includes non-business days),
  - Or under-resourced staff.
- The late notification to applicant (after 2 days) might be due to:
  - Manual review bottleneck,
  - Or dependency on supervisor approval.
- No Follow-up Call: May reflect **low priority on customer experience**, or lack of training.

>  **Assessment**: Process is *correct*, but *inefficient*. Not a breakdown, but a performance concern.

###  **Summary Table**

| Case | Normative Violation? | Desiderata Violation? | Key Issues |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **1** |  No |  No | Fully compliant and timely. Model case. |
| **2** |  Yes |  Yes | - Risk before Credit Check<br>- Doc finalized after rejection<br>- Failed to inform applicant |
| **3** |  No |  Yes | - Delayed credit check (>24h)<br>- Late applicant notification (>48h post-decision)<br>- No follow-up call |

###  Final Thoughts

- **Case 1** is your gold standard: correct, timely, complete.
- **Case 2** is **non-compliant** and must be corrected—especially the *inverted process order* and *post-rejection documentation*.
- **Case 3** is *technically valid*, but **process efficiency and service quality** are lacking. Consider monitoring SLAs or adding automation triggers to uphold desiderata.
