Okay, let's analyze the provided event log snippet and group the low-level events into higher-level process steps.

**Analysis of Event Sequence (Case A1 as example):**

1.  **Events 1-3:** `Retrieve raw metal sheet`, `Scan barcode`, `Place metal sheet on table`. These actions are performed by Operator A and involve getting the raw material identified and positioned.
2.  **Events 4-5:** `Align metal sheet`, `Preheat metal sheet`. These actions are performed by machines (Robot, Heating Unit) immediately after the material is placed, preparing it for the next operation.
3.  **Events 6-8:** `Pick up welding tool`, `Weld corner A`, `Weld corner B`. These actions are performed by Operator B and constitute the core welding process.
4.  **Event 9:** `Measure weld integrity`. This is a specific check performed by a sensor immediately after welding.
5.  **Events 10-11:** `Apply protective coating`, `Dry coating`. These actions are performed by dedicated units (Coating, Heating) to apply and cure a finish.
6.  **Event 12:** `Visual check`. This is a final inspection step performed by Operator C after the coating process.

The sequence for Case B2 follows the same pattern.

**Proposed High-Level Process Steps:**

Based on the analysis, we can define the following high-level steps:

1.  **High-Level Step Name:** **Material Staging & Preparation**
    *   **Low-Level Events Included:**
        *   `Retrieve raw metal sheet`
        *   `Scan barcode`
        *   `Place metal sheet on table`
        *   `Align metal sheet`
        *   `Preheat metal sheet`
    *   **Rationale:** This group combines the initial manual handling of the raw material (retrieval, identification, placement) with the immediate automated steps required to prepare it (alignment, preheating) for the main fabrication process. These events occur sequentially at the beginning of the process for a given CaseID and logically constitute the setup phase.

2.  **High-Level Step Name:** **Welding Operation**
    *   **Low-Level Events Included:**
        *   `Pick up welding tool`
        *   `Weld corner A`
        *   `Weld corner B`
    *   **Rationale:** This group represents the core value-adding fabrication step in this segment. It includes the operator acquiring the necessary tool and performing the welding actions. These events are temporally clustered and functionally related to joining or modifying the material.

3.  **High-Level Step Name:** **Post-Weld Quality Check**
    *   **Low-Level Events Included:**
        *   `Measure weld integrity`
    *   **Rationale:** This step is a distinct quality control activity performed immediately after the welding operation using specific sensing equipment. It verifies the quality of the preceding step before further processing occurs. Separating it highlights the QC aspect.

4.  **High-Level Step Name:** **Coating & Curing**
    *   **Low-Level Events Included:**
        *   `Apply protective coating`
        *   `Dry coating`
    *   **Rationale:** These two events are functionally linked – applying a coating and then treating it (drying/curing). They are performed by dedicated units and represent the finishing phase of the product in this log segment.

5.  **High-Level Step Name:** **Final Inspection**
    *   **Low-Level Events Included:**
        *   `Visual check`
    *   **Rationale:** This represents the final quality assurance step in the observed sequence, performed manually after all other processing steps (including coating) are complete for this segment. It signifies the completion of this part of the workflow.

**Summary Output:**
