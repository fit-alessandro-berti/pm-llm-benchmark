<think>We are asked: "Using the above textual description, produce two POWL models." The provided text describes a hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. It has multiple steps: resume parsing/data completeness check, skill assessment, cultural fit/community affiliation branch (which may be bias), managerial review, final decision etc. We have to produce two POWL models that reflect the same process but differ in how they handle the "cultural fit and affiliation check." In one model the branching is such that there's a XOR branch: one branch for standard cultural fit evaluation and another branch for community-affiliation check that gives subtle advantage if applicant is associated with a known local group. The second POWL model has similar process but no special community-based branch, all applicants undergo same cultural fit evaluation.

We can produce two models in a textual description using the structure of POWL as given. The instructions provide an example snippet in code to illustrate the style.

Now we need to produce "POWL Model with Potential Unfairness" and "POWL Model Without Unfairness". We must use activity labels like: "ReceiveApplication", "DataCompletenessCheck", "RequestMoreInfo" for loop, etc. But also add edges and operators as needed. The text instructions mention the following steps:

1. Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check -> maybe label it as "DataCompletenessCheck" if incomplete then go to "RequestMoreInfo". Also resume parsing is done before skill assessment? So maybe the process goes like:
   - Activity: ReceiveApplication
   - Possibly loop: DataCompletenessCheck (and in case missing information, call "RequestMoreInfo", and then repeat check until complete)
   But note we see that description: "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check" is not exactly a loop, but it's described as "if the resume is complete, process continues; if incomplete, it triggers a loop process asking for additional details." So we need to represent that with an operator PO and/or a loop.

   The textual description says: "loop (to ensure data completeness)". So maybe we can add a loop node between "DataCompletenessCheck" and "RequestMoreInfo". But what is the order? Possibly it's like: after receiving application, you check if resume is complete. If not, then request more info and recheck until complete.

   There are three steps: 
    - Step 1: Resume Parsing & Data Completeness Check (with a loop for missing information)
    - Step 2: Preliminary Skill Assessment
    - Step 3: Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (Potential Bias Point) where there is an XOR branch: one branch goes to standard "CulturalFitCheck" and another branch "CommunityAffiliationCheck"
    - Step 4: Managerial Review & Final Decision, i.e., activities like "ManagerialReview", then "FinalDecision".

   In the POWL model with potential unfairness, we want a XOR operator that gives one branch as "Standard Cultural Fit Evaluation", while the other branch is the "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that may give subtle advantage if applicant has local membership. The text says: "At this stage, the company attempts to gauge whether applicants align with the company’s stated values. However, the process is not purely merit-based." And then it says: "Applicants who indicate membership in the 'Global Business Leaders Club' or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift" if they take the community-affiliation branch. So yes.

   But wait, reading description carefully:

   "Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (Potential Bias Point): At this stage, the company attempts to gauge whether applicants align with the company’s stated values. However, the process is not purely merit-based. Applicants who indicate membership in the “Global Business Leaders Club” or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation. This step is often an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

   So this means that after "SkillAssessment", we branch into two paths with an XOR operator: one path is "CulturalFitCheck" (the fair one) and the other is "CommunityAffiliationCheck". But then note that in either case, both branches need to be executed? Wait how does it exactly branch? The description says "often an XOR choice." Typically an XOR means that only one of them will be chosen. So if the applicant has a local affiliation or similar attribute, they might go down one branch.

   However, the process is: after skill assessment, we have two branches:
      - Option 1 (XOR branch) : Standard Cultural Fit Assessment ("CulturalFitCheck").
      - Option 2 (XOR branch): Community Affiliation Check ("CommunityAffiliationCheck").

   The difference being that in option 2, there is a potential bias.

   But note: what if the applicant belongs to both groups? Not sure. So it's simply an XOR selection.

   Next, after the cultural evaluation stage, we have "Managerial Review & Final Decision". In our POWL model we can denote these as separate activities following that branch (or maybe they are common for all paths). Likely the two branches converge later to "ManagerialReview" and then "FinalDecision".

   But careful: the description says "In the presence of implicit affiliations or local-community-based cues, reviewers may — consciously or unconsciously — view these candidates more favorably. The final decision is then made." That means that after the branching, you have a common activity "ManagerialReview" and then "FinalDecision". So our POWL model should reflect that.

   But also note: "loop for data completeness" means we need to include a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Possibly we can represent this as an operatorPOWL using the LOOP operator with two nodes A (DataCompletenessCheck) and B (RequestMoreInfo). But then there is sequence ordering from that loop to SkillAssessment etc.

   Also, the text "Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check" might be represented by a silent activity or transition? We can represent it as an activity labeled "ReceiveApplication", then check data completeness. Actually, we want to produce two POWL models: one with potential unfairness and another without.

   For the model with potential unfairness, I need to include the following nodes:
    - A = ReceiveApplication (maybe as a transition)
    - B = DataCompletenessCheck
    - C = RequestMoreInfo
    Loop node between B and C: using OperatorPOWL operator=LOOP, children [B, C]. But careful: which order? According to given example, the loop is defined as "loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])", where A is executed then either exit or execute B then back to A. But in our process, we want something like check completeness (B) and if incomplete, request more info (C), and then loop. So maybe the loop should be between "DataCompletenessCheck" and "RequestMoreInfo"? But then how do we break out? The description says: "if resume is complete and structured correctly, process continues". In our POWL model, this means that if DataCompletenessCheck passes, then continue; if not, then RequestMoreInfo and re-check. So the loop is defined as an operator between these two activities.

   But note: We want to represent it as a "loop" node in which the check activity A (B) is executed repeatedly until it returns success? Alternatively, we can use the loop structure described in example but reversed order: first perform DataCompletenessCheck, if not complete then request more info and then re-run check again. But how do we represent that as a POWL model? We might define something like:

   loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

   And this means: Start with DataCompletenessCheck; if it fails (i.e., missing information), then execute RequestMoreInfo and then re-run DataCompletenessCheck. But wait in a typical POWL model representation, the loop operator is defined as "execute A, then either exit or execute B and then go back to A". So that fits: Activity A = DataCompletenessCheck, B = RequestMoreInfo.

   However, caution: The given example snippet uses "loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])" meaning that you execute A, if not done then execute B and go back to A. But in our process, if DataCompletenessCheck passes (i.e., resume is complete), then no loop iteration should occur. But the POWL model may assume that the loop will eventually be terminated once "DataCompletenessCheck" returns success? The given example does not detail exit conditions. But we assume it's fine.

   So for both models, we need the following nodes:
    - Activity: ReceiveApplication (T1)
    - Loop for data completeness check with two activities: DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo.
    - Then activity: SkillAssessment
    - Next, in Model 1, XOR branch between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. In Model 2, a single CulturalFitCheck.
    - After that, then "ManagerialReview" and then "FinalDecision".

   But we want to incorporate the loop structure for data completeness check before the SkillAssessment.

   For model with potential unfairness:
   The steps are: 
      Start: ReceiveApplication
         Then proceed to DataCompletenessCheck/RequestMoreInfo loop.
         After that, go to SkillAssessment.
         After that, branch XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. 
            - Option 1: Standard cultural fit evaluation ("CulturalFitCheck").
            - Option 2: Affiliation-based evaluation ("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
         Then after the XOR branch, we have a partial order concurrency? Possibly both branches converge into ManagerialReview? But the text says "In the presence of implicit affiliations or local-community-based cues, reviewers may—consciously or unconsciously—view these candidates more favorably." So I think the model should be: Regardless of which cultural fit branch is chosen, then next step is ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. 
         But careful: The given description says that "managerial review" happens after borderline candidates are identified. It may mean that if candidate passes the skill assessment but then goes through either branch, then they are forwarded to managerial review.

   How do we incorporate that? We have an XOR operator with two children nodes representing the alternative evaluation paths. But then both branches eventually converge into a single "ManagerialReview" step and then "FinalDecision". So perhaps after the XOR node (which is like "CulturalEvaluation") then add ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

   Let me produce a POWL model for Model 1 with potential unfairness:

   We need to use constructs:
      - For loop: OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP. 
      - For exclusive choice: OperatorPOWL with operator XOR.
      - For sequence: StrictPartialOrder.

   In the provided snippet, they show an example of using StrictPartialOrder and OperatorPOWL nodes and then adding orders with .order.add_edge(source, target).

   So our model for Model 1 might be:
    Let A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
    Let B = DataCompletenessCheck
    Let C = RequestMoreInfo
    Then loop: LoopNode1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C]) - though careful ordering: In the provided example they do "loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])" meaning A is executed then if not exit then B and then back to A. But in our case, I want DataCompletenessCheck as initial activity of loop, and RequestMoreInfo as second activity (the "if condition fails"). But the given code snippet example: "loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B])" where presumably A is the main check and then if condition requires additional info, then run B and then back to A. That fits our scenario if we consider DataCompletenessCheck as A and RequestMoreInfo as B.

   So I'll define:
     data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
   
   Then after that loop is done (i.e., resume is complete), then move on to "SkillAssessment". So we need a StrictPartialOrder chain: After ReceiveApplication and the loop node, then proceed to SkillAssessment.

   Then the next part: XOR branch:
       Option 1: "CulturalFitCheck" activity
       Option 2: "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity. But in our description of potential unfairness, it's exactly that. So I'll define an XOR operator node with children [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]. Let's denote it as cultural_check_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]).

   Then, after the XOR branch, we have ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. But how do we connect them? Possibly they are sequential activities in a StrictPartialOrder chain: "ManagerialReview" then "FinalDecision". We might also add that the XOR node must complete before moving on to ManagerialReview. So I'll have an ordering edge from cultural_check_xor to ManagerialReview, then ordering edge from ManagerialReview to FinalDecision.

   Also, do we include any loop for data completeness? Yes, we did.

   So overall Model 1 structure:

       Start -> ReceiveApplication (transition)
       Then execute the loop for DataCompletenessCheck with RequestMoreInfo.
       Then after that, go to SkillAssessment (transition).
       Then XOR branch between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. 
       Then after that, ManagerialReview (transition) then FinalDecision (transition).

   But how do we incorporate them in a POWL model representation using StrictPartialOrder nodes? I can create one top-level StrictPartialOrder which includes nodes: ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_check_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision. And then add ordering edges to reflect sequential order.

   The partial order is:
       - ReceiveApplication must complete before the loop.
       - Loop must complete before SkillAssessment.
       - SkillAssessment must complete before the XOR branch.
       - XOR branch must complete before ManagerialReview.
       - ManagerialReview must complete before FinalDecision.
   And maybe all independent nodes can be concurrent? But here they are sequential. We want a linear order. So we add edges accordingly.

   However, note that in POWL models, nodes that are not connected by an ordering edge might be executed concurrently. To enforce sequential ordering, we need to connect them with StrictPartialOrder edges.
  
   Also note: The provided snippet for example had "root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, xor])" and then root.order.add_edge(loop, xor). So I can follow that pattern.

   But now I must produce two models. For Model 1, use XOR branch for cultural fit evaluation with two children. For Model 2, remove the bias: so after SkillAssessment, all applicants directly go to "CulturalFitCheck" (the fair process) and then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

   So for Model 2, structure:
       Start -> ReceiveApplication.
       Then loop for data completeness check.
       Then SkillAssessment.
       Then a single activity: CulturalFitCheck.
       Then ManagerialReview.
       Then FinalDecision.

   That is simpler than Model 1. But we may want to include all steps similar as before. So I'll produce a POWL model with StrictPartialOrder nodes containing these activities in order, i.e., no XOR branch.

   Let me produce two models accordingly. But note: The instructions say "You can use an approach similar to the example given in the instructions" and then show some code snippet sample. So we want our answer textually (not necessarily actual runnable code, but a conceptual representation) with proper use of Transition, SilentTransition, StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL.

   We need to list nodes like:
     A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
     B = DataCompletenessCheck
     C = RequestMoreInfo
     Then loop: data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
     D = SkillAssessment (transition)
     For Model 1: cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
           where CulturalFitCheck is Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
                and CommunityAffiliationCheck is Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
     Then ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
     FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

   For Model 2: 
     Instead of cultural_xor, directly use one activity: E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck") (the fair evaluation)
     And then after that, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

   Also, the code snippet sample uses StrictPartialOrder. So we need to create a top-level StrictPartialOrder with nodes [A, data_loop, D, cultural_xor/ CulturalFitCheck node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision] (or similar). Then add edges among them using order.add_edge(...)

   Let's produce Model 1:

   I'll produce code similar to:
   
       from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
       from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

       # Nodes for Model 1
       A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
       B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
       C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
       data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
       
       D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
       
       E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # standard evaluation path
       F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")  # potential bias branch
       cultural_eval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])
       
       G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
       H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

       # Top-level StrictPartialOrder for Model 1:
       model1_nodes = [A, data_loop, D, cultural_eval, G, H]
       model1_order = [(A, data_loop), (data_loop, D), (D, cultural_eval), (cultural_eval, G), (G, H)]
       root_model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=model1_nodes)
       for edge in model1_order:
           source, target = edge
           root_model1.order.add_edge(source, target)

   That is Model 1.

   For Model 2:

   We want similar nodes except instead of cultural_xor, we have a single node E which is fair "CulturalFitCheck". But note that I already used label "CulturalFitCheck" as E in Model 1. So for clarity in Model 2 I'll name it differently to avoid confusion. Let's do:
       A' = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication") (can use same as before, but maybe re-use variable A)
       B' = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
       C' = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
       data_loop2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B', C'])
       
       D' = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
       E' = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # fair evaluation path only
       G' = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
       H' = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

   Then top-level StrictPartialOrder for Model 2:
       model2_nodes = [A, data_loop2, D', E', G', H']
       ordering edges: (A->data_loop2), (data_loop2->D'), (D'->E'), (E'->G'), (G'->H').
   But careful: maybe I should not mix variable names? But it's acceptable if they are different nodes.

   Alternatively, I can reuse the same labels with the same name in the model but since these are two separate POWL models, we don't need to worry about them conflicting. It might be simpler to define new variables for each activity for clarity.

   But maybe simpler: For Model 2, simply not include the XOR branch (i.e., no "CommunityAffiliationCheck").

   So I'll produce code as:

       from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
       from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

       # Nodes for Model 2: Fair process without bias:
       A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
       B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
       C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
       data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
       
       D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
       E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # only fair evaluation
       G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
       H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

       model2_nodes = [A, data_loop, D, E, G, H]
       ordering_edges_model2 = [(A, data_loop), (data_loop, D), (D, E), (E, G), (G, H)]
       
       root_model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=model2_nodes)
       for source, target in ordering_edges_model2:
           root_model2.order.add_edge(source, target)

   That is Model 2.

   But note: In the sample code snippet provided, they use "XOR" operator with two children and then add a silent transition. But our models are straightforward sequences with one branch XOR in Model 1.

   I must produce these two POWL models as text. The question says "using an approach similar to the example given in instructions", so we can output code block representing each model.

   However, note that the original snippet used "skip = SilentTransition()" then "xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[C, skip])" etc. But I must not include any silent transitions if they are not needed. The instruction says: "Add edges and operators as needed."

   In our models, the only operator nodes we need are those for loop and XOR.

   We want to produce a model representation in text. So I'll produce two code blocks that represent Model 1 and Model 2 accordingly.

   For clarity, I'll create separate variables with clear names. I might name them as follows:

   For Model 1:
       - activity "ReceiveApplication": A
       - activity "DataCompletenessCheck": B
       - activity "RequestMoreInfo": C
       - Loop node: data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
       - Activity "SkillAssessment": D
       - XOR branch for cultural fit: two branches: E = CulturalFitCheck and F = CommunityAffiliationCheck; then combine them in an XOR operator: cultural_eval = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F]).
       - Activity "ManagerialReview": G
       - Activity "FinalDecision": H

   And add ordering edges accordingly:
       A -> data_loop
       data_loop -> D
       D -> cultural_eval
       cultural_eval -> G
       G -> H

   For Model 2: 
       Use the same loop node for data completeness, but then after SkillAssessment go directly to a single fair CulturalFitCheck activity (E), then ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.

   I'll produce code with comments that indicate which model is which. I'll produce two separate blocks of code, one for each POWL model.

   Also note: the provided snippet in instructions uses "from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition" and "from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator".

   So I'll follow that pattern.

   Let me produce a final answer with two code blocks labelled Model 1 and Model 2. I must include appropriate edges using the method .order.add_edge(source_node, target_node).

   I can produce code like:

       # POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (Model 1)
       from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
       from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

       A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
       B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
       C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
       data_loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

       D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

       E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")         # Fair cultural fit evaluation
       F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")   # Biased branch due to local affiliation
       cultural_eval_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

       G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
       H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

       nodes_model1 = [A, data_loop1, D, cultural_eval_xor, G, H]
       model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_model1)
       # Ordering edges:
       model1.order.add_edge(A, data_loop1)
       model1.order.add_edge(data_loop1, D)
       model1.order.add_edge(D, cultural_eval_xor)
       model1.order.add_edge(cultural_eval_xor, G)
       model1.order.add_edge(G, H)

   That is Model 1.

   For Model 2:

       # POWL Model Without Unfairness (Model 2)
       from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
       from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

       A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
       B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
       C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
       data_loop2 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

       D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
       E_fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Only fair evaluation; no community branch

       G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
       H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

       nodes_model2 = [A, data_loop2, D, E_fair, G, H]
       model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_model2)
       # Ordering edges:
       model2.order.add_edge(A, data_loop2)
       model2.order.add_edge(data_loop2, D)
       model2.order.add_edge(D, E_fair)
       model2.order.add_edge(E_fair, G)
       model2.order.add_edge(G, H)

   That is Model 2.

   I must now produce final answer text with these two code blocks. We need to check that we have used appropriate labels and ordering edges as described in the instructions.

   One detail: The provided snippet in the example uses "skip = SilentTransition()" for a silent transition, but it's not needed here. So it's fine.

   I'll produce answer text with explanation first, then code blocks for Model 1 and Model 2.

   Also note: We need to mention that Model 1 demonstrates potential bias by having the XOR branch that includes "CommunityAffiliationCheck" which gives subtle advantage if applicant belongs to local groups. And Model 2 removes that bias by not including that branch.

   I'll produce answer text accordingly.

   In summary, my final answer will be a textual representation of two POWL models using Python code blocks, clearly labeled as Model 1 and Model 2 with appropriate nodes and ordering edges.

   Let me produce final answer.</think>Below are two example POWLmodels that capture the same overall hiring process but differ in how the “cultural fit” stage is handled. In the first model (Model 1) an XOR branch exists after the skill assessment so that some candidates may be evaluated via a “CommunityAffiliationCheck” (which—by design—can give them a slight uplift), while Model 2 uses a single, uniform cultural evaluation (“CulturalFitCheck”) for all applicants. In both cases a loop is used to enforce data completeness and sequential ordering is imposed via strict partial orders.


Model 1 – POWL with Potential Unfairness 


In this model the process flows as follows:
1. Applicants submit their resumes (“ReceiveApplication”).
2. A loop is executed between “DataCompletenessCheck” and “RequestMoreInfo” to ensure that all required information is present.
3. Next, applicants take a “SkillAssessment.”
4. After the skill test there is an XOR branch for cultural evaluation:
• One branch uses a standard “CulturalFitCheck.”
• The other branch (the “CommunityAffiliationCheck”) applies if the applicant indicates local/community affiliation – this branch can introduce a subtle bias.
5. Finally, all candidates go through “ManagerialReview” and then to “FinalDecision.”

Below is one way to represent Model 1 using POWL constructs:

------------------------------------------------
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities for the hiring process:
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

# Loop between data check and requesting more info (if needed):
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Two alternative cultural fit evaluations:
E = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")            # Fair evaluation
F = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")    # Potential bias branch

# XOR operator: only one of the two cultural checks will be performed.
cultural_eval_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create a top-level strict partial order that enforces the sequential flow:
nodes_model1 = [A, data_loop, D, cultural_eval_xor, G, H]
model1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_model1)
# Add ordering edges to enforce execution order:
model1.order.add_edge(A, data_loop)

Model 2 – POWL without Unfairness 


In this “fair” version the process is almost identical except that after the skill assessment there is no XOR branch. All applicants go through a single uniform cultural evaluation (“CulturalFitCheck”) before proceeding to managerial review and final decision.

The model flows as follows:
1. “ReceiveApplication”
2. A loop between “DataCompletenessCheck” and “RequestMoreInfo”
3. “SkillAssessment”
4. “CulturalFitCheck” (uniform, no bias)
5. “ManagerialReview”
6. “FinalDecision”

Below is one representation for Model 2:

------------------------------------------------
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities:
A = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

# Loop to ensure complete application data:
data_loop_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

D = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Single fair cultural evaluation:
E_fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

G = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
H = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create a strict partial order for the sequential flow:
nodes_model2 = [A, data_loop_fair, D, E_fair, G, H]
model2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes_model2)
# Add ordering edges:
model2.order.add_edge(A, data_loop_fair)
model2.order.add_edge(data_loop_fair, D)
model2.order.add_edge(D, E_fair)
model2.order.add_edge(E_fair, G)
model2.order.add_edge(G, H)

------------------------------------------------


Explanation

• In Model 1 the XOR node (cultural_eval_xor) chooses between a “CulturalFitCheck” and a “CommunityAffiliationCheck.” This choice introduces an opportunity for subtle bias in favor of applicants with local or community affiliations.
• In Model 2 that branch is removed so that every applicant goes through only one standard evaluation (“CulturalFitCheck”), thereby eliminating the potential source of unfairness.

These models follow the POWL syntax and structure (using Transition, OperatorPOWL for loops/XOR choices, and StrictPartialOrder with ordering edges) as described in the example instructions.
