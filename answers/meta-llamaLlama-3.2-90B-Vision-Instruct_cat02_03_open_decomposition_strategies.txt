Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects can bring numerous benefits and also poses some challenges. Here are the main advantages and disadvantages:

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved performance**: Decomposition can significantly reduce the complexity of the process model, making it more manageable and improving the overall performance of the process mining analysis.
2. **Enhanced understanding**: Breaking down a large process into smaller sub-processes can provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the process, enabling better insights and more effective decision-making.
3. **Scalability**: Decomposition strategies can handle large volumes of data and complex process models, making them ideal for large-scale process mining projects.
4. **Reduced noise and complexity**: By focusing on specific sub-processes, decomposition can help reduce the impact of noise and irrelevant data, leading to more accurate process models and better insights.
5. **Better resource allocation**: Decomposition can help identify areas of the process that require more attention or resources, enabling more targeted and effective resource allocation.

**Challenges:**

1. **Defining meaningful sub-processes**: Identifying the right sub-processes can be challenging, as it requires a deep understanding of the process and its various components.
2. **Preserving process semantics**: Decomposition can lead to a loss of process semantics if not done correctly, making it essential to ensure that the sub-processes are properly defined and connected.
3. **Handling dependencies and interactions**: Sub-processes can have complex dependencies and interactions, which can be difficult to manage and analyze.
4. **Maintaining data consistency**: Decomposition can lead to inconsistencies in data across different sub-processes, requiring careful data management and integration.
5. **Ensuring comparability and generalizability**: Decomposition can make it challenging to compare and generalize results across different sub-processes, requiring careful consideration of the analysis scope and methodology.
6. **Increasing analysis complexity**: Decomposition can lead to an increase in analysis complexity, as each sub-process requires its own analysis and interpretation.
7. **Requiring advanced analytical skills**: Decomposition strategies often require advanced analytical skills, including process modeling, data analysis, and interpretation.

To overcome these challenges, process mining practitioners can use various decomposition techniques, such as:

1. **Hierarchical decomposition**: Breaking down the process into smaller sub-processes using a hierarchical structure.
2. **Functional decomposition**: Decomposing the process into functional sub-processes based on specific business functions or activities.
3. **Event-based decomposition**: Breaking down the process into sub-processes based
