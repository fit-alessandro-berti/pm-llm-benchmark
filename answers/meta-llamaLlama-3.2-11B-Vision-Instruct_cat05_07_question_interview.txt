Here are the targeted, open-ended questions I would ask the interviewee:

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

1. Can you elaborate on the specific responsibilities of the property coordinator versus the dedicated property manager? How do their roles overlap, and what are their key performance indicators?
2. How do you ensure that the property manager assigned to a property is the best fit for the landlord and the property type? Are there any specific training programs or checklists that property managers follow?
3. Are there any instances where the property manager's tasks are delegated to other team members (e.g., leasing agents, compliance officers)? How does this role delegation work, and what are the criteria for selecting the right person for a specific task?

**Decision-Making and Criteria:**

1. You mentioned that the property manager's experience and track record factor into their assignment. Can you provide more context on what specific factors are considered, and how they are weighted in the decision-making process?
2. When property managers are discussing lease terms with tenants, what are some of the most common variables that influence the final agreement? For example, do they prioritize rent, lease duration, or amenities?
3. How are exceptions, such as properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses, handled? Are there specific protocols or guidelines in place for navigating these situations?

**Timing and Sequencing:**

1. You described the process as quite involved. Can you provide a rough estimate of the time frame from the initial contact with the landlord to the property being ready for tenant screening? Are there any critical milestones or deadlines that must be met during this period?
2. Are there any dependencies or uncertainties in the process that can impact timing? For example, are there periods when local housing regulations or inspections might be delayed?
3. How are internal audits and quality checks integrated into the process? Are they done concurrently with the onboarding process, or are they done after the property is activated in the rental portal?

**Exceptions and Variations:**

1. Can you describe a scenario where a property onboarding process might not follow the standard workflow? For example, might the landlord request an expedited timeline or have special insurance requirements?
2. How are exceptions documented and tracked within the company? Are there any specific procedures for recording and addressing variations to the standard process?
3. Are there any variations in the process based on the type of property (e.g., furnished rentals, luxury units, student housing)? If so, can you provide more context on how the property manager's approach differs in these cases?

**Communication and Technology:**

1. You mentioned that communication with the landlord, property manager, and support teams is tracked using a combination of email threads, internal CRMs, and project management tools. Can you elaborate on the specific tools used and how they facilitate communication and workflow?
2. How do you ensure that all stakeholders stay informed and aligned throughout the onboarding process? Are there any regular check-ins or status updates that occur?
3. How does the company use data and analytics to inform and optimize the onboarding process? For example, do they track key performance indicators, such as time-to-market or rent-price-to-value ratios?
