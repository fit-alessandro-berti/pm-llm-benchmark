Given the observed behavior from the event log, we can create a process tree that captures the essence of the business process, including its sequential nature, optional loops for handling requests for missing information, and validations that may occur due to these requests.

Here is a structured representation of the final process tree in terms of operators and activities:

```plaintext
+ ( 'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',
         + ( '* ( X("Request Missing Info (RMI)", "Validate Form (VF)"), 
             -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)', 
                  -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)', 
                       -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
                            'Archive Case (AC)' ) ) ) ) ) )
```

Explanation of the process tree:
- The root operation is `+`, indicating true concurrency between two main branches.
  - One branch represents 'Receive Application (RA)'
  - The other branch starts with a sequence (`->`), where 'Validate Form (VF)' must be executed before further steps.
  - Following the validation, there's an option for either entering into a loop (`*`) involving handling missing information requests and re-validation of forms until no more missing info needs to be requested. This loop can occur zero or multiple times if required.
    - The activities inside the loop are 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' followed by another 'Validate Form (VF)', which signifies the iterative process of requesting for missing information and validating again after receiving it, if needed.
  - After optionally exiting from this loop, there's a sequence defined:
    - 'Assess Eligibility (AE)'
    - Followed by 'Approval Decision (AD)'
    - Then comes another sequence where 'Send Confirmation (SC)' is executed before finally archiving the case with 'Archive Case (AC)'.
  
This tree captures both the main flow of activities and the optional loop to handle situations that require additional information gathering and re-validation, making it a more nuanced model based on observed process behavior.
