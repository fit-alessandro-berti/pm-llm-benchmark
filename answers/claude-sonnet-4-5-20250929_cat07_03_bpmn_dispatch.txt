# Visualization Description

This is a **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram** depicting a shipping/logistics workflow across multiple organizational lanes. The diagram illustrates the end-to-end process of preparing and shipping goods.

## Organizational Structure (Swim Lanes)

The process is divided into four horizontal swim lanes representing different departments:

1. **Logistics** (top)
2. **Secretary/Computer Hardware Shop** (upper middle)
3. **Warehouse** (lower middle)
4. **[Unlabeled bottom lane]** (bottom)

## Key Process Flow

### Starting Point
- Process begins with a **"Ship goods"** trigger event

### Main Process Steps

**Secretary/Computer Hardware Shop Lane:**
1. **Clarify shipment method** - Initial assessment
2. **Decision point**: "Special handling?" 
   - If NO  proceeds directly
   - If YES  leads to getting logistics quotes
3. **Check if insurance is required** (connects to Customer information database)
4. **Decision**: "If insurance necessary"
   - Always leads to  **Write package label**
5. **Get 3 offers from logistic companies**
6. **Select logistic company and place order**

**Logistics Lane:**
- **Insure parcel** - Handled when insurance is required

**Warehouse Lane:**
7. **Package goods** - Includes a 48-hour timer notation with a clock icon
8. If delayed  **Notify customer about delay** (subprocess)
9. **Fill out Shipment paperwork**
10. **Move package to pickup area**
11. **End event**: "Shipment prepared"

## Notable Elements

- **Database symbol**: Customer information storage
- **Document icon**: Order details
- **Timer event**: 48-hour constraint on packaging
- **Multiple gateways**: Decision diamonds and parallel/merge gateways throughout
- **Subprocess**: Customer notification for delays

The diagram effectively shows both the sequential flow and parallel processes involved in logistics operations.
