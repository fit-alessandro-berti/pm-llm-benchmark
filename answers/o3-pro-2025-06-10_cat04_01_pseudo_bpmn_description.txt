Below is a “walk-through” of the model, step by step.  
For quick orientation, think of the process as three consecutive phases:

1. Qualification of the request (Is it standard or custom? Is it doable?).  
2. Preparation of the offer (delivery date or quotation) – possibly in parallel with risk/stock checks.  
3. Internal approval and customer confirmation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Start Event  
   • Trigger: the company receives a customer enquiry for a product or service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Task A – “Receive Customer Request”  
   • Purpose: record the request, capture key data (product, quantity, due date, special requirements) and open a case in the order-handling system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. XOR Gateway – “Check Request Type”  
   • Semantics: exclusive decision; only one outgoing path can be taken.  
   • Condition evaluated: Does the request match a predefined catalogue item without modifications (Standard) or does it require any tailoring (Custom)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4a. STANDARD branch  

   4a-1. Task B1 – “Perform Standard Validation”  
         – Verify that the request really matches the catalogue specification (price list, options, lead times).  
         – Make sure the customer is in good standing and that no special handling is hidden in the notes.

   4a-2. AND Gateway – “Run Parallel Checks”  
         – Semantics: parallel split. Both checks are launched simultaneously to shorten lead-time.

         • Task C1 – “Credit Check”  
           – Automatic or manual scoring of the customer’s ability to pay.

         • Task C2 – “Inventory Check”  
           – Query ERP/warehouse for stock on hand or earliest replenishment date.

   4a-3. AND Gateway (implicit join) – “All Parallel Checks Completed”  
         – Waits until both credit and inventory results are in before the flow continues.

   4a-4. Task D – “Calculate Delivery Date”  
         – Combine the inventory availability, transport lead time, and standard production calendar to promise a delivery date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4b. CUSTOM branch  

   4b-1. Task B2 – “Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis”  
         – Engineering / pre-sales analyse drawings, materials, tooling, capacity, compliance etc.

   4b-2. XOR Gateway – “Is Customization Feasible?”  
         – If YES  continue, if NO  reject.

         • [Yes] Task E1 – “Prepare Custom Quotation”  
           – Build bill-of-materials, estimate hours, determine special purchase items, price the job and outline the delivery schedule.

         • [No] Task E2 – “Send Rejection Notice”  
           – Politely decline the enquiry and terminate the process (End Event reached immediately after this task).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Convergence of the two main branches  
   – Whether we came from Task D (standard) or Task E1 (custom), the case is now “commercially ready” and enters the approval phase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Needed?”  
   • Business rule examples:  
     – Value above 20 k€  
     – Discount > 15 %  
     – Customer on watch list  
     – Rush order that stresses capacity  
   • If No  skip directly to invoicing.  
   • If Yes  Task F.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Task F – “Obtain Manager Approval”  
   • May involve one or more approvers in sequence or parallel (not shown).  
   • Output = either Approved or Rejected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. XOR Gateway – “Is Approval Granted?”  
   • [Yes]  Task G.  
   • [No]  Task H.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Task H – “Re-evaluate Conditions”  
   • Align with the manager’s comments:  
     – For a custom job, adjust specs, costs, margin  loop back to Task E1 “Prepare Custom Quotation”.  
     – For a standard job, maybe change promised date, split the order, ask the warehouse to expedite  loop back to Task D “Calculate Delivery Date”.  
   • The loop continues until approval is achieved or the customer withdraws (withdrawal not modelled here).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Task G – “Generate Final Invoice”  
    • Create official pro-forma or sales order confirmation in ERP, reflecting final price, taxes and delivery terms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Task I – “Send Confirmation to Customer”  
    • Dispatch the invoice / quotation acceptance, delivery promise and payment instructions by e-mail or EDI.  
    • Marks the commercial hand-off to order fulfilment / production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
12. End Event  
    • Process instance ends; KPI timers for “order lead time” stop; further execution (manufacturing, logistics) is handled by separate processes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick summary of key modelling elements

• XOR Gateway (diamond with X) = exclusive choice: only one path continues based on a condition.  
• AND Gateway (diamond with + or parallell bars) = parallel split/join: all outgoing paths start; the subsequent join waits for all of them to finish.  
• Loop-back arrow from Task H represents an iterative correction cycle driven by management feedback.  
• Early termination exists on the Custom path when feasibility = No (Task E2 leads directly to End).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Differences between Standard and Custom Requests

Standard:  
– Validation is mostly clerical and automated.  
– Risk mitigation is handled by two quick parallel checks (credit, stock).  
– Delivery date is a straightforward calculation.

Custom:  
– Requires engineering effort and cost modelling.  
– May be rejected outright on technical grounds.  
– Produces a detailed quotation instead of a simple delivery promise.  
– Potentially more iteration during approval because margins are tighter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
When are approvals or rework triggered?

1. The “Is Approval Needed?” gateway triggers approval only when rule thresholds are met.  
2. If the manager declines (Is Approval Granted? = No), Task H is invoked.  
   – For custom cases the process loops to Task E1 to reformulate the quotation.  
   – For standard cases it loops to Task D to renegotiate delivery or pricing.  
3. Each loop returns to the approval gateway again, ensuring no uncontrolled bypass.

The model therefore captures both efficiency (parallel checks, straight-through processing for low-risk orders) and risk control (approval loops, feasibility gates) in a single, coherent flow.
