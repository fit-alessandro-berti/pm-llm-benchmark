**Validating process sequences against rules**

I'm examining each case against the normative sequence and rules for order of receive, check, authorize, package, ship, cancel, and close steps. Cases 2, 3, and 5 break rules around authorization timing, packaging before authorization, shipping after cancellation, or missing packaging before shipping. Case 3 notably has multiple violations including both shipping after cancel and cancellation occurring after authorization, which contradicts the expected inventory-based flow. Cases 1 and 4 comply fully with the rules. I'll explain these violations referencing the normative constraints carefully.

### Summary of Conformance Checking

| Case ID | Conformance? | Explanation |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **1**   |  Compliant  | Follows the expected fulfillment path: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close. |
| **2**   |  Violation  | “Package items” occurs **before** “Authorize payment”. The normative description stipulates that payment must be authorized *before* any packaging is performed. |
| **3**   |  Violations | Two issues:<br>1. The case performs “Cancel order” **after** “Authorize payment”. In the normative model, a cancellation should follow the inventory check directly when stock is insufficient; once cancelled, further fulfillment steps don’t make sense.<br>2. “Ship order” occurs **after** “Cancel order”, which is explicitly disallowed (no shipping should happen after a cancellation). |
| **4**   |  Compliant  | Correct cancellation path: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close, with no fulfillment steps afterwards. |
| **5**   |  Violation  | “Ship order” happens without a preceding “Package items” step. The normative flow requires packaging to occur between payment authorization and shipping. |

### Conclusion
Cases **2**, **3**, and **5** deviate from the normative process, each for the reasons detailed above. Cases **1** and **4** adhere to the expected flow.
