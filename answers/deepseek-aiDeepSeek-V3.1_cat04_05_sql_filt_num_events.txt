Here's a DuckDB SQL query that identifies cases with six or fewer events and returns all events for those cases:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id, 
        COUNT(*) as event_count
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_event_counts cec 
    ON el.case_id = cec.case_id
ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;
```

**Alternative approach using window function:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as total_events
    FROM event_log
) events_with_counts
WHERE total_events <= 6
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**
- The first query uses a CTE to calculate event counts per case and filters for cases with 6 events, then joins back to get all events for those cases
- The second query uses a window function to calculate total events per case while preserving all individual event rows
- Both queries maintain all original columns from the event_log table
- The ORDER BY ensures results are grouped by case and ordered chronologically within each case

Both approaches are valid in DuckDB. The window function version might be more efficient as it avoids the join operation, while the CTE version can be more readable for some users.
