Let's analyze each case based on the normative rules and desiderata.

---

### **Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)**

**Key Normative Constraints:**
- **Sequence:** Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case
- **Ordering Rules:**
    - Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
    - Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision.
    - Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision.
    - If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.
    - If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case.

**What is Not Allowed:**
- Skipping activities in the required sequence.
- Changing the order (e.g., doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
- Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection.
- Closing the case without following the decision logic (Approved  Finalize Documentation before closing, Rejected  close without finalization).

---

### **Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

- Credit Check completed within 24 hours of Application Received.
- Applicant informed within 48 hours of Loan Decision.
- Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before Close Case (encouraged but not required).

### **Case Analysis:**

#### **Case 1:**

| Timestamp           | Activity                |
| :------------------ | :---------------------- |
| 2024-01-10 09:00    | Application Received    |
| 2024-01-10 09:30    | Credit Check            |
| 2024-01-10 10:00    | Risk Assessment         |
| 2024-01-10 11:00    | Loan Decision (Approved)|
| 2024-01-10 13:00    | Inform Applicant        |
| 2024-01-10 13:30    | Finalize Documentation  |
| 2024-01-10 14:00    | Close Case              |

**1. Normative Violations:**
*   **None.**
    *   The sequence is correct: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
    *   Ordering rules are respected: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.
    *   Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation occurred before Close Case.

**2. Desiderata Failures:**
*   **None.**
    *   Credit Check (09:30) was within 24 hours of Application Received (09:00).
    *   Inform Applicant (13:00) was within 48 hours of Loan Decision (11:00).
    *   No Follow-up Call, but this is an encouragement, not a failure if not performed. The description for desiderata indicates "Failing to adhere to these timing recommendations or skipping the follow-up call is not a serious violation." So, while not done, it's not a "failure" of a hard desideratum.

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**
*   This case represents an ideal execution of the loan application process, adhering to all strict rules and meeting all recommended best practices. It's a textbook example of a compliant and efficient process flow.

#### **Case 2:**

| Timestamp           | Activity                       |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received           |
| 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment                | *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* |
| 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check                   |
| 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected)       |
| 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation         | *(Not allowed after rejection)* |
| 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case                     |

**1. Normative Violations:**
*   **Violation 1: Ordering Rule Violation - Credit Check before Risk Assessment.**
    *   **Reason:** Risk Assessment (08:20) was performed before Credit Check (09:00). The rule explicitly states, "Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment."
*   **Violation 2: Forbidden Action - Finalize Documentation after rejection.**
    *   **Reason:** The loan was Rejected at 09:30, but "Finalize Documentation" was performed at 10:00. The rule explicitly states, "If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing the case."

**2. Desiderata Failures:**
*   **None directly measurable due to normative violations.**
    *   The prompt states "Violating these is not considered a serious problem, but ideally they should be followed." Since the process has fundamental normative violations, the concept of "desiderata failure" becomes less relevant for analysis of this particular case flow. For example, while Credit Check occurred within 24 hours of application, the fact it was out of order makes its timing less relevant to desiderata analysis.

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**
*   This case exhibits significant deviations from the normative process.
    *   The inversion of "Credit Check" and "Risk Assessment" could suggest a human error, a misinterpretation of the process, or an attempt to speed up the process by starting the Risk Assessment prematurely (perhaps based on preliminary information). This could lead to an incomplete or inaccurate risk assessment if critical credit information was not yet available.
    *   Performing "Finalize Documentation" after a rejected loan decision is a critical error. This could be due to:
        *   **Confusion/Miscommunication:** The person finalizing documentation was not aware of the rejection.
        *   **System Glitch:** The system allowed an action that should have been blocked by business rules.
        *   **Attempt to Salvage:** An attempt to prepare for an appeal or re-application, which is not part of the standard rejection flow.
    *   These violations highlight a need for stronger process controls, automated checks, or better training for staff involved in the loan application process.

#### **Case 3:**

| Timestamp           | Activity                         |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------- |
| 2024-01-12 09:00    | Application Received             |
| 2024-01-14 10:00    | Credit Check                     | *(Happened more than 24 hours later - just a desideratum violation)* |
| 2024-01-14 11:00    | Risk Assessment                  |
| 2024-01-14 12:00    | Loan Decision (Approved)         |
| 2024-01-16 15:00    | Inform Applicant                 | *(Later than recommended 48 hours - again a desideratum violation)* |
| 2024-01-17 09:00    | Finalize Documentation           |
| 2024-01-17 10:00    | Close Case                       |
| *(No Follow-up Call)* |                                  |

**1. Normative Violations:**
*   **None.**
    *   The sequence is correct: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
    *   Ordering rules are respected: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision.
    *   Since the loan was approved, Finalize Documentation occurred before Close Case.

**2. Desiderata Failures:**
*   **Desideratum Failure 1: Credit Check completion time.**
    *   **Reason:** Application Received on 2024-01-12 09:00. Credit Check performed on 2024-01-14 10:00. This is approximately 49 hours later, exceeding the recommended 24-hour window.
*   **Desideratum Failure 2: Inform Applicant time.**
    *   **Reason:** Loan Decision (Approved) made on 2024-01-14 12:00. Inform Applicant performed on 2024-01-16 15:00. This is approximately 51 hours later, exceeding the recommended 48-hour window.
*   **Desideratum Failure 3: No Follow-up Call.**
    *   **Reason:** The "Follow-up Call" was not performed. While not a strict requirement, it is encouraged, representing a missed opportunity for optimal customer alignment.

**3. Interpretations/Justifications:**
*   This case adheres strictly to all normative rules, indicating a solid understanding of the core process logic.
*   The desiderata failures suggest potential bottlenecks or resource constraints.
    *   The delay in the Credit Check could be due to:
        *   High volume of applications.
        *   Dependency on external credit agencies with slower response times.
        *   Staffing shortages or backlogs.
    *   The delay in informing the applicant after the decision could be due to:
        *   Manual communication processes that are slow.
        *   A queue of approved applications needing communication.
        *   Staff capacity issues.
    *   The absence of a Follow-up Call, while not a serious violation, points to either:
        *   A deliberate choice to streamline the process (reduce non-essential steps).
        *   Lack of time or resources to perform this additional, non-mandatory step.
        *   A belief that the written communication (Inform Applicant) is sufficient.
*   Overall, this case demonstrates a compliant process that could benefit from efficiency improvements to meet desired service level agreements and enhance customer experience.
