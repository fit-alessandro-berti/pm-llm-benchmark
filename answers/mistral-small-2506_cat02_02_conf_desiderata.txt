### **1. Violations of Normative (Strict) Rules**

#### **Case 2: Multiple Violations**
- **Violation 1:** **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**
  - **Reason:** The sequence requires **Credit Check  Risk Assessment**, but in Case 2, Risk Assessment occurred at **08:20** before Credit Check at **09:00**.
  - **Impact:** This is a **strict violation** of the ordering rules.

- **Violation 2:** **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**
  - **Reason:** The loan was **rejected at 09:30**, but **Finalize Documentation** was performed at **10:00**.
  - **Impact:** This is a **strict violation** because documentation should **never** be finalized after a rejection.

#### **Case 3: No Normative Violations**
- **No strict violations** were observed in Case 3. All steps followed the required sequence.

### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

#### **Case 1: No Desiderata Violations**
- **No deviations** from recommended best practices.

#### **Case 2: No Desiderata Violations**
- **No deviations** from recommended best practices (though normative violations exist).

#### **Case 3: Multiple Desiderata Violations**
- **Violation 1:** **Credit Check Delayed Beyond 24 Hours**
  - **Reason:** Application was received at **2024-01-12 09:00**, but Credit Check was done at **2024-01-14 10:00** (2 days later).
  - **Impact:** This is **suboptimal** but not a strict violation.

- **Violation 2:** **Inform Applicant Delayed Beyond 48 Hours**
  - **Reason:** Loan Decision was made at **2024-01-14 12:00**, but the applicant was informed at **2024-01-16 15:00** (~47 hours later).
  - **Impact:** This is **suboptimal** but not a strict violation.

- **Violation 3:** **No Follow-up Call**
  - **Reason:** The process encourages a **Follow-up Call** before closing, but none was recorded.
  - **Impact:** This is **suboptimal** but not a strict violation.

### **3. Possible Interpretations & Justifications**

#### **Case 2 (Normative Violations)**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**
  - Possible **human error** (e.g., an analyst mistakenly performed Risk Assessment before verifying credit history).
  - Could indicate **process inefficiency** (e.g., credit check was delayed due to system issues).

- **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:**
  - Possible **automation error** (e.g., a system incorrectly triggered documentation finalization).
  - Could indicate **lack of process oversight** (e.g., an employee did not check the decision before proceeding).

#### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations)**
- **Delayed Credit Check & Inform Applicant:**
  - Possible **high workload** (e.g., backlog caused delays).
  - Could indicate **inefficient resource allocation** (e.g., insufficient staff to process applications promptly).

- **No Follow-up Call:**
  - Possible **oversight** (e.g., the call was forgotten or deemed unnecessary).
  - Could indicate **lack of enforcement** (e.g., the follow-up is encouraged but not tracked).

### **Summary of Findings**
| Case ID | Normative Violations | Desiderata Violations |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **1**   | None                 | None                  |
| **2**   |  Risk Assessment before Credit Check <br>  Finalize Documentation after Rejection | None |
| **3**   | None                 |  Credit Check delayed <br>  Inform Applicant delayed <br>  No Follow-up Call |

**Conclusion:**
- **Case 2** has **serious process violations** that must be corrected.
- **Case 3** has **suboptimal behavior** that should be improved but does not break strict rules.
- **Case 1** is **fully compliant** with both normative and desiderata.
