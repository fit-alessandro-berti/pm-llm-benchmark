Certainly! Below is a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task of filtering out cases with more than six events and returning only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total.

```sql
WITH event_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)
SELECT
    el.*
FROM
    event_log el
JOIN
    event_counts ec
ON
    el.case_id = ec.case_id
WHERE
    ec.event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `event_counts`:**
   - This CTE calculates the number of events for each `case_id` by grouping the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counting the number of rows in each group.

2. **Main Query:**
   - The main query selects all columns from the `event_log` table (`el.*`).
   - It joins the `event_log` table with the `event_counts` CTE on the `case_id` column.
   - The `WHERE` clause filters out any `case_id` where the `event_count` is greater than 6, ensuring that only events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.

This query ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are included in the final result set.
