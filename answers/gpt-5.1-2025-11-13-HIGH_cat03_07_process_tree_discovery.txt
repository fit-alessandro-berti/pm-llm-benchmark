Here is a process tree that captures the observed behavior, including the optional, repeating “request missing info + revalidation” pattern:

```text
-> (
    'RA',                      // Receive Application
    'VF',                      // Validate Form
    'AE',                      // Assess Eligibility
    * (
        tau,                   // enables zero or more iterations
        -> (
            -> (
                'RMI',         // at least one Request Missing Info ...
                * ( tau, 'RMI')// ... plus zero or more extra RMI  => RMI+
            ),
            'VF'               // followed by a (re-)Validate Form
        )
    ),
    'AD',                      // Approval Decision
    'SC',                      // Send Confirmation
    'AC'                       // Archive Case
)
```

**Intuition in words**

- The main flow is a strict sequence:  
  RA  VF  AE  (loop)  AD  SC  AC.
- The loop is `* (tau, ->( RMI+, VF ))`, which means:
  - It is optional (can be skipped entirely).
  - Each iteration consists of:
    - One or more `RMI` events (`RMI+`), then
    - A `VF` (re-validation).
  - This allows:
    - No loop at all: RA VF AE AD SC AC (Case 2),
    - One cycle: RA VF AE RMI VF AD SC AC (Case 1),
    - Multiple RMIs before a single VF: RA VF AE RMI RMI VF AD SC AC (Case 3),
    - And multiple such cycles if they occur in other cases.
