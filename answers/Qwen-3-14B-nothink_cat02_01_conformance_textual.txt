### **1. Identification of Violating Cases**

Based on the normative process description, the following **cases deviate from the expected process flow**:

- **Case 2**
- **Case 3**
- **Case 5**

---

### **2. Explanation of Violations**

#### **Case 2:**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-06 10:00    | **Package items**  |
| 2023-10-06 10:30    | **Authorize payment** |
| 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation Explanation:**

- **"Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment"**, which violates the normative rule that **"Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory" and before "Package items"**.
- The correct sequence, when inventory is sufficient, should be: **Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close**.
- In this case, the **order of "Package items" and "Authorize payment" is reversed**, which is **not allowed** and **violates the intended process flow**.
- This is a **clear deviation** from the normative description.

#### **Case 3:**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 2023-10-07 10:30    | **Ship order**     |
| 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Violation Explanation:**

- **"Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order"**, which is explicitly **not allowed** according to the normative description.
- The description clearly states: **"Ship order" should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation.**
- In this case, after **"Cancel order"**, the process **should not proceed to "Ship order"** or any other fulfillment-related activity.
- **"Ship order" is a violation of the normative process** because it occurs **after cancellation**.

---

#### **Case 5:**

| Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2023-10-09 11:00    | **Ship order**     |
| 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation Explanation:**

- **"Package items" is missing** in this case.
- According to the normative process, **"Package items" should occur after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order"**.
- The correct sequence when inventory is sufficient is: **Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close**.
- In this case, the process **skips "Package items"** and goes **directly from "Authorize payment" to "Ship order"**, which is **not allowed**.
- **"Package items" is a required step** before shipping and its absence is a **violation of the normative process**.

### **Summary of Violations:**

| Case ID | Violation Type | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| 2      | Activity Order | "Package items" before "Authorize payment" |
| 3      | Activity Order | "Ship order" after "Cancel order" |
| 5      | Missing Activity | Missing "Package items" before "Ship order" |

---

### **Conclusion**

Cases **2**, **3**, and **5** all contain deviations from the normative process described. These deviations involve either **incorrect ordering of activities** or **missing required steps**, which **violate the intended logic** of the process. The normative process clearly outlines the expected sequence of events, and any deviation from these sequences (especially those involving payment authorization, packaging, and shipping) is considered a violation.
