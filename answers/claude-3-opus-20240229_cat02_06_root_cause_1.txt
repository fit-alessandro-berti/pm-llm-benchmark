Based on the given event log, I have analyzed the total resolution times for each case and identified potential factors contributing to performance issues. Here are my findings and recommendations:

1. Cases with significantly longer resolution times:
   - Case 102: Total resolution time of 25 hours (received on 2024-03-01 08:05, closed on 2024-03-02 09:15)
   - Case 104: Total resolution time of 24 hours 10 minutes (received on 2024-03-01 08:20, closed on 2024-03-02 08:30)
   - Case 105: Total resolution time of 49 hours 5 minutes (received on 2024-03-01 08:25, closed on 2024-03-03 09:30)

   In comparison, Cases 101 and 103 have much shorter resolution times of 2 hours 15 minutes and 1 hour 20 minutes, respectively.

2. Potential root causes of performance issues:
   a. Escalations to Level-2 Agents:
      - Cases 102 and 105, which have the longest resolution times, both involve escalations to Level-2 Agents.
      - The escalation process itself may be causing delays, as there are significant waiting times between the escalation and the subsequent investigation by the Level-2 Agent (Case 102: 2 hours 30 minutes, Case 105: 28 hours 50 minutes).

   b. Long waiting times between activities:
      - In Case 102, there is a long waiting time of 19 hours between the investigation by the Level-2 Agent and the resolution of the ticket.
      - Similarly, in Case 104, there is a waiting time of 19 hours between the investigation and resolution steps.
      - These long waiting times suggest potential bottlenecks or resource constraints in the resolution process.

   c. Delays before investigation and resolution:
      - In Cases 102 and 104, there are significant delays between the assignment to the Level-1 Agent and the start of the investigation (Case 102: 2 hours 30 minutes, Case 104: 3 hours 30 minutes).
      - These delays could be due to high workload or inefficient ticket assignment processes.

3. Insights and recommendations:
   a. Review and streamline the escalation process:
      - Analyze the criteria for escalating tickets to Level-2 Agents and ensure that only complex issues are escalated.
      - Implement mechanisms to prioritize and quickly assign escalated tickets to Level-2 Agents to minimize waiting times.

   b. Identify and address bottlenecks in the resolution process:
      - Investigate the reasons behind the long waiting times between activities, particularly between investigation and resolution steps.
      - Allocate additional resources or optimize workflows to eliminate these bottlenecks and reduce waiting times.

   c. Improve ticket assignment and prioritization:
      - Review the ticket assignment process to ensure prompt assignment to Level-1 Agents.
      - Implement a priority-based system to ensure that high-priority tickets are investigated and resolved in a timely manner.

   d. Enhance agent training and knowledge management:
      - Provide regular training and support to Level-1 Agents to improve their efficiency in investigating and resolving tickets.
      - Maintain a comprehensive knowledge base and encourage knowledge sharing among agents to reduce the need for escalations.

By addressing these identified factors and implementing the recommended improvements, the organization can work towards reducing the total resolution times and enhancing the overall performance of the Customer Support Ticket Resolution process.
