### **BPMN-like Textual Process Model: Invoice Approval**

This model describes the end-to-end process from invoice receipt to payment scheduling, incorporating the roles of Accounts Payable, Purchasing, and Management, as well as handling for exceptions and escalations.

**Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process

**Participants/Lanes:**
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Clerk** (Primary Process Driver; e.g., Mary)
*   **Purchasing Officer** (e.g., Dan)
*   **Department Manager** (Final Approver; e.g., Carlos)
*   **Accounts Payable (AP) Supervisor** (Exception Handler; e.g., Rita)
*   **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Exception Handler; e.g., Karen)
*   **Supplier** (External Participant)
*   **Accounting System** (Automated Participant)

**Artifacts (Data Objects):**
*   **Invoice:** The primary document that flows through the process.
*   **Purchase Order (PO):** A reference document used for validation.
*   **Goods Receipt Confirmation:** An email or system notification confirming services/goods were received.

---

### **Process Flow Description:**

**1. Start Event:**
*   **Trigger:** An invoice is received by the company, typically via email to the Accounts Payable department.

**2. AP Clerk Lane:**
*   **Task:** `Check for Purchase Order (PO) Number`
    *   The AP Clerk examines the received invoice to determine if a valid PO number is present.
*   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Is PO Number Present?`
    *   **Path 1 (No):**
        *   **Task:** `Return Invoice to Supplier`
            *   The AP Clerk sends an email to the supplier requesting that they resubmit the invoice with a valid PO number.
        *   **End Event:** `Process Terminated (Awaiting Resubmission)`
    *   **Path 2 (Yes):**
        *   **Task:** `Log Invoice in Accounting System`
            *   The AP Clerk enters the initial invoice data into the system.
        *   **Task:** `Forward Invoice for Goods Receipt Confirmation`
            *   The AP Clerk sends the invoice (or a notification) to the Purchasing department.

**3. Purchasing Officer Lane:**
*   **Task:** `Confirm Goods/Services Receipt and Invoice Details`
    *   The Purchasing Officer receives the invoice from AP.
    *   They compare the invoice details (quantities, prices) against the corresponding PO.
*   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Are Goods/Services Confirmed?`
    *   **Path 1 (Yes):**
        *   **Task:** `Send Confirmation to AP`
            *   The Purchasing Officer sends a confirmation email or system notification back to the AP Clerk.
    *   **Path 2 (No / Discrepancy Found):**
        *   **Sub-Process:** `Resolve Purchasing Discrepancy`
            *   **Task:** `Contact Supplier for Correction`
                *   The Purchasing Officer contacts the supplier to request a corrected invoice.
            *   **Task:** `Notify AP Clerk to Hold Invoice`
                *   Purchasing informs AP to pause the process until the issue is resolved.
            *   *(This sub-process ends when a corrected invoice is received or the issue is otherwise resolved, at which point the flow returns to `Send Confirmation to AP`)*.

**4. AP Clerk Lane (Resumes):**
*   *(Waits for message from Purchasing Officer)*
*   **Task:** `Match Invoice Line Items to PO`
    *   Upon receiving confirmation from Purchasing, the AP Clerk performs a detailed three-way match (Invoice vs. PO vs. Goods Receipt Confirmation) within the accounting system.
*   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Does Invoice Match PO?`
    *   **Path 1 (Yes - "Happy Path"):**
        *   **Task:** `Request Manager Approval`
            *   The AP Clerk finalizes the matched invoice package. The **Accounting System** automatically sends an approval request notification to the relevant Department Manager.
    *   **Path 2 (No - Discrepancy Found):**
        *   **Sub-Process:** `Resolve AP-Level Discrepancy`
            *   **Task:** `Clarify Discrepancy with Purchasing`
                *   The AP Clerk contacts the Purchasing team to resolve the issue (e.g., incorrect pricing).
            *   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Is Discrepancy Easily Resolved?`
                *   **Path 1 (Yes):**
                    *   *(The flow returns to `Match Invoice Line Items to PO` after resolution)*.
                *   **Path 2 (No):**
                    *   **Task:** `Escalate to AP Supervisor`
                        *   The AP Clerk forwards the complex issue to their supervisor.
                    *   *(The process continues in the AP Supervisor Lane)*.

**5. Department Manager Lane:**
*   *(Waits for notification from the Accounting System)*
*   **Task:** `Review Invoice and Supporting Documents`
    *   The Department Manager reviews the invoice, PO, and confirmation details in the system.
*   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Approve Invoice?`
    *   **Path 1 (Yes - Approved):**
        *   **Task:** `Approve Invoice in System`

            *   The Manager rejects the invoice or puts it on hold.
        *   **Task:** `Notify AP to Investigate`
            *   The Manager sends the invoice back to the AP Clerk with a note explaining the reason for rejection/hold.
            *   *(The process returns to the AP Clerk Lane for further investigation)*.

**6. AP Clerk Lane (Final Step):**
*   *(Waits for approval message from the Department Manager)*
*   **Task:** `Schedule Invoice for Payment`
    *   Upon receiving the final approval, the AP Clerk adds the invoice to the next payment run.
*   **End Event:** `Invoice Scheduled for Payment`

### **Exception Handling Sub-Processes (Asynchronous Events):**

**A. AP Supervisor Lane (Triggered by Escalation):**
*   **Trigger:** `AP Clerk Escalates Complex Discrepancy`
*   **Task:** `Investigate Escalated Issue`
    *   The AP Supervisor coordinates between departments, contacts suppliers, or analyzes the problem.
*   **Gateway (Exclusive):** `Is this a "No PO" Invoice?`
    *   **Path 1 (Yes):**
        *   **Task:** `Work with Department to Create Retrospective PO` or `Decide on Rejection`.
    *   **Path 2 (No):**
        *   **Task:** `Coordinate Resolution with Stakeholders`.
*   **Task:** `Return Invoice to Normal Flow`
    *   Once resolved, the supervisor sends the invoice back to the AP Clerk to re-enter the main process (e.g., at the `Match Invoice` step).

**B. Supplier Relationship Manager Lane (Triggered by Request):**
*   **Trigger:** `AP or Purchasing Requests Help with Supplier`
*   **Task:** `Contact Supplier to Resolve Issue`
    *   The manager leverages their relationship to clarify pricing, get a missing PO number, or resolve contract-related discrepancies.
*   **Task:** `Communicate Resolution to AP/Purchasing`
    *   Provides the correct information so the invoice can proceed in its original lane.
