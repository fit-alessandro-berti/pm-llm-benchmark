## Temporal Profile Anomalies, Hypotheses, and Verification Queries

Here's an analysis of potential anomalies within the provided temporal profile, along with hypotheses and SQL queries for verification.

**1. Anomaly: Receive (R) to Approve (P) - Short Average Time & Low Standard Deviation**

* **Observation:** The average time between receiving a claim and approving it is approximately 25 hours with a very low standard deviation. This suggests a highly consistent, and potentially unrealistic, approval timeframe.
* **Hypothesis:**  A rule-based automated approval system might be in place for certain claim types or amounts, bypassing the typical evaluation process. Alternatively, adjusters might be prematurely approving claims to meet performance metrics, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments.
* **Verification Queries:**
    * **Identify claims with unusually short R-P times:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        c.claim_amount,
        c.claim_type,
        MIN(ce1.timestamp) AS receive_time,
        MAX(ce2.timestamp) AS approve_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 3600 AS time_to_approve_hours
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 3600 < 12  -- Less than 12 hours
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type;
    ```
    * **Check if specific claim types are consistently approved quickly:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_type,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 3600) AS avg_approve_hours
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'R'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'P'
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_type;
    ```

**2. Anomaly: Approve (P) to Notify (N) - Long Average Time & High Standard Deviation**

* **Observation:** The average time between approving a claim and notifying the customer is 7 days, with a standard deviation of 2 days. This indicates significant delays and inconsistency in customer notification.
* **Hypothesis:**  A backlog in the notification process, potentially due to limited resources or a manual notification step, is causing the delay.  The high standard deviation suggests the delay is not uniform, possibly dependent on claim complexity or adjuster workload.
* **Verification Queries:**
    * **Identify claims with excessively long P-N times:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id,
        c.customer_id,
        MIN(ce1.timestamp) AS approve_time,
        MAX(ce2.timestamp) AS notify_time,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 86400 AS time_to_notify_days
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'P'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 86400 > 10 -- More than 10 days
    GROUP BY
        c.claim_id, c.customer_id;
    ```
    * **Correlate P-N delay with adjuster workload:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        a.name AS adjuster_name,
        AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 86400) AS avg_notify_days
    FROM
        adjusters a
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON a.adjuster_id = (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE event_id = ce1.event_id AND activity = 'P')
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON a.adjuster_id = (SELECT resource FROM claim_events WHERE event_id = ce2.event_id AND activity = 'N')
    WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    GROUP BY
        a.name
    ORDER BY
        avg_notify_days DESC;
    ```

**3. Anomaly: Assign (A) to Close (C) - Short Average Time**

* **Observation:**  A relatively short average time between assigning an adjuster and closing the claim.
* **Hypothesis:** Claims are being closed prematurely, potentially without proper evaluation or approval.  This could be due to adjusters prioritizing closure rates over thorough investigation, or a system error allowing claims to be closed without completing all steps.
* **Verification Queries:**
    * **Identify claims closed quickly after assignment, without intermediate steps:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'A'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'C'
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 3600 < 4  -- Less than 4 hours
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM claim_events ce3
            WHERE ce3.claim_id = c.claim_id
              AND ce3.activity IN ('E', 'P')
              AND ce3.timestamp > ce1.timestamp
              AND ce3.timestamp < ce2.timestamp
        );
    ```

**4. Anomaly: Evaluate (E) to Notify (N) - Very Short Average Time**

* **Observation:** A very short average time (5 minutes) between evaluating a claim and notifying the customer.
* **Hypothesis:** The notification process is automated and triggered immediately after evaluation, potentially before a full review is completed. Alternatively, the 'Evaluate' event might be incorrectly logged, or the notification is a preliminary acknowledgement rather than a final decision notification.
* **Verification Queries:**
    * **Identify claims with extremely short E-N times:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 60 < 2; -- Less than 2 minutes
    ```
    * **Check if these claims have a subsequent 'P' (Approve) event shortly after 'N':**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.claim_id
    FROM
        claims c
    JOIN
        claim_events ce1 ON c.claim_id = ce1.claim_id AND ce1.activity = 'E'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce2 ON c.claim_id = ce2.claim_id AND ce2.activity = 'N'
    JOIN
        claim_events ce3 ON c.claim_id = ce3.claim_id AND ce3.activity = 'P'
    WHERE
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(ce2.timestamp) - MIN(ce1.timestamp))) / 60 < 2
        AND ce3.timestamp > ce2.timestamp
        AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce3.timestamp - ce2.timestamp)) / 60 < 30; -- Approve within 30 minutes of Notify
    ```
