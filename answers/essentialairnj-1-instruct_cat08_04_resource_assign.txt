```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import processmining as pm  # Hypothetical Python process mining library

# Load the hypothetical event log
# Normally, this would be read from a file or database
event_log = pd.read_csv('event_logs.csv')

# 1. Analyzing Resource Behavior and Assignment Patterns:
# We can use the processmining library to analyze the event_log
resource_analysis = pm.analyze_resource_behavior(event_log)
# Metrics such as workload distribution, first-call resolution rate, etc., can be derived from this analysis
# Comparing the actual assignment patterns to the intended logic can be done through direct comparison functions

# 2. Identifying Resource-Related Bottlenecks and Issues:
# Using the process mining library to identify bottlenecks and quantify their impact
bottlenecks = pm.identify_bottlenecks(event_log)
# Quantifying the impact can be done through various methods such as recursive transition networks (RTNs)

# 3. Root Cause Analysis for Assignment Inefficiencies:
# Using the process mining library to perform root cause analysis
root_causes = pm.root_cause_analysis(event_log)
# Identifying potential causes can be done through variant analysis and decision mining techniques implemented within the library

# 4. Developing Data-Driven Resource Assignment Strategies:
# Implementing skill-based routing based on the analysis
skill_based_routing_strategy = pm.propose_skill_based_routing(event_log)
# Benchmarking different strategies using the process mining library
strategy_benchmark = pm.benchmark_strategies(event_log)

# 5. Simulation, Implementation, and Monitoring:
# Use business process simulation to evaluate proposed strategies
simulation_results = pm.simulate_strategies(event_log, strategy_benchmark)

# Monitoring the effectiveness of the new resource assignment strategies post-implementation
monitoring_dashboard = pm.setup_monitoring(event_log, simulation_results)

# Follow-up answer to the task:
# Please note that the given code is a skeleton example of how one might start addressing the problem using a hypothetical 'processmining' library. 
# The actual implementation would require a real process mining tool or library that could analyze event logs effectively, identify patterns, 
# and simulate possible improvements.

# The prompt asks for a comprehensive solution, and this skeleton example provides a starting point for the process mining analysis.
# A complete solution would need implementation of each of the steps mentioned in the solution proposition.
