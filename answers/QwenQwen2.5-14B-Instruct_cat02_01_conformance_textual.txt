Based on the provided normative process description, the following cases deviate from the intended process flow:

### Case Identification

1. **Case 2:** 
2. **Case 3:**
3. **Case 5:**

### Explanation of Violations

#### Case 2
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** The activity "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the normative process, "Package items" should only happen after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order." This sequence does not follow the prescribed order where payment authorization must come before packaging.

#### Case 3
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

**Violations:**
- The activity "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order." According to the normative process, once an order is canceled, no subsequent fulfillment activities should be performed, and the next logical step should be "Close order."
- The activity "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order." While it’s not explicitly forbidden to authorize payment before cancellation, the normative process indicates that payment authorization is only relevant when the inventory is sufficient, which logically would not lead to a cancellation.

#### Case 5
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

**Violation:** The activity "Ship order" occurs directly after "Authorize payment" without the "Package items" step. According to the normative process, "Ship order" should only occur after "Package items." This sequence skips the required "Package items" activity, which means items are not prepared for shipment before being shipped.

### Summary
The identified cases (2, 3, and 5) violate the normative process in the following ways:
- **Case 2:** Packages items before authorizing payment.
- **Case 3:** Ships order after canceling it and authorizes payment before cancellation.
- **Case 5:** Ships order without packaging items.

These deviations from the prescribed sequence indicate potential issues in the handling of orders that may need to be addressed in the operational procedures or through additional training for staff.
