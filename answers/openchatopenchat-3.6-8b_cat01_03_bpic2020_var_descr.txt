This data represents various process variants of a system that handles declarations and payments. The process usually starts with an employee submitting a declaration. Depending on the process variant, the declaration may go through multiple approval stages, including approval by administration, budget owner, and supervisor. In some cases, the declaration may be rejected at different stages and require resubmission. Once a declaration is finally approved, a request for payment is sent, and the payment is handled.

The performance metric represents the total performance value for each process variant, while the frequency metric represents the number of occurrences of each process variant.

In summary, this dataset captures the various paths a declaration can take, from submission to payment, including different approval stages and rejection scenarios.
