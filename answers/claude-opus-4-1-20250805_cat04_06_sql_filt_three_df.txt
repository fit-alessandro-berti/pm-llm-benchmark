Looking at this problem, I need to:
1. Find cases with the specific sequence of three activities in direct succession
2. Among those, identify cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' > 5 days
3. Exclude those cases from the final result

Here's my DuckDB SQL solution:

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    -- Add row numbers to maintain order within each case
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
    FROM event_log
),
sequence_matches AS (
    -- Find cases with the exact sequence in direct succession
    SELECT DISTINCT
        e1.case_id,
        e2.timestamp as create_order_timestamp,
        e3.timestamp as confirm_order_timestamp
    FROM ordered_events e1
    JOIN ordered_events e2 
        ON e1.case_id = e2.case_id 
        AND e2.rn = e1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events e3 
        ON e2.case_id = e3.case_id 
        AND e3.rn = e2.rn + 1
    WHERE e1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND e2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND e3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
cases_to_exclude AS (
    -- Filter for sequences where time between Create and Confirm > 5 days
    SELECT case_id
    FROM sequence_matches
    WHERE confirm_order_timestamp > create_order_timestamp + INTERVAL '5 days'
)
-- Return all events except those from excluded cases
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM cases_to_exclude
)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ordered_events` CTE**: Assigns row numbers to events within each case ordered by timestamp. This allows us to check for direct succession.

2. **`sequence_matches` CTE**: Uses self-joins to find cases where the three activities appear in exact sequence with consecutive row numbers (no events in between). It captures the timestamps of 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' for the timing check.

3. **`cases_to_exclude` CTE**: Filters the matched sequences to only include cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.

4. **Final SELECT**: Returns all events from the original table except those belonging to the excluded cases.

The query ensures that:
- The three activities must appear in the exact specified order
- They must be consecutive (no other events from the same case between them)
- The timing condition (>5 days) is checked only for the matched sequences
- The final result excludes entire cases that meet both criteria
