To identify anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the given event log, we need to analyze the sequence and timing of events for each order. We can also cross-reference with the `orders` and `resources` tables to gain more context. Here are some potential anomalies and hypotheses, along with the SQL queries to investigate them:

### Anomalies and Hypotheses

1. **Out-of-Order Events:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Events might be logged out of order due to system errors or concurrent processing.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.event_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.timestamp < LAG(oel.timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY oel.case_id ORDER BY oel.event_id)
     ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.event_id;
     ```

2. **Missing Events:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Some events might be missing due to system failures or incomplete processes.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT o.case_id, o.order_type, o.order_value
     FROM orders o
     LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
     WHERE oel.case_id IS NULL;
     ```

3. **Late Confirmation of Shipment:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Late confirmation of shipment might indicate inefficiencies in logistics management.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%late_confirmation=Y%';
     ```

4. **Early Shipment Attempt:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Early shipment attempts might be due to policy violations or miscommunication.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%attempted_early=Y%';
     ```

5. **Payment Received Before Invoice Issued:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Payment received before the invoice is issued might indicate billing errors or fraud.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Receive Payment'
     AND oel.timestamp < (SELECT oel2.timestamp
                          FROM order_event_log oel2
                          WHERE oel2.case_id = oel.case_id AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice')
     ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.event_id;
     ```

6. **Unscheduled Shipments:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Unscheduled shipments might indicate logistical issues or policy violations.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%shipment_scheduled=N%';
     ```

7. **Credit Check Issues:**
   - **Hypothesis:** Low credit scores might indicate potential risks or issues in the credit check process.
   - **SQL Query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, oel.resource, oel.additional_info
     FROM order_event_log oel
     WHERE oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND oel.additional_info LIKE '%credit_score=%'
     ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(oel.additional_info FROM 'credit_score=([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER);
     ```

### Cross-Referencing with `resources` Table

To understand the roles and departments involved in these anomalies, we can cross-reference with the `resources` table:

- **SQL Query:**
  ```sql
  SELECT oel.case_id, oel.activity, oel.timestamp, r.role, r.department
  FROM order_event_log oel
  JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
  WHERE oel.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Receive Payment', 'Perform Credit Check')
  ORDER BY oel.case_id, oel.event_id;
  ```

### Conclusion

By running these SQL queries, we can gain insights into the anomalies and undesirable behaviors in the event log. This will help in identifying potential system errors, policy violations, or inefficiencies in the order processing workflow. Further analysis and root cause investigation can be conducted based on the results obtained from these queries.
