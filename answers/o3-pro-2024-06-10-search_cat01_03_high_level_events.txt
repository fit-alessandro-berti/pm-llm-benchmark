Proposed high-level process map (aggregated from the sample log)

Step # | High-level activity name | Constituent low-level events (patterns) | Why these events belong together
----- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------
1 | Material Preparation | “Retrieve raw metal sheet”  “Scan barcode”  “Place metal sheet on table”  “Align metal sheet”  “Pre-heat metal sheet” | • All actions occur before any value-adding transformation (weld, coat, etc.).  • They happen within the first ~20–25 s of each case, executed primarily by Operator A, Robot Arm #2 and Heating Unit #1—equipment associated with setup rather than assembly.  • Logically they convert an incoming raw part into a ready-to-assemble workpiece, so they form a coherent “prep” phase.  
2 | Welding Assembly | “Pick up welding tool”  “Weld corner A”  “Weld corner B” | • Same human resource (Operator B) and tool ID (W-12) appear in tight temporal succession (<20 s).  • These events are the core joining operation that turns a prepared sheet into a welded sub-assembly.  
3 | In-process Weld Inspection | “Measure weld integrity” | • Performed immediately after welding by a dedicated QC resource (Quality Sensor #1).  • Single specialized check; separating it lets analysts distinguish process execution from in-line quality assurance.  
4 | Surface Finishing | “Apply protective coating”  “Dry coating” | • Both events relate to coating application and curing, executed by coating/heating units (Unit #3 and Unit #2).  • They always follow a successful weld inspection, forming a distinct post-assembly treatment stage.  
5 | Final Visual Inspection | “Visual check” | • Last timestamped action; performed by Operator C rather than automated devices.  • Represents human sign-off that releases the part to the next process or to inventory.  

How to apply these groupings to the full log

Rule set (can be implemented in a process-mining or ETL tool):

1. Material Preparation = all events that occur **before** the first occurrence of any welding activity for the same CaseID **and** whose Activity label includes one of: {Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat}.  
2. Welding Assembly = contiguous block that starts with “Pick up welding tool” (or first “Weld*” event if the pick-up is missing) and ends with the last “Weld*” event in that block.  
3. In-process Weld Inspection = any “Measure weld integrity” event recorded **after** the Welding Assembly block and **before** the first coating event for that case.  
4. Surface Finishing = events with Activity  {Apply protective coating, Dry coating, Cure coating, etc.}. Treat them as one block until no further coating-related activity occurs for  X seconds (configurable gap, e.g., 30 s).  
5. Final Visual Inspection = the final “Visual check” (or any Activity that matches regex “.*Visual.*Inspect.*”) for that CaseID.

Why this matters

• Compresses 12–13 fine-grained events per case into 5 meaningful stages—easier for dashboards and bottleneck analysis.  
• Separates value-adding operations (assembly, finishing) from checks, enabling OEE and quality KPI calculations.  
• Rule-based grouping is interpretable and can be tuned (e.g., adjust the gap that separates surface-finishing events or merge Steps 3 & 5 if business prefers a single “Quality Inspection” stage).
