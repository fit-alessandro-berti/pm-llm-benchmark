To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze the process variants and their execution times. Here are some key differences based on the provided data:

### 1. **Frequency of Loan Denial vs. Loan Approval:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The most frequent outcome is "Application Rejected" (960 occurrences), followed by "Loan Denied" (229 occurrences).
  - The frequency of "Sign Loan Agreement" is relatively low (39 occurrences).
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The most frequent outcome is "Loan Denied" (2709 occurrences), followed by "Sign Loan Agreement" (1656 occurrences).
  - The frequency of "Application Rejected" is lower (664 occurrences).

### 2. **Execution Time:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The average execution time for "Application Rejected" is 219999.156.
  - The average execution time for "Loan Denied" is around 310015.991 to 330021.590.
  - The average execution time for "Sign Loan Agreement" is around 330025.590.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The average execution time for "Loan Denied" is around 340005.309.
  - The average execution time for "Sign Loan Agreement" is around 340004.889.
  - The average execution time for "Application Rejected" is 260002.042.

### 3. **Process Complexity:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - There are more complex processes involving multiple steps like "Request Co-Signer On Loan" and "Make Visit to Assess Collateral" before reaching the final decision.
  - The process often involves more steps and longer execution times for loan denial.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The processes are generally simpler, with fewer steps before reaching the final decision.
  - The process often involves fewer steps and shorter execution times for loan denial.

### 4. **Special Cases:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - There are instances where the process involves multiple visits to assess collateral before loan denial, which increases the complexity and execution time.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - There are instances where the process involves "skipped_examination" leading to "Sign Loan Agreement," which is not present in the protected group.

### 5. **Appointment Denial:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The frequency of "Appointment Denied" is 599, with an average execution time of 90000.623.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The frequency of "Appointment Denied" is 363, with an average execution time of 80001.088.

### 6. **Loan Denial vs. Loan Approval:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The ratio of "Loan Denied" to "Sign Loan Agreement" is significantly higher.
- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The ratio of "Loan Denied" to "Sign Loan Agreement" is more balanced.

### Summary:
- The protected group experiences more complex processes with longer execution times, especially for loan denial.
- The unprotected group has simpler processes with shorter execution times for loan denial.
- The unprotected group has a higher frequency of loan approval compared to the protected group.
- The protected group has a higher frequency of "Application Rejected" compared to the unprotected group.
- The unprotected group has a unique process involving "skipped_examination" leading to loan approval, which is not present in the protected group.

These differences suggest that the protected group faces more scrutiny and longer processing times, which could be indicative of unfair treatment. The unprotected group seems to have a more streamlined process with a higher likelihood of loan approval.
