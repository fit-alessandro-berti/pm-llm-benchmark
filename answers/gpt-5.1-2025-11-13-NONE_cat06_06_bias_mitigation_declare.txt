Explanation of how the added constraints reduce bias:

1. **Mandatory Manual Review for sensitive groups (coexistence, responded_existence, precedence, chainprecedence).**  
   Any decision that explicitly encodes a sensitive group (e.g., `Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`, `Approve_Female`, etc.) must be accompanied by and immediately preceded by `ManualReview`. This enforces consistent, human-in-the-loop oversight for decisions involving sensitive demographics, reducing the chance of automated, unchecked bias.

2. **Required BiasMitigationCheck after sensitive attribute access (response, succession, chainresponse).**  
   After any sensitive attribute is checked (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantAge`, `CheckApplicantGender`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` is required before progressing to the final decision. This forces the process to explicitly apply fairness checks before decisions are made.

3. **Blocking direct paths from sensitive checks to decisions (nonsuccession, nonchainsuccession).**  
   These constraints forbid direct (and immediate) succession from sensitive attribute checks to decision activities (`FinalDecision` and group-specific approve/reject variants). This prevents “knee-jerk” decisions based solely on a newly revealed sensitive attribute.

4. **Precedence of mitigation before FinalDecision (precedence, response).**  
   `BiasMitigationCheck` is enforced as a prerequisite to `FinalDecision`, ensuring that all final decisions, especially those following sensitive checks, are made only after a mitigation step has occurred.

Overall, the new constraints structurally require that:  
- sensitive information  mitigation and review steps  decision,  
and explicitly forbid shortcuts that could encode biased behavior based directly on sensitive attributes.
