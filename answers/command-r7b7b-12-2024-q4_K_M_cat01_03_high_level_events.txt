## High-Level Process Steps:

**1. Material Acquisition and Preparation:**
   - **Events:** Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet (for both cases A1 and B2)
   - **Justification:** These initial steps are crucial for preparing the raw materials. They ensure that the correct part is retrieved, its authenticity is verified via scanning, it's placed in a designated location, aligned properly, and preheated to facilitate subsequent processes like welding. The repetitive nature of these actions across both cases indicates a consistent phase in the manufacturing workflow.
   - **Name:** Material Acquisition & Preparation

**2. Assembly:**
   - **Events:** Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B (performed by Operator B for case A1 and Operator B for case B2)
   - **Justification:** The assembly stage involves bringing together the components to create a finished product. The picking and welding actions are sequential steps in this process. Both cases involve Operator B performing these tasks, suggesting they are part of the same assembly phase.
   - **Name:** Assembly

**3. Quality Control:**
   - **Events:** Measure weld integrity (performed by Quality Sensor #1 for both cases A1 and B2), Visual check (performed by Operator C)
   - **Justification:** Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing to ensure product reliability. The measurements of weld integrity provide data on the strength and quality of the welds, while visual checks by an operator further verify the product's adherence to specifications. These actions are consistently performed after the assembly stage for both cases.
   - **Name:** Quality Control

**4. Finishing and Coating:**
   - **Events:** Apply protective coating, Dry coating (performed by Coating Unit #3 and Heating Unit #2 respectively)
   - **Justification:** After the primary components are assembled and checked, finishing processes like applying a protective coating take place to enhance product durability and appearance. Both cases involve these coating applications in sequence after the quality control checks.
   - **Name:** Finishing & Coating
