**Explanation:**

*   **Case Identification:** Cases were identified by observing the workflow of the user. Each case begins with an initial action (e.g., "FOCUS" on a specific document, starting to work on an email, or working with a spreadsheet), and all related subsequent events (e.g., "TYPING", "SAVE", "SWITCH" events within the same application and focused window) constitute that case. Some events might be interrupted (e.g., the user switches to another application or a different file), and those interruptions are used to determine case boundaries.

*   **Activity Naming:** Activity names were created to represent the purpose of the actions. The raw "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SAVE," "SWITCH", "CLICK", "SCROLL", "HIGHLIGHT", and "CLOSE" events are mapped into more meaningful business activities. These actions are combined together to form higher level activities. For example, "FOCUS" events were combined with other document-related actions to describe activities like "Edit Document". "SWITCH" events are used to determine when the user is working on a different task, leading to a new case. Events that involve entering or editing text were categorized as "Type Text".

*   **Case Boundaries:**

    *   The user worked on "Quarterly\_Report.docx" before 9:00 am and at around 9:07 am. This is considered a single case (Case 1).
    *   Working on "Document1.docx" from 9:00 am to 9:07 am is considered a single case (Case 2). The user went back and forth from editing the document to other activities.
    *   Checking email, replying, and sending an email represent a case (Case 3).
    *   Reviewing the "Report\_Draft.pdf" document is a case (Case 4).
    *   Working on the "Budget\_2024.xlsx" spreadsheet, from 9:05 am to 9:05:45 am is a case (Case 5).

*   **Attributes:** All the columns in the source log were included, alongside the newly derived `Case ID` and `Activity Name` columns.
