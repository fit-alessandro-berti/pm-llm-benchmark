# Performance Analysis: Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process

## 1. Resolution Time Analysis

Let me first calculate the total resolution time for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Resolution Time | Status |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| 101 | 2024-03-01 08:00 | 2024-03-01 10:15 | **2h 15min** |  Normal |
| 102 | 2024-03-01 08:05 | 2024-03-02 09:15 | **25h 10min** |  Delayed |
| 103 | 2024-03-01 08:10 | 2024-03-01 09:30 | **1h 20min** |  Normal |
| 104 | 2024-03-01 08:20 | 2024-03-02 08:30 | **24h 10min** |  Delayed |
| 105 | 2024-03-01 08:25 | 2024-03-03 09:30 | **49h 5min** |  Critically Delayed |

**Average Resolution Time:** 20.4 hours  
**Median Resolution Time:** 24.2 hours (skewed by Case 105)

### Cases with Significant Delays:
- **Case 105**: 49+ hours (most severe - 2+ days)
- **Case 102**: 25+ hours (~1 day)
- **Case 104**: 24+ hours (~1 day)

Cases 101 and 103 completed within business hours (~1-2 hours), while Cases 102, 104, and 105 extended over multiple days.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### **Factor 1: Escalation to Level-2 Agents**

**Cases with Escalation:** 102, 105  
**Cases without Escalation:** 101, 103, 104

| Case | Escalation? | Resolution Time | Delay After Escalation |
|------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 102 | Yes | 25h 10min | 19h (from escalation to resolution) |
| 105 | Yes | 49h 5min | 43h (from escalation to resolution) |
| 104 | No | 24h 10min | N/A |

**Analysis:**
- Cases 102 and 105 both involved escalation, and both experienced substantial delays
- **Case 102**: 2.5-hour wait between escalation (11:30) and investigation by Level-2 (14:00), then overnight delay before resolution
- **Case 105**: **Massive 28-hour wait** between escalation (10:00 on March 1) and Level-2 investigation (14:00 on March 2)

**Key Insight:** Escalation introduces significant delays, particularly in the handoff between Level-1 and Level-2 agents. This suggests:
- Level-2 agents may be overloaded or have limited availability
- Poor handoff protocols between escalation tiers
- Lack of urgency or SLA tracking for escalated tickets

### **Factor 2: Extended Waiting Times Between Activities**

#### Case-by-Case Activity Gap Analysis:

**Case 104 (No Escalation, but still delayed - 24h):**
- Assign  Investigate: **3.5 hours** (09:30  13:00)
- Investigate  Resolve: **19 hours** (13:00 March 1  08:00 March 2)

**Case 105 (Critical delay - 49h):**
- Investigate (1st)  Escalate: 50 minutes (normal)
- Escalate  Investigate (2nd): **28 hours** 
- Investigate (2nd)  Resolve: **19 hours** (overnight)

**Case 102 (Delayed - 25h):**
- Escalate  Investigate: **2.5 hours**
- Investigate  Resolve: **19 hours** (overnight)

**Pattern Identified:** 
- **Overnight delays** are common (investigation starting late afternoon leads to next-day resolution)
- **Post-escalation investigation delays** are severe (2.5-28 hours)
- **Assignment-to-investigation gaps** can be significant (3.5 hours in Case 104)

---

### **Factor 3: Time-of-Day Effects**

| Case | Investigation Start Time | Resolution Time from Investigation | Crosses Business Day? |
|------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| 101 | 09:00 | 1h | No |
| 102 | 14:00 | 19h | Yes (afternoon start) |
| 103 | 08:45 | 30min | No |
| 104 | 13:00 | 19h | Yes (afternoon start) |
| 105 | 14:00 (Day 2) | 19h | Yes (afternoon start) |

**Key Finding:** Investigations starting after 1:00 PM consistently result in overnight delays (~19 hours to resolution), suggesting:
- Complex issues cannot be resolved within the same business day if started late
- Lack of after-hours support coverage
- No handoff procedures for end-of-day incomplete work

## 3. Summary of Performance Bottlenecks & Recommendations

### **Root Causes Identified:**

| Root Cause | Impact | Affected Cases |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Level-2 Escalation Delays** | High (28h max wait) | 102, 105 |
| **Overnight/Multi-day Resolution Cycles** | High (19h delays) | 102, 104, 105 |
| **Late-day Investigation Starts** | Medium (forces next-day completion) | 102, 104, 105 |
| **Assignment-to-Investigation Gaps** | Medium (3.5h delays) | 104 |

---

### **Recommendations:**

#### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Optimize Level-2 Escalation Process**
   - Implement SLA for Level-2 response time (target: <2 hours)
   - Create dedicated escalation queue with priority handling
   - Enable direct assignment to available Level-2 agents rather than queue-based escalation

2. **Extend Support Coverage**
   - Consider shift overlap or extended hours for Level-2 team
   - Implement handoff protocols for tickets in-progress at end of business day
   - Target: reduce overnight resolution gaps from 19h to <12h

3. **Early Investigation Protocol**
   - Prioritize ticket assignment and investigation in morning hours
   - Flag tickets received/triaged after 12:00 PM for expedited handling or next-morning priority
   - Set hard SLA: Investigation must start within 2 hours of assignment

4. **Proactive Escalation Detection**
   - Implement early warning system to predict escalation needs during triage
   - Route potential escalation cases directly to Level-2 or hybrid teams

#### **Long-term Improvements:**

5. **Performance Metrics & Monitoring**
   - Track escalation rate and post-escalation resolution time
   - Monitor time-of-day patterns in ticket assignments
   - Set target: 90% of tickets resolved within 4 hours (like Cases 101, 103)

6. **Capacity Planning**
   - Analyze Level-2 agent utilization and availability
   - Cross-train Level-1 agents to reduce escalation frequency

**Expected Impact:** Reducing escalation delays and overnight gaps could decrease average resolution time from 20+ hours to <6 hours, bringing outlier cases closer to the 1-2 hour benchmark set by Cases 101 and 103.
