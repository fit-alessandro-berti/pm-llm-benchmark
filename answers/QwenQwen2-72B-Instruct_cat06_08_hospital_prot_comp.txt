Noticing significant differences in process variants and their associated performance between the protected and the unprotected group requires an observation of patterns and disparities in the process flow and the execution times. Key differences appear in:

**1. Routes with 'Expert Examination' and 'Thorough Examination' steps:**
   - The unprotected group has more occurrences involving 'Expert Examination' followed by 'Thorough Examination' (1466 vs. 78 occurrences in the protected group). This implies that individuals in the unprotected group are disproportionately subjected to more invasive checks and possibly more comprehensive treatment when visiting the facility.
   - The execution time for these process variants are also high (around 320,000 seconds in the unprotected group), suggesting that these individuals might spend more time within the healthcare system compared to the protected group members.

**2. Discharge as a separate process variant:** 
   - In the unprotected group, there are 505 instances of 'Discharge' occurring independently without any other activities (i.e., no other process steps leading to discharge). This suggests that there might be cases in the unprotected group where patients are discharged without being properly registered or examined, leading to potential bypassing of necessary procedures.
   - In the protected group, 'Discharge' never occurs independently, indicating that every 'Discharge' event is preceded by a full medical process such as examination, diagnosis, and treatment.

**3. Treatment Unsuccessful Cases:**
   - The unprotected group reports a higher number of process variants that include a 'Treatment unsuccessful' step (e.g., Expert Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful) compared to the protected group, signifying potentially lower treatment success rates in this group.

**4. Regular Examination Steps:**
   - Standard examination routes (Register -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful) have a higher frequency in the protected group (284 occurrences) over the unprotected group (279 occurrences). Yet, considering the much higher total occurrences in the unprotected group for 'expert' and 'thorough' examination processes, this disparity highlights that straightforward treatment without additional diagnostic steps is somewhat more common for the protected group.
   - The performance times are very similar for both groups in these cases, around 260,000 seconds.

In summary, the main differences lie in the frequency and sequence of process steps. The unprotected group undergoes more intensive examinations, more frequently, and also reports more unsuccessful treatment outcomes. These disparities could be suggestive of hidden inequality in healthcare service delivery regarding these
