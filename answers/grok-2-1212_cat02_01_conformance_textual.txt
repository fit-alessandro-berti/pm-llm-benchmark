To identify deviations from the normative process, we will analyze each case in the event log against the rules and expected sequences described in the normative process description. Let's go through each case step-by-step:

### Case 1

**Event Log Sequence:**
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Package items
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
This case follows the normative process for the scenario where inventory is sufficient. The sequence matches the expected flow: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close. There are no violations.

### Case 2

**Event Log Sequence:**
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Package items
4. Authorize payment
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
This case violates the normative process. The violation occurs because "Package items" happens before "Authorize payment." According to the normative description, "Package items" should only occur after payment authorization. This sequence violates the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged.

### Case 3

**Event Log Sequence:**
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Cancel order
5. Ship order
6. Close order

**Analysis:**
This case contains multiple violations. The first violation occurs because "Authorize payment" happens before "Cancel order," which suggests that inventory was sufficient (since payment was authorized), but then the order is canceled. This is illogical because if inventory was sufficient, the order should not be canceled.

The second violation is that "Ship order" happens after "Cancel order." According to the normative description, once an order is canceled, it should proceed directly to "Close order" without any fulfillment activities like shipping.

### Case 4

**Event Log Sequence:**
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Cancel order
4. Close order

**Analysis:**
This case follows the normative process for the scenario where inventory is insufficient. The sequence matches the expected flow for cancellation: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. There are no violations.

### Case 5

**Event Log Sequence:**
1. Receive order
2. Check inventory
3. Authorize payment
4. Ship order
5. Close order

**Analysis:**
This case violates the normative process. The violation occurs because "Ship order" happens without the preceding "Package items" activity. According to the normative description, items must be packaged before they can be shipped. Skipping the packaging step violates this rule.

### Summary of Violations

1. **Case 2:**
   - Violation: "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
   - Explanation: The normative process requires that payment be authorized before items are packaged. This sequence violates the rule that payment must be authorized before items are packaged.

2. **Case 3:**
   - Violation 1: "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order."
     - Explanation: Authorizing payment implies sufficient inventory, but canceling the order contradicts this, indicating a logical inconsistency.
   - Violation 2: "Ship order" after "Cancel order."
     - Explanation: Once an order is canceled, no fulfillment activities should occur. Shipping after cancellation violates the rule that canceled orders should proceed directly to closing.

3. **Case 5:**
   - Violation: "Ship order" without "Package items."
   - Explanation: The normative process requires items to be packaged before they can be shipped. Skipping the packaging step violates this rule.

### Conclusion

Based on the normative process description, Cases 2, 3, and 5 contain deviations from the intended process flow. These deviations are identified by comparing the sequences in the event log against the expected sequences and rules outlined in the normative description.
