Based on the provided process variants, frequencies, and performance metrics, several **process-specific** and **data-specific** root causes contribute to the performance issues in the Declaration process. Here's a detailed analysis:

### **1. High Frequency of Rejections at Multiple Stages**

- **Stages Involved**: 
  - **Administration**
  - **Pre-Approver**
  - **Budget Owner**
  - **Supervisor**

- **Impact**:
  - **Increased Iterations**: Multiple rejections necessitate resubmissions, causing the process to loop through various stages repeatedly.
  - **Performance Degradation**: Each additional loop adds to the total processing time, significantly increasing the performance metric.

- **Evidence from Variants**:
  - **Variant 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34**: These variants include multiple rejections by different roles, correlating with higher performance values (e.g., Variant 30 has a performance of 13,805,869.200 due to numerous rejections and resubmissions).

### **2. Complex Approval Hierarchy with Multiple Approval Layers**

- **Components**:
  - **Administration**
  - **Pre-Approver**
  - **Budget Owner**
  - **Supervisor**

- **Impact**:
  - **Increased Complexity**: More approval layers mean more decision points, which can slow down the process, especially if approvals are inconsistent.
  - **Higher Likelihood of Rejections**: Each additional approval stage introduces another opportunity for the declaration to be rejected, further complicating the process.

- **Evidence from Variants**:
  - **Variants 2, 6, 11, 18, 22, 28, 34**: These involve approvals from both Administration and Budget Owner before final approval by the Supervisor, contributing to longer processing times.

### **3. Presence of Missing or Incomplete Approval Steps**

- **Issues Identified**:
  - **Rejections by "MISSING"**: Indicates incomplete data or undefined approval paths.
  
- **Impact**:
  - **Process Halts or Delays**: Missing approval steps can cause the process to stop unexpectedly or require manual interventions, leading to significant delays.
  
- **Evidence from Variants**:
  - **Variant 12, 17, 26**: Instances where declarations are rejected by "MISSING," leading to incomplete or extended processing paths with high performance values.

### **4. Multiple Resubmissions Due to Rejections**

- **Impact**:
  - **Redundancy**: Each rejection forces the employee to resubmit the declaration, often repeating the same or similar steps, which accumulates processing time.
  - **Inconsistent Data Handling**: Repeated submissions can lead to data inconsistencies or errors, further complicating the process.

- **Evidence from Variants**:
  - **Variants 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 21, 23, 27, 31, 33, 34**: Frequent resubmissions after rejections significantly inflate performance metrics (e.g., Variant 33 with a performance of 3,502,608.250 due to multiple rejections and resubmissions).

### **5. Specific Variants with Extremely High Performance Metrics Indicating Severe Process Issues**

- **Examples**:
  - **Variant 30**: Performance = 13,805,869.200
    - **Issue**: Multiple rejections by Administration and Budget Owner, leading to extensive resubmissions.
  - **Variant 26**: Performance = 4,922,455.714
    - **Issue**: Rejections by "MISSING" and multiple approvals leading to a convoluted path.
  - **Variant 32**: Performance = 9,110,508.000
    - **Issue**: Direct payment handling after final approval, possibly bypassing necessary steps, leading to data or process inconsistencies.

### **6. Variants with Minimal or No Performance Impact but Indicative of Process Shortcuts or Bypasses**

- **Example**:
  - **Variant 8**: Performance = 0.000
    - **Issue**: "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" suggests the process is halted prematurely without completing necessary approvals, potentially leading to incomplete data entries.

### **Summary of Root Causes**

1. **Frequent Rejections**: High rates of rejection at multiple approval stages cause the process to loop, increasing processing time.
2. **Complex Approval Structure**: Multiple approval layers add complexity and opportunities for delays.
3. **Missing Approval Steps**: Incomplete or undefined approval paths lead to process halts and require manual interventions.
4. **Multiple Resubmissions**: Repeated attempts to get declarations approved due to initial failures inflate performance metrics.
5. **Process Bypasses**: Shortcuts or incomplete processes (e.g., saving without approval) can create data inconsistencies and require corrective actions.

### **Recommendations**

To address these root causes, consider the following **process and data-specific** improvements:

- **Streamline Approval Hierarchy**: Reduce the number of approval layers where possible to minimize complexity and points of failure.
- **Enhance Data Completeness**: Ensure all necessary approval steps are defined and data fields are complete to prevent "missing" rejections.
- **Implement Validation Checks**: Before submission, validate declarations to reduce the likelihood of rejections.
- **Monitor and Analyze Rejections**: Identify common reasons for rejections to address underlying issues proactively.
- **Automate Resubmission Processes**: Where feasible, automate parts of the resubmission process to reduce delays caused by manual interventions.

By targeting these specific process and data-related factors, you can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of the Declaration process.
