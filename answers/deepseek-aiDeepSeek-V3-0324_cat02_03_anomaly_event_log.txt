### Analysis of Anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Event Log

The standard P2P process typically follows this sequence:
1. **Create Purchase Requisition**  
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**  
3. **Issue Purchase Order (PO)**  
4. **Receive Goods** (for goods) or **Receive Service** (for services)  
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**  
6. **Match Invoice to PO** (3-way match: PO, invoice, and goods receipt)  
7. **Release Payment**  
8. **Close Case**  

Deviations from this sequence or illogical ordering of steps may indicate anomalies. Below are the identified anomalies in the given event log:

---

#### **Case 1002: Payment Released Before Approval and Goods Receipt**
- **Anomalous Sequence**:  
  - `Issue Purchase Order` (before requisition approval)  
  - `Vendor Invoice Received`  
  - `Release Payment` (before approval or goods receipt)  
  - `Approve Purchase Requisition` (after payment is released)  
  - `Receive Goods` (after payment)  

- **Problems**:  
  1. **Payment Before Approval**: Payment was released before the requisition was approved, which violates internal controls. Approvals should precede any financial commitment (PO issuance) or payment.  
  2. **Payment Before Goods Receipt**: Payment was released before confirming the goods were received, risking payment for undelivered or unsatisfactory goods.  
  3. **PO Issued Before Approval**: The PO was issued before the requisition was approved, which could lead to unauthorized purchases.

#### **Case 1003: Payment Released Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**
- **Anomalous Sequence**:  
  - `Release Payment` (before invoice received or goods received)  
  - `Vendor Invoice Received` (after payment)  
  - `Receive Goods` (after payment)  

- **Problems**:  
  1. **Payment Without Invoice or Goods**: Payment was released without verifying the invoice or receiving the goods, which is a severe control failure. This could lead to fraud (e.g., paying for nonexistent goods) or duplicate payments.  
  2. **No 3-Way Match Before Payment**: The standard practice is to match the PO, invoice, and goods receipt before payment to ensure accuracy and validity.  

---

#### **Case 1004: Goods Received Before PO Issued**
- **Anomalous Sequence**:  
  - `Receive Goods` (before `Issue Purchase Order`)  
  - `Issue Purchase Order` (after goods receipt)  

- **Problems**:  
  1. **Goods Received Without PO**: This suggests goods were delivered without a formal PO, which violates procurement controls. A PO should be issued to the vendor before any goods are shipped or received.  
  2. **Risk of Unauthorized Purchases**: Without a PO, there is no formal record of the agreed terms (price, quantity, etc.), leading to potential disputes or overpayments.

### Summary of Anomalies and Risks
| Case ID | Anomaly                                                                 | Risks                                                                 |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1002    | Payment released before requisition approval and goods receipt          | Unauthorized spending, payment for undelivered goods                  |
| 1003    | Payment released before invoice and goods receipt                       | Fraud risk, duplicate payments, no audit trail                        |
| 1004    | Goods received before PO issued                                         | Unauthorized purchases, lack of contractual agreement with vendor     |

### General Best Practices Violated:
1. **Segregation of Duties**: Approvals, PO issuance, and payments should involve different roles to prevent fraud.  
2. **3-Way Match**: Invoice, PO, and goods receipt must match before payment.  
3. **Sequential Control**: Requisition approval → PO → Goods Receipt → Invoice → Payment.  

These anomalies could indicate **control weaknesses, fraud risks, or process inefficiencies** and should be investigated further.
