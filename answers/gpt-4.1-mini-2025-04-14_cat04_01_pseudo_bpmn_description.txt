Certainly! Let me break down the pseudo-BPMN process step-by-step, explain the purpose of each element, describe the gateways, and clarify how paths diverge, converge, and loop based on conditions.

## Overview

This process models how a company handles incoming customer requests, distinguishing between **Standard** and **Custom** request types, with appropriate validations, parallel checks, feasibility analyses, approvals, and notification steps. The process ensures quality control, feasibility, and management oversight before confirming the order with the customer.

---

## Step-by-step Explanation

### 1. **Start Event**
- This marks the initiation of the process: a customer request has been received and the workflow begins.

### 2. **Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- The process formally captures a customer's request.
- This is the entry point for all further processing.

### 3. **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**
- XOR (Exclusive OR) gateway means only one path can be taken based on the condition.
- Condition: Is the request **Standard** or **Custom**?
    - This decision route bifurcates the process into two distinct flows:

---

## Path 1: **Standard Request**

### 4. **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- Validates that a standard request complies with predefined rules or criteria.
- Example: Checking if the requested product exists, quantity limits, etc.

### 5. **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- AND gateway indicates that multiple paths are executed concurrently.
- Two checks run **in parallel**:
    - **Task C1:** "Credit Check" — verifies if the customer’s credit status allows the order.
    - **Task C2:** "Inventory Check" — confirms if sufficient products are in stock.

### 6. **Join after Parallel Checks**
- The process waits until **both** parallel checks complete.
- Synchronizes flow before proceeding.

### 7. **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- Based on inventory availability and logistics, determine the expected delivery date for the order.
- This consolidates the preceding checks into a concrete shipment schedule.

---

## Path 2: **Custom Request**

### 4. **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- Evaluates if a custom request is technically and operationally feasible.
- Could involve assessing custom design, resource availability, costing, timelines.

### 5. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- Decision point:
   - **If Yes:** 
     - Proceed to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**, where a tailored price and terms are prepared for the customer.
   - **If No:** 
     - Proceed to **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**, which communicates that the request cannot be fulfilled.
     - This leads to the **End Event**, concluding the process for infeasible requests.

---

## After Standard or Custom Path Tasks are Completed

Both paths converge once the key validation/analysis is done and necessary outputs (delivery date or quotation) are ready.

### 1. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- Decision:
   - **If Yes:**
     - Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"
       - Sends output (delivery date or quotation) for managerial review.
     - Gateway XOR: "Is Approval Granted?"
       - **If Yes:** Continue to Task G.
       - **If No:** Go to Task H.
   - **If No:** Skip approval and continue directly to Task G.

### 2. **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- Manager reviews and decides on the validity, pricing, or other aspects of the request.
- This adds a control layer for critical/custom orders.

### 3. **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- Evaluates manager’s decision:
   - **Approval Granted:** proceed to generate final invoice.
   - **Approval Denied:** rework or reevaluate conditions.

### 4. **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
- Feedback loop step where the process reanalyzes or adjusts the request.
- Important to note **loops differ based on request type:**
    - For **Custom Path:** loops back to Task E1 "Prepare Custom Quotation"
        - Implies reworking quotation to address issues raised by manager.
    - For **Standard Path:** loops back to Task D "Calculate Delivery Date" 
        - Implies reassessment of delivery date or order details.

---

## Final Steps

### 5. **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- Once approval is secured or deemed unnecessary, the system creates a billing invoice tailored either by standard parameters or custom proposals.

### 6. **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- Sends an official confirmation message to the customer, informing them about their order status, invoice details, and expected delivery.

### 7. **End Event**
- Marks the end of the process.

## Summary of Gateways

| Gateway Type | Purpose                                                 | Locations & Meaning                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| XOR (Exclusive OR) | Splits or merges flow based on mutually exclusive conditions | - Check request type (Standard vs Custom)<br>- Feasibility decision<br>- Approval needed decision<br>- Approval granted decision |
| AND (Parallel) | Runs multiple tasks/concurrent operations needing all to complete | Parallel credit check and inventory check for standard path |

## Key Differentiators Between Standard and Custom Paths

| Aspect                    | Standard Request                    | Custom Request                    |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Validation                | "Perform Standard Validation"      | "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis" |
| Parallel Checks           | Credit Check + Inventory Check run in parallel | No parallel checks; feasibility assessed single path |
| Follow-up Task            | Calculate Delivery Date             | Prepare Custom Quotation (if feasible) |
| If Not Feasible           | Not applicable (assumed feasible)  | Send Rejection Notice and end process |
| Rework Loop               | Loop back to Calculate Delivery Date  | Loop back to Prepare Custom Quotation |

## When Are Approval and Rework Triggered?

- **Approval Needed?** Probably depends on business rules like:
  - Order value thresholds,
  - Customization complexity,
  - Customer risk factors, etc.

- **If Approval is Denied:**
  - Process triggers rework:
    - For standard requests, reevaluates delivery dates or checks.
    - For custom requests, revises quotations for more feasibility or adjusted pricing.

- **If Approval is Not Needed or Granted:** 
  - Moves to final invoicing and confirmation.

# **Conclusion**

This BPMN pseudo-model clearly differentiates handling of standard vs. custom requests:

- Standard requests undergo parallel financial and inventory checks before delivery date calculation.
- Custom requests demand feasibility checks and either progress with custom quotations or end with rejection.
- Both paths can require managerial approval based on conditions, and denial triggers a rework loop appropriate to request type.
- Finally, approved or uncomplicated requests generate invoices and customer confirmations, closing the process.

This structure ensures effective management of orders according to complexity and risk, maximizing customer satisfaction and operational control.
