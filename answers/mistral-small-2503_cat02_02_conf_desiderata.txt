### Analysis of the Event Log

#### 1. Violations of Normative Rules

**Case 2:**
- **Violation 1:** The activity "Risk Assessment" occurred before "Credit Check."
  - **Reason:** The normative constraint specifies that "Credit Check" must occur before "Risk Assessment."
- **Violation 2:** The activity "Finalize Documentation" occurred after the loan decision was "Rejected."
  - **Reason:** The normative constraint specifies that "Finalize Documentation" should not occur after a rejection.

**Case 3:**
- No normative rule violations were observed in Case 3.

#### 2. Failures to Meet Desiderata Conditions

**Case 1:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was made.
  - **Reason:** While not a strict rule, it is recommended to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case.

**Case 2:**
- **Desideratum Violation:** No Follow-up Call was made.
  - **Reason:** Similar to Case 1, a Follow-up Call is recommended but not required.

**Case 3:**
- **Desideratum Violation 1:** The "Credit Check" was completed more than 24 hours after the application was received.
  - **Reason:** It is recommended to complete the "Credit Check" within 24 hours of receiving the application.
- **Desideratum Violation 2:** The "Inform Applicant" activity was performed more than 48 hours after the loan decision.
  - **Reason:** It is recommended to inform the applicant within 48 hours of the loan decision.
- **Desideratum Violation 3:** No Follow-up Call was made.
  - **Reason:** Similar to Cases 1 and 2, a Follow-up Call is recommended but not required.

#### 3. Interpretations or Justifications for Observed Behaviors

**Case 1:**
- **Behavior:** All normative rules were followed, but the Follow-up Call was not made.
  - **Justification:** The process was strictly adhered to, but the Follow-up Call, being a desideratum, was likely skipped due to operational efficiency or oversight.

**Case 2:**
- **Behavior:** Significant normative violations occurred, including performing "Risk Assessment" before "Credit Check" and finalizing documentation after a rejection.
  - **Justification:** This could indicate a lack of training or oversight in the process. The sequence of activities was not followed, leading to potential inefficiencies and errors.

**Case 3:**
- **Behavior:** All normative rules were followed, but several desiderata were not met.
  - **Justification:** The delays in "Credit Check" and "Inform Applicant" activities suggest potential backlogs or inefficiencies in the process. The absence of a Follow-up Call might be due to the same reasons as in Case 1.

### Summary

- **Normative Violations:** Only Case 2 violated the strict normative rules.
- **Desiderata Violations:** All cases failed to meet at least one desideratum, primarily the absence of a Follow-up Call.
- **Interpretations:** The deviations from desiderata suggest areas for process improvement, while the normative violations in Case 2 indicate a need for stricter adherence to the defined sequence of activities.
