# Analysis of Hire-to-Retire POWL Models

## 1. Overview of the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process
The standard Hire-to-Retire process typically follows this sequence:
- **Post_Job_Ad**: Create and publish a job opening
- **Screen_Candidates**: Review and filter applications
- **Conduct_Interviews**: Interview shortlisted candidates
- **Make_Hiring_Decision**: Select the best candidate
- **Onboard_Employee**: Help the new employee transition into the role
- **Add_to_Payroll**: Process payroll information
- **Close_Case**: Finalize and close the recruitment case

The expected order is sequential with some parallelism potentially allowed between screening and interviews in practice.

## 2. Analysis of Anomalies in Each Model

### Model 1 Analysis:
```python
model1.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide)
model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview)
model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard)
model1.order.add_edge(Onboard, Payroll)
model1.order.add_edge(Payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies in Model 1:**
1. **Premature Hiring Decision**: The model allows making a hiring decision (Decide) after screening without conducting interviews, which is a major deviation from standard practice. Interviews are typically a required step before making a hiring decision.
   
2. **Parallel Execution of Decide and Interview**: The model allows Decide and Interview to be executed in parallel after Screening, which is problematic as interviews should inform the hiring decision.

3. **Missing Sequential Dependency**: The model doesn't enforce that interviews must happen before the hiring decision, which is a fundamental requirement in most hiring processes.

These anomalies represent **severe deviations** from the standard hiring process, as they allow for a hiring decision to be made without the critical step of conducting interviews.

### Model 2 Analysis:
```python
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Screen)
model2.order.add_edge(Post, Interview)
model2.order.add_edge(Interview, Decide)
model2.order.add_edge(Decide, loop_onboarding)
model2.order.add_edge(loop_onboarding, xor_payroll)
model2.order.add_edge(xor_payroll, Close)
```

**Anomalies in Model 2:**
1. **Parallel Posting of Ads and Screening/Interviewing**: The model allows posting job ads to be followed by both screening and interviewing in parallel, which is not typical. Usually, you post an ad, then screen applications, then conduct interviews.

2. **Loop on Onboarding**: The onboarding activity is wrapped in a loop, which could imply that onboarding might need to be repeated, which is unusual and potentially problematic (though it might represent re-onboarding for role changes).

3. **XOR on Payroll**: The payroll activity is in an XOR with a silent transition, meaning payroll might be skipped entirely, which is a critical issue since all hired employees should be added to payroll.

4. **Missing Activity**: The model is missing the "Screen_Candidates" activity in the execution flow (it's in the nodes list but not connected in the order).

These anomalies represent **moderate to severe issues**, particularly the potential to skip payroll processing, which is a critical part of the hiring process.

## 3. Comparison and Conclusion

**Model 1** has a more **structured sequence** but with **fundamental flaws** in the hiring process logic, particularly allowing hiring decisions without interviews. While the sequence appears more linear, it violates the basic hiring principle that interviews should precede hiring decisions.

**Model 2** has a **better sequential flow** (post ad  interview  decide), but introduces problematic elements like the possibility of skipping payroll processing and has structural issues with missing connections. The loop on onboarding is also questionable.

### Which Model is More Normative?

**Model 2 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process**, despite its anomalies. Here's why:

1. **Better Sequential Logic**: It follows a more logical sequence where interviews precede hiring decisions, which is standard practice.

2. **Critical Activities Present**: It includes all the critical activities of the process, whereas Model 1 has them but in the wrong order.

3. **Potential for Correction**: The issues in Model 2 could be addressed by:
   - Removing the parallel path from Post to Interview
   - Ensuring Screen_Candidates is properly connected
   - Removing the XOR from Payroll (it should be mandatory)
   - Reconsidering the loop on Onboarding

4. **Less Severe Anomalies**: While Model 2 has issues, they are more correctable than the fundamental flaw in Model 1 where interviews are not required before making a hiring decision.

In conclusion, while both models have issues, **Model 2 represents a more normative process** due to its better alignment with the expected sequence of hiring activities, particularly the relationship between interviewing and making a hiring decision.
