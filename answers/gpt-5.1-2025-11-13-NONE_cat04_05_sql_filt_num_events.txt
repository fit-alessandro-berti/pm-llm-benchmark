Here’s a concise DuckDB SQL query that does exactly that:

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log AS e
JOIN (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
) AS c
ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

Explanation (brief):
- The subquery groups events by `case_id` and keeps only those with `COUNT(*) <= 6`.
- The outer query joins back to `event_log` to return all events for those qualifying cases.
- `ORDER BY` is optional but useful to see events in case/timestamp order.
