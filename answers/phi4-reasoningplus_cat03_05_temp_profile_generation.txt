<think>We are asked to produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile for some global supply chain process. The process includes activities: Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), After-Sales Support (AS). The task says we need produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. It is given that each pair of activities eventually following each other in process execution, not only directly connected but eventually following each other.

We have to consider pairs that appear in event logs and assign estimated average time and standard deviation. We are instructed "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt." But then we should produce a dictionary with activity pairs as keys and values as tuples (average_time, standard_deviation). The instructions say: "For each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other), assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times." Wait the instruction "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information" means we need to produce a dictionary with placeholders? But then what do we output exactly: We are allowed to estimate numbers for average time and standard deviation? The instructions say: "For example:
{('A','B'): (86400, 3600)}" which indicates average time is some number in seconds. But then it says "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt." This means that we should produce a dictionary with estimated values, but the numbers should be guessed by us?

Wait re-read: The task says:
- "Your task: Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. For each pair of activities ... assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt." So that means the LLM should produce a dictionary with numeric values? It instructs: "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt" - That might be to avoid giving away hints.

However, we need to produce representative pairs from global supply chain process with activity labels. The list of activities is:
SS -> OP (Supplier Selection and Order Placement) 
OP -> RC (Order Placement then Receive Components)
RC -> QI (Receive Components, then Quality Inspection)
QI -> CA (Quality Inspection to Component Assembly)
CA -> PT (Component Assembly to Product Testing)
PT -> PK (Product Testing to Packaging)
PK -> WS (Packaging to Warehouse Storage)
WS -> DT (Warehouse Storage to Distribution)
DT -> AS (Distribution to After-sales Support)

But the prompt says: "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other." That means that we also need pairs where activities are separated by more than one step.

Let's see what exactly is meant:
"For a given trace like <A,B,C,D>, the pairs (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D) must be considered." 
So it means that for each process execution we consider every pair of activities in chronological order. So if an event log has a trace A, B, C, D then the pairs are: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.
But now here our supply chain has many steps, so all pairs between any two distinct events.

The instructions say "for each pair that appear in the global supply chain process (not only directly connected but eventually following each other), assign an estimated average time and standard deviation." So I need to produce a dictionary with keys as tuples of activities, like ('SS','OP') etc. The keys should be pairs of activity labels.

We must consider not only immediate successors but also non-adjacent ones.
We can include pairs that are "separated by multiple steps" (for example: ('SS','QI'), which is from Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection? That's two steps, so we can have a dictionary entry for that pair). But note the prompt says we need to produce representative subset of these activity pairs, ensuring complexity by considering pairs separated by multiple steps. So I'll include some keys that are not immediate ones.

I must produce estimated average times and standard deviations for each pair. The instructions say "not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt", meaning I shouldn't refer to numbers from the sample provided? Wait let me re-read: "For example:
{('A','B'): (86400, 3600)}" but then it says "do not provide explicit numerical temporal information" so that might mean we should generate our own numbers?

I must produce a dictionary. The dictionary keys will be pairs of activities in the process and values are tuples (average_time, standard_deviation). I need to include representative subset of these activity pairs.

We have 10 activities: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. There are many possible pairs if we consider every pair from a trace? But the dictionary keys in Python must be hashable and should be considered "tuples of strings".

Now I'll produce a subset of these activity pairs that is representative and not too large. The problem says: "Consider a representative subset." So maybe choose some direct ones and some non-adjacent ones.

The list of activities can be thought as chronological ordering:
SS -> OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS
But the process might have multiple steps in between. The temporal profile should reflect that there is a time gap from each event to any subsequent event.

Let's denote some estimated values for average times and standard deviations based on typical durations. We have to produce numbers, not too detailed? But wait instructions "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information" but we need numbers anyway. But the prompt said: "For example:
{('A','B'): (86400, 3600)}" That is a valid representation. But then the instruction says do not provide explicit numeric values in the prompt. So I'll produce some numbers that are plausible?

We want to be consistent with process steps:

- Supplier Selection (SS) takes time maybe 1-2 days? but average times?
Let's try: The delay between SS and OP might be something like: The process of selecting a supplier is done in real-time, so it might not have huge delays. But we are dealing with global supply chain processes for manufacturing high-tech electronics. So perhaps there are delays due to communication across time zones etc.

We need an estimated average times that reflect the durations between these events:
- SS (Supplier Selection) to OP (Order Placement): This is probably quite short, maybe an hour or few hours if it's done via digital system? But might also be a couple days. Let’s consider: It could take some time as multiple factors are involved. But I'll guess a value: Maybe average 3600 seconds (1 hour) with std dev of say 1800 seconds (30 minutes)? That seems plausible.

- OP to RC: Order Placement to Receive Components - This might be larger because ordering components and shipping them takes time, maybe 5 days on average, but standard deviation might be large. But supply chain delays vary a lot. Let's choose average 432000 seconds for 5 days? Actually wait, let me check if we want seconds or minutes: The sample uses seconds. I'll use seconds.

Maybe OP to RC: Average time is maybe several days, say 7200 seconds (2 hours) might be too short though. Wait, but ordering components can take weeks sometimes. But high-tech electronics supply chain could have delays of up to 3-4 days shipping times? It depends on the company's efficiency. Let’s consider: On average, after order placement, you get the component in maybe 1 day (86400 seconds) with a standard deviation maybe half that? But then again, many supply chains are global so delays can be more significant. We have to choose numbers.

I might produce dictionary entries as pairs:

We need some direct pairs:
('SS', 'OP') - immediate next event pair.
('OP', 'RC')
('RC', 'QI')
('QI', 'CA')
('CA', 'PT')
('PT', 'PK')
('PK', 'WS')
('WS', 'DT')
('DT', 'AS')

But also pairs that are not directly connected. We want a representative subset including some pairs that skip some intermediate steps:
E.g., ('SS','RC'): This is two hops away, from Supplier Selection to Receive Components.
('OP', 'QI'): Order Placement to Quality Inspection (skipping RC)
('RC', 'CA'): etc.

We can produce a dictionary with these keys. But we want a representative subset. It might be too many if I include every pair from 10 activities? That would be around 45 pairs. The question says "representative subset" so maybe choose about 10-15 pairs that capture both immediate and non-immediate relationships.

Let's try to produce dictionary with 12 keys maybe. But instructions say "not only directly connected, but eventually following each other". It means we consider all pairs in a trace? Actually it says: "For a given trace like <A,B,C,D>, the pairs (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D) must be considered." So that is every pair of activities from the trace. But we want representative subset, so maybe include both immediate consecutive pairs and non-consecutive ones.

I'll produce keys for these:

Let's list all activities in order: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS

Now I'll choose a few pairs:
1. ('SS', 'OP')
2. ('OP', 'RC')
3. ('RC', 'QI')
4. ('QI', 'CA')
5. ('CA', 'PT')
6. ('PT', 'PK')
7. ('PK', 'WS')
8. ('WS', 'DT')
9. ('DT', 'AS')

Then some additional pairs that are not consecutive:
10. ('SS','RC'): from Supplier Selection to Receive Components.
11. ('OP','QI'): Order Placement to Quality Inspection.
12. ('RC','CA'): Receive Components to Component Assembly.
13. ('CA','PT') is already present as immediate, so skip that if it's duplicate.
14. ('DT','AS') is already immediate.

Maybe add:
14. ('SS', 'QI'): Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection (skipping OP and RC). 
15. ('OP','PT'): Order Placement to Product Testing (skipping QI)
16. ('RC','PK'): Receive Components to Packaging (skipping QI, CA, PT?) But wait check: The trace ordering is SS,OP,RC,QI,CA,PT,P K,WS,DT,AS so after RC comes QI then CA then PT then PK? Actually the sequence goes: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. So if we take ('RC', 'PK') that means skipping QI and CA and PT. But maybe include that pair.

Also:
17. ('CA','WS'): Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage (skipping PT, PK)
18. ('PT','DT'): Product Testing to Distribution (skipping PK, WS)

Maybe also non-adjacent ones from further apart:
19. ('SS', 'AS'): Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support, which covers the entire process.

But if I include too many keys, dictionary might be huge. But instructions say "representative subset" so we want a sample that is not trivial but representative.

We can produce maybe 10 pairs with some mix: immediate and non-immediate. Let’s choose 9-12 pairs. It said "representative subset", so I'll include around 11 pairs. The question says "ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps." So I want at least one pair that's not adjacent, such as SS to AS and maybe some other pairs.

Let's try: I can produce a dictionary with keys:

- ('SS', 'OP') : immediate connection
- ('OP','RC'): immediate connection
- ('RC','QI'): immediate connection
- ('QI','CA'): immediate connection
- ('CA','PT'): immediate connection
- ('PT','PK'): immediate connection
- ('PK','WS'): immediate connection
- ('WS','DT'): immediate connection
- ('DT','AS'): immediate connection

Then I add one non-adjacent:
- ('SS', 'QI') is not directly adjacent because the trace would be SS,OP,RC,QI. So yes.
Also: ('OP','PT') might be interesting because it spans OP->RC->QI->CA? Wait check ordering: Actually, if we choose pair of activities separated by two steps (like OP to PT) then that means skip RC and QI and CA? But actually our process is exactly in order. Let's re-read the list in order:
SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS.
For ('OP', 'PT'): that would be: Order Placement to Product Testing, which means skipping after receiving components and quality inspection etc? Actually check: In the sequence if we take OP (2nd) then PT is 6th. That spans RC, QI, CA as intermediate steps. So yes, it's a non-adjacent pair.
And maybe ('RC', 'WS'): Receive Components to Warehouse Storage, which spans QI, CA, PT, PK.
Also ('SS','AS') spanning the entire chain.

Maybe I'll include these pairs:
('SS', 'OP')
('OP','RC')
('RC','QI')
('QI','CA')
('CA','PT')
('PT','PK')
('PK','WS')
('WS','DT')
('DT','AS')

Now add non-adjacent pairs:
('SS','QI') - Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection (skipping OP and RC).
('OP', 'PT') - Order Placement to Product Testing.
('RC', 'WS') - Receive Components to Warehouse Storage.
('CA', 'PK')? Wait check: CA is at position 5, PK is at position 7. Actually in our ordering: CA is 5th? Let me re-check: SS (1), OP (2), RC (3), QI (4), CA (5), PT (6), PK (7), WS (8), DT (9), AS (10). So CA to PK means CA (position 5) and PK (position 7) which is not immediate because immediate after CA is PT then PK. So yes, that's a non-adjacent pair.
('QI','WS') - Quality Inspection to Warehouse Storage (skipping CA,PT,P K)
Maybe also ('OP', 'AS'): Order Placement to After-Sales Support (spanning almost entire process)

That would be many keys.

Let me count: immediate ones are 9 keys. Then non-immediate: 
- ('SS','QI')
- ('OP','PT')
- ('RC','WS')
- ('CA','PK')
- ('QI','WS')
- ('OP','AS')

That gives total of 9 + 6 = 15 pairs.

Maybe I'll produce a dictionary with these 15 keys. That is "representative subset".

Now assign estimated average times and standard deviations to each pair. But we need some consistency in numbers across the process? Possibly we want increasing durations as the distance increases because they are cumulative delays: The further apart the activities, the longer the time difference. So if I assume that the immediate transitions have lower variability than non-immediate ones because they represent shorter spans.

But note the instructions from "TEMPORAL PROFILE" say average and standard deviation for pairs of events in a process execution. They could be different for each pair depending on how long delays are expected to be. Let me consider estimated values:

We need to assign plausible durations in seconds (as sample does).

Let's assume that immediate transitions have lower delay compared to non-immediate transitions because they capture only one step's delay, but non-adjacent pairs include the sum of several steps.

I can create estimates. But what are typical delays? Let me consider approximate times:

- ('SS', 'OP'): Supplier Selection to Order Placement might be relatively short, maybe around 1 hour on average (3600 seconds) with standard deviation 1800 seconds.
- ('OP','RC'): Order Placement to Receive Components: this might involve lead time from supplier. Possibly a day? Actually ordering high-tech electronics components may take longer if the suppliers are global. But I'll estimate a few hours maybe? Perhaps it's a couple days average? Let’s think: If it is not urgent, then maybe it takes 1-2 days on average. However, we want to have consistency with other delays.

I can try to produce a timeline for each immediate connection:
SS -> OP: It might be relatively quick decision making after supplier selection, say average 1 hour.
OP -> RC: Ordering components - it could take maybe 2 days? But not sure. Let's see, the process is complex global supply chain so delays can be variable. I'll set ('OP','RC'): average time = 7200 seconds (2 hours) or 86400 seconds for a day? Which one? Considering high-tech electronics, it might be more like several days because shipping and order processing takes time.
I can consider: Order placement to component receipt: maybe 3 days on average. But I'll try to have consistent numbers.

Maybe I'll set ('SS','OP'): average = 3600 sec (1 hour), stdev = 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
('OP','RC'): average = 86400 seconds? That is 24 hours, which is 1 day, but then it might be too long for high-tech components order placement. Alternatively, I could set it to 432000 seconds if I assume 5 days on average.

Let's consider global supply chain: Procurement may involve shipping across continents and so can be around a week. But maybe not; high-tech manufacturing is time-sensitive but still has some delays.

I might want to use numbers that are "representative" rather than realistic because it's an estimation exercise for temporal profile modeling.
The sample provided uses 86400 seconds (1 day) with stdev 3600 sec, which is in the order of one day average and a few hours deviation. So I'll try to be consistent: immediate transitions could be around a couple of hours or days.

Let's decide:
I need to assign for each pair an estimated average time and standard deviation. The pairs that are further apart will have larger averages since they include multiple steps. And also the standard deviations might be larger as well because there is more variability cumulated over several transitions.

We need a dictionary of pairs: I'll produce 15 keys.

I can structure my estimates as follows:
For immediate neighbors, average times might be in the order of hours to days.
For non-adjacent ones, add up some values.

Maybe I'll decide: The process has 10 activities. Let each immediate step have a base duration and variance. Then for pairs that are not adjacent, it is sum of durations.

But careful: if we assume independence between steps, then the average time difference is just the sum of individual means, and the standard deviation would be sqrt(sum of variances) if they're independent. But these events might not be exactly independent, but since it's a modeling assumption maybe I'll use sums.

I can assign base values to each immediate transition:
Let:
SS->OP: average = 3600 seconds (1 hour), stdev = 1800 sec.
OP->RC: average = 86400 seconds? But that seems high compared to SS->OP. Maybe I want a more consistent order:
Maybe I'll assign the following:
- ('SS','OP'): average=3600, std=1800
- ('OP','RC'): average=7200 (2 hours), std=3600 maybe? 
But let me check: For the sample provided in the prompt, they gave 86400 seconds for 'A' to 'B', which is a day. So maybe I'll assign similar numbers in order of days rather than hours because it's global supply chain process.

I want consistency:
Maybe I'll assume that immediate transitions have an average duration on the order of one day (86400 sec) with standard deviation 3600 sec, except for very quick ones like SS->OP which might be a couple hours. But then if I assign all transitions as 1 day, then non-adjacent pairs become multiple days and their standard deviations are larger.

Let's consider the process: Supplier Selection -> Order Placement might be immediate decision making - maybe it's an hour? But perhaps not because supplier selection might involve meetings and negotiations that can take a few hours to one day. In global supply chain, decisions might be made quickly if electronic communications are in place. But I'll assume:
('SS', 'OP'): average = 3600 sec (1 hour), std = 1800 sec.

Now next:
('OP','RC'): Order Placement to Receive Components: Ordering components can involve a lead time that includes processing the order and shipping arrangements. That might take around maybe 2 days? I'll set average = 172800 seconds (48 hours) but then standard deviation = 86400/??? Let me be consistent: sample provided used (86400, 3600). But wait sample is just an example and not necessarily realistic for the process. Maybe I can use similar numbers for all pairs: immediate ones average one day with std one hour? That might be too low for some steps though.

But since it's a global supply chain, let me think: 
- Supplier Selection to Order Placement: likely done quickly because the supplier is already shortlisted maybe, so 1 hour.
- Then Order Placement to Receive Components: could be around 1 day on average? But then quality inspection might take hours. 

Let's try to assign:
('SS', 'OP'): average = 3600 sec (1 hour), std=1800 sec
('OP','RC'): average = 86400 sec (1 day), std=43200 sec? That doesn't make sense because standard deviation shouldn't be larger than the mean. Alternatively, I can set stdev to maybe half of the mean or quarter.

Let me think: For immediate transitions:
We want to assign a reasonable ratio between average and standard deviation. The sample uses (86400, 3600) which is 1 day vs 1 hour. Ratio ~ 24 hours / 1 hour = 24? Wait check: 86400 seconds divided by 3600 seconds equals 24. So they use a factor of 24 difference.
Maybe I'll do similar ratio for others.

For ('SS','OP'): average=3600, std=1800 gives ratio 2 (3600/1800 = 2), which is different from the sample's ratio of 86400/3600=24. But that might be because the process steps vary in variability as well.

I can set a rule: For each immediate transition pair i, I'll assign average time T and standard deviation T / factor, but the factor might depend on the step.
Maybe I want all pairs to have different values. I can produce arbitrary estimates. Let's try:

For immediate transitions:
('SS','OP'): average = 3600 sec (1 hour), std = 1800 sec (30 minutes). Ratio = 2
('OP', 'RC'): average = 86400 sec (24 hours, 1 day) , std = 3600 sec (1 hour). Ratio = 24.
('RC','QI'): average = maybe 14400 sec (4 hours), std = 7200 sec (2 hours). Ratio ~2.
('QI', 'CA'): average = 86400 sec (1 day), std = 43200? That gives ratio of 20. Hmm that seems inconsistent.

Maybe I want to assign more consistent values: Since the sample provided uses one example, but not necessarily applicable to all steps. Let me try a systematic approach:
I can assume each immediate step has an average time and standard deviation that reflect the nature of the process:
- Supplier Selection (SS): This activity might be very quick because it's just selection from existing suppliers. So I'll assign: ('SS','OP'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 sec.
- Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC): Ordering components might take longer due to processing and shipping. I can set: ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec (1 day), std = 43200? Wait that ratio is 24 again if I use similar numbers, but then standard deviation becomes 86400/ ? The sample provided had ratio of average/stdev = 86400/3600 = 24. So maybe I want to maintain a consistent pattern: If an immediate transition has a long average time like 1 day, then the std might be around 1 hour (which is 1/24th of 1 day). But for a shorter process like SS->OP which is only one hour average, then standard deviation might be half that? I can choose different ratios. 
Maybe I'll do:
- ('SS','OP'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 (ratio 2:1).
- ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec, std = 3600 sec (ratio 24:1). That is very low variability relative to the mean.
- ('RC','QI'): average might be moderate, say avg = 14400 sec (4 hours), std = 7200 sec (2 hours) ratio 2:1 again.
- ('QI','CA'): Quality inspection to Component Assembly. Inspection can take variable time if it's detailed, so maybe avg = 36000 sec (10 hours?), std=18000 sec? Ratio ~2:1.
- ('CA','PT'): Component assembly might be quick relative to testing? But product testing might take a while but quality control may vary. I'll set avg = 28800 sec (8 hours), std = 14400 sec, ratio = 2:1 again.
- ('PT','PK'): Product Testing to Packaging. Perhaps product testing is standardized so maybe avg = 7200 sec (2 hours), std=3600 sec, ratio = 2:1.
- ('PK','WS'): Packaging to Warehouse Storage may be quick. I'll set avg = 3600 sec (1 hour), std=1800 sec, ratio = 2:1.
- ('WS','DT'): Warehouse Storage to Distribution might have delays in logistics. Perhaps avg = 86400 sec (1 day), std=43200? That gives a ratio of 24 again.
- ('DT','AS'): After distribution, after-sales support may be immediate contact but sometimes delays occur. I'll set maybe avg = 3600 sec (1 hour) and std=1800 sec.

But then the ratios are not consistent across transitions: Some are 2:1, some are 24:1. That might reflect different degrees of variability in process steps. But this is arbitrary estimation.

Alternatively, I can decide to assign one ratio uniformly for immediate pairs, but that doesn't capture the fact that some delays have high variability relative to their average times and others don't. The sample given did not mention ratios though. It just said "For example: {('A', 'B'): (86400, 3600)}" which is a day and one hour standard deviation.

I want to produce plausible numbers for the global supply chain process:
- Supplier Selection might be quick with low variability.
- Order Placement to Receive Components might have more variability due to external factors (shipping delays). So I can set that pair to average 86400 sec, std = 3600 seconds, which is exactly like the sample example. Then immediate pairs that are short maybe should have lower averages:
   ('SS','OP'): 1 hour avg, std=30 min.
- Quality inspection might be fairly standard but still variable: I'll set ('RC', 'QI') to average = maybe 7200 sec (2 hours) with std = 3600 sec? That gives a ratio of 2.
   But then I already used 86400 for one pair, which is 24:1. So there's inconsistency.

Maybe I want to have different magnitudes for each immediate pair that reflect the nature of these steps in a global supply chain:
- SS->OP: fast decision making (maybe 0.5 hour avg, 15 minutes std) i.e., (1800,900).
- OP->RC: ordering takes longer, maybe average 48 hours (172800 sec), and variability might be around 12 hours (43200 sec)? Ratio of 4.
- RC->QI: receiving components then inspection; maybe on-site quality control is done relatively quickly if automated. Let's say avg = 2 hours (7200 sec) with std=3600 sec, ratio ~2.
- QI->CA: after quality inspection, component assembly starts; this might require some setup time and could be variable due to different conditions. Maybe avg = 6 hours (21600 sec) with std=4320 sec? Ratio roughly 5?
- CA->PT: product testing might have moderate variability; let's say avg = 4 hours (14400 sec) with std=3600 sec, ratio 4.
- PT->PK: packaging is usually standardized but can vary due to logistic delays; maybe avg = 2 hours (7200 sec), std=1800 sec, ratio 4.
- PK->WS: storing the product might be quick; say avg = 1 hour (3600 sec) with std=900 sec, ratio 4.
- WS->DT: distribution from warehouse to retailer can have delays. Let's say avg = 24 hours (86400 sec) with std=43200 sec? That gives a ratio of 2 if I use that, but then it might be too high compared to others; maybe instead choose avg = 12 hours (43200 sec) with std=7200 sec, ratio = 6.
- DT->AS: After distribution, after-sales support might be initiated quickly once product reaches customers; say avg = 1 hour (3600 sec), std=1800 sec.

I need to pick consistent ones. But the sample dictionary they gave uses seconds in terms of day and hour. They used one pair with average time as 86400 (1 day) and standard deviation as 3600 (1 hour). That ratio is exactly 24:1, which seems like a specific chosen example.

Maybe I'll stick to using that example pattern for some pairs:
- For pairs with longer delays, use (average, std) = (86400, 3600) i.e., (1 day, 1 hour).
For pairs with shorter durations, maybe reduce by factor. But then there's inconsistency in ratios.

I can decide: For immediate transitions that are "fast" steps, use ratio of average/std = 2; for those that are "slow", use ratio of 24. But then which ones are fast and which are slow? Let's consider the process:
- SS->OP: Likely a relatively quick decision, so I'll assign (3600, 1800).
- OP->RC: Order placement to receiving components could involve shipping lead times, so maybe it's slower. I'll assign (86400, 3600) which is 1 day and 1 hour.
- RC->QI: Quality inspection might be performed quickly if automated; maybe assign a moderate speed, perhaps (7200, 3600). That ratio is 2 again (like SS->OP).
- QI->CA: After quality inspection, assembly begins. I think this might take some time to set up production lines? But product testing might come later. However, since we already assigned slower step for OP->RC and WS->DT, maybe also assign a slow one for assembly transitions if necessary.
But the process is high-tech electronics, so assembly might be done quickly by robots or it could be manual?
I can decide: I'll assign (36000, 18000) for ('QI', 'CA') i.e., 10 hours and std of 5.55 hours? Actually that ratio gives 2 as well if we want consistent ratio.
Maybe I want a mix.

Let's try to assign:
('SS','OP'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 sec (ratio=2)
('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec, std = 3600 sec (ratio=24) [slow shipping]
('RC','QI'): avg = 7200 sec, std = 3600 sec (ratio=2) [inspection quick]
('QI','CA'): avg = 14400 sec, std = 7200 sec (ratio=2) [assembly starts fairly soon]
('CA','PT'): avg = 28800 sec, std = 14400 sec (ratio=2) [component assembly to product testing might be a bit more complex so longer time but similar ratio]
('PT','PK'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 sec (ratio=2) [packaging is quick]
('PK','WS'): avg = 7200 sec, std = 3600 sec (ratio=2)
('WS','DT'): avg = 86400 sec, std = 3600 sec (slow distribution step maybe?)
('DT','AS'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 sec (quick after-sales support)

But then I haven't used any non-adjacent pairs. For non-immediate pairs, the average is cumulative. But they might not be simply additive if we assume independence. However for estimation purposes, I could set:
For a pair (A, B) that are separated by k immediate steps, average time might be k * (average of one immediate step between A and B)? But then standard deviation might be computed as sqrt(sum of variances). But since these values are different depending on which steps they cover, we must add them up accordingly.

I need to determine the sequence indices:
We have activities with positions: 
1: SS
2: OP
3: RC
4: QI
5: CA
6: PT
7: PK
8: WS
9: DT
10: AS

For any pair (A_i, A_j) where i < j, the observed time difference is sum_{k=i}^{j-1} of immediate delay from activity k to k+1? But then standard deviation would be sqrt(sum_{k=i}^{j-1}(std^2)) if independent. 

But maybe I'll assume that each pair's temporal profile is not simply the additive one, but it's estimated independently. The prompt doesn't require me to derive them mathematically; rather, I need to produce a dictionary with estimated values for each pair.

I can choose to assign arbitrary numbers for non-adjacent pairs that are plausible based on their "span" in the process. For instance:
('SS','QI'): This covers transitions SS->OP and OP->RC? Actually, wait check: SS->QI would cover activities from index 1 (SS) to index 4 (QI). That means it includes two immediate pairs if we consider only adjacent pairs? Actually the ordering is: SS -> OP (immediate), then OP-> RC (immediate), then RC-> QI (immediate)? But wait, check the process: The order is SS,OP,RC,QI,... So 'SS','QI' means activities at positions 1 and 4. The immediate pairs that occur between them in a trace are:
Between SS and OP, and then OP and RC, and then RC and QI? But wait, if we have the trace <SS, OP, RC, QI> then the pairs considered are: (SS,OP), (SS,RC), (SS,QI), (OP,RC), (OP,QI), (RC,QI). So for 'SS','QI' in a trace with these four activities, it spans two immediate transitions if they were adjacent? Actually wait, let me recalc: In the process order given by positions 1 to 10:
- For pair ('SS', 'QI'): SS is position 1, QI is position 4. So the intermediate steps are: from SS to OP (position2), then from OP to RC (pos3) and then from RC to QI (pos4)? Actually, careful: If I want to get the time difference between SS and QI, it's not necessarily the sum of immediate transitions because in a trace, if activities appear non-consecutively, the temporal profile is defined for each pair as observed. But we have to assume that the delays are independent and additive. So if we assume independence, then average for ('SS','QI') = (avg(SS->OP) + avg(OP->RC) + avg(RC->QI)). 
We already set:
('SS','OP'): 3600
('OP','RC'): 86400
('RC','QI'): 7200
So sum = 3600+86400+7200 = 97200 sec. And the standard deviation, if independent, would be sqrt(1800^2 + 3600^2 + 3600^2) = sqrt(3240000 + 12960000 + 12960000) = sqrt(291,00000?) Let's do calculation:
- For ('SS','OP'): std=1800
- ('OP','RC'): std=3600
- ('RC','QI'): std=7200 (if I set that as earlier)

Wait check: I said for ('RC','QI') ratio 2, so average = 7200 and std=3600. So yes.

So variance sum = 1800^2 + 3600^2 + 3600^2.
1800^2 = 3,240,000; 3600^2 = 12,960,000 each, so total variance = 3240000 + 12960000 + 12960000 = 291, 3240000+25920000? Let's recalc: Actually sum=3240000 + 12960000 = 16200000, plus another 12960000 gives 29160000. Square root of that is sqrt(29160000) which is around 5400 seconds (since 5400^2=29160000 exactly). So then std for ('SS','QI') would be about 5400 sec.

But wait, my immediate pairs I set earlier were:
('SS','OP'): (3600,1800)
('OP','RC'): (86400, 3600) but that ratio is huge.
('RC','QI'): (7200, 3600)

Maybe it's more consistent to have similar ratios for all immediate pairs. The sample given in the prompt used a pair with average=86400 and std=3600 which has ratio of 24:1. But then I set others with ratio 2:1.

I might want to assign each immediate step a number that reflects its typical duration based on my interpretation of the process steps:

Process analysis:
- Supplier Selection (SS): This involves evaluating suppliers. It could be done quickly if data is readily available, or it can take some time if decision criteria are complex. But in a global supply chain for high-tech electronics, there might be automated supplier selection systems that quickly evaluate suppliers based on past performance and cost metrics. So I'll set ('SS','OP'): avg = 1800 sec (30 minutes), std=900 sec (15 min). Ratio ~2.
- Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC): This step likely involves order processing, lead times from the supplier, shipping arrangements, etc. That can be quite variable and might take a couple of days on average. Let me set ('OP','RC'): avg = 172800 sec (48 hours), std=43200 sec (12 hours). Ratio ~4.
- Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI): Once components arrive, quality inspection is performed. This could be done relatively quickly if automated, but might vary with the volume and type of components. I'll set ('RC','QI'): avg = 7200 sec (2 hours), std=3600 sec (1 hour). Ratio ~2.
- Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA): After inspection, assembly is scheduled. This might require some preparation time and coordination. I'll set ('QI','CA'): avg = 14400 sec (4 hours), std=7200 sec (2 hours). Ratio ~2.
- Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT): Assembly of components into a sub-unit may take variable times depending on complexity, but let's assume it takes about 6 hours average. I'll set ('CA','PT'): avg = 21600 sec (6 hours), std=10800 sec (3 hours). Ratio ~2.
- Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK): Once the product is tested and approved, packaging might be done quickly if standardized. Let's say avg = 7200 sec (2 hours), std=3600 sec (1 hour). Ratio ~2.
- Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS): After packaging, storing in the warehouse may not take long but could involve handling logistics. I'll set ('PK','WS'): avg = 3600 sec (1 hour), std=1800 sec (30 minutes). Ratio ~2.
- Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT): Getting product out for distribution might be subject to scheduling and transportation delays. Let's assume avg = 86400 sec (24 hours, 1 day), std=43200 sec (12 hours). Ratio ~2 as well, but if I want it to match the sample ratio? Actually sample used (86400,3600) which is different ratio. But I'll maintain consistency with my other values: Ratio of 2 for fast steps and maybe a higher ratio for slower ones.
- Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS): This may be immediate once product shipped, but might also involve some delay in support initiation. I'll set ('DT','AS'): avg = 3600 sec (1 hour), std=1800 sec (30 minutes).

Now let me check consistency: Some pairs are slower and have a high average time relative to their standard deviation, while others are quicker.

We see that for OP->RC, ratio is 48 hours / 12 hours = 4.
For WS->DT, ratio might also be similar if I choose avg=86400 sec (24h) and std=43200 sec (12h), which would give ratio 2? Actually 86400/43200=2. So it's not consistent with others.

Maybe I want to assign each immediate pair a ratio that reflects its inherent variability:
- SS->OP: quick decision, low variability; ratio = maybe 2.
- OP->RC: more variable due to external supplier lead times; ratio = maybe 4 (as chosen).
- RC->QI: moderate variability; ratio=2.
- QI->CA: could be moderately variable; ratio=2.
- CA->PT: similar; ratio=2.
- PT->PK: similar; ratio=2.
- PK->WS: similar; ratio=2.
- WS->DT: distribution can be unpredictable; maybe ratio = 4 (like order placement) because shipping delays might vary more.
- DT->AS: quick, so ratio=2.

I need to decide on the averages and standard deviations:
Let me choose average times that are plausible in seconds:

For SS->OP: avg = 1800 sec, std = 900 sec. 
For OP->RC: avg = 172800 sec (48 hours) seems high though. But maybe order processing in a global supply chain can take days? It could be 2-3 days average. Let me consider that again: Global supply chain for high-tech electronics might involve just-in-time manufacturing, so delays are minimized. But then the sample given was 1 day delay for one pair, which is 86400 sec. That suggests maybe we want to use similar orders of magnitude as in the example.

Maybe I should calibrate:
- SS->OP: quick decision process, maybe on average 30 minutes.
- OP->RC: ordering might take a day or two depending on supplier responsiveness; let's assume average of 1 day (86400 sec) with std = 43200? But then ratio becomes 2. That is simpler.

I'll try to be consistent with the sample provided:
Maybe I want all immediate pairs to have similar magnitude, e.g., around 1 day for slower ones and maybe a fraction of that for faster ones.
Alternatively, I can decide that many steps are standardized with an average time of about one day (86400 sec) and std = 3600 sec. But then SS->OP would be too long if it's only 30 minutes on average.

I want to capture the variation in delays due to different process segments:
- Supplier Selection and Order Placement: decision making, likely quick.
- Ordering components: might involve global logistics, so can be longer and more variable.
- Quality Inspection, Component Assembly, Product Testing, Packaging: these are manufacturing steps that may have shorter durations but also some variability.
- Distribution from warehouse to retailers: could also be slower due to transportation issues.
- After-sales support is likely initiated quickly once product shipped.

I can assign:
('SS','OP'): avg = 1800 sec (30 min), std = 900 sec (15 min)
('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec (24 hours, one day), std = 43200 sec? But that gives ratio 2. That would be a huge variability though: standard deviation equals half the average. But maybe it's plausible for global supply chain where shipping times can vary widely.
Alternatively, I might set ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400, std = 3600 (like sample), but then SS->OP ratio becomes inconsistent.

Let me try to make them consistent in terms of magnitude relative to each other:
Maybe all immediate pairs should have a similar order-of-magnitude average time. But then process steps like ordering components might not be as quick as quality inspection if manufacturing is highly automated. 
I think I'll assume:
- For fast decisions: SS->OP and DT->AS, PK->WS maybe are the fastest (average 1 hour) with std = 30 minutes.
- For mid-level tasks: RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK might be around 2 hours average? That doesn't add up if we want them to sum up in non-immediate pairs though.

Maybe I should assign them consistently:
Given it's a global supply chain process for high-tech electronics, the overall cycle time could be on the order of days. The sample provided (86400,3600) is 1 day average with 1 hour deviation, which is used as an example. I can use that pattern for most pairs.

Maybe I'll set:
- SS->OP: since supplier selection might be done quickly, but maybe it still takes some time to evaluate suppliers? But then in a global supply chain, it could be automated and quick - say average = 3600 sec (1 hour) with std = 1800 sec.
- OP->RC: ordering components can be delayed by shipping; so set avg = 86400 sec (1 day), std = 3600 sec (1 hour). That gives ratio of 24 again, as in sample. But then for SS->OP I get ratio=2. The disparity might reflect the fact that one is a decision process and the other involves logistics.
- RC->QI: receiving components and quality inspection may not be as time-consuming; say avg = 7200 sec (2 hours), std = 3600 sec (1 hour). Ratio=2.
- QI->CA: after quality inspection, assembly can start quickly; maybe set avg = 14400 sec (4 hours), std = 7200 sec? That ratio=2 again. But then the differences among immediate transitions are inconsistent if some have ratio 24 and others have ratio 2.
Maybe I'll standardize to one ratio: For all immediate pairs, I'll use average time and standard deviation that reflect the process's nature consistently. But then how do we incorporate variability? The sample provided used (86400,3600) which is a huge gap between average and std, meaning very little relative variation compared to the mean.

I can decide: Let’s assume all immediate pairs have an average of about 1 day and standard deviation of 1 hour except for those that are supposed to be quick. But then SS->OP might not be 1 day if it's a decision process.
Perhaps I'll assign:
- ('SS', 'OP'): avg = 3600 (1 hour), std = 1800 (30 min). Ratio=2.
- ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 (1 day), std = 43200? That would be ratio 24 if I set it as in sample. But then maybe I want to maintain the same ratio for all pairs: For slow processes, use ratio=24; for quick ones, use ratio=2.
- ('RC','QI'): avg = 7200 (2 hours), std = 3600 sec? Ratio=2 if average=7200 and std=3600 then ratio=2 as well. But that gives a standard deviation equal to the average divided by 2. 
- ('QI','CA'): I can set avg = 14400 (4 hours), std = 7200, ratio=2.
- ('CA','PT'): avg = 28800 (8 hours), std = 14400, ratio=2.
- ('PT','PK'): avg = 3600 (1 hour), std = 1800, ratio=2.
- ('PK','WS'): avg = 7200 (2 hours), std = 3600, ratio=2.
- ('WS','DT'): avg = 86400 (1 day), std = 43200? Ratio becomes 24 if I use the same as OP->RC. But maybe that is plausible because distribution can be delayed by logistics.
- ('DT','AS'): avg = 3600 (1 hour), std = 1800, ratio=2.

Now let's check: Some pairs have ratio 2 and some have ratio 24. It seems inconsistent but it might reflect the variability inherent in different process segments:
- The ordering step (OP->RC) and distribution step (WS->DT) are more variable relative to their average time.
- Other steps like quality inspection, assembly transitions, packaging, etc., are relatively consistent with a low coefficient of variation.

Now for non-immediate pairs, I'll assume they are cumulative sums. But I can either compute them or assign plausible estimates manually.

Let's try computing cumulative ones if we assume independence and add means and square-root sum of variances.
For immediate pairs:
I have values:
SS->OP: (3600, 1800)
OP->RC: (86400, 43200) ? Wait I said ratio for OP->RC is like sample? But then sample ratio was 86400/3600=24. I want to maintain that for OP->RC if it's slow step.
But then QI->CA I set as (14400,7200) which is ratio 2.

Maybe let me assign clearly:
Immediate pairs:
1. ('SS', 'OP'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 sec. Ratio = 2.
2. ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec, std = 43200? But that gives ratio 20, not exactly 24 if I want to be consistent with sample: sample had (86400, 3600). Let me check: If I use (86400, 3600) then ratio=24. So I'll set ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400, std = 3600.
3. ('RC','QI'): avg = 7200 sec, std = 3600? That gives ratio=2.
4. ('QI','CA'): avg = 14400, std = 7200, ratio=2.
5. ('CA','PT'): avg = 28800, std = 14400, ratio=2.
6. ('PT','PK'): avg = 3600, std = 1800, ratio=2.
7. ('PK','WS'): avg = 7200, std = 3600, ratio=2.
8. ('WS','DT'): avg = 86400, std = 3600, ratio=24.
9. ('DT','AS'): avg = 3600, std = 1800, ratio=2.

That gives a mix: For steps that are logistics related (OP->RC and WS->DT) we use high average but low standard deviation relative to the average? Actually, check ratios:
- For SS->OP: 3600/1800 = 2.
- For OP->RC: 86400/3600 = 24. 
- For RC->QI: 7200/3600 = 2.
- For QI->CA: 14400/7200 = 2.
- For CA->PT: 28800/14400 = 2.
- For PT->PK: 3600/1800 = 2.
- For PK->WS: 7200/3600 = 2.
- For WS->DT: 86400/3600 = 24.
- For DT->AS: 3600/1800 = 2.

So steps with ratio=24 are the ones that are more variable relative to their average time? Actually, a higher ratio means lower variability. Because if average is high and standard deviation is low, then coefficient of variation (std/mean) is low. So ratio=24 means std/mean = 3600/86400 = 1/24 which is about 4.17%. For the steps with ratio=2, std/mean = 1800/3600 = 0.5 or 50% coefficient of variation. That makes sense: logistics processes (OP->RC and WS->DT) are more predictable, while decision-making or quality inspection processes might be less predictable.

That seems plausible.

Now non-immediate pairs can be computed as sum of means and sqrt(sum of variances). Let's compute each:

For ('SS','QI'): This covers immediate transitions from SS to OP, OP to RC, and RC to QI.
- Mean = 3600 + 86400 + 7200 = 97200 sec.
- Variance: (1800^2) + (3600^2) + (3600^2) 
= 1800^2 = 3,240,000; 3600^2 = 12,960,000 each; sum = 3240000 + 12960000 + 12960000 = 29160000.
- Std = sqrt(29160000) = 5400 sec (because 5400^2=29160000 exactly).
So ('SS','QI') should be (97200, 5400).

For ('OP', 'PT'): This covers transitions from OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, and CA->PT.
- Mean = 86400 + 7200 + 14400 + 28800 = 86400+7200=93600; plus 14400 gives 108000; plus 28800 equals 136800 sec.
Wait recalc: 86400 + 7200 = 93600, then +14400 = 108000, then +28800 = 136800.
- Variance: For OP->RC variance = 3600^2 = 12960000; RC->QI = 3600^2 = 12960000; QI->CA = 7200^2 = 51840000? Wait, check: 7200^2 should be 51,840,000 but let's compute exactly: 7200 * 7200 = 51,840,000? Actually 72*72=5184 so times 10000 gives 51840000 yes.
- CA->PT variance = 14400^2 = 207360000 (since 14400*14400 = 207360000).
Sum variances = 12960000 + 12960000 + 51840000 + 207360000 = Let's sum: 12960000+12960000=25920000, then add 51840000 gives 77760000, then plus 207360000 equals 285120000.
Std = sqrt(285120000). sqrt(285120000) approximate? sqrt(285120000)  16896. Let me compute: 16900^2=285610000, so roughly 16890 maybe. I'll set it to about 16900 sec (approx 4 hours 55 minutes)? Actually 16900/3600 = ~4.7 hours.
I want a round number. Maybe I can round to nearest hundred: sqrt(285120000) exactly? Let's do: sqrt(285120000)=16896. But maybe I'll use 17000 sec as an approximation. But let me check: The ratio might be not important; we just need an estimate.
I want consistency with other numbers maybe using the same pattern as immediate ones (ratio of mean to std should roughly follow similar patterns? Not necessarily though.)
Maybe I can set ('OP','PT') = (136800, 16900) approx.

For ('RC', 'WS'): This covers transitions from RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, and PK->WS.
- Mean = 7200 + 14400 + 28800 + 3600 + 7200 = Let's sum: 7200+14400=21600; plus 28800=50400; plus 3600=54000; plus 7200=61200 sec.
- Variance: 
RC->QI variance = (3600)^2? Wait, check immediate pair RC->QI: (7200,3600) so std=3600, variance=12960000.
QI->CA: (14400,7200), variance = 7200^2 = 51840000.
CA->PT: (28800,14400), variance = 207360000.
PT->PK: (3600,1800), variance = 3240000.
PK->WS: (7200,3600), variance = 12960000.
Sum variances = 12960000 + 51840000 + 207360000 + 3240000 + 12960000 = let's sum step by step:
12960000+51840000=64800000, plus 207360000=272160000, plus 3240000=275400000, plus 12960000=288360000.
Std = sqrt(288360000) which is about 16977 sec (since 17000^2=289000000). I'll round to 17000 sec maybe.

So ('RC','WS') = (61200, 17000).

For ('CA', 'PK'): This covers transitions from CA->PT and PT->PK.
- Mean = 28800 + 3600 = 32400 sec.
- Variance: CA->PT variance=207360000? Wait check: For CA->PT I set (28800,14400) so std=14400, variance=207360000; PT->PK variance= (3600,1800): variance=3240000. Sum = 207360000+3240000 = 210600000.
Std = sqrt(210600000). sqrt(210600000)= about 14510 sec? Let's compute approximate: 14500^2=210250000, so roughly 14500.
So ('CA','PK') = (32400, 14500).

For ('QI', 'WS'): This covers transitions from QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS.
- Mean = 14400 + 28800 + 3600 + 7200 = Let's sum: 14400+28800=43200; plus 3600=46800; plus 7200=54000 sec.
- Variance: QI->CA variance = 51840000 (std 7200 squared), CA->PT variance = 207360000, PT->PK variance = 3240000, PK->WS variance = 12960000. Sum = 51840000+207360000=259200000; plus 3240000=262440000; plus 12960000=275400000.
Std = sqrt(275400000) which is about 16590 sec (similar to previous one, roughly 16600 maybe).
So ('QI','WS') = (54000, 16600).

For ('OP', 'AS'): This covers transitions from OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT, DT->AS.
- Mean = sum of immediate means: 
OP->RC=86400, RC->QI=7200, QI->CA=14400, CA->PT=28800, PT->PK=3600, PK->WS=7200, WS->DT=86400, DT->AS=3600.
Let's sum:
86400 + 7200 =93600; +14400 =108000; +28800 =136800; +3600 =140400; +7200 =147600; +86400 =234000; +3600 =237600 sec.
- Variance: 
OP->RC variance = (3600^2) = 12960000,
RC->QI variance = 3600^2 = 12960000,
QI->CA variance = 7200^2 = 51840000,
CA->PT variance = 14400^2 =207360000,
PT->PK variance = 1800^2? Wait check: PT->PK (3600,1800) so variance=3240000,
PK->WS variance = 3600^2=12960000,
WS->DT variance = 3600^2=12960000,
DT->AS variance = 1800^2=3240000.
Sum variances:
12960000 + 12960000 =25920000;
+51840000 =77760000;
+207360000 =285120000;
+3240000 =288360000;
+12960000 =301320000;
+12960000 =314160000;
+3240000 =317400000.
Std = sqrt(317400000) ~ 17820 sec (since 17820^2=317400000? Let's check: 17820^2, approximately yes).
So ('OP','AS') = (237600, 17800).

For ('SS', 'AS'): This covers all transitions from SS to AS.
Mean = sum of immediate means for pairs from index 1 to 9:
SS->OP=3600,
OP->RC=86400,
RC->QI=7200,
QI->CA=14400,
CA->PT=28800,
PT->PK=3600,
PK->WS=7200,
WS->DT=86400,
DT->AS=3600.
Let's sum these:
3600 + 86400 =90000; +7200 =97200; +14400 =111600; +28800 =140400; +3600 =144000; +7200 =151200; +86400 =237600; +3600 =241200 sec.
- Variance: Sum of variances for all immediate pairs:
SS->OP variance = 1800^2 =3240000,
OP->RC variance = (3600)^2 =12960000,
RC->QI variance = 3600^2 =12960000,
QI->CA variance = 7200^2 =51840000,
CA->PT variance =14400^2 =207360000,
PT->PK variance =1800^2=3240000,
PK->WS variance =3600^2=12960000,
WS->DT variance =3600^2=12960000,
DT->AS variance =1800^2=3240000.
Sum variances: 3240000+12960000 =16200000; +12960000=29160000; +51840000=81000000? Wait recalc step by step:
- 3240000
- 12960000 -> total =16200000
- next add another 12960000 gives 29160000,
- then add 51840000 gives 81000000? Let's do: 29160000+51840000=81000000 exactly.
- then add 207360000 gives 288360000,
- then add 3240000 gives 291600000,
- then add 12960000 gives 304560000,
- then add another 12960000 gives 317520000,
- then add final 3240000 gives 320760000.
Std = sqrt(320760000)  17920 sec (approx). 
Let me compute: sqrt(320760000)= 17920? Because 17920^2=321, but I'll approximate to 17900 sec maybe.

I can decide rounding:
('SS','AS') = (241200, 17900).

Now, note that these cumulative calculations assume independence and add variances linearly. It's an estimation though.

Now I have computed estimates for non-adjacent pairs: 
('SS', 'QI') = (97200, 5400)
('OP','PT') = (136800, sqrt(285120000)  16900)
('RC','WS') = (61200, 17000)
('CA','PK') = (32400, 14500)
('QI','WS') = (54000, 16600)
('OP','AS') = (237600, 17800)
('SS','AS') = (241200, 17900)

Also I have the immediate pairs: 
('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800)
('OP','RC'): (86400, 3600)
('RC','QI'): (7200, 3600)
('QI','CA'): (14400, 7200)
('CA','PT'): (28800, 14400)
('PT','PK'): (3600, 1800)
('PK','WS'): (7200, 3600)
('WS','DT'): (86400, 3600)
('DT','AS'): (3600, 1800)

I want to also include some other non-immediate pairs maybe like ('SS', 'DT')? But we already have ('OP','AS') and ('SS','AS'). Possibly I'll include ('SS','DT') but that might be redundant because ('OP','AS') covers a longer range. But the prompt says "consider pairs of activities that eventually follow each other", so any pair is allowed.

I can also include:
('SS','RC'): That spans from SS->OP and OP->RC.
Mean = 3600 + 86400 =90000 sec, variance = (1800^2 + 3600^2) = 3240000+12960000=16200000, std = sqrt(16200000)=4024.9 ~ 4000 sec? Actually sqrt(16200000)=4024.9378 sec approximately.
So ('SS','RC') = (90000, 4025) approx.

('OP', 'QI'): That spans OP->RC and RC->QI.
Mean = 86400+7200=93600 sec, variance = 3600^2 + 3600^2 =12960000+12960000=25920000, std = sqrt(25920000)=5099.02 ~5100 sec.
So ('OP','QI') = (93600, 5100).

('RC', 'CA'): That spans RC->QI and QI->CA.
Mean = 7200+14400=21600 sec, variance = 3600^2 + 7200^2 =12960000+51840000=64800000, std = sqrt(64800000)=8049.937? Actually sqrt(64800000) is about 8050 sec.
So ('RC','CA') = (21600, 8050).

('DT', 'AS') we already have immediate pair, so not needed.

I might include these additional ones:
- ('SS','RC')
- ('OP','QI')
- ('RC','CA')

Also maybe ('WS','AS'): That spans WS->DT and DT->AS.
Mean = 86400+3600=90000 sec? Wait recalc: WS->DT = 86400, DT->AS = 3600, so sum = 90000. 
Variance = (3600^2)+(1800^2)=12960000+3240000=16200000, std = sqrt(16200000) 4025 sec.
So ('WS','AS') = (90000, 4025).

Also maybe ('PT', 'DT'): That spans PT->PK and PK->WS and WS->DT? Wait careful: For pair ('PT', 'DT'), we need to consider the immediate transitions from PT to DT. The trace order: PT is at position 6, DT is at position 9.
So it includes: PT->PK (position 7), then PK->WS (8) and WS->DT (9). 
Mean = 3600 + 7200 + 86400 = 97200 sec? Let's recalc: 3600+7200=10800, plus 86400=97200.
Variance = variance(PT->PK)+variance(PK->WS)+variance(WS->DT) = (1800^2)+(3600^2)+(3600^2)=3240000+12960000+12960000 =29160000, std = sqrt(29160000)=5400 sec.
So ('PT','DT') = (97200, 5400).

I might not include too many additional non-adjacent pairs because dictionary is supposed to be a representative subset. I already have immediate ones and then some selected non-immediate pairs.

Let me list the keys I'll include in final dictionary:

Immediate pairs (9 of them):
1. ('SS', 'OP')
2. ('OP','RC')
3. ('RC','QI')
4. ('QI','CA')
5. ('CA','PT')
6. ('PT','PK')
7. ('PK','WS')
8. ('WS','DT')
9. ('DT','AS')

Non-adjacent pairs (maybe 10 additional ones):
10. ('SS', 'RC')
11. ('OP','QI')
12. ('RC','CA')
13. ('QI','WS')
14. ('DT','AS') is immediate already, so skip that.
15. ('OP','PT')
16. ('RC','WS')
17. ('CA','PK')
18. ('SS','QI')
19. ('OP','AS')
20. ('SS','AS')

Maybe I have too many duplicates: Actually some pairs are repeated: For instance, we already included immediate ones for positions (like SS->RC) appears as non-adjacent? Actually no, immediate ones are only consecutive.
We want to include all pairs with indices i and j where i < j. But we don't need to list them all if it's too many. The prompt says "a representative subset", so I can choose a selection that covers different spans.

I already have:
Immediate pairs: 
('SS','OP'), ('OP','RC'), ('RC','QI'), ('QI','CA'), ('CA','PT'), ('PT','PK'), ('PK','WS'), ('WS','DT'), ('DT','AS').

Non-adjacent pairs that I computed with cumulative sums:
('SS', 'QI'): from SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI
Mean=97200, std=5400.
('OP','PT'): from OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT. Mean=136800, std  16900.
('RC','WS'): from RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS. Mean=61200, std  17000.
('QI','WS'): from QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS. Mean=54000, std 16600.
('DT','AS') is immediate, skip.
('OP','AS'): from OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT, DT->AS. Mean=237600, std 17800.
('SS','AS'): from all transitions: Mean=241200, std 17900.

Then additional ones:
('SS', 'RC') = (90000, 4025) approx.
('OP','QI') = (93600, 5100).
('RC','CA') = (21600, 8050).

Maybe also ('WS','AS') = (86400+3600? Wait recalc: WS->DT is immediate from position 8 to 9; then DT->AS is immediate from position 10. So yes: ('WS','AS'): mean = 86400 + 3600 = 90000, std= sqrt(3600^2+1800^2)=4025.
('PT', 'DT') we computed = (97200,5400) but that's same as ('SS','QI')? Wait check: ('PT','DT') means from PT at pos6 to DT at pos9. That includes transitions PT->PK (pos7), PK->WS (pos8), WS->DT (pos9). And we computed that earlier for ('PT', 'DT'): mean=3600+7200+86400=97200, std=sqrt(3240000+12960000+12960000)=5400. That equals the same as ('SS','QI')? But no, let's check: ('SS','QI') spans SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI which is 3 steps, but here it's PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT which is also 3 steps. And interestingly the sums are different because the averages of these three transitions might differ.
For PT->PK: (3600,1800), for PK->WS: (7200,3600), and for WS->DT: (86400,3600). Sum mean = 3600+7200+86400=97200; variance sum = 3240000 + 12960000 + 12960000 =29160000, std=sqrt(29160000)=5400. So ('PT','DT') equals (97200,5400) same as ('SS','QI'). That might be coincidental because the immediate pairs we used for positions 1-3 and for positions 6-9 are different though:
For SS->OP: (3600,1800), OP->RC: (86400,3600), RC->QI: (7200,3600) sum =97200.
For PT->PK: (3600,1800), PK->WS: (7200,3600), WS->DT: (86400,3600) sum =97200.
So they are identical in terms of cumulative average and std? That seems plausible if the immediate pairs have same values for corresponding positions. But we set different values for some steps:
Actually check immediate pair assignments:
('SS','OP') = 3600,
('OP','RC') = 86400,
('RC','QI') = 7200.
For ('PT','PK')=3600, ('PK','WS')=7200, ('WS','DT')=86400.
They are the same set, just in different order. So yes, they are identical cumulative sums.

Also ('CA', 'PK'): that spans from CA->PT and PT->PK:
Mean = 28800+3600=32400, variance = (14400^2)+(1800^2) wait careful: For CA->PT we set std=14400, so variance=207360000, for PT->PK: (3600,1800) variance=3240000. Sum = 207360000+3240000=210600000, sqrt gives about 14510 sec.
I computed that earlier.

We already have ('CA','PK') above.

I think I'll include the following pairs in final dictionary:
Immediate ones (9 keys):
('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800)
('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 3600)
('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 3600)
('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200)
('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 14400)
('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800)
('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600)
('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 3600)
('DT', 'AS'): (3600, 1800)

Non-adjacent ones:
('SS', 'RC'): (90000, sqrt(3240000+12960000) = sqrt(16200000)=4025 approx) I'll use (90000, 4025).
('OP', 'QI'): (93600, 5100) approx.
('RC','CA'): (21600, sqrt(3600^2+7200^2) but careful: immediate RC->QI std is 3600 and QI->CA std is 7200. So variance = 12960000 + 51840000 =64800000, std=8050 approx.)
('SS', 'QI'): (97200, sqrt(3240000+12960000+12960000)=sqrt(29160000)=5400) so (97200, 5400).
('PT','DT'): (97200, 5400) as computed.
('CA','PK'): (32400, 14510 approx, I'll round to 14500 maybe)
('QI','WS'): (54000, sqrt(51840000+207360000+3240000+12960000)=sqrt(275400000) 16600) so (54000, 16600).
('OP', 'PT'): (136800, sqrt(12960000+12960000+51840000+207360000)=sqrt(285120000) approx 16900) I'll use (136800, 16900).
('RC','WS'): (61200, 17000) as computed.
('OP', 'AS'): (237600, sqrt(12960000+12960000+51840000+207360000+3240000+12960000+12960000+3240000)=sqrt(317400000) approx 17820?) Let me recalc: I computed earlier as (237600, 17800), I'll use (237600, 17800).
('SS', 'AS'): (241200, sqrt(sum variances for all immediate pairs)= sqrt(320760000)=17920, but I approximated to maybe 17900) so (241200, 17900).

Maybe that's enough. But note: We have duplicates? Let me check:
I have ('PT','DT') and ('SS','QI') are both (97200,5400). They are actually the same cumulative sum from three transitions: For SS->OP->RC->QI and PT->PK->WS->DT. They might be coincidental because I set them with same numbers.
But that's fine.

I must ensure each key is unique. Keys:
- ('SS','OP')
- ('OP','RC')
- ('RC','QI')
- ('QI','CA')
- ('CA','PT')
- ('PT','PK')
- ('PK','WS')
- ('WS','DT')
- ('DT','AS')

Non-adjacent ones:
- ('SS', 'RC')
- ('OP', 'QI')
- ('RC','CA')
- ('SS','QI')
- ('PT','DT') [but note, ('PT','DT') is the same as ('SS','QI')? Actually no, careful: 'SS','QI' spans indices 1 to 4; 'PT','DT' spans indices 6 to 9. They could be similar if we set them identical intentionally.]
- ('CA', 'PK')
- ('QI','WS')
- ('OP','PT')
- ('RC','WS')
- ('OP','AS')
- ('SS','AS')

That makes 9 + 10 = 19 keys total.

This dictionary might be too large, but the prompt said "a representative subset", so I can choose maybe 15 keys if it's easier to read. But "complexity" is desired by considering pairs separated by multiple steps. Perhaps a moderate number like 12-14 keys is enough.

I want to produce something that looks neat and not too huge. Possibly I'll include:
Immediate ones: all 9.
Non-immediate ones, choose: 
('SS', 'RC')
('OP','QI')
('RC','CA')
('SS','QI')   (this one is interesting because it spans supplier selection to quality inspection)
('PT','DT')   (spanning product testing to distribution, which is three steps from PT->PK->WS->DT)
('QI','WS')   (quality inspection to warehouse storage, spanning QI->CA->PT->PK->WS, 4 steps)
('OP','AS')   (order placement to after-sales support, spanning almost all steps)
('SS','AS')   (spanning the whole process)

That gives total keys = 9 + 7 = 16. That might be a bit more than necessary.

Alternatively, I can include fewer immediate ones if needed, but instructions "representative subset" suggests enough to capture variety.
I can choose the following dictionary keys (16 in total):

1. ('SS', 'OP')
2. ('OP','RC')
3. ('RC','QI')
4. ('QI','CA')
5. ('CA','PT')
6. ('PT','PK')
7. ('PK','WS')
8. ('WS','DT')
9. ('DT','AS')

Non-immediate:
10. ('SS', 'RC')
11. ('OP', 'QI')
12. ('RC', 'CA')
13. ('SS', 'QI')  [spanning SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI]
14. ('PT','DT')   [spanning PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT] but note this is the same as ('SS','QI')? Actually they are computed from different segments; I'll include it for variety.
15. ('QI', 'WS')
16. ('OP', 'AS')
17. ('SS', 'AS')

That would be 17 keys.

Maybe I'll reduce a bit: Instead of including both ('PT','DT') and ('SS','QI') if they are identical in value, I can include one of them only once.
Let's check the computed ones:
('SS','QI') = (97200, 5400).
('PT','DT') = (97200, 5400) as well. So they are identical, so I don't need to include both if I want a representative subset. I'll drop one of them.

So final keys will be:
Immediate ones: 
1. ('SS', 'OP')
2. ('OP','RC')
3. ('RC','QI')
4. ('QI','CA')
5. ('CA','PT')
6. ('PT','PK')
7. ('PK','WS')
8. ('WS','DT')
9. ('DT','AS')

Non-immediate ones:
10. ('SS', 'RC')
11. ('OP', 'QI')
12. ('RC', 'CA')
13. ('SS', 'QI')  [spanning SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI]
14. ('QI', 'WS')
15. ('OP', 'AS')
16. ('SS', 'AS')

That gives total of 9 + 7 = 16 keys.

Now I'll present the dictionary with these keys and values as computed above:

Let's list them neatly with our assigned estimated average times in seconds and standard deviations (rounded to nearest integer maybe):

Immediate ones:
('SS','OP'): (3600, 1800)
('OP','RC'): (86400, 3600) [1 day avg]
('RC','QI'): (7200, 3600)
('QI','CA'): (14400, 7200)
('CA','PT'): (28800, 14400)
('PT','PK'): (3600, 1800)
('PK','WS'): (7200, 3600)
('WS','DT'): (86400, 3600) 
('DT','AS'): (3600, 1800)

Non-immediate:
('SS', 'RC') = mean = 3600 + 86400 = 90000 sec, std = sqrt(3240000+12960000)= sqrt(16200000)= 4025 sec approx. I'll round maybe to nearest hundred: (90000, 4025). Maybe use 4000 or 4050? Let's recalc exactly:
1800^2 = 3,240,000; 3600^2 = 12,960,000; sum=16,200,000; sqrt(16,200,000) = 4024.9378  4025 sec.
I'll write (90000, 4025).

('OP', 'QI') = mean = 86400 + 7200 = 93600 sec, std = sqrt(3600^2+3600^2)= sqrt(12960000+12960000)= sqrt(25920000)=5099.02 5100 sec.
So ('OP','QI') = (93600, 5100).

('RC', 'CA') = mean = 7200 + 14400 = 21600 sec, std = sqrt(3600^2+7200^2)= sqrt(12960000+51840000)= sqrt(64800000)=8050. approx.
So ('RC','CA') = (21600, 8050).

('SS', 'QI') = mean = 3600 + 86400 + 7200 = 97200 sec, std = sqrt(1800^2+3600^2+3600^2)= sqrt(3240000+12960000+12960000)= sqrt(29160000)=5400 sec.
So ('SS','QI') = (97200, 5400).

('QI', 'WS') = mean = 14400 + 28800 + 3600 + 7200 = let's sum: 14400+28800=43200; plus 3600=46800; plus 7200=54000 sec.
Std = sqrt(7200^2 + 14400^2 + 1800^2? Let's recalc properly:
Immediate pairs used: ('QI','CA') = (14400,7200) so variance = 51840000;
('CA','PT') = (28800,14400) so variance =207360000;
('PT','PK') = (3600,1800) so variance=3240000;
('PK','WS') = (7200,3600) so variance=12960000.
Sum variances = 51840000 +207360000+3240000+12960000 = 51840000+207360000 =259200000; then plus 3240000 =262440000; plus 12960000 =275400000.
Std = sqrt(275400000)=16600 sec approximately (since 16600^2=275560000, close enough). I'll use (54000, 16600).

('OP', 'AS') = mean = sum of means from OP->RC, RC->QI, QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS, WS->DT, DT->AS.
That is: 86400 + 7200 +14400+28800+3600+7200+86400+3600 = let's sum:
86400+7200=93600; +14400=108000; +28800=136800; +3600=140400; +7200=147600; +86400=234000; +3600=237600 sec.
Std = sqrt( (3600^2)+(3600^2)+(7200^2)+(14400^2)+(1800^2)+(3600^2)+(3600^2)+(1800^2) ).
Let's compute each:
For OP->RC: 3600^2=12960000.
RC->QI: 3600^2=12960000.
QI->CA: 7200^2=51840000.
CA->PT:14400^2=207360000.
PT->PK:1800^2=3240000.
PK->WS:3600^2=12960000.
WS->DT:3600^2=12960000.
DT->AS:1800^2=3240000.
Sum = 12960000+12960000=25920000; +51840000=77760000; +207360000=285120000; +3240000=288360000; +12960000=301320000; +12960000=314160000; +3240000=317400000.
Std = sqrt(317400000)=17820 sec approx. I'll round to 17800 sec maybe.
So ('OP','AS') = (237600, 17800).

('SS', 'AS') = mean = sum of means from all immediate pairs:
=3600+86400+7200+14400+28800+3600+7200+86400+3600. Sum: 3600+86400=90000; +7200=97200; +14400=111600; +28800=140400; +3600=144000; +7200=151200; +86400=237600; +3600=241200 sec.
Std = sqrt( sum of variances for all immediate pairs).
We computed that as approx 320760000, std  sqrt(320760000)=17920 sec approx. I'll round to 17900.
So ('SS','AS') = (241200, 17900).

Now I have 16 keys.

I might want to check if any non-immediate pair is redundant with an immediate one: They are distinct pairs because the indices differ by more than 1 in some cases. That's fine.

Let me list final dictionary keys and values:

Key: ('SS','OP') => (3600, 1800)
('OP','RC') => (86400, 3600)
('RC','QI') => (7200, 3600)
('QI','CA') => (14400, 7200)
('CA','PT') => (28800, 14400)
('PT','PK') => (3600, 1800)
('PK','WS') => (7200, 3600)
('WS','DT') => (86400, 3600)
('DT','AS') => (3600, 1800)

Non-adjacent:
('SS', 'RC') => (90000, 4025)   [approx]
('OP', 'QI') => (93600, 5100)
('RC', 'CA') => (21600, 8050)
('SS', 'QI') => (97200, 5400)
('QI','WS') => (54000, 16600)
('OP', 'AS') => (237600, 17800)
('SS', 'AS') => (241200, 17900)

That's a representative subset.

I'll now produce the Python dictionary in code block. I will output a Python dictionary literal with these keys and values. They are tuples of integers representing seconds.

I'll format it nicely:

temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800),
    ('OP', 'RC'): (86400, 3600),
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 3600),
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 7200),
    ('CA', 'PT'): (28800, 14400),
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),
    ('PK', 'WS'): (7200, 3600),
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 3600),
    ('DT', 'AS'): (3600, 1800),
    
    ('SS', 'RC'): (90000, 4025),
    ('OP', 'QI'): (93600, 5100),
    ('RC', 'CA'): (21600, 8050),
    ('SS', 'QI'): (97200, 5400),
    ('QI','WS'): (54000, 16600),
    ('OP','AS'): (237600, 17800),
    ('SS','AS'): (241200, 17900)
}

That is the answer.

I can add a comment that these numbers are estimated in seconds and represent average time differences between activities in the supply chain process. The dictionary keys are tuples of activity labels and the values are (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds.

I need to check consistency: For ('WS', 'DT') I used (86400, 3600). And for ('OP','RC') also same pattern as that one. That might be a bit inconsistent with our earlier discussion that ordering components (OP->RC) is slow and predictable, but then WS->DT is distribution which might also be slow.

Alternatively, maybe I want to adjust them: The sample given in the prompt used (86400, 3600) for a pair, so it's acceptable to use that pattern.
Maybe I'll assume:
- ('SS','OP'): quick decision (1 hour avg).
- ('OP','RC'): ordering components (1 day avg).
- ('RC','QI'): quality inspection (2 hours avg).
- ('QI','CA'): component assembly (4 hours avg).
- ('CA','PT'): product testing (8 hours avg).
- ('PT','PK'): packaging (1 hour avg).
- ('PK','WS'): warehouse storage (2 hours avg).
- ('WS','DT'): distribution (1 day avg) maybe.
- ('DT','AS'): after-sales support (1 hour avg).

And then for non-immediate pairs, I compute cumulative sums accordingly. That is what I have done.

I worry about the consistency: For instance, ('CA','PT') is 8 hours vs 'QI','CA' is 4 hours and 'PT','PK' is 1 hour. So they sum to 8+? Let's check:
Actually, the immediate pairs in order are:
SS->OP = 3600 sec (1h)
OP->RC = 86400 sec (24h) - this seems a big jump relative to SS->OP.
RC->QI = 7200 sec (2h)
QI->CA = 14400 sec (4h)
CA->PT = 28800 sec (8h)
PT->PK = 3600 sec (1h)
PK->WS = 7200 sec (2h)
WS->DT = 86400 sec (24h)
DT->AS = 3600 sec (1h)

That ordering means the total process time from SS to AS is: 3600 + 86400 + 7200 +14400+28800+3600+7200+86400+3600 = 241200 seconds, which is about 67 hours? Let's compute: 241200/3600  67 hours or 2.8 days. That might be plausible for a global supply chain process.

The non-immediate pairs then have cumulative sums accordingly:
('SS','RC') = 3600 + 86400 = 90000 sec (25 hours approx)
('OP','QI') = 86400+7200=93600 sec (~26 hours)
('RC','CA') = 7200+14400=21600 sec (6 hours)
('SS','QI') = 3600+86400+7200 = 97200 sec (27 hours)
('PT','DT') we computed would be (3600+7200+86400) = 97200 sec, same as ('SS','QI') but I'll not include duplicate.
('QI','WS') = 14400+28800+3600+7200=54000 sec (15 hours)
('OP','AS') = sum from OP to AS = 86400+7200+14400+28800+3600+7200+86400+3600 = 237600 sec (~66 hours?) Let's re-check: Actually, check order: Activities indices:
SS=1, OP=2, RC=3, QI=4, CA=5, PT=6, PK=7, WS=8, DT=9, AS=10.
For ('OP','AS'): from index 2 to index 10. Sum of immediate means for indices: (for OP->RC) = 86400, (RC->QI)=7200, (QI->CA)=14400, (CA->PT)=28800, (PT->PK)=3600, (PK->WS)=7200, (WS->DT)=86400, (DT->AS)=3600. Sum=86400+7200=93600; +14400=108000; +28800=136800; +3600=140400; +7200=147600; +86400=234000; +3600=237600 sec. That is 6.59 days? Actually, 237600/86400 2.75 days.
('SS','AS') = sum of all immediate means from index1 to 9: we computed as 241200 sec (~67 hours).

That seems plausible.

I might round some numbers to nice multiples maybe:
- For ('CA', 'PT'): (28800,14400) is fine (8h, std=4h).
- ('WS','DT') = (86400,3600) which is 24h and 1h.
Maybe I want all standard deviations to be round numbers like ending in 000 maybe? But then we lose the variety.

I might adjust: Instead of using 1800 for some pairs, maybe use 1800 always for quick ones and 3600 for longer ones. Let's check our immediate ones:
We have two types: "quick" steps with mean = 3600 (1h) and std=1800 (30 min), ratio=2.
Then "long" steps with mean = 86400 (24h) and std=3600 (1h), ratio=24.
And intermediate ones: For ('RC','QI') we set as quick type? But it's 7200, which is 2 hours. But then we used same standard deviation as quick type (1800)? That gives a ratio of 4 if I do that? Actually, 7200/3600 = 2, not 4.
Wait check: 7200 sec average, std=3600 means ratio=7200/3600 = 2. So it's consistent with the quick ones.

For ('QI','CA'): we set (14400,7200) ratio=2; for ('CA','PT') we set (28800,14400), ratio=2.
So basically all immediate pairs except 'OP->RC' and 'WS->DT' are of type "quick" with 1h or multiple hours? But then why is one pair's average time different if they are both type quick? They are not all the same; I want to reflect that some steps inherently take longer. The prompt said "Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt", so it's fine.

I think my assignment is acceptable, even if not perfectly consistent.

Let me reassign a bit for clarity:
Maybe I'll assign types: 
Type A (decision/assembly) steps with average ~1h or 2h:
- ('SS','OP'): (3600,1800)
- ('RC','QI'): (7200,3600)? Wait that gives ratio = 2.
- ('PT','PK'): (3600,1800)

Type B (manufacturing) steps with average ~4-8 hours:
- ('QI','CA'): (14400,7200)
- ('CA','PT'): (28800,14400)

Type C (logistics) steps with average 24h:
- ('OP','RC'): (86400,3600) 
- ('WS','DT'): (86400,3600)

And then packaging and after-sales support are quick again:
- ('PK','WS'): (7200,3600)? Actually I set that as type A but average=2h. But it should be similar to PT->PK which is 1h? Let me decide: Packaging might be standardized so maybe ('PK','WS') = (3600,1800) for consistency with quick ones. But then my sum in total process time changes. I'll try to maintain the order as originally computed:
Maybe I'll revise the immediate pairs consistently:

I want a consistent narrative:
- Supplier Selection and Order Placement are decision processes: average 1 hour.
- Ordering components is logistics, so average 24 hours (1 day).
- Quality Inspection is relatively quick but necessary: maybe average 2 hours.
- Component Assembly takes longer due to setup: maybe 4 hours.
- Product Testing takes time: perhaps 8 hours.
- Packaging might be done quickly: 1 hour.
- Warehouse Storage could take a bit: say 2 hours.
- Distribution is logistics: 24 hours (1 day).
- After-sales Support is quick: 1 hour.

So then immediate pairs become:
('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800)
('OP','RC'): (86400, 3600)   [logistics, more predictable]
('RC','QI'): (7200, 3600)    [inspection, quick but variable? ratio=2 means std is half the mean so 50% CV]
('QI','CA'): (14400, 7200)
('CA','PT'): (28800, 14400)
('PT','PK'): (3600, 1800)
('PK','WS'): (7200, 3600)   [maybe packaging to storage: quick process but maybe takes 2 hours]
('WS','DT'): (86400, 3600)  [distribution logistics]
('DT','AS'): (3600, 1800)

This is what I had originally. So it's fine.

Now check non-immediate pairs using these values:
- ('SS', 'RC') = sum of SS->OP and OP->RC: = 3600+86400=90000 sec, std = sqrt(1800^2 + 3600^2) = sqrt(3240000+12960000)=sqrt(16200000)=4024.9378  4025.
- ('OP','QI') = sum of OP->RC and RC->QI: =86400+7200=93600, std = sqrt(3600^2+3600^2) = sqrt(12960000+12960000)=sqrt(25920000)=5099.02 5100.
- ('RC','CA') = sum of RC->QI and QI->CA: =7200+14400=21600, std = sqrt(3600^2+7200^2) = sqrt(12960000+51840000)=sqrt(64800000)=8050.
- ('SS','QI') = sum of SS->OP, OP->RC, RC->QI: =3600+86400+7200=97200, std = sqrt(1800^2+3600^2+3600^2) = sqrt(3240000+12960000+12960000)=sqrt(29160000)=5400.
- ('QI','WS') = sum of QI->CA, CA->PT, PT->PK, PK->WS: =14400+28800+3600+7200=54000, std = sqrt(7200^2 + 14400^2 + 1800^2? Let's recalc properly:
   Actually, immediate pairs used for that span are:
     ('QI','CA') = (14400,7200)
     ('CA','PT') = (28800,14400)
     ('PT','PK') = (3600,1800)
     ('PK','WS') = (7200,3600)
   Variance sum = 7200^2 + 14400^2 + 1800^2? Wait I need to be careful: Actually, for each immediate pair, the standard deviation is given, so variance = std^2.
   For ('QI','CA'): var=7200^2 = 51840000.
   For ('CA','PT'): var=14400^2 =207360000.
   For ('PT','PK'): var=1800^2 =3240000.
   For ('PK','WS'): var=3600^2 =12960000.
   Sum variance = 51840000 +207360000+3240000+12960000 = 51840000+207360000 =259200000; plus 3240000 =262440000; plus 12960000 =275400000. Std = sqrt(275400000)=16600 (approx).
- ('OP','AS') = sum from OP to AS: that's indices 2 to 10, which includes:
   ('OP','RC')=(86400,3600)
   ('RC','QI')=(7200,3600)
   ('QI','CA')=(14400,7200)
   ('CA','PT')=(28800,14400)
   ('PT','PK')=(3600,1800)
   ('PK','WS')=(7200,3600)
   ('WS','DT')=(86400,3600)
   ('DT','AS')=(3600,1800)
   Sum mean = 86400+7200+14400+28800+3600+7200+86400+3600 = let's sum carefully:
     86400 + 7200 =93600
     +14400 =108000
     +28800 =136800
     +3600 =140400
     +7200 =147600
     +86400 =234000
     +3600 =237600 sec.
   Sum variance = 3600^2 (for OP->RC) which is 12960000,
                 + 3600^2 for RC->QI =12960000,
                 + 7200^2 for QI->CA =51840000,
                 +14400^2 for CA->PT =207360000,
                 +1800^2 for PT->PK =3240000,
                 +3600^2 for PK->WS =12960000,
                 +3600^2 for WS->DT =12960000,
                 +1800^2 for DT->AS =3240000.
   Sum variance = 12960000+12960000=25920000; +51840000=77760000; +207360000=285120000; +3240000=288360000; +12960000=301320000; +12960000=314160000; +3240000=317400000.
   Std = sqrt(317400000)=17820 sec approx, I'll round to 17800.
- ('SS','AS') = sum of all immediate pairs from SS to AS (indices 1 to 10 excluding last? Actually from index1 to 9 because there are 9 transitions): Already computed as mean=241200 and std  sqrt(320760000)=17920 sec approx, I'll round to 17900.

So final dictionary with my chosen values:

temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800),
    ('OP','RC'): (86400, 3600),
    ('RC','QI'): (7200, 3600),
    ('QI','CA'): (14400, 7200),
    ('CA','PT'): (28800, 14400),
    ('PT','PK'): (3600, 1800),
    ('PK','WS'): (7200, 3600),
    ('WS','DT'): (86400, 3600),
    ('DT','AS'): (3600, 1800),

    ('SS', 'RC'): (90000, 4025),
    ('OP', 'QI'): (93600, 5100),
    ('RC', 'CA'): (21600, 8050),
    ('SS', 'QI'): (97200, 5400),
    ('QI','WS'): (54000, 16600),
    ('OP','AS'): (237600, 17800),
    ('SS','AS'): (241200, 17900)
}

I can include a comment that these estimates are in seconds.

This should be my final answer. I'll output it in plain text with Python dictionary code block.

I'll now produce the final answer accordingly.</think>Below is one possible answer. In this example we assume that each “immediate” (consecutive) transition has been estimated based on its inherent nature in a global supplychain process. For instance, supplier selection and order placement tend to be quick decision–making steps while ordering components or distributing finished products involve longer, more predictable lead times. (All durations are given in seconds.) One possible Python dictionary is:

------------------------------------------------
# “Quick” steps (e.g. internal decisions) are estimated with a 1hour average:
quick_mean = 3600   # 1 hour
quick_std  = 1800   # 30 minutes

# “Logistics” or external coordination steps tend to take about one day,
# but because those processes are highly standardized, the variability is lower.
logistic_mean = 86400  # 24 hours (1 day)
logistic_std  = 3600   # 1 hour

# Other manufacturingrelated transitions might have moderate durations.
inspection_mean = 7200  # 2 hours
assembly_mean   = 14400 # 4 hours
testing_mean    = 28800 # 8 hours
packaging_mean  = 7200  # 2 hours

# (For simplicity the standard deviations for these “manufacturing” steps are chosen as half their average.)
inspection_std  = 3600  # 50% of inspection time
assembly_std    = 7200
testing_std     = 14400
packaging_std   = 3600

# A representative temporal profile dictionary is then built by assigning each immediate pair a tuple:
temporal_profile = {
    # Immediate (consecutive) pairs:
    ('SS', 'OP'): (quick_mean, quick_std),               # Supplier Selection  Order Placement

    ('QI','CA'): (assembly_mean, assembly_std),             # Quality Inspection  Component Assembly

A few comments:
• In this design the “quick” steps (e.g. internal decisions) are modeled with a mean of about one hour and a standard deviation of 30 minutes.
• Steps such as ordering components or distribution have been set to last about one day on average but with a lower relative variability.
• For nonadjacent pairs the average delay is taken as the sum of the immediate means while (assuming independence) the overall uncertainty is computed via a square–root–of–sum–of–variances.

This dictionary is only one representative example. In practice, the exact numbers would be estimated from real event log data and might differ in magnitude or variability across process segments.
