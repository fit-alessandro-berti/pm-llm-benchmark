We need to produce a BPMN-like textual process model based on interview excerpts. The task: "Using the information from the interviews, generate a BPMN-like process diagram description (in textual form) that captures: Activities/Tasks, Sequence Flow, Gateways/Decision Points, Roles/Participants, Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs, Exceptions/Variations." Also "Consolidate conflicting accounts by indicating uncertainty where necessary." The output must be a well-structured textual representation that can be used to draw a BPMN diagram.

We need to incorporate all details: start: Invoice receipt. Steps: check PO, if no PO then request from supplier, else log invoice. Then forward to purchasing for confirmation. Then match invoice line items to PO. If matches, send to manager for approval. If discrepancy, email purchasing for clarification; escalate to supervisor if unresolved. Manager approval triggers after confirmation and match; they get notification. Manager approves/rejects. If reject/investigate, maybe escalate to supervisor or back to purchasing. Then after manager approval, schedule for payment (payment run). Also other roles: Supplier Relationship Manager is looped in for missing PO, pricing discrepancy, contract terms. She helps resolve issues.

We need to capture loops, escalations. Need to have decisions: check PO existence (yes/no). Decision: matched? Yes -> manager approval; no -> clarify/dispute. Decision: manager approves? Yes -> schedule payment; no -> investigate or reject.

We also have alternative path: If missing PO, send back to supplier (request details). This could be considered an exception: request PO from supplier, then re-enter. Or if discrepancy cannot be resolved easily, escalate to supervisor. Also supplier may be contacted via Supplier Relationship Manager. We need to include that.

We need to represent roles: Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary), Purchasing Officer (Dan), Department Manager (Carlos), Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita), Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen). Also system (accounting system) maybe as automated tasks.

Artifacts: Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), email notifications, confirmation email, system notifications, payment schedule.

We need to produce a textual BPMN-like description: maybe something like:

**Process:** Invoice Approval Process

**Start Event:** Invoice Received (by email)

**End Event:** Payment Scheduled

**Flow:**

1. Receive Invoice (AP Clerk). Input: Invoice (email). Output: Logged Invoice in System.

2. Check PO Existence (Decision Gateway). If PO missing  Task "Request PO from Supplier". If PO present  Proceed.

2a. Request PO from Supplier (AP Clerk contacts Supplier). Output: Supplier provides PO or revised invoice.

2b. After receiving PO, loop back to step 1 (Log Invoice again?) Possibly we can define as "Re-evaluate".

3. Log Invoice in Accounting System (AP Clerk). Output: Logged Invoice record.

4. Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Goods Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk  Purchasing). Output: Confirmation request.

5. Purchasing Officer (Dan) Reviews PO and Invoice. Decision: Does invoice match PO? If match  Send Confirmation (Task "Confirm Receipt of Goods"). If mismatch  Request clarification or correction.

5a. If mismatch, email AP clerk (or purchasing) to clarify. If unresolved, escalate to Supervisor (Rita).

6. After confirmation (from Purchasing), AP Clerk matches Invoice Line Items to PO (Task "Match Invoice to PO"). Decision: Match? If yes  proceed to Manager Approval. If no  Resolve Discrepancy (including contacting Supplier Relationship Manager or escalation to Rita). After resolution, loop back to "Match Invoice to PO".

7. Send to Department Manager for Approval (Task). Manager receives notification. Decision: Approve? If yes  proceed to schedule payment. If no  Investigate (maybe request further info or reject). Rejection loops to resolution.

8. After Manager approval, AP Clerk schedules invoice for payment (Task "Schedule Payment"). Then End.

Also includes roles for Supplier Relationship Manager: in case of missing PO or pricing discrepancy, she is involved to contact supplier and verify contract terms. So there can be a "Resolve Discrepancy with Supplier" task where either AP clerk or Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager may be engaged.

Also includes escalation to Supervisor Rita for unresolved discrepancies.

We need to include data objects: Invoice, PO, Confirmation email, Approval record, Payment schedule.

We can represent sequence flow as list of steps with numbering and decision gateways.

Now produce output.

We also need to note any ambiguous or conflicting accounts: Mary says "If there’s a discrepancy—like incorrect pricing or missing items—I email the purchasing team to clarify. Sometimes, if the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, I have to escalate it to my supervisor." Dan says "If something’s off... we either contact the supplier directly or ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice...". So there is some variation: sometimes Purchasing contacts supplier directly; sometimes AP clerk contacts. We can note that as ambiguous.

Also "If PO number missing, I tell Mary she needs to get that information before I can proceed." So that's also a path.

Also "Sometimes, if the PO number is missing, I tell Mary she needs to get that information before I can proceed." That's at Purchasing side. So we need to incorporate that.

Also the manager's approval triggered after both receipt and match: "system sends an automatic email". That's an automated task.

Now produce a textual BPMN model with sections: Process Summary, Roles, Artifacts, Activities (with sequence), Gateways (decision points), Exceptions/Variations.

Probably better to present as bullet list with arrow "->" indicating flow.

We could also present as a table: Step ID, Activity, Role, Input, Output.

Will do that.

Will also provide a diagram description like: "Start -> Receive Invoice -> Check PO -> (Gateway: PO Exists?) -> Yes: Log Invoice -> Forward to Purchasing -> Purchasing Confirm -> (Gateway: Invoice matches PO?) -> Yes: Match Invoice -> Manager Approval -> (Gateway: Manager Approved?) -> Yes: Schedule Payment -> End. No: Resolve Discrepancy / Escalate..."

We also incorporate the Supplier Relationship Manager.

Now produce final answer accordingly.

We'll note ambiguous steps: Variation in who contacts supplier, whether escalation to Rita is always used, possibly multiple loops.

Below is a **textual BPMNstyle description** of the InvoiceApproval process that can be directly “wired” into a BPMN editor (e.g., Visio, Bizagi, Camunda).  
The description follows the standard BPMN notation (Activities, Sequence Flows, Gateways, Data Objects, Participants) and also highlights the points where the interview data were ambiguous or could be interpreted in more than one way.

## 1. Process Overview  

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Process Name** | Invoice Approval (AP Workflow) |
| **Start Event** | Invoice received (by email) |
| **End Event** | Invoice scheduled for payment (payment run) |
| **Primary Owner** | Accounts Payable (AP) Department |
| **Other Participants** | Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager |
| **Key Data Objects** | Invoice, Purchase Order (PO), Confirmation Email, Approval Record, Payment Schedule |

## 2. Activities & Sequence Flow  

> **Notation** –`[Activity]` – performed by *Role* – *Input  Output*  

| Step ID | Activity (Task) | Role | Input | Output | Notes / Variants |
|---------|----------------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Receive Invoice** | AP Clerk (Mary) | Invoice (email) | Invoice (logged) | Start event. |
| **2** | **Check PO Existence** | AP Clerk | Invoice | Decision: POpresent? | **GatewayX1** – “PO Present?” |
| **2a** | **Request PO from Supplier** | AP Clerk  Supplier | Request for PO | Supplier provides PO / revised invoice | *Path when PO missing* – may involve Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen). |
| **2b** | **Reevaluate (loop back)** | AP Clerk | New/Revised PO | Return to Step1 (log invoice) | After PO received, go back to “Log Invoice”. |

| **5b** | **Escalate to AP Supervisor** | AP Clerk  AP Supervisor (Rita) | Unresolved discrepancy | Escalation case | *Exception* – used when discrepancy cannot be cleared easily. |
| **5c** | **Reloop to Step5** | – | Resolution result | Return to “Review PO vs. Invoice” | After correction, reevaluate match. |
| **6** | **Send Confirmation of Receipt** | Purchasing Officer (Dan) | Confirmed match | Confirmation email to AP | |
| **7** | **Match Invoice Line Items to PO** | AP Clerk | Invoice, PO, Confirmation | Match result | **GatewayX3** – “Lineitem match?” |
| **7a** | **Resolve Lineitem Discrepancy** | AP Clerk / Purchasing / Karen | Mismatch details | Corrected lineitems / PO amendment | May involve escalation to Rita (similar to Step5b). |
| **7b** | **Reloop to Step7** | – | Resolution result | Return to “Match Invoice Line Items” | |
| **8** | **Submit for Manager Approval** | AP Clerk (systemgenerated) | Invoice, PO, Confirmation, Match report | Approval request (email) | Automated email triggered by system. |
| **9** | **Manager Review** | Department Manager (Carlos) | Invoice package | Decision: “Approved?” | **GatewayX4** – “Manager Approves?” |
| **9a** | **Reject / Investigate** | Manager  AP Clerk | Rejection reason | Return to “Resolve Discrepancy” or “Request PO” | Rare (once every couple of months). |
| **9b** | **Approve** | Manager | Approval record | Approval confirmation | |
| **10** | **Schedule Payment** | AP Clerk | Approved invoice | Payment schedule entry | End event – “Invoice scheduled for payment”. |

## 3. Gateways (Decision Points)

| Gateway ID | Question / Condition | Outgoing Flows |
|---|---|---|
| **X1** | *Is a valid PO number present on the invoice?* | Yes  Step3 (Log Invoice) <br> No  Step2a (Request PO) |
| **X2** | *Does the invoice match the PO (quantity, price, charges)?* | Yes  Step6 (Send Confirmation) <br> No  Step5a (Resolve Discrepancy) |
| **X3** | *Do the invoice line items match the PO line items?* | Yes  Step8 (Submit for Approval) <br> No  Step7a (Resolve Lineitem Discrepancy) |
| **X4** | *Does the department manager approve the invoice?* | Yes  Step10 (Schedule Payment) <br> No  Step9a (Reject/Investigate) |

*All “No” paths loop back to a resolution activity (Steps5a/5b/7a/9a) and then reenter the appropriate gateway.*

---

## 4. Participants (Roles)  

| Role | Involvement |
|---|---|
| **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** | Receives, logs, forwards, matches, requests PO, escalates, schedules payment. |
| **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** | Confirms receipt of goods, compares invoice to PO, contacts supplier or AP for mismatches. |
| **Department Manager (Carlos)** | Final approval; reviews for budget / suspicious items. |
| **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** | Handles escalations when discrepancies cannot be resolved; creates retrospective POs if needed. |
| **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen)** | Consulted for missing PO numbers, pricing/contract discrepancies; facilitates supplier communication. |
| **Accounting System (automated)** | Generates notification emails, records invoice status, triggers manager approval request. |

---

## 5. Artifacts / Data Objects  

| Artifact | Description | Passed Between |
|---|---|---|
| **Invoice** (email) | Original vendor bill | Supplier  AP Clerk |
| **Purchase Order (PO)** | Internal order document | AP Clerk  Purchasing Officer |
| **Confirmation Email** | Purchasing’s receipt confirmation | Purchasing Officer  AP Clerk |
| **Match Report** | Systemgenerated comparison (lineitem) | AP Clerk  Manager (as part of approval package) |
| **Approval Record** | Manager’s signoff in system | Manager  AP Clerk |
| **Payment Schedule** | Entry in the AP payment run file | AP Clerk  Finance (postprocess) |

---

## 6. Exceptions / Variations  

| # | Exception / Variation | How it is Handled (in model) |
|---|---|---|
| **E1** | **Missing PO number** | GatewayX1  “No”  Step2a (Request PO). May involve Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager) to obtain PO. |
| **E2** | **InvoicePO mismatch (price, quantity, charges)** | GatewayX2  “No”  Step5a (Resolve Discrepancy). If unresolved  Step5b (Escalate to Rita). |
| **E3** | **Lineitem mismatch** | GatewayX3  “No”  Step7a (Resolve Lineitem Discrepancy). Can also loop in Karen for contract price verification. |
| **E4** | **Manager rejects or flags suspicious invoice** | GatewayX4  “No”  Step9a (Reject/Investigate). The invoice returns to AP/Purchasing for clarification, then reenters the flow at the appropriate gateway. |
| **E5** | **Informal / informal PO (services without PO)** | Handled by Rita (Step5b). She coordinates with department head to create a “retrospective PO” or decide to reject the invoice. |
| **E6** | **Supplier sends revised invoice** | After receipt of revised invoice, the process loops back to Step1 (Receive Invoice) – i.e., a new instance is logged. |
| **E7** | **Multiple escalations** (e.g., discrepancy not solved by Purchasing  AP Supervisor  Supplier Relationship Manager) | Represented by multiple “Resolve” loops that can reenter any of the three matching gateways (X2, X3). |

> **Note on Ambiguity:**  
> - *Who contacts the supplier when a mismatch is found?* Interviews suggest either Purchasing (Dan) or AP Clerk (Mary) may do it; in the model this is shown as a shared “Resolve Discrepancy” activity that can involve both AP and Purchasing, with Karen optionally looped in.  
> - *When does escalation to Rita occur?* Mary mentions “sometimes if the discrepancy can’t be resolved easily, I have to escalate it to my supervisor”. The model reflects this as a conditional escalation (Step5b) that can be triggered from any “Resolve Discrepancy” activity.

                                 No                
                                                    
(Resolve Lineitem Discrepancy)            (Submit for Manager Approval)
                                  Yes

                     (Reject/Investigate)  (Schedule Payment)  [End]
```

*The arrows with “No”/“Yes” denote the decision outcomes. The loops back to “Resolve …” activities reflect the iterative nature of exception handling.*

### How to use this description

1. **Create a BPMN diagram** using the above steps as “tasks”, the gateways as “exclusive (XOR) diamonds”, and the roles as “lanes”.  
2. **Map the data objects** to the diagram as “data objects” attached to the appropriate tasks (e.g., Invoice, PO).  
3. **Add the exception flows** as “sequence flows” that return to the appropriate gateway (X1X4) after resolution.  
4. **Validate** that each path leads from the start event to the end event (invoice scheduled for payment).  

This textual model captures the consensus view of the five interviewees while also flagging the points where the process may deviate or where responsibility is shared, providing a solid foundation for a BPMN implementation or for further processmining analysis.
