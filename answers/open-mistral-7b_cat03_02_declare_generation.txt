I can provide a basic example of how you might structure a DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay (P2P) process, but please note that the support and confidence values are placeholders and should be replaced with actual data collected from your process.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {'Purchase_Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'absence': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'exactly_one': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'init': {'Purchase_Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}},
    'responded_existence': {'Purchase_Order': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'coexistence': {'Purchase_Order': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'response': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'precedence': {'Invoice_Received': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'succession': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'altresponse': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'altprecedence': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'altsuccession': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'chainresponse': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'chainprecedence': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'chainsuccession': {'Goods_Receipt': {'Invoice_Received': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'noncoexistence': {'Purchase_Order': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'nonsuccession': {'Invoice_Received': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
    'nonchainsuccession': {'Invoice_Received': {'Goods_Receipt': {'support': 0.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}},
}
```

In this example, the process begins with a Purchase Order (Purchase_Order), followed by the Goods Receipt (Goods_Receipt). The Invoice is received after the Goods Receipt, and there is an exact one occurrence of the Invoice Received. The Purchase Order and Goods Receipt are coexistent and have a response relationship. The Invoice Received and Goods Receipt have a succession relationship. The Goods Receipt and Invoice Received also have alternate response, alternate precedence, alternate succession, chain response, chain precedence, and chain succession relationships. Additionally, the Purchase Order and Goods Receipt have a non-coexistence relationship, and the Invoice Received and Goods Receipt have a non-succession and non-chain succession relationship.
