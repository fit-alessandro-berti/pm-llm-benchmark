Okay, I need to create a Petri net for the insurance claim process described. Let me start by understanding all the steps and the conditions mentioned.

First, the process starts with the customer filing an Insurance Claim (C). Then the steps are CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL. But there are loops in DV leading to RDS if documents are incomplete, and FC leading to II multiple times if needed. The final state should be CL, so the final marking should have a token in the closure place.

Let me outline the main flow:

Start place -> CR -> DV -> FC -> CA -> AP -> P -> N -> CL.

But DV can loop back to RDS. So after DV, if there's a problem, they go back to RDS, then back to DV again. Similarly, after FC, if doubts, loop to II, which can be multiple times. So FC and II can loop multiple times.

So the Petri net needs to have transitions for each activity, with possible loops.

First, I need to model all the transitions. Let's list all the transitions:

- C: Customer files claim (but maybe that's part of the initial marking. Wait, the initial marking starts in a start place. Wait, the example code has a source place. So perhaps the initial step is a transition called C (Customer files claim) leading from a start place to CR. Or maybe the initial marking is in a start place, then transition C (label C) would be the first step.

Wait, the example code in the prompt starts with a source place and a sink. The initial marking is in source, then after transition execute_activity, it moves to sink. So in the scenario, the initial step would be a transition labeled "Insurance Claim (C)" which consumes a token from the start place and produces it into CR.

Wait, the scenario says the customer files the claim, which starts the process. So the initial marking should be a token in the start place, and the first transition is the customer filing the claim. But maybe in the Petri net, the start place is the initial state, then a transition labeled C (the customer's action) leads to CR. Then CR is followed by other steps.

Alternatively, maybe the start place is immediately followed by CR transition. But according to the scenario, the process starts with the customer filing C. So perhaps the start place is a place called "Claim Filed" or "Start", then the first transition is CR (Claim Registration). Wait, the customer files the claim (C), which is an action. So maybe the Petri net starts with a place called "Start", then transition C (Customer files claim) which leads to a place "Claim Registered" (so CR transition is the first step after C). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe the initial marking is in a start place (like 'start'), then the first transition is CR (label "Claim Registration"), which is triggered once the claim is filed. But since the customer's action is the start, perhaps that's the first transition. Let me model this.

Let me think step by step:

The process starts when the customer files a claim (C). Then the company starts processing. So perhaps the initial marking is a token in a place called 'start', then a transition 'C' (customer action) that leads to 'claim_registered' place. Then CR transition would take the token from 'claim_registered' and proceed. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the first transition is CR (Claim Registration), which represents the system logging the claim. Then the start place would have the token, then CR transition would take it, leading to a place that allows Document Verification. But how to model the customer's action of filing the claim? Maybe the initial marking is in a place called 'Claim Filed' (so the customer action is modeled as the initial state). Hmm, perhaps the exact modeling of the customer's action isn't necessary here. The problem says that the initial marking should place a token in a start place, representing a new claim arriving. So the start place is the first place. Then the first transition would be CR (Claim Registration), which is triggered once the claim is registered, leading to the next place.

Wait, in the example code, the initial marking has a token in 'source' place, and then the transition 'execute_activity' moves it to sink. So in the example, the transition is the activity. So in our case, each activity (CR, DV, etc.) are transitions with labels. So each activity is a transition. The start place has a token, and transitions are the steps.

So the flow would be:

Start place (with token)  CR (transition)  place after CR  DV (transition)  place after DV  FC (transition)  and so on.

But between DV and RDS, there's a loop. So after DV, there's a possibility to loop back. So how to model that?

For the Document Verification (DV) step:

After DV transition completes, the token goes to a place. Then, this place can have two outgoing transitions:

- One is the "normal" transition to proceed to FC.

- The other is RDS (Re-Document Submission) transition, which would loop back to DV.

Wait, but transitions are events. So perhaps after DV, there's a place. From that place, two transitions: one is "Continue to Fraud Check" (but maybe the label is DV's output, then FC is the next activity). Hmm, perhaps I need to model a choice here.

Wait, the scenario says: "if documents are incomplete after DV, then RDS occurs before continuing". So after DV, there's a check. If documents are okay, proceed to FC. If not, do RDS, then go back to DV.

So in Petri net terms, this would be a choice. So after DV, the token can go to a decision place. Then, two transitions:

- One transition labeled FC (but wait, FC is the Fraud Check activity. Hmm, perhaps the place after DV leads to a transition that represents the decision. But maybe in Petri nets, this is modeled with a place followed by two transitions, one for the loop and one to proceed.

Alternatively, using an XOR split: after DV, the token can go to either RDS or FC. Wait, but how to model that in a Petri net.

Wait, perhaps after the DV transition, the output place splits into two paths. One path is a transition called RDS (Re-Document Submission), leading back to the input place of DV. The other path goes to FC.

But in that case, how to model the choice. Since Petri nets are passive, the transitions fire when possible. So if both transitions are enabled, they can fire. But we need to model that only one can happen. However, in the scenario, it's a conditional choice. So perhaps to model this, we can have a place after DV, which has two outgoing arcs: one to a transition RDS (which loops back to DV's input place), and another to FC transition. However, since a token can't be split, this would require that either RDS or FC fires, but not both. But in a Petri net, if both transitions are enabled (i.e., the place after DV has a token), then only one of them can fire (non-deterministically). But in the scenario, sometimes RDS is needed, sometimes not. So perhaps the model should allow for the possibility of looping back to DV multiple times.

Wait, in the scenario, after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS happens before continuing. So each time after DV, there's a possibility to loop back. So the structure could be:

DV consumes a token from its input place (say, after CR), produces to a place 'after DV' (p_dv). Then, RDS transition takes from p_dv and puts back into the input place of DV (or perhaps another place that feeds into DV). Also, another transition (maybe FC) takes from p_dv to proceed.

Wait, but transitions can't have multiple arcs unless properly connected. Let's think:

Let's say:

Places:

- p_CR_out: after CR transition.

DV transition starts from p_CR_out.

After DV transition fires, it puts a token into p_DV_out.

Then, in p_DV_out, we have two outgoing transitions:

- RDS: which takes the token and sends it back to p_CR_out (or maybe to a different place that leads back to DV?)

Wait, that might not be correct. Because after RDS, you need to redo DV. So RDS would lead back to a place that allows DV to be done again.

So perhaps:

p_CR_out  DV  p_afterDV.

In p_afterDV:

- Transition FC leads to p_FC_out (proceeding to CA).

- Transition RDS leads back to a place p_RDS_out which connects back to p_CR_out (but that might not be correct). Wait, no: after RDS, the process should loop back to DV. So RDS transition should take the token from p_afterDV and put it into a place that leads to DV again.

Wait, perhaps:

p_afterDV  has two transitions: RDS and Continue to FC.

RDS transition would lead back to a place that leads back into DV's input.

Wait, let's model it as:

DV's output place is p_afterDV.

From p_afterDV:

- Transition RDS consumes from p_afterDV and produces to p_CR_out (input to DV), allowing another firing of DV.

- Transition FC_Choice (but FC is a transition) consumes from p_afterDV and produces to p_FC_in, which leads to FC.

So each time DV is fired, after processing, the token goes to p_afterDV. Then either RDS is done (loop back) or proceed to FC.

But how to model that after proceeding to FC, there's no loop back to DV again. So this setup would allow multiple RDS steps. For example:

DV  RDS  DV  FC.

Or DV  RDS  RDS  DV  FC.

But in the scenario, after RDS, you redo DV. So this structure would model that.

Similarly, for FC and II. After FC, if doubts, loop back via II. So FC's output place has transitions to II and to CA. Then II loops back to FC's input.

Let me outline:

After FC transition, we have a place p_afterFC. Then:

- Transition CA (Claim Assessment) consumes from p_afterFC and leads to p_CA_in.

- Transition II (In-depth Investigation) consumes from p_afterFC and leads back to p_FC_in (the input place of FC), allowing FC to be redone.

Wait, but FC needs to be done again. So after II, you need to redo FC.

So FC's input place is p_FC_in.

FC transition takes from p_FC_in  produces to p_afterFC.

Then, in p_afterFC:

- Transition CA leads to p_CA_in.

- Transition II takes from p_afterFC and produces to p_afterII.

Then p_afterII connects to a transition that leads back to p_FC_in. Wait, maybe II's output leads directly back to FC's input.

Wait:

II transition would take a token from p_afterFC and put it into p_FC_in. Then FC can fire again.

So:

FC transition: p_FC_in  FC  p_afterFC.

Then, p_afterFC  two transitions:

CA (transition CA takes p_afterFC to p_CA_in)

II transition: takes p_afterFC and returns to p_FC_in.

So in this way, after FC, you can choose to do II (loop back) or proceed to CA.

But in the scenario, the II can happen multiple times. So this setup allows FC  II  FC  II  FC, etc.

So each time FC is done after II.

Okay, this seems correct.

Now, putting all together:

First, create all the places, transitions, and arcs.

Let's outline the steps:

Start place (initial marking here)  transition CR (label "Claim Registration")  p_CR_out.

Wait, initial marking should be a start place, say 'start_place', with a token. Then transition CR consumes from 'start_place' and produces to p_CR_out.

Then p_CR_out  DV (Document Verification, label "Document Verification")  p_afterDV.

p_afterDV has two outgoing transitions:

- RDS (label "Re-Document Submission")  back to p_CR_out (so that DV can be done again).

Wait, no. Because RDS is a step that happens, then after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So after RDS transition fires, the token would go to a place that allows re-entering DV.

Wait, the RDS transition should take the token from p_afterDV and put it into a place that is the input to DV. So if DV's input is p_CR_out, then RDS would produce there.

But p_CR_out is the output of CR transition. So if CR transition has already fired once (but in our case, the first step is CR, so after CR fires, the token is in p_CR_out. Then DV fires, token moves to p_afterDV. Then RDS transition would take from p_afterDV and put back to p_CR_out, allowing DV to fire again.

Yes. So:

CR transition connects start_place  CR  p_CR_out.

DV transition connects p_CR_out  DV  p_afterDV.

In p_afterDV:

- RDS transition takes p_afterDV and leads back to p_CR_out.

- FC transition takes p_afterDV  p_afterDV_to_FC.

Wait, no. The FC transition would be the Fraud Check activity, which takes the token from p_afterDV and produces to p_FC_in.

Wait, maybe:

DV transition outputs to a place called p_postDV.

Then, from p_postDV:

- RDS transition consumes p_postDV and produces to p_CR_out.

- FC transition consumes p_postDV and produces to p_FC_in.

This way, after DV completes, the token is in p_postDV. Then, either RDS or FC can fire. If RDS fires, the token is removed from p_postDV and added to p_CR_out. Then DV can fire again. If FC fires, the token is removed from p_postDV and added to p_FC_in, allowing FC to proceed.

Ah, this is better. Because p_postDV can only have one token. So either RDS or FC can fire, not both. Once one fires, the token is consumed.

So the structure would be:

p_CR_out  DV  p_postDV.

p_postDV  RDS (arc from p_postDV to RDS, and arc from RDS to p_CR_out).

p_postDV  FC (arc from p_postDV to FC, arc from FC to p_FC_in).

Wait, FC transition would take p_postDV's token and put into p_FC_in. Then FC's transition is FC: p_CR_out  DV  p_postDV; then FC is after p_postDV.

Wait, no. Let's re-express:

DV transition consumes from p_CR_out and produces to p_postDV.

Then, FC transition must consume from p_postDV and produce to p_FC_out (or whatever). But then, after FC, we have the possibility of looping back via II.

Alternatively:

After DV, the token is in p_postDV. Then FC transition consumes that token and produces to p_FC_in.

Then, FC processing starts.

So FC transition has input p_postDV and output p_FC_out (or p_FC_in for next steps).

Similarly, after FC, there's the CA step.

But after FC, we have the possibility of looping back via II. So:

FC transition  p_FC_out.

Then, in p_FC_out, there's a transition CA (Claim Assessment), which takes token to p_CA_in.

Also, transition II (In-depth Investigation) takes token from p_FC_out and produces to p_II_out.

Then, p_II_out transitions back to p_FC_in (so that FC can be redone).

Wait, no. To loop back, after II, we need to go back to FC's input place, which would be p_postDV? Or p_FC's own input.

Wait, FC's input place is p_postDV. But if we loop back, then after II, we need to get back to FC's input.

So perhaps:

After FC fires, token is in p_FC_out.

Then, a transition CA takes from p_FC_out to p_CA_in.

Another transition II takes from p_FC_out to p_afterII.

Then p_afterII connects to a transition that loops back to FC's input place (p_postDV) or to a place that feeds FC again.

Wait, but in that case, after II fires, token is in p_afterII, then perhaps a transition would take it to a place that can fire FC again.

Alternatively, after II, the token is put back into FC's input place (p_postDV), so that FC can be re-fired.

But how:

FC transition consumes from p_postDV, produces to p_FC_out.

If II transition takes from p_FC_out and produces back to p_postDV, then FC can be done again.

Yes. So:

FC transition: p_postDV  FC  p_FC_out.

II transition consumes p_FC_out and produces to p_postDV.

Then, CA transition consumes p_FC_out and produces to p_CA_in.

So this way, after FC fires, token in p_FC_out can either go to CA (proceeding) or II (looping back).

But in this setup, if both CA and II are enabled, they are in conflict. So either CA or II can fire.

This models the scenario where if FC raises doubts, II is done multiple times.

Now, proceeding with the steps.

After CA (transition CA), token goes to p_CA_out. Then Approval (AP) transition takes it to p_AP_out. If the amount is below threshold, AP might not be needed? But according to scenario, AP is required only if amount surpasses threshold. Hmm, but modeling this in Petri nets could be complex. However, the problem says "the process should reach the final marking" after payment, etc. So perhaps AP is always present, but maybe there's a choice. However, the problem says that AP is a step that must be done if the threshold is passed. Since this introduces a conditional, but modeling that in a Petri net without inhibitor arcs or priorities might be challenging. However, given that the problem doesn't specify handling this condition, perhaps we can model AP as a mandatory step, or perhaps include a choice. But since the problem says "the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a threshold", which suggests that sometimes AP is done and sometimes not. However, modeling such a conditional split in a Petri net would require an XOR split, which can't be directly modeled in a classical Petri net without additional constructs (like using transitions and places to represent the choice). But since the problem says "the process should reach the final marking", perhaps we can assume that AP is always done regardless. Or, perhaps model that after CA, there's an option to skip AP, but that complicates things. The problem might not require modeling this part in detail. Since the scenario says "the process should reach the final marking once the claim is paid, notification sent, and closure done", perhaps regardless of whether AP was needed. So to simplify, perhaps model AP as a mandatory step. Alternatively, perhaps AP is always present. Let's proceed assuming that AP is a mandatory step, so after CA comes AP. If that's not the case, but the problem allows both possibilities, but the final steps must be P, N, CL regardless, then perhaps the model can proceed with AP as a step.

Then, after AP  Payment (P)  Notification (N)  Closure (CL). The final marking should have a token in CL.

So putting all together:

Places:

start_place (initial marking has token here)

p_CR_out: after CR transition.

p_postDV: after DV.

p_FC_in (but perhaps p_FC_out is after FC)

p_afterII: after II.

p_CA_in, p_CA_out.

p_AP_in, p_AP_out.

p_P_in, p_P_out.

p_N_in, p_N_out.

p_CL_in, p_CL_out (final place, final marking here).

Transitions:

CR: label "Claim Registration"

DV: label "Document Verification"

FC: label "Fraud Check"

CA: label "Claim Assessment"

AP: label "Approval"

P: label "Payment"

N: label "Notification"

CL: label "Closure"

RDS: label "Re-Document Submission"

II: label "In-depth Investigation"

Now, building the arcs.

Start_place  CR transition (arc from start_place to CR).

CR transition  p_CR_out (arc from CR to p_CR_out).

p_CR_out  DV transition (arc from p_CR_out to DV).

DV transition  p_postDV (arc from DV to p_postDV).

p_postDV  RDS transition (arc to RDS).

RDS transition  p_CR_out (arc from RDS to p_CR_out).

p_postDV  FC transition (arc from p_postDV to FC).

FC transition  p_FC_out (arc from FC to p_FC_out).

p_FC_out  CA transition (arc to CA).

CA transition  p_CA_out (arc from CA to p_CA_out).

p_CA_out  AP transition (arc to AP).

AP transition  p_AP_out.

p_AP_out  P transition.

P transition  p_P_out.

p_P_out  N transition.

N transition  p_N_out.

p_N_out  CL transition.

CL transition  p_CL_out.

Additionally:

p_FC_out  II transition (arc to II).

II transition  p_postDV (arc from II back to p_postDV).

This way, after FC, the token is in p_FC_out. Then either CA can fire (proceeding) or II can fire (looping back to FC again).

Now, for the initial and final markings.

Initial marking has a token in start_place.

Final marking has a token in p_CL_out.

Now, coding this in Python with pm4py.

First, create the net, then all the places, transitions, and arcs.

Let me outline the steps:

Import necessary modules.

Create the PetriNet instance.

Add all places:

start_place, p_CR_out, p_postDV, p_FC_out, p_afterII (wait, no, II transitions to p_postDV), p_CA_out, p_AP_out, p_P_out, p_N_out, p_CL_out.

Wait, in the above outline:

p_CR_out: output from CR.

p_postDV: output from DV.

FC outputs to p_FC_out.

II outputs back to p_postDV.

CA outputs to p_CA_out.

AP outputs to p_AP_out.

Etc.

Now, transitions:

CR, DV, FC, CA, AP, P, N, CL, RDS, II.

Each transition has a label as per the scenario.

Now, code steps:

Import:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

Initialize net:

net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

Create all places:

start_place = PetriNet.Place("start_place")
p_CR_out = PetriNet.Place("p_CR_out")
p_postDV = PetriNet.Place("p_postDV")
p_FC_out = PetriNet.Place("p_FC_out")
p_CA_out = PetriNet.Place("p_CA_out")
p_AP_out = PetriNet.Place("p_AP_out")
p_P_out = PetriNet.Place("p_P_out")
p_N_out = PetriNet.Place("p_N_out")
p_CL_out = PetriNet.Place("p_CL_out")

Add all these places to net.places.

Then transitions:

CR = PetriNet.Transition("CR", "Claim Registration")
DV = PetriNet.Transition("DV", "Document Verification")
FC = PetriNet.Transition("FC", "Fraud Check")
CA = PetriNet.Transition("CA", "Claim Assessment")
AP = PetriNet.Transition("AP", "Approval")
P = PetriNet.Transition("P", "Payment")
N = PetriNet.Transition("N", "Notification")
CL = PetriNet.Transition("CL", "Closure")
RDS = PetriNet.Transition("RDS", "Re-Document Submission")
II = PetriNet.Transition("II", "In-depth Investigation")

Add all transitions to net.transitions.

Now, add arcs:

From start_place to CR, and CR to p_CR_out.

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(start_place, CR, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CR, p_CR_out, net)

Then, p_CR_out to DV:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_CR_out, DV, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV, p_postDV, net)

Then, RDS transition:

arc from p_postDV to RDS:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_postDV, RDS, net)
arc from RDS to p_CR_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(RDS, p_CR_out, net)

Arc from p_postDV to FC:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_postDV, FC, net)
arc from FC to p_FC_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC, p_FC_out, net)

Arcs for CA:

arc from p_FC_out to CA:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_FC_out, CA, net)
arc CA to p_CA_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA, p_CA_out, net)

Arcs for AP:

arc from p_CA_out to AP:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_CA_out, AP, net)
arc AP to p_AP_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(AP, p_AP_out, net)

Arcs for Payment:

arc from p_AP_out to P:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_AP_out, P, net)
arc P to p_P_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P, p_P_out, net)

Arcs for Notification:

arc from p_P_out to N:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_P_out, N, net)
arc N to p_N_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(N, p_N_out, net)

Arcs for Closure:

arc from p_N_out to CL:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_N_out, CL, net)
arc CL to p_CL_out:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CL, p_CL_out, net)

Arcs for II:

arc from p_FC_out to II:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_FC_out, II, net)
arc from II to p_postDV:
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(II, p_postDV, net)

Now, initial marking (im) has start_place with token.

im = Marking()
im[start_place] = 1

Final marking (fm) has p_CL_out with token.

fm = Marking()
fm[p_CL_out] = 1

Wait, but in the scenario, the final state is Closure. So the final marking should have a token in p_CL_out.

Now, code should be okay.

Wait, but in the example code, after creating the net, the sink place was removed. But in our case, we don't need to remove any place. The problem says to provide the code for constructing the net, initial and final markings.

Now, possible mistakes: places not added to net.places, transitions not added to net.transitions.

In code:

Each place and transition needs to be added to the net's sets.

So after creating each place and transition:

net.places.add(start_place)
net.places.add(p_CR_out)
... and so on for all places.

Similarly:

net.transitions.add(CR)
net.transitions.add(DV)
... and all transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the petri_utils functions add them automatically. Wait, no. The example code adds the places and transitions explicitly to the net.places and net.transitions. For example:

source = PetriNet.Place(...)
net.places.add(source)
execute_activity = PetriNet.Transition(...)
net.transitions.add(execute_activity)

Therefore, in our code, after creating each place and transition, we must add them to the net's places and transitions.

So in code:

net.places.add(start_place)
net.places.add(p_CR_out)
net.places.add(p_postDV)
net.places.add(p_FC_out)
net.places.add(p_CA_out)
net.places.add(p_AP_out)
net.places.add(p_P_out)
net.places.add(p_N_out)
net.places.add(p_CL_out)

net.transitions.add(CR)
net.transitions.add(DV)
net.transitions.add(FC)
net.transitions.add(CA)
net.transitions.add(AP)
net.transitions.add(P)
net.transitions.add(N)
net.transitions.add(CL)
net.transitions.add(RDS)
net.transitions.add(II)

This step is crucial. If places or transitions are not added to the net, the arcs can't be added.

Putting all together.

Now, code:

fm = Marking()
fm[p_CL_out] = 1

This should model the required process.

Testing for loops:

- RDS loops back to p_CR_out, so after DV, if RDS fires, token returns to p_CR_out, allowing DV to be redone.

- FC fires, token in p_FC_out. II transition sends it back to p_postDV, which is the input to DV and FC. No, wait: II transitions to p_postDV? No. Wait, the arc from II to p_postDV.

Wait, FC transition outputs to p_FC_out.

Then, II transition takes from p_FC_out and outputs to p_postDV.

So after FC, token in p_FC_out. If II fires, token moves to p_postDV. Then FC's input is p_postDV, so FC can fire again. Wait, no:

FC transition's input is p_postDV  FC  p_FC_out.

Ah, yes. So FC consumes from p_postDV and produces to p_FC_out.

If after FC fires, the token is in p_FC_out. Then, firing II moves the token to p_postDV. Now, FC can fire again, because its input place p_postDV now has a token.

So FC can be re-fired. But in this model, FC's transition requires p_postDV token, which would be there after II fires.

But FC is the Fraud Check activity. So this allows multiple FC steps after each II.

But according to the scenario, after FC, if doubts, II is done, which can happen multiple times. So this model allows FC  II  FC (since after II, token in p_postDV again, then FC can fire again).

Wait, no. FC's input is p_postDV. So after II fires, token is in p_postDV. So FC can fire again.

Yes. Which models the loop FC  II  FC again.

But the FC transition's label is "Fraud Check". So each firing would represent a new instance of Fraud Check after an investigation.

This seems correct.

Another point: after CA, AP is next. But scenario says Approval is needed only if amount exceeds threshold. However, the model makes AP mandatory. This could be a simplification.

But the problem states that the final marking should be reached once all steps are done. So regardless of whether AP was needed, the process ends with CL. However, the current model requires AP to be fired. If AP is skipped, the process can't reach closure. Therefore, if in some cases AP is skipped, the model would not account for that, leading to an incorrect final marking. However, the problem states that AP is required when the amount surpasses a threshold. But to model optional steps in a Petri net requires a split. For example, CA would output to a place that allows either AP or skipping AP, then both paths merge into Payment.

But the problem might not require handling this complexity, especially since the user hasn't specified it. So the current model assumes that AP is always performed. It's a simplification.

Assuming this is acceptable, the code should be okay.

Now, code should be correct.

Here is a complete and well-documented Python implementation of an **accepting Petri net** that models the **insurance claim management process** as described in the scenario. The net includes the necessary transitions, places, and arcs to represent the sequence of steps, including the **loops** for document resubmission and in-depth investigation.

---

###  **Overview of the Petri Net Structure**

- **Places** represent the **states** between activities.
- **Transitions** represent the **activities** themselves and are labeled accordingly.
- **Arcs** define the flow of tokens between places and transitions.
- **Initial marking** places a token in the `start_place`, representing the arrival of a new claim.
- **Final marking** places a token in `p_CL_out`, representing the successful closure of the claim.

---

###  **Petri Net Components**

- **Places:**
  - `start_place`: Start of the process.
  - `p_CR_out`, `p_postDV`, `p_FC_out`, `p_CA_out`, `p_AP_out`, `p_P_out`, `p_N_out`, `p_CL_out`: Intermediate and final states.

- **Transitions:**
  - `CR`, `DV`, `FC`, `CA`, `AP`, `P`, `N`, `CL`: Core activities.
  - `RDS`, `II`: Loops for document resubmission and in-depth investigation.

- **Arcs:**
  - Connect places to transitions and transitions to places to define the flow.
  - Include loops for `RDS` (back to DV) and `II` (back to FC).

```

###  **Final Notes**

- This model allows for **multiple iterations** of the **document verification** and **fraud check** steps via the `RDS` and `II` transitions.
- It assumes that **all steps must be completed** (including Approval) for the claim to be closed. If the Approval step is optional, additional logic (e.g., XOR split/merge) would be required.
- The net is designed to be **accepting**, with a clear final state represented by a token in `p_CL_out`.

---

###  **Summary**

This implementation provides a **complete and valid accepting Petri net** for the insurance claim management process using `pm4py`. It includes:

- **All required activities** as labeled transitions.
- **Loops** for document resubmission and in-depth investigation.
- **Initial and final markings** to represent the start and end of the process.

This Petri net can be used for further analysis, simulation, or conformance checking using `pm4py`.
