Given the event log and observed behavior, the process tree should capture the main sequence of activities, the optional repeating loop for requesting missing information and revalidation, and the final steps of approval, confirmation, and archiving. Here’s the final process tree:

```
-> ( 
    'Receive Application (RA)', 
    'Validate Form (VF)', 
    'Assess Eligibility (AE)', 
    * ( 
        + ( 
            'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 
            'Approval Decision (AD)' 
        ), 
        -> ( 
            'Validate Form (VF)', 
            'Assess Eligibility (AE)' 
        ) 
    ), 
    'Send Confirmation (SC)', 
    'Archive Case (AC)' 
)
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Main Sequence:**
   - **Receive Application (RA)**
   - **Validate Form (VF)**
   - **Assess Eligibility (AE)**

2. **Loop for Missing Information and Revalidation:**
   - After assessing eligibility, there is a loop that allows for the optional scenario:
     - **Request Missing Info (RMI):** Can request missing information, after which the process can enter the re-validation loop.
     - Or **Approval Decision (AD):** Can directly go to approval decision.
   
     - Inside the loop, if "Request Missing Info (RMI)" is taken, there is a true concurrency (satisfied by the `+` operator):
       - **Request Missing Info (RMI)**
       - **Approval Decision (AD)**
     
     - If "Approval Decision (AD)" in the concurrency is not reached, the process follows the sequence to perform the necessary re-validation:
       - **Validate Form (VF)**
       - **Assess Eligibility (AE)**

3. **Final Steps:**
   - After exiting the loop (once the approval decision is made), the process continues with:
     - **Send Confirmation (SC)**
     - **Archive Case (AC)**

### Formulated Process Tree:
- **First Sequential Flow (`->`)** includes the main activities: *Receive Application (RA), Validate Form (VF), Assess Eligibility (AE)*.
- **Loop (`*`)**:
  - **True Concurrency** (`+`): whether to *Request Missing Info (RMI)* or proceed directly to *Approval Decision (AD)*.
  - **Inside the loop**:
    - If *Request Missing Info (RMI)* is taken, it leads back to the **sequence** (`->`) of *Validate Form (VF), Assess Eligibility (AE)* to re-validate and assess again after acquiring the missing information.
- **Following the main **sequence*** after exiting the loop, the final activities of *Send Confirmation (SC)* and *Archive Case (AC)* complete the process.
