# **Process Mining-Driven Optimization for Speedy Parcels**
*Last-Mile Delivery Efficiency & Cost Reduction Strategy*

---

## **1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**
### **1.1 Data Preprocessing & Integration**
To create a cohesive event log for process mining, we must integrate data from **GPS trackers, driver scanners, dispatch systems, and maintenance logs** while addressing the following challenges:

#### **Key Integration Steps:**
1. **Unified Case ID Definition**
   - Define a **Vehicle-Day** as the primary case (e.g., `V12-20241205`).
   - Link package-level events (e.g., `P9876`) to the parent Vehicle-Day case for hierarchical analysis.

2. **Timestamp Alignment & Event Correlation**
   - Align timestamps across systems (GPS may log every 30 sec, scanners at delivery milestones).
   - Use **location proximity** (Lat/Lon) to match GPS "low-speed" events with scanner "Arrive Customer" events.

3. **Activity Standardization**
   - Map disparate event types (e.g., "Low Speed Detected"  "Traffic Delay," "Unscheduled Stop"  "Breakdown").
   - Classify events into **high-level activities** (e.g., *Traveling, Delivering, Idle, Maintenance*).

4. **Handling Missing/Noisy Data**
   - Impute missing GPS coordinates using **dead reckoning** (last known speed/direction).
   - Flag outliers (e.g., unrealistic speeds, duplicate scans).

5. **Attribute Enrichment**
   - Augment with **external data** (traffic APIs, weather, customer density).
   - Calculate derived attributes (e.g., *distance between stops, time since last maintenance*).

#### **Challenges:**
- **Temporal Granularity Mismatch:** GPS data is high-frequency; scanner data is sparse.
- **Semantic Ambiguity:** "Idle" could mean traffic, parking, or driver break.
- **Cross-System Inconsistencies:** Dispatch planned routes may not match GPS actual paths.

---

### **1.2 Process Discovery**
Use **process discovery algorithms** to visualize the *actual* delivery process:

#### **Approach:**
- **Heuristics Miner / Inductive Miner:**
  - Generate a **process map** showing sequences like:
    `Depart Depot  Travel  Arrive Customer  Deliver  Depart  ...  Return Depot`.
  - Highlight **deviations** (e.g., unscheduled stops, failed deliveries, traffic delays).
- **Hierarchical Mining:**
  - Drill into sub-processes (e.g., "Delivery Attempt"  Success/Failed  Reattempt).
- **Variant Analysis:**
  - Identify **common vs. rare paths** (e.g., 80% of routes follow the plan, but 20% have detours).

#### **Example Insights:**
- **Unplanned Stops:** Frequent "Engine Warning Light" events correlate with older vehicles.
- **Failed Deliveries:** 15% of stops result in failures, often clustering in high-rise apartments.
- **Traffic Bottlenecks:** "Low Speed" events cluster near schools during drop-off/pick-up times.

---

### **1.3 Conformance Checking**
Compare the **discovered process** against the **planned dispatch routes**:

#### **Deviation Types to Investigate:**
| **Deviation Type**          | **Example**                          | **Root Cause Hypothesis**               |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Sequence Deviations**     | Skipped stops, out-of-order deliveries | Driver discretion, traffic rerouting    |
| **Unplanned Stops**         | Unscheduled maintenance, driver breaks | Poor vehicle health, lack of break scheduling |
| **Timing Deviations**       | Stops taking 2x longer than planned  | Parking difficulties, customer delays    |
| **Route Deviations**        | GPS path  dispatch route            | Real-time traffic avoidance, driver error |
| **Failed Deliveries**       | Multiple attempts for same package   | Poor time window management             |

#### **Tools/Techniques:**
- **Alignment-Based Conformance Checking** (e.g., using **PM4Py** or **Celonis**):
  - Quantify deviations (e.g., "30% of routes deviate by >15 mins").
- **Trace Clustering:**
  - Group similar deviations (e.g., "Vehicles in Zone X always take Detour Y").

## **2. Performance Analysis & Bottleneck Identification**
### **2.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
Define KPIs aligned with Speedy Parcels’ goals:

| **KPI**                          | **Calculation**                                                                 | **Data Source**                          |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **On-Time Delivery Rate**        | (Deliveries within time window) / (Total deliveries)                             | Scanner timestamps + dispatch data       |
| **Avg. Time per Delivery Stop**  | (Depart Customer - Arrive Customer)                                            | Scanner events                           |
| **Travel Time vs. Service Time** | (Travel time between stops) / (Time spent at stops)                            | GPS + Scanner                            |
| **Fuel Consumption per km**      | (Fuel used) / (Distance traveled)                                               | GPS speed + maintenance logs             |
| **Vehicle Utilization Rate**     | (Active delivery time) / (Total shift time)                                    | GPS ignition on/off                      |
| **Traffic Delay Frequency**      | Count of "Low Speed" events / km                                                | GPS data                                 |
| **Failed Delivery Rate**         | (Failed attempts) / (Total attempts)                                           | Scanner "Delivery Failed" events         |
| **Unscheduled Stop Rate**         | (Unplanned stops) / (Total stops)                                               | GPS + Maintenance logs                   |

---

### **2.2 Bottleneck Identification Techniques**
#### **Process Mining Tools:**
- **Performance Spectrum Analysis** (Celonis):
  - Visualize **median/outlier** durations for each activity (e.g., "Why do 10% of stops take >10 mins?").
- **Bottleneck Heatmaps:**
  - Overlay delays on a **geospatial map** to identify traffic hotspots.
- **Variant Comparison:**
  - Compare high-performing vs. low-performing routes/drivers.

#### **Example Bottlenecks:**
| **Bottleneck**               | **Evidence from Data**                          | **Quantified Impact**                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Morning Traffic in Zone A** | 75% of "Low Speed" events between 8-9 AM       | +20 mins per route                       |
| **High-Rise Deliveries**      | Failed delivery rate = 25% (vs. 5% average)   | 2x re-delivery cost                      |
| **Older Vehicles (V10-V15)**  | 3x more unscheduled stops                      | +15% maintenance cost                    |
| **Driver Breaks**            | Unscheduled 30-min stops in 40% of shifts      | -5% vehicle utilization                  |

## **3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies**
### **3.1 Potential Root Causes**
| **Inefficiency**               | **Possible Root Causes**                                                                 | **Process Mining Validation**                          |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Late Deliveries**            | - Static routes ignore real-time traffic.                                               | Correlate GPS "Low Speed" with traffic API data.      |
|                                | - Underestimated service time (e.g., parking, elevators in high-rises).                | Analyze dwell time by location type.                  |
| **High Fuel Costs**            | - Idling in traffic.                                                                     | GPS speed = 0 km/h for prolonged periods.            |
|                                | - Suboptimal route sequencing (zig-zag patterns).                                     | Compare actual vs. planned route distances.          |
| **Failed Deliveries**          | - Poor time window adherence.                                                            | Overlay "Delivery Failed" events with customer slots. |
|                                | - Lack of customer notifications (e.g., "Your package is arriving").                   | Check if re-delivery rates drop with notifications.   |
| **Maintenance Costs**          | - Reactive (not predictive) maintenance.                                               | Mine maintenance logs for failure patterns.          |
|                                | - Older vehicles assigned to long routes.                                               | Cross-analyze vehicle age vs. breakdown frequency.   |
| **Driver Variability**         | - Some drivers take longer breaks.                                                       | Cluster drivers by "Unscheduled Stop" duration.       |
|                                | - Inexperienced drivers struggle with navigation.                                       | Compare route adherence by driver tenure.             |

### **3.2 Specific Analyses to Validate Root Causes**
1. **Variant Analysis:**
   - Compare routes with **high vs. low on-time rates** to identify best practices.
   - Example: "Drivers who start early avoid traffic"  Adjust shift start times.

2. **Correlation with External Data:**
   - Overlay **traffic data** with GPS "Low Speed" events to confirm congestion impact.
   - Example: "Zone A delays spike at 8:30 AM due to school traffic"  Reroute during this window.

3. **Dwell Time Analysis:**
   - Break down **service time** into:
     - *Parking time* (GPS "Arrive" to Scanner "Arrive Customer").
     - *Customer interaction* (Scanner "Arrive" to "Depart").
   - Example: "High-rise deliveries add 5 mins for elevator waits"  Adjust time estimates.

4. **Failed Delivery Pattern Mining:**
   - Sequence: `Delivery Failed  Reattempt (next day)  Success`.
   - Root cause: "60% of failures occur when customer time window is <2 hours"  Expand windows.

5. **Vehicle Health Trends:**
   - Mine maintenance logs for **leading indicators** of breakdowns (e.g., "Warning light appears 3 days before failure").
   - Example: "Vehicles >5 years old fail 3x more"  Prioritize replacements.

---

## **4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies**
### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Routing with Real-Time Traffic Integration**
**Targeted Inefficiency:** Static routes cause delays in traffic.
**Root Cause:** Dispatch system lacks real-time adjustments.
**Process Mining Insight:**
- GPS data shows **recurring traffic bottlenecks** (e.g., Zone A at 8-9 AM).
- 25% of routes deviate from planned paths due to driver discretion.

**Proposal:**
- Integrate **live traffic APIs** (e.g., Google Maps, HERE) into the dispatch system.
- Use **reinforcement learning** to suggest alternative routes when delays exceed 10 mins.
- **Pilot Test:** Compare on-time rates for dynamic vs. static routes.

**Expected Impact:**
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** +15%
- **Fuel Consumption:** -8% (less idling)
- **Driver Stress:** Reduced (fewer ad-hoc decisions)

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**
**Targeted Inefficiency:** Unscheduled breakdowns disrupt deliveries.
**Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance leads to costly downtime.
**Process Mining Insight:**
- Vehicles **V10-V15** have 3x more unscheduled stops.
- "Engine Warning Light" appears **3 days before 80% of breakdowns**.

**Proposal:**
- Develop a **predictive maintenance model** using:
  - Historical maintenance logs (failure patterns).
  - GPS data (e.g., harsh braking, prolonged idling).
  - Sensor data (if available, e.g., oil temperature).
- Schedule maintenance **during low-demand periods** (e.g., weekends).

**Expected Impact:**
- **Unscheduled Stops:** -40%
- **Maintenance Cost:** -12% (preventing major repairs)
- **Vehicle Utilization:** +5% (fewer breakdowns)

---

### **Strategy 3: Customer Time Window Optimization**
**Targeted Inefficiency:** Failed deliveries (15% rate) require costly reattempts.
**Root Cause:**
- Narrow time windows (e.g., 9-11 AM) conflict with traffic patterns.
- No customer notifications for delays.

**Process Mining Insight:**
- Failed deliveries spike when **time windows <2 hours**.
- 60% of failures occur in **high-rise buildings** (longer service times).

**Proposal:**
1. **Expand Time Windows:**
   - Use process mining to identify **optimal windows** (e.g., 9 AM-1 PM for high-rises).
2. **Proactive Customer Notifications:**
   - Send SMS/email updates if driver is delayed (e.g., "Your package will arrive by 10:30 AM instead of 9:30 AM").
3. **Incentivize Flexible Customers:**
   - Offer discounts for "Anytime" delivery slots.

**Expected Impact:**
- **Failed Delivery Rate:** -50%
- **Re-Delivery Cost:** -30%
- **Customer Satisfaction:** +20% (fewer missed deliveries)

## **5. Operational Constraints & Continuous Monitoring**
### **5.1 Accounting for Constraints**
| **Constraint**               | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Driver Working Hours**     | Use process mining to **balance route loads** (avoid overtime while meeting demand).   |
| **Vehicle Capacity**         | Optimize package assignment to **minimize weight/volume excess**.                       |
| **Customer Time Windows**    | Dynamically adjust routes to **prioritize tight windows** (e.g., medical supplies).     |
| **Union Regulations**        | Ensure breaks are scheduled **without disrupting flow** (e.g., during low-traffic periods). |

---

### **5.2 Continuous Monitoring Dashboard**
Deploy a **real-time process mining dashboard** (e.g., Celonis, Disco) with:

#### **Key Metrics to Track:**
1. **Real-Time KPIs:**
   - On-time delivery rate (hourly update).
   - Fuel efficiency per route.
   - Unscheduled stop alerts.

2. **Geospatial Heatmaps:**
   - Traffic delay hotspots (updated every 30 mins).
   - Failed delivery clusters.

3. **Driver/Vehicle Performance:**
   - **Top/bottom 10% performers** (for targeted training).
   - **Maintenance risk scores** per vehicle.

4. **Process Variants:**
   - Automated alerts for **new inefficient paths** (e.g., "10% of drivers now taking Detour X").

#### **Alerts & Actions:**
| **Trigger**                          | **Action**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| On-time rate drops below 85%        | Investigate root cause (traffic? driver? vehicle?).                      |
| Unscheduled stops increase by 20%    | Check for emerging vehicle issues or driver fatigue.                     |
| New traffic bottleneck detected     | Reroute affected vehicles dynamically.                                   |
| Failed deliveries spike in Zone Y    | Adjust time windows or add customer notifications.                       |

#### **Feedback Loop:**
- **Monthly Deep Dives:** Re-run process discovery to detect **new inefficiencies**.
- **A/B Testing:** Pilot changes (e.g., dynamic routing) in one region before scaling.
