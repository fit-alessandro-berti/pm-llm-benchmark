## 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

### Preprocessing and Integration of Data

**Integration Approach:**
To preprocess and integrate the diverse datasets into a cohesive event log for process mining, we will follow a systematic approach:

- **Standardization:** Convert all timestamps to a uniform timezone (e.g., UTC) to ensure consistency across different systems.
- **Normalization:** Ensure that data from different sources are aligned in terms of granularity. For instance, GPS logs might capture location at 1-second intervals, while scanners record events like 'Arrive Customer' at minute-level intervals; we will interpolate or aggregate data where necessary.
- **Enrichment:** Enrich the event log with additional metadata such as vehicle type (van vs. truck), driver shift length, and package weight. This can be achieved by joining tables based on common identifiers like `Vehicle ID` and `Package ID`.
- **Quality Assurance:** Identify missing events or inconsistencies (e.g., GPS logs showing a vehicle moving while the scanner indicates 'Idle') to correct data quality issues.

**Challenges:**
- **Data Granularity Disparities:** Ensuring that all datasets align temporally without losing critical details.
- **Incomplete Data:** Handling cases where certain drivers, vehicles, or routes have missing data due to technical failures or human error.
- **Data Privacy:** Anonymizing sensitive information (e.g., driver names) while ensuring that the integrity of the analysis is not compromised.

### Process Discovery

**Discovery Algorithms:**
To discover the actual delivery process from depot departure to return:

- **Traceability Analysis:** Use traceability graphs to understand how individual traces (i.e., a single vehicle's journey on a given day) are mapped across different events.
- **Process Mining Techniques:** Apply algorithms such as Alpha, Beta, or Heuristic Miner to extract the most frequent process paths from the event log.
- **Visualization Tools:** Utilize tools like ProM or ELAN to visualize discovered processes. Key stages will include:
  - **Departure/Arrival:** Visualizing departures from and arrivals at the depot using GPS data.
  - **Travel Segments:** Mapping out travel segments with associated speed, location, and any deviations (e.g., traffic delays).
  - **Service Activities:** Including scanning events, customer interactions, and delivery outcomes.

### Conformance Checking

**Comparative Analysis:**
Conformance checking involves comparing the actual process paths to planned routes from dispatch:

- **Sequence Alignment:** Use sequence mining techniques to align actual sequences of events (e.g., 'Depart Depot' followed by a series of deliveries) with planned routes.
- **Timing Deviations:** Identify deviations in timing, such as when services take longer than expected or when unexpected stops occur (e.g., maintenance).
- **Operational Deviations:** Detect unplanned activities like emergency stops or vehicle breakdowns during the actual process versus what was planned.

**Types of Deviations:**
- **Sequence Variations:** Compare planned vs. executed routes.
- **Timing Anomalies:** Identify instances where service times exceed travel times by significant margins.
- **Maintenance Stops:** Highlight any unplanned maintenance activities and their impact on delivery timelines.

## 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**On-Time Delivery Rate:**
- **Definition:** Percentage of deliveries completed within the estimated time window.
- **Calculation:** Count the number of deliveries that arrived before or exactly at the scheduled time, divided by total delivery attempts.

**Average Time per Delivery Stop:**
- **Definition:** Average duration between consecutive service activities (e.g., scanning a package).
- **Calculation:** Sum of all durations between scanned events and divide by the number of transitions.

**Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:**
- **Definition:** Ratio of travel distance/time to the time spent performing services at customers.
- **Calculation:** Total travel time divided by total service time across all deliveries.

**Fuel Consumption per km/package:**
- **Definition:** Amount of fuel used relative to the distance traveled and number of packages delivered.
- **Calculation:** Total fuel consumption during a shift divided by the sum of distances between depot arrivals and departures, weighted by package count.

**Vehicle Utilization Rate:**
- **Definition:** Proportion of time vehicles are actively delivering packages versus idle.
- **Calculation:** Active delivery time per vehicle divided by total operational time.

**Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:**
- **Definition:** Number and duration of delays due to traffic conditions.
- **Calculation:** Count of instances where travel speed drops below a threshold, along with average delay durations.

**Rate of Failed Deliveries:**
- **Definition:** Percentage of deliveries that did not reach their destination successfully.
- **Calculation:** Total failed delivery attempts divided by total deliveries attempted.

### Bottleneck Identification Techniques

**Techniques Used:**
- **Sequence Mining:** Identify common sequences of events (e.g., 'Depart Depot' -> 'Deliver Package 1' -> 'Deliver Package 2') that lead to bottlenecks.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze temporal patterns of delays, focusing on traffic hotspots or specific time windows with higher failure rates.

**Types of Bottlenecks:**
- **Traffic Congestion Areas:** Specific intersections or routes with frequent slowdowns.
- **Peak Hours:** Times when delivery volumes spike (e.g., evenings).
- **Vehicle Breakdown Hotspots:** Locations where maintenance stops are frequently occurring.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

### Potential Bottlenecks and Their Causes

**Suboptimal Route Planning:**
- **Cause:** Static route planning based on historical data without considering real-time traffic conditions.
- **Impact:** Longer travel times, increased fuel consumption, higher risk of missed delivery windows.

**Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
- **Cause:** Historical data not accounting for recent roadworks or traffic patterns.
- **Impact:** Delays at customer locations due to underestimation of travel time.

**Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
- **Cause:** Frequent congestion in specific urban areas during peak hours.
- **Impact:** Significant delays leading to missed deliveries and increased operational costs.

**High Variability in Service Time:**
- **Cause:** Inconsistent service times at customers due to location characteristics (e.g., distance from depot, building access).
- **Impact:** Increased variability in delivery time windows and higher customer dissatisfaction.

**Vehicle Breakdowns/Maintenance Needs:**
- **Cause:** Frequent or poorly scheduled maintenance leading to unplanned stops.
- **Impact:** Downtime for vehicles, increased labor costs for repairs, potential missed deliveries during breakdown periods.

**Driver Behavior/Skill Differences:**
- **Cause:** Variability in driver adherence to planned routes and handling of traffic conditions.
- **Impact:** Inconsistent delivery times, higher fuel consumption due to inefficient routing or speeding.

### Quantifying Bottleneck Impact

**Techniques for Quantification:**
- **Statistical Correlation Analysis:** Examine the correlation between specific events (e.g., delays at a particular intersection) and overall KPI performance.
- **Regression Modeling:** Use regression models to predict how changes in variables (e.g., traffic conditions, maintenance schedules) affect delivery times and costs.

## 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Proposed Strategies with Rationale

**1. Dynamic Routing Adjustments Based on Real-Time Traffic Data**
