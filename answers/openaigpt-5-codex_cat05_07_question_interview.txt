**Drafting clarifying questions list**
</think>
1. When a landlord first contacts the regional office, what intake channels are available (phone, email, portal), and how do you capture or triage those requests?  
2. Are there service-level expectations for how quickly the property coordinator must review and validate the landlord’s documentation?  
3. How do you track outstanding or missing documents—do coordinators own follow-up, or is there an automated reminder system?  
4. Once property details are entered into the central database, is there a quality check or approval step before moving forward?  
5. What criteria or decision matrix guides the assignment of a property manager beyond workload and geography—are there thresholds or scoring mechanisms?  
6. Does the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord follow a standardized agenda or checklist?  
7. How do you log and communicate any special landlord policies or custom requirements to the rest of the team (photographers, inspectors, marketing, leasing)?  
8. Are the scheduling steps for photography and inspection handled sequentially or in parallel, and who coordinates conflicts or rescheduling?  
9. If the inspector identifies issues, what is the typical escalation path—do property managers have authority to engage contractors, or is approval required?  
10. How does the marketing team determine the final listing content and pricing—do they collaborate with analytics or rely on preset guidelines?  
11. What triggers the “activation” of a property in the rental portal—is there a formal sign-off or checklist to confirm all prerequisites are met?  
12. During tenant screening, how do you prioritize applicants when multiple strong candidates emerge—are there documented criteria or a review board involved?  
13. Who is responsible for negotiating lease terms and handling exceptions such as promotional discounts or non-standard clauses?  
14. What internal audits or compliance checks occur after a lease is signed, and how are findings acted upon?  
15. How are communications and status updates shared among stakeholders—do you use a centralized project management tool, or is it mostly handled via email and CRM notes?  
16. Are there standard timelines or SLA targets for each major phase (documentation review, manager assignment, inspection, marketing, leasing), and how do you monitor adherence?  
17. How do you handle special cases such as properties that require additional insurance or unique regulatory compliance—do you have a separate workflow?  
18. If a landlord or tenant raises concerns or disputes mid-process, what is the escalation or resolution mechanism?  
19. Do you track metrics or KPIs (e.g., time to onboard, tenant acquisition speed) to evaluate the effectiveness of this process?  
20. How often is the overall onboarding process reviewed or refined, and who is involved in those continuous-improvement discussions?
