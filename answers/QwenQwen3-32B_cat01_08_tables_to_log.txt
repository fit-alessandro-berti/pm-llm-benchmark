Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to create a comprehensive event log from the given ERP tables. The main goal is to have each row represent an event with Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, and other attributes.

Starting with the Orders table. Each order is a case, so the order_id is the Case ID. The first event for each case is "Order Created" with the order_date. That's straightforward.

Next, the Order Lines table. Each order can have multiple items. The item_picking_date is the timestamp for the "Items Picked" activity. Since an order might have multiple items picked at different times, I should create a separate event for each item's picking. However, if the picking dates are the same, maybe combine them. But looking at the data, for order 1001, two items were picked at different times. So each will be a separate event. The resource is the picker_id, which can be mapped to the resource_name from the Resources table.

Then the Delivery table. Each delivery has dispatch and arrival dates. So "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events. Since an order can have multiple deliveries, each delivery is a separate case? Wait, no, the case is still the order_id. So each delivery is part of the same case. So for order 1002, there are two deliveries, so two dispatch events and two arrived events. Need to check the timestamps to ensure the order is correct.

Invoices and Payments are next. For each invoice, there's an "Invoice Issued" event with the invoice_issue_date and the billing_person_id. Then, for each payment, a "Payment Received" event with the payment_date and method. Each invoice might have multiple payments, but in the data provided, each invoice seems to have one payment. So each payment is a separate event linked to the invoice, which in turn is linked to the order.

Now, the challenge is to combine all these events into a single event log, ordered chronologically for each order. Each event must be in the correct order. For example, an order is created, items are picked (possibly multiple events), then dispatched, arrived, invoice issued, payment received.

Need to make sure that for each order, all events are included. Also, check if there are any missing events. For example, order 1004 has no invoice or payment data, so those events are missing. But the problem states to include every event for every order_id, so if there's no invoice or payment, those events just won't be present.

Now, let's map each table to events:

- Orders: "Order Created" with order_date and sales_person_id.
- Order Lines: "Item Picked" for each item, with item_picking_date and picker_id.
- Delivery: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" for each delivery, using dispatch and arrival dates, with carrier_id.
- Invoice: "Invoice Issued" with invoice_issue_date and billing_person_id.
- Payments: "Payment Received" with payment_date, method, and reference.

For each order, collect all these events and sort them by timestamp. For example, order 1001:

1. Order Created (2024-01-01T09:00:00Z)
2. Item Picked (ITEM-001 at 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z)
3. Item Picked (ITEM-002 at 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z)
4. Order Dispatched (2024-01-03T08:30:00Z)
5. Order Arrived (2024-01-05T14:45:00Z)
6. Invoice Issued (2024-01-06T09:00:00Z)
7. Payment Received (2024-01-10T11:30:00Z)

This order is straightforward. Now, for order 1002, there are two deliveries and two invoices. So the events would be:

1. Order Created (2024-01-02T12:30:00Z)
2. Item Picked (ITEM-003 at 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z)
3. Item Picked (ITEM-005 at 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z)
4. Order Dispatched (2024-01-04T07:20:00Z)
5. Order Arrived (2024-01-07T16:10:00Z)
6. Order Dispatched (2024-01-05T07:00:00Z)
7. Order Arrived (2024-01-08T10:00:00Z)
8. Invoice Issued (2024-01-08T10:15:00Z)
9. Invoice Issued (2024-01-10T11:00:00Z)
10. Payment Received (2024-01-12T14:00:00Z)
11. Payment Received (2024-01-15T09:00:00Z)

Wait, but the invoice for order 1002 is issued twice. So two "Invoice Issued" events. Similarly, two payments.

Now, for order 1004, there are no invoices or payments, so the event log will only have up to the delivery events.

Also, need to map the resource IDs to names using the Resources table. For example, sales_person_id SP-001 is Alice Brown, picker_id WH-001 is David Lin, etc.

Now, compiling all this into the event log. Each row will have:

- Case ID (order_id)
- Activity Name
- Timestamp
- Resource (if available)
- Other attributes (like payment method, invoice amount, etc.)

Need to ensure that each event is correctly ordered for each order. For example, in order 1003, the item picking is on the 5th, delivery on the 6th, invoice on the 9th, and payment on the 11th.

Also, check for any missing data. For example, order 1004 has no invoice or payment data, so those events are not present. The problem says to include every event for every order_id, so if an order doesn't have a particular event, it's just not in the log.

Now, let's start building the table. For each order, list all events in order of their timestamps.

Starting with order 1001:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z - Resource: Alice Brown
2. Item Picked (ITEM-001) - 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z - Resource: David Lin
3. Item Picked (ITEM-002) - 2024-01-02T11:00:00Z - Resource: Eva Johnson
4. Order Dispatched - 2024-01-03T08:30:00Z - Resource: GlobalTransport
5. Order Arrived - 2024-01-05T14:45:00Z - Resource: GlobalTransport
6. Invoice Issued - 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z - Resource: Gina Carter - Amount: 250.00
7. Payment Received - 2024-01-10T11:30:00Z - Resource: Credit Card - Reference: REF-CC-123

Order 1002:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-02T12:30:00Z - Resource: Bob Smith
2. Item Picked (ITEM-003) - 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z - Resource: Eva Johnson
3. Item Picked (ITEM-005) - 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z - Resource: David Lin

10. Payment Received - 2024-01-12T14:00:00Z - Resource: Wire Transfer - Reference: REF-WT-XYZ
11. Payment Received - 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z - Resource: Check - Reference: REF-CH-789

Order 1003:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z - Resource: Bob Smith
2. Item Picked (ITEM-002) - 2024-01-05T15:30:00Z - Resource: Frank Miller
3. Item Picked (ITEM-006) - 2024-01-05T15:45:00Z - Resource: David Lin
4. Order Dispatched - 2024-01-06T07:30:00Z - Resource: AirExpress
5. Order Arrived - 2024-01-07T20:00:00Z - Resource: AirExpress
6. Invoice Issued - 2024-01-09T08:00:00Z - Resource: Gina Carter - Amount: 150.00
7. Payment Received - 2024-01-11T10:30:00Z - Resource: Credit Card - Reference: REF-CC-456

Order 1004:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z - Resource: Charlie Kim
2. Item Picked (ITEM-001) - 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z - Resource: Eva Johnson
3. Order Dispatched - 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z (Wait, no delivery for order 1004 in the Delivery table. Wait, looking back, the Delivery table has entries for 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005. So order 1004 has no delivery. So the event log for 1004 will only have order created and item picked. But wait, the item was picked on 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z. But no delivery. So the events are:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-04T14:15:00Z
2. Item Picked (ITEM-001) - 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z

No delivery, invoice, or payment.

Order 1005:

1. Order Created - 2024-01-05T08:45:00Z - Resource: Alice Brown
2. Item Picked (ITEM-007) - 2024-01-06T09:30:00Z - Resource: Frank Miller
3. Item Picked (ITEM-002) - 2024-01-06T09:45:00Z - Resource: Eva Johnson
4. Order Dispatched - 2024-01-07T10:15:00Z - Resource: FastShip
5. Order Arrived - 2024-01-09T11:45:00Z - Resource: FastShip
6. Invoice Issued - 2024-01-10T09:30:00Z - Resource: Irene Park - Amount: 500.00
7. Payment Received - 2024-01-15T12:00:00Z - Resource: Credit Card - Reference: REF-CC-789

Now, compiling all these into the event log table. Each event is a row with Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, and other attributes like amount, payment method, etc.

Need to make sure that the timestamps are in order for each case. For example, in order 1002, the two dispatch and arrive events are after the first ones. Also, the invoices and payments are after the deliveries.

Also, check if any events are missing. For example, order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment, so those events are not present.

Now, let's structure the table with the required columns and the additional attributes as needed.

### Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Activity Mapping**:
   - Each item picking in the Order Lines table is treated as a separate "Item Picked" event.
   - Multiple deliveries for an order are treated as separate "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events.
   - Each invoice and payment is treated as a separate event even if multiple exist for the same order.

2. **Resource Mapping**:
   - Resource IDs from the tables were mapped to their corresponding names using the Resources table.
   - For payment methods, the "Resource/Actor" column was used to indicate the method (e.g., "Credit Card", "Wire Transfer").

3. **Missing Data**:
   - Order 1004 has no delivery, invoice, or payment data, so those events are not included.
   - All other orders have complete data for all relevant tables.

4. **Chronological Order**:
   - Events are sorted by timestamp within each order to reflect the actual process flow.
