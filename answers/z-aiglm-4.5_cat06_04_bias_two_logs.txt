### Analysis of Bias in Event Logs

The **Group B (Unprotected Group) event log exhibits bias**, specifically **favoritism toward members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club"**. This bias manifests systematically through the `ScoreAdjustment` mechanism, which artificially inflates scores for unprotected group members associated with a specific community group, leading to unequal outcomes compared to the protected group.

#### Key Evidence of Bias:
1. **Discriminatory Application of Score Adjustments**:
   - **Group A (Protected Group)**: No score adjustments occur. All applicants rely solely on `PreliminaryScore`. For example:
     - `P002` (score 710) is **rejected** without any adjustment.
   - **Group B (Unprotected Group)**: Members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** adjustment:
     - `U003` starts with a lower `PreliminaryScore` (695) but becomes **approved** after the adjustment (705).
     - `U001` (score 720) is approved with the boost, while `P001` (same score) is approved without it.  
    **Bias**: The boost is exclusively applied to unprotected group members in a specific community group, creating an advantage unavailable to the protected group.

2. **Impact on Final Decisions**:
   - **Protected Group (Group A)**: Decisions are strictly based on raw scores.  
     Example: `P002` (710) is rejected, implying a threshold near 710–720.
   - **Unprotected Group (Group B)**: The +10 adjustment allows borderline cases to exceed thresholds:  
     - `U003` (695  705) is approved despite a score lower than `P002` (710), who was rejected.  
    **Bias**: A protected group applicant (`P002`) with a higher score (710) is rejected, while an unprotected group applicant (`U003`) with a lower score (695) is approved due to the adjustment. This violates equal treatment.

3. **Role of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup`**:
   - **Protected Group**: All have `LocalResident = FALSE` and `CommunityGroup = None`. They are ineligible for adjustments.
   - **Unprotected Group**: All have `LocalResident = TRUE`. Those in "Highland Civic Darts Club" (`U001`, `U003`) gain adjustments; others (`U002`) do not.  
    **Bias**: The system conflates "local residency" with eligibility for community-based boosts, but only unprotected group members benefit. Protected group applicants are systematically excluded from this pathway.

#### Systematic Differences in Final Decisions:
| Scenario                          | Protected Group (Group A)       | Unprotected Group (Group B)          |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Score Adjustment Opportunity**  | None (ineligible)              | +10 boost for specific community group |
| **Borderline Case (695–710)**     | Rejected (e.g., `P002`: 710)   | Approved (e.g., `U003`: 695  705)   |
| **Equal Scores (720)**            | Approved without boost (`P001`) | Approved with boost (`U001`)         |
| **No Community Group**            | Rejected if below threshold     | Rejected (`U002`: 710)               |

#### How Bias Manifests:
- **Mechanism**: The `ScoreAdjustment` rule (`+10 Community Boost`) is applied **only** to unprotected group members in a privileged community group. This rule is:
  - **Discriminatory**: Protected group applicants cannot access adjustments regardless of merit.
  - **Arbitrary**: The boost is tied to a single community group, disadvantaging others.
- **Outcome**: Protected group applicants face a **higher de facto approval threshold**. For instance:
  - A protected applicant needs 720 to be approved (`P001`, `P003`), while an unprotected applicant in the favored group needs only 705 after adjustment (`U003`).
- **Systemic Impact**: The bias creates a two-tier system where:
  1. Unprotected group members in the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive preferential treatment.
  2. Protected group members are held to a stricter standard, widening the approval gap.

#### Conclusion:
The **Group B log reveals bias** through the unequal application of score adjustments. The "Community Boost" mechanism systematically favors a subset of unprotected group applicants, disadvantaging the protected group even when they have identical or higher scores. This violates principles of fairness and equal opportunity, as decisions are influenced by group affiliation rather than objective merit. To mitigate this, adjustments should be:
- **Eligibility-blind**: Applied uniformly across groups.
- **Merit-based**: Tied to verifiable criteria (e.g., income, credit history), not community group membership.
