### 1. Normative Rule Violations

Normative rules represent strict constraints on the loan process sequence and logic. Violations occur when steps are skipped, reordered, or performed in contradiction to the defined process (e.g., finalizing documentation after rejection). Below, I analyze each case based on the event log:

- **Case 1**: No normative violations.  
  The sequence follows the required order: Application Received (09:00)  Credit Check (09:30)  Risk Assessment (10:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 11:00)  Inform Applicant (13:00)  Finalize Documentation (13:30)  Close Case (14:00). All steps are present, in correct order, and aligned with the approval logic (documentation finalized before closing).

- **Case 2**: Two normative violations.  
  - **Risk Assessment before Credit Check**: Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20, before Credit Check at 09:00. This reverses the required order (Credit Check must precede Risk Assessment).  
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection**: Loan Decision was Rejected (09:30), but Finalize Documentation was performed at 10:00 before Close Case (10:30). This contradicts the rule prohibiting documentation finalization after rejection (cases should close directly without it).  
  Note: The log shows no Inform Applicant step, which is required after Loan Decision; this omission is an additional potential violation, as informing the applicant cannot be skipped.

- **Case 3**: No normative violations.  
  The sequence adheres to the rules: Application Received (01-12 09:00)  Credit Check (01-14 10:00)  Risk Assessment (11:00)  Loan Decision (Approved, 12:00)  Inform Applicant (01-16 15:00)  Finalize Documentation (01-17 09:00)  Close Case (10:00). Steps are in order, and approval logic is followed correctly (documentation before closing). The extended timelines do not violate sequence rules.

### 2. Desiderata Failures

Desiderata are recommended best practices (e.g., timing windows and optional actions) that promote efficiency but are not mandatory. Deviations are suboptimal and indicate room for improvement, but they do not constitute serious process failures. Analysis per case:

- **Case 1**: No desiderata failures.  
  Credit Check occurred 30 minutes after Application Received (well within the recommended 24-hour window). Inform Applicant was 2 hours after Loan Decision (prompt, within 48 hours). A Follow-up Call is not logged but was not explicitly performed or skipped in a way that impacts the process; since it's encouraged but optional, this is neutral.

- **Case 2**: No clear desiderata failures (focus is on normative issues).  
  Timestamps suggest Credit Check (08:20, though out of order) was within 24 hours of Application Received (08:00). No Inform Applicant step is logged, so promptness cannot be evaluated, but this ties more to normative rules. No Follow-up Call is mentioned, which is suboptimal but not required.

- **Case 3**: Two desiderata failures, representing suboptimal behavior.  
  - **Delayed Credit Check**: Performed on 01-14 at 10:00, over 48 hours after Application Received (01-12 09:00), exceeding the recommended 24-hour window. This delays the overall process unnecessarily.  
  - **Delayed Inform Applicant**: Occurred on 01-16 at 15:00, over 48 hours after Loan Decision (01-14 12:00), missing the recommended 48-hour promptness guideline. This could reduce applicant satisfaction.  
  - **No Follow-up Call**: The log explicitly notes its absence before Close Case. While encouraged to ensure alignment, skipping it is not severe but misses an opportunity for better communication.  
  These deviations slow the process and may affect applicant experience, but they do not break the core sequence.

### 3. Interpretations and Justifications

To make sense of the observed behaviors, I suggest plausible interpretations that align as closely as possible with the normative constraints and desiderata, while acknowledging deviations. These are hypothetical justifications based on common process scenarios (e.g., resource constraints or errors), without excusing strict violations:

- **Case 1**: This appears as an ideal execution, possibly under optimal conditions like sufficient staffing. The tight timeline (full process in ~5 hours) suggests a high-priority or straightforward application, justifying full adherence to both rules and recommendations. No need for justification—it's a model case.

- **Case 2**: The out-of-order Risk Assessment before Credit Check could be interpreted as an administrative error or parallel processing attempt (e.g., a junior staff member starting risk review prematurely while awaiting credit data). This doesn't align with rules but might stem from workload pressures in a busy period. The post-rejection Finalize Documentation might represent a clerical mistake, such as automated workflow triggering the wrong branch (e.g., a system glitch confusing approval/rejection signals). The missing Inform Applicant could be an oversight, perhaps with notification handled informally outside the log. Overall, this case suggests systemic issues like inadequate training or software bugs, warranting process audits rather than individual fault.

- **Case 3**: The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be justified by external factors, such as the applicant providing incomplete information initially (requiring follow-up before credit pull) or holidays/weekends (01-12 to 01-14 spans a potential non-business day gap). This aligns with desiderata as "preferred" rather than absolute, allowing flexibility for real-world interruptions. The absence of a Follow-up Call might indicate confidence in the process (e.g., clear approval with no issues needing clarification), making it a low-risk omission. Despite suboptimal timing, the case stayed within normative bounds, possibly due to a deliberate "queue management" approach in a backlog scenario. To improve, implementing reminders for desiderata (e.g., automated alerts for 24/48-hour windows) could prevent future deviations.
