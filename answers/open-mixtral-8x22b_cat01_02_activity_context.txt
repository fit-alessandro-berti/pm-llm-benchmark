1. The activities that appear multiple times within the same case are "Verify Documents" and "Call Customer". The meaning of "Verify Documents" changes depending on whether it is the initial verification or a re-verification after additional documents have been submitted or account adjustments have been made. "Call Customer" also changes meaning depending on the context, such as whether it is to request missing documents, clarify account discrepancies, confirm adjustments, or to have the customer return to the branch.

2. The renamed activities are as follows:
   - "Verify Documents" -> "Initial Document Verification" and "Re-verify Documents"
   - "Call Customer" -> "Call for Missing Documents", "Call for Account Clarification", "Follow-up Call for Confirmation", and "Call to Have Customer Return"
