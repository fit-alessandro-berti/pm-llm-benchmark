### 1. Identification of Cases with Performance Issues

To identify performance issues, I calculated the **lead time** for each case as the duration from the **Submit Claim** (first event) to **Close Claim** (last event). Timestamps were converted to datetime differences for precision (assuming UTC and standard time calculations).

| Case ID | Submit Timestamp     | Close Timestamp      | Lead Time          |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | 1 day 1 hour 55 minutes (~26 hours) |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | 2 days 19 minutes (~48 hours) |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | 1 hour 25 minutes |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | 3 days 5 hours 5 minutes (~77 hours) |

- **Cases with significantly longer lead times (performance issues)**: **2002, 2003, and 2005**. These exceed 1 day, compared to <2 hours for the fast cases (2001 and 2004). The average lead time for all cases is ~31 hours, but the outliers are 2–5x longer.
- **Fast cases (benchmarks)**: 2001 and 2004 complete same-day with no interruptions.

Delays primarily occur between **Evaluate Claim** and **Approve Claim**, driven by repeated **Request Additional Documents** activities.

### 2. Analysis of Attributes Correlating with Extended Durations

I cross-tabulated lead times with **Resource**, **Region**, and **Complexity**, focusing on patterns in delays (e.g., number of doc requests, waiting times between events).

#### Key Patterns by Attribute:
| Attribute       | Fast Cases (2001, 2004) | Slow Cases (2002, 2003, 2005) | Correlation with Delays |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity** | Low (both)             | Medium (2002), High (2003, 2005) | **Strong**: High/Medium complexity always involves 1–3 "Request Additional Documents" (avg. 2 per slow case). Low complexity: 0 requests, straight to approval (~30–45 min post-eval). Multiple requests add 1–3 days of customer wait time. |
| **Region**     | A (2001), B (2004)     | B (2002, 2005), A (2003)     | **Moderate**: Region B has 2/3 slow cases, but low-complexity B (2004) is fast. Delays in B tied to complexity, not region alone. Region A slow only on high complexity. |
| **Resource (Key Roles)** | - CSR_Jane/Paul/Mary (submit/close: fast)<br>- Adjuster_Mike/Lisa (eval: ~30 min)<br>- Manager_Ann (approve: fast)<br>- Finance_Alan/Carl (pay: fast) | - **Adjuster_Lisa** (2002: 1 request; 2005: 3 requests  longest delays)<br>- **Adjuster_Mike** (2003: 2 requests)<br>- Manager_Bill (approvals: late-day/next-day)<br>- Multiple requests cluster on Lisa/Mike | **Strong for Adjusters**: Lisa (3/5 evals, 2 slow cases) and Mike (2/5 evals, 1 slow) issue **all doc requests**. Lisa's cases average 40+ hour delays on medium/high. Manager_Ann approves all fast cases; Bill handles slow ones. |

- **Number of Doc Requests as Proxy for Delays**:
  | Case | Complexity | # Requests | Main Delay Cause |
  |------|------------|------------|------------------|
  | 2001 | Low       | 0         | None            |
  | 2002 | Medium    | 1         | Eval  Request: 4h 15m wait; overnight to approve |
  | 2003 | High      | 2         | Multiple same-day requests; 1.5-day wait post-last request |
  | 2004 | Low       | 0         | None            |
  | 2005 | High      | 3         | Repeated requests over 3 days; longest waits |

- **Summary Correlations**:
  - **Primary Root Cause**: **High Complexity**  Multiple doc requests  Extended customer response waits (1–3 days between requests and approval).
  - **Secondary**: **Adjuster Resources** (Lisa and Mike) handle all complex evals/requests, leading to rework loops.
  - **Tertiary**: **Region B** slightly worse (more medium/high cases, Lisa-dominant), but not causal alone. Manager_Bill's approvals add minor delays (e.g., end-of-day timing).

### 3. Explanations for Root Causes and Mitigation Suggestions

#### Explanations:
- **High Complexity Drives Multiple Doc Requests**: Complex claims likely involve ambiguous evidence, legal nuances, or high-value amounts, requiring iterative clarification. Each "Request Additional Documents" introduces ~1-day customer response lag (e.g., over weekends or business hours), compounding delays. Low complexity flows linearly (submit  eval  approve  pay  close in <2 hours).
- **Resource-Specific Bottlenecks (Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike)**: These adjusters may lack efficiency on complex cases (e.g., poor initial evaluation, over-requesting docs). Lisa's 3 requests in 2005 suggest escalation failure; Mike's repeats in 2003 indicate similar issues. Manager_Bill's late approvals may reflect overload or sequential handoffs.
- **Region Influence**: Region B handles more medium/high cases (3/5 total events), possibly due to case routing or volume. This amplifies adjuster bottlenecks but isn't the core driver (A's high case 2003 still slow).
- **Process-Wide**: No parallelism (e.g., requests block approval); timestamps show intra-day clustering but overnight/weekend gaps.

#### Mitigation Suggestions:
1. **Triage by Complexity (Upfront Routing)**:
   - Use automated scoring at "Submit Claim" (e.g., based on claim amount, injury type) to route high/medium to specialized "Complex Claims Team" (bypass Lisa/Mike).
   - **Expected Impact**: Reduce doc requests by 50% via better initial data capture.

2. **Resource Optimization and Training**:
   - Cross-train or reassign: Pair Lisa/Mike with mentors for complex cases; dedicate fast resources (e.g., Manager_Ann's team) to high-volume low complexity.
   - Performance dashboards: Track "requests per eval" per adjuster; incentivize single-pass approvals.
   - **Expected Impact**: Cut adjuster delays by 30–50% (e.g., limit to 1 request per case).

3. **Process Redesign for Efficiency**:
   - **Self-Service Portal**: Allow customers to upload docs proactively during submission/eval, reducing request loops.
   - **Parallel Processing**: Approve/pay while awaiting final docs if partial approval possible.
   - **SLA Monitoring**: Alert on >24h post-request; escalate Region B high-complexity cases cross-region.
   - **Weekend/After-Hours Handling**: AI triage or on-call rotation to avoid overnight delays.

4. **Monitoring and Tech Investments**:
   - Implement process mining tools (e.g., Celonis) to visualize bottlenecks live.
   - Predictive analytics: Forecast doc needs based on complexity/region to preempt requests.

Implementing these could reduce average lead time to <1 day, with high-complexity cases targeted at <2 days. Prioritize complexity-based triage for quickest wins.
