## 1. Case Resolution Time Analysis

To identify cases with significantly longer resolution times, we calculate the total duration for each case (from `Receive Ticket` to `Close Ticket`).

| Case ID | Start Time (Receive) | End Time (Close)   | Total Duration | Duration (Hours) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15   | 2 hours 15 min | 2.25             |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15   | 1 day 1 hour 10 min | 25.17            |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30   | 1 hour 20 min  | 1.33             |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30   | 1 day 10 min   | 24.17            |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30   | 2 days 1 hour 5 min | 49.08            |

**Summary of Resolution Times:**

* **Shortest:** Case 103 (1 hour 20 minutes)
* **Average (Approx.):** (2.25 + 25.17 + 1.33 + 24.17 + 49.08) / 5 $\approx$ 20.4 hours
* **Longest:** Case 105 (49 hours 5 minutes)

### Identification of Delayed Cases

Cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times (over 24 hours) compared to the quick resolutions of Cases 101 and 103 (under 3 hours).

**Delayed Cases:** **102, 104, and 105.**

## 2. Determination of Potential Root Causes

We will analyze the sequence and duration of steps within the delayed cases to pinpoint bottlenecks.

### A. Case 102 Analysis (25.17 hours)

| Start Time | End Time | Activity Sequence | Duration | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09:00 | 11:30 | Assign to Level-1 Agent $\rightarrow$ Escalate | 2.5 hours | Long wait before the decision to escalate. |
| 11:30 | 14:00 | Escalate $\rightarrow$ Investigate (L2) | 2.5 hours | Delay (Queue Time) before Level-2 Agent begins investigation. |
| 14:00 (Mar 1) | 09:00 (Mar 2) | Investigate Issue $\rightarrow$ Resolve Ticket | **19 hours** | Massive delay during the investigation phase, spanning an overnight period. |

**Root Cause for 102:** The primary delay is the **19-hour investigation time**, likely combined with the weekend/overnight pause, and moderate queue time before Level-2 takes over.

### B. Case 104 Analysis (24.17 hours)

| Start Time | End Time | Activity Sequence | Duration | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09:30 | 13:00 | Assign to Level-1 Agent $\rightarrow$ Investigate Issue | **3.5 hours** | Long queue/wait time before the Level-1 Agent started working. |
| 13:00 (Mar 1) | 08:00 (Mar 2) | Investigate Issue $\rightarrow$ Resolve Ticket | **19 hours** | Massive delay during the investigation phase, spanning an overnight period. |

**Root Cause for 104:** Case 104 was not escalated, suggesting it was a complex issue handled entirely by Level-1. The main delays are a **long initial queue (3.5 hours)** and the **overnight investigation time (19 hours).**

### C. Case 105 Analysis (49.08 hours - The Longest Case)

| Start Time | End Time | Activity Sequence | Duration | Observation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09:10 | 10:00 | Investigate Issue (L1) $\rightarrow$ Escalate | 50 minutes | Quick initial investigation leading to a prompt escalation decision. |
| 10:00 (Mar 1) | 14:00 (Mar 2) | Escalate $\rightarrow$ Investigate Issue (L2) | **28 hours** | **Extremely long waiting time (queue time) for the Level-2 team to pick up the ticket after escalation.** |
| 14:00 (Mar 2) | 09:00 (Mar 3) | Investigate Issue (L2) $\rightarrow$ Resolve Ticket | **19 hours** | Massive delay during the Level-2 investigation phase, spanning an overnight period. |

**Root Cause for 105:** The overwhelming factor is the **28-hour delay** between escalation and the start of the Level-2 investigation. This indicates a severe bottleneck in the capacity or availability of the specialized Level-2 team.

### Summary of Performance Factors Causing Delays

The analysis reveals three major patterns leading to extended cycle times:

1. **Escalation Bottleneck (Severe):** Cases requiring escalation (102, 105) introduce significant delays. Case 105 showed a 28-hour wait time just to move from `Escalate` to the Level-2 `Investigate Issue` step.
2. **Investigation Time / Overnight Delay:** All long cases (102, 104, 105) exhibit extremely long durations (approx. 19 hours) between the start of investigation and resolution. Given the timestamps, this strongly suggests that **tickets are frequently left unresolved overnight** once investigation starts.
3. **Level-1 Queue/Wait Time (Moderate):** Case 104 showed a significant 3.5-hour delay between assignment and the start of investigation, suggesting capacity issues or poor prioritization within the Level-1 team.

## 3. Explanation and Recommendations

### Explanation of Increased Cycle Times

The identified factors contribute to increased cycle times as follows:

1. **Escalation Queue Congestion:** The massive delay in Case 105 (28 hours) highlights that **Level-2 agents are a critical resource bottleneck.** Tickets are waiting nearly 1.5 days in a queue after being flagged as needing specialized attention. This invalidates the purpose of quick triaging and escalation, as the benefit of identifying complexity early is lost waiting for the expert team.
2. **Lack of Resolution Focus/Handover:** The recurring 19-hour gap during investigation (involving overnight hours) indicates that agents often start investigating complex issues too late in the workday, or that there is no proper handover mechanism. Once an investigation is started, it should ideally proceed to resolution within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., within the same working shift).
3. **Initial Agent Productivity:** The 3.5-hour delay in Case 104 from assignment to the start of investigation suggests that Level-1 agents might be overloaded, inefficiently managing their queues, or spending excessive time on non-ticket related tasks.

### Insights and Recommendations

To address these performance bottlenecks and reduce the overall cycle time, the following recommendations should be considered:

| Bottleneck | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Escalation Bottleneck (Level-2)** | **Increase Level-2 Capacity and Prioritization:** Hire more specialized agents or implement a dynamic staffing model. **Crucially, implement strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** for the time between `Escalate` and the start of the Level-2 `Investigate Issue` activity (e.g., maximum 4 hours). | Significantly reduce the 28-hour wait time observed in Case 105, speeding up complex resolutions. |
| **Overnight Delays** | **Implement Shift Handover Protocols:** Require agents to summarize the current state of an investigation before the end of their shift. Implement a "Hot Ticket" list for tickets currently under investigation that must be picked up immediately by the next shift (if 24/7 coverage exists) or prioritized first thing in the morning. | Reduce the recurring 19-hour resolution time by ensuring work continues seamlessly or is immediately resumed upon shift start. |
| **Level-1 Queue Time** | **Optimize Level-1 Workflow and Capacity:** Review the capacity planning for Level-1 agents and analyze their queue management practices. Implement a policy that requires investigation to begin within a shorter timeframe (e.g., 60 minutes) after assignment. | Eliminate unnecessary delays (like the 3.5 hours in Case 104) and ensure quicker time-to-first-action. |
| **General Process Insight** | **Introduce Severity/Priority Metric:** The log only shows activity, not the severity. If the lengthy cases (102, 105) were critical, the delays are unacceptable. If a priority metric were included, we could ensure that high-priority tickets bypass these queues. | Ensure critical tickets are resolved faster, potentially by having dedicated Level-2 resources for P1 issues. |
