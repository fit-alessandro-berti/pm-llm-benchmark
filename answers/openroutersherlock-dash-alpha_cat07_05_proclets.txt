### Overall Diagram Structure
This is a technical flowchart-style visualization divided into **two main panels (a) and (b)**, illustrating a workflow involving lab tests, an order system, a Hospital Information System (HIS), and interactions between **two protocol classes** connected through **two channels**. It appears to model a medical or laboratory process (e.g., blood sample testing) with feedback loops, decision points, and data flows. The diagram uses boxes for systems/components, arrows for directed flows, and labels for actions/data. At the bottom is a **table** labeled "(c) Example of a performative," showing a message exchange example.

### Panel (a): Main Workflow Diagram
This is the primary flowchart titled **"Two protocol classes connected through two channels"** (implied by the bottom caption). It depicts an interconnected system with these key components and flows:

#### Core Components (as labeled boxes):
- **Order system** (central, connected to multiple arrows).
- **HIS** (Hospital Information System, overlapping/central hub with multiple inputs/outputs).
- **Lab** (left side, with sub-elements).
- **Lab test** (right side, with sub-tests).
- **Lab assistant** (bottom-left).

#### Key Flows and Arrows (numbered for reference in the image):
1. **Input to Order System**: "Lab entry" (blood sample input)  **Order system**.
2. **Order System Outputs**:
   - To HIS: Solid arrow labeled "1".
   - To Lab test: Dashed arrow labeled "2".
3. **HIS Interactions** (thick central box with internal labels):
   - Receives from Order system.
   - Outputs to Lab test ("3"), "Do test again" loop, and others.
   - Internal loops: "Receive result"  "Judge"  "Do test again" (feedback loop).
4. **Lab Side (Left)**:
   - "Lab entry" (blood sample)  **Lab**  "Lab judge"  "Gentry??" (possibly "Entry" or lab decision)  Back to lab or to **Lab assistant**  "Send report".
5. **Lab Test Side (Right)**:
   - **Lab test** box contains:
     - "Test chemical".
     - "Perform chemical".
     - "Test result".
     - "Make report".
   - Sub-notes: "requires 1.0", "Lab 1.", "Class test".
6. **Feedback Loops**:
   - From HIS: "Receive result"  Decision ("Judge")  "Do test again"  Back to lab/test.
   - Dashed lines indicate alternative/conditional paths.

**Visual Style**: Rectangles for systems, diamonds/ovals for decisions (e.g., "Judge"), solid arrows for primary flows, dashed for secondary. Colors include blue/green boxes, black arrows.

### Panel (b): Class Test Details
A smaller inset or sub-diagram on the right, labeled **"(b) Class test"**, showing:
- **"Chemical finish"**  **"Lab test"** (contains "chemical" and "report").
- **"(b) The two protocol classes"** – Emphasizes two classes: one for lab/order, one for chemical testing.

### Panel (c): Example Table
At the bottom, a **table titled "(c) Example of a performative"** (likely from protocol/agents theory, e.g., FIPA ACL performatives for multi-agent communication). It details a message in a lab test scenario:

| Time | Channel | Sender   | Receiver | Action       | Content     | Scope | Direction |
|------|---------|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 1130 | Order  | Lab     | Lab test | Create test for a Job | Private    | OUT   | ?        |

- **Interpretation**: At time 1130, via "Order" channel, "Lab" sends to "Lab test" a performative action "Create test for a Job" with private scope, outgoing (OUT) direction.

### Summary Interpretation
This diagram models a **lab testing protocol** where an **order system** and **HIS** coordinate **lab** and **lab test** (chemical analysis) processes. It includes result judging, re-testing loops, and reporting. The "two protocol classes" (lab vs. chemical/lab test) communicate via **two channels** (e.g., "Order" channel in the table), exemplified by an agent-like message performative. Likely from a paper on distributed systems, multi-agent protocols, or healthcare informatics.
