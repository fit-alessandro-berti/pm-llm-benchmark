Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model:

1. The average time between Receive (R) and Approve (P) is around 25 hours with an unusually low standard deviation of 1 hour. This suggests an artificially rigid approval schedule not fully explained by the business process.

2. The Approve (P) to Notify (N) transition has an extremely long average delay of 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days. This inconsistency might indicate backlogs, resource constraints, or highly variable notification practices.

3. The average time from Assign (A) to Close (C) is a relatively short 2 hours. Claims seem to be closed quickly after assignment without consistently going through Evaluate (E) or Approve (P) steps, hinting at premature closures.

4. The Evaluate (E) to Notify (N) transition averages only 5 minutes, an unrealistically quick turnaround that may not align with business rules or could mean skipping necessary intermediate steps.

Hypotheses for the Anomalies:

1. Manual data entry delays or batched processing might explain the consistent 25-hour Receive to Approve gap, rather than the actual claim review taking that long.

2. Inconsistent adjuster availability or shifting of complex claims to overloaded senior adjusters could cause the long and variable Approve to Notify times. 

3. Some adjusters might be prematurely closing simple or low-risk claims right after assignment to improve their metrics, without proper evaluation.

4. An automated notification system triggered by specific evaluate outcomes could generate rapid Evaluate to Notify transitions, bypassing an intended manual review.

SQL Queries for Verification:

1. Identify claims with abnormal Receive to Approve times:

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_type, c.claim_amount, 
       extract(epoch from (ap.timestamp - rc.timestamp)) as r_to_p_time
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events rc ON c.claim_id = rc.claim_id AND rc.activity = 'R'  
JOIN claim_events ap ON c.claim_id = ap.claim_id AND ap.activity = 'P'
WHERE extract(epoch from (ap.timestamp - rc.timestamp)) < 79200 
   OR extract(epoch from (ap.timestamp - rc.timestamp)) > 100800; 
```

2. Check for long Approve to Notify delays by adjuster specialization:

```sql
SELECT a.specialization, avg(extract(epoch from (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) as avg_p_to_n_time
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id AND p.activity = 'P' AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON p.resource = a.adjuster_id::varchar
GROUP BY a.specialization
HAVING avg(extract(epoch from (n.timestamp - p.timestamp))) > 518400;
```

3. Find claims closed within 4 hours of assignment without evaluation:

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, c.claim_amount, c.claim_type 
FROM claims c
JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = 'A'
JOIN claim_events l ON c.claim_id = l.claim_id AND l.activity = 'C'  
WHERE extract(epoch from (l.timestamp - a.timestamp)) <= 14400
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e 
    WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E'
      AND e.timestamp > a.timestamp AND e.timestamp < l.timestamp
  );
```

4. Identify rapid Evaluate to Notify transitions by customer region:

```sql
SELECT c.claim_id, a.region, extract(epoch from (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) as e_to_n_time  
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id AND e.activity = 'E' AND n.activity = 'N'
JOIN claims c ON e.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters a ON e.resource = a.adjuster_id::varchar
WHERE extract(epoch from (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 120;
```

These queries can help pinpoint specific instances of the anomalous patterns, relate them to contextual data like claim types or adjuster attributes, and quantify how frequently the deviations occur. The results would guide further investigation into the root causes and potential process improvements.
