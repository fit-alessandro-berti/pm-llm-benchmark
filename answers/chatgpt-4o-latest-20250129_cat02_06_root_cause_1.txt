### **Analysis of Delayed Cases and Root Causes**  

#### **1. Identifying Cases with Long Resolution Times**  

To determine which cases take significantly longer than others, we calculate the total resolution time for each ticket (from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket"):  

| Case ID | Start Time            | End Time              | Total Resolution Time |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 101     | 2024-03-01 08:00     | 2024-03-01 10:15     | **2 hours 15 min**  |
| 102     | 2024-03-01 08:05     | 2024-03-02 09:15     | **25 hours 10 min** |
| 103     | 2024-03-01 08:10     | 2024-03-01 09:30     | **1 hour 20 min**  |
| 104     | 2024-03-01 08:20     | 2024-03-02 08:30     | **24 hours 10 min** |
| 105     | 2024-03-01 08:25     | 2024-03-03 09:30     | **49 hours 5 min**  |

The **average resolution time** for non-delayed cases (101 and 103) is around **1-2 hours**. Cases **102, 104, and 105** are outliers, taking over **24 hours**, with Case 105 being the most delayed at **49 hours**.

#### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**  

##### **A. Escalations Lead to Significant Delays**  
- Cases **102 and 105** involve an escalation to a Level-2 agent, and both experienced **longer resolution times**.
- In **Case 102**, the escalation happened at **11:30 AM**, but the investigation didn't start until **2:00 PM**, suggesting a **2.5-hour wait**.
- In **Case 105**, the escalation occurred at **10:00 AM on March 1**, but the next investigative step only happened at **2:00 PM on March 2**, indicating a **26-hour gap**.

##### **B. Delays Between "Assign to Agent" and "Investigate Issue"**  
- In **Case 104**, the ticket was assigned to an agent at **9:30 AM**, but the investigation only started at **1:00 PM**, creating a **3.5-hour delay**.
- Such delays suggest possible backlog issues or inefficient workload distribution.

##### **C. Overnight/Weekend Effects**  
- **Case 102 and Case 104** span overnight hours, implying that **limited working hours may contribute to resolution delays**.
- **Case 105 extends across a weekend (March 1-3), causing a major delay** before resolution.

#### **3. Insights and Recommendations**  

1. **Reduce Escalation Delays**  
   - Escalated tickets experience **significant waiting times** before investigation. A structured **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** for escalated tickets could ensure that Level-2 agents begin investigating within a specific timeframe (e.g., within 2 hours of escalation).  
   - Introduce **real-time escalation notifications** to ensure priority handling.

2. **Optimize Ticket Assignment & Investigation Timing**  
   - Cases like **104 show unnecessary delays between assignment and investigation**. Implementing **automated ticket queue balancing** could help distribute workload more evenly, reducing bottlenecks.
   - Consider **prioritization rules** for long-waiting tickets to ensure they are picked up faster.

3. **Address Weekend & After-Hours Delays**  
   - Cases that extend **overnight or over weekends face significant delays**. Introducing a **24/7 support model for high-priority tickets** or having a **rotational on-call Level-2 team** could help mitigate these gaps.

4. **Monitoring & Reporting on Cycle Time Trends**  
   - A **dashboard tracking escalation times, investigation delays, and resolution speed** could help spot inefficiencies early.
   - Regularly review **cases that exceed a set threshold (e.g., 12 hours)** and perform **root cause analysis** on them.

### **Conclusion**  
Cases 102, 104, and 105 suffer from long resolution times primarily due to **escalation delays, investigation backlogs, and weekend/after-hours gaps**. Addressing these through **faster escalation handling, workload distribution improvements, and better weekend support** can improve overall efficiency. ðŸš€
