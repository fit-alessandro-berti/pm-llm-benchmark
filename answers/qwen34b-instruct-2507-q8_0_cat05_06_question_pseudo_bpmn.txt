1. Why were specific geographic regions (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, USA) chosen for component sourcing, and how do these decisions balance cost, reliability, and geopolitical risk?

2. How does the parallel gateway structure in the component sourcing phase enable faster time-to-market, and what are the potential risks of relying on simultaneous procurement from multiple countries?

3. What mechanisms are in place to ensure that component suppliers meet quality and delivery standards across different regulatory and operational environments?

4. How is the decision to split component sourcing into parallel paths aligned with the overall product development timeline and risk tolerance?

5. What contingency plans exist if one of the component suppliers fails to deliver on time or meets quality standards?

6. How does the 24/7 assembly operation in Malaysia optimize production efficiency, and what are the potential environmental, labor, or safety implications?

7. What criteria are used to determine whether a batch of smartphones passes quality checks, and how are these thresholds established and validated?

8. How is data from quality diagnostics integrated into the decision to rework or scrap units—what role does real-time monitoring play in this process?

9. Why is there a parallel split for distribution via air freight and cargo ship, and how are these two modes balanced in terms of cost, speed, and market responsiveness?

10. How are delivery timelines and market demands factored into the choice between air freight and sea shipping, especially for time-sensitive versus volume-driven markets?

11. What regulatory challenges arise during customs clearance, and how are compliance requirements standardized across diverse regional jurisdictions?

12. How is the distribution network structured to support local warehousing and retail access without creating bottlenecks or duplication of effort?

13. What role does local warehousing play in reducing delivery times and improving customer satisfaction, and how is its capacity managed dynamically?

14. How are e-commerce and direct shipment channels prioritized, and what metrics determine whether a VIP or pre-order shipment is more valuable than bulk retail distribution?

15. What data sources and analytical tools are used to monitor inventory levels and sales forecasts in real time, and how are these forecasts validated?

16. How is demand volatility managed in the decision to adjust orders to suppliers versus proceeding to the next sales cycle, and what triggers such adjustments?

17. What ethical, cultural, or labor considerations are factored into decisions about assembly locations, supplier selection, and distribution methods?

18. How does the process ensure transparency and accountability across stakeholders—suppliers, assembly plants, distributors, and end consumers?

19. What role do cross-functional teams (R&D, logistics, compliance, sales) play in decision-making at gateways and task transitions, and how is their input integrated?

20. How might the process evolve in response to emerging technologies (e.g., AI-driven demand prediction, automation in assembly, blockchain for supply chain traceability)? What risks or barriers could slow such evolution?
