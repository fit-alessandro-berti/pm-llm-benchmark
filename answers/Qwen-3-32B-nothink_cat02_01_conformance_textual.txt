# Analysis of Event Log for Process Violations

## Summary of Normative Process Constraints
Based on the description provided, the following constraints must be followed:

1. The process must begin with "Receive order"
2. "Check inventory" must occur before any payment authorization or fulfillment activities
3. If inventory is sufficient:
   - "Authorize payment" must occur after "Check inventory"
   - "Package items" must occur after "Authorize payment"
   - "Ship order" must occur after "Package items"
   - "Close order" must be the final activity
4. If inventory is insufficient:
   - "Cancel order" must occur after "Check inventory"
   - "Close order" must be the final activity
5. "Ship order" must never occur after "Cancel order"
6. "Close order" must always be the final activity in all scenarios

## Case Analysis

### **Case 1**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order

 **No violations** - This case follows the normative process exactly for a sufficient inventory scenario.

### **Case 2**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

 **Violation(s):**
1. "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment" - This is a violation of the normative process, which requires "Authorize payment" to occur before packaging.
2. "Ship order" occurs after "Package items" (which is correct), but the prior step is wrong.

### **Case 3**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order

 **Violation(s):**
1. "Cancel order" occurs after "Authorize payment" - This is a violation of the normative process, which requires "Cancel order" to be the next step after "Check inventory" when inventory is insufficient.
2. "Ship order" occurs after "Cancel order" - This is explicitly stated in the normative description as a violation: "Ship order" should never occur after a cancellation.

### **Case 4**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order

 **No violations** - This case follows the normative process exactly for an insufficient inventory scenario.

### **Case 5**
**Sequence:** Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order

 **Violation:**
1. "Ship order" occurs before "Package items" - The normative process requires "Package items" to occur after payment authorization and before shipping.

## Conclusion

**Cases that violate the normative process:**
- **Case 2:** Packaging occurs before payment authorization
- **Case 3:** Cancellation occurs after payment authorization, and shipping occurs after cancellation
- **Case 5:** Shipping occurs before packaging

**Cases that follow the normative process:**
- **Case 1** and **Case 4**

These violations demonstrate missteps in following the defined business logic, particularly in the sequence of payment authorization, packaging, and cancellation activities.
