Here's an example implementation of a Log Skeleton for an hypothetic Purchase-to-Pay process in Python:
```python
# Define activities in the process
activities = {'Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods', 
              'Create Invoice', 'Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'}

# Define the Log Skeleton
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order')},
    'always_before': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'), ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'),
                      ('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'), ('Create Invoice', 'Send Invoice'), 
                      ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'always_after': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'), ('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'),
                     ('Create Invoice', 'Send Invoice'), ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'never_together': {('Create Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'), ('Send Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {1, 2},
        'Send Purchase Order': {1, 2},
        'Receive Goods': {1},
        'Create Invoice': {1, 2},
        'Send Invoice': {1, 2},
        'Pay Invoice': {1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'), ('Create Invoice', 'Send Invoice'), 
                         ('Send Invoice', 'Pay Invoice')}
}
```
This example corresponds to a simplified Purchase-to-Pay process where:

* `Create Purchase Order` and `Send Purchase Order` are equivalent and must occur together.
* `Create Purchase Order` and `Send Purchase Order` must always occur before `Receive Goods`.
* `Receive Goods` must always occur before `Create Invoice`, and so on.
* `Create Purchase Order`, `Send Purchase Order` and `Pay Invoice` cannot co-exist inside the same case.
* The frequency of each activity is bounded: `Create Purchase Order` and `Send Purchase Order` can occur 1 or 2 times, `Receive Goods` exactly 1 time, `Create Invoice` and `Send Invoice` 1 or 2 times, and `Pay Invoice` exactly 1 time.
* `Receive Goods` must directly follow `Send Purchase Order`, `Send Invoice` must directly follow `Create Invoice`, and `Pay Invoice` must directly follow `Send Invoice`.

You can adjust this example to better suit the needs of your specific process model. 

**Main Function with Example Usage**
```python
def main():
    # Print activities
    print("Activities:")
    print(activities)

    # Print Log Skeleton constraints
    print("\nLog Skeleton Constraints:")
    for key, value in log_skeleton.items():
        if key == 'activ_freq':
            print(f"{key}:")
            for activity, freq in value.items():
                print(f"  {activity}: {freq}")
        else:
            print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
When run, this code will display the activities and Log Skeleton constraints defined for the Purchase-to-Pay process.
