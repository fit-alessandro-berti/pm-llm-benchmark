**Explanation of Added Constraints:**

1. **`existence`:** Added `"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}` to ensure that manual reviews are present in the process, providing an opportunity for human oversight to catch potential biases.
2. **`coexistence`:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"CheckApplicantGender_Female": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` enforce that whenever an applicant's race is identified as a minority or gender as female (which could be subject to bias), a `ManualReview` activity must also occur within the same trace. This ensures that applications from these potentially vulnerable groups are subject to additional scrutiny.
3. **`response`:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` mandate that after checking an applicant's race or gender, a `BiasMitigationCheck` activity must eventually follow. This introduces a mandatory checkpoint to assess and mitigate potential biases before proceeding to a decision.
4. **`succession`:**
    *   `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` was added to ensure that any `BiasMitigationCheck` is succeeded by a `FinalDecision`, meaning that the bias check is indeed used to influence the decision-making process.
5. **`nonsuccession`:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace_Minority": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"CheckApplicantGender_Female": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` prevent a direct succession from checking a sensitive attribute (race identified as a minority or gender identified as female) to a negative decision (rejection). This ensures that a rejection cannot immediately follow the identification of these attributes without intervening steps, such as the `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview`, to evaluate the fairness of the decision.

These added constraints aim to reduce bias in the loan application process by:

*   Introducing mandatory checks (`BiasMitigationCheck`) after sensitive attributes are identified.
*   Requiring human oversight (`ManualReview`) for applications from potentially vulnerable groups.
*   Preventing immediate negative decisions based on sensitive attributes.

By enforcing these constraints, the process is more likely to make fair and unbiased decisions, promoting equal opportunity for all applicants.
