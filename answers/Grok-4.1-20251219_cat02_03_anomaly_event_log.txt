### Standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) Process Flow
A typical, compliant Procure-to-Pay process follows this logical sequence (with minor variations possible but core controls preserved):

1. **Create Purchase Requisition** → 2. **Approve Purchase Requisition** → 3. **Issue Purchase Order** → 4. **Receive Goods** → 5. **Vendor Invoice Received** → 6. **Match Invoice to PO (and receipt)** → 7. **Release Payment** → 8. **Close Case**

Key control principles (three-way match and segregation of duties):
- A purchase order (PO) must exist and be approved **before** goods are received or paid.
- Goods should be received **before** payment is released.
- Invoice should be received and matched against PO and goods receipt **before** payment.
- Payment should only occur after proper matching/verification.

### Analysis of Each Case

**Case 1001**  
Sequence: Create → Approve → Issue PO → Receive Goods → Invoice → Match → Payment → Close  
**Normal**. Follows the standard sequence with no violations.

**Case 1002**  
Sequence:  
- Create Purchase Requisition  
- Issue Purchase Order  
- Vendor Invoice Received  
- Release Payment  
- Approve Purchase Requisition (very late)  
- Receive Goods  
- Match Invoice to PO  
- Close  

**Anomalies and Issues**:
- **Purchase Order issued before requisition approval** (PO at 08:40, approval at 08:00 next day).  
  → Violates internal controls; requisitions must be approved before committing the company via a PO.
- **Invoice received and payment released before goods receipt** (payment on Feb 3, goods received Feb 4).  
  → High fraud risk (paying for goods not yet received).
- **Payment released before invoice matching** (payment at 07:15, matching on Feb 5).  
  → Bypasses three-way match; payment made without verification.
- **Requisition approved after PO issuance and payment**.  
  → Suggests possible retroactive approval to cover non-compliant actions.

**Problematic**: This case shows severe control breakdowns and potential fraud (e.g., fictitious vendor payment, collusion to bypass approvals).

**Case 1003**  
Sequence:  
- Create → Approve → Issue PO  
- Release Payment  
- Vendor Invoice Received (next day)  
- Receive Goods  
- Match Invoice to PO  
- Close  

**Anomalies and Issues**:
- **Payment released before invoice is even received** (payment Feb 8, invoice Feb 9).  
  → Impossible under normal accounting; you cannot pay an invoice you haven't received.
- **Payment before goods receipt** (goods received Feb 10).  
  → Paying for undelivered goods.
- **Payment before matching**.  
  → Complete bypass of verification controls.

**Problematic**: This is a major red flag for fraud (e.g., manual override or fictitious payment). Paying without an invoice is highly irregular and often indicates error or intentional misconduct.

**Case 1004**  
Sequence:  
- Create → Approve Requisition  
- Receive Goods  
- Issue Purchase Order (after goods receipt)  
- Vendor Invoice Received  
- Match → Payment → Close  

**Anomalies and Issues**:
- **Goods received before Purchase Order is issued** (goods Feb 6 09:00, PO at 09:15 same day).  
  → Classic "receiving before ordering" anomaly. Indicates possible confirmation purchase (retroactive PO creation to justify unauthorized purchase) or maverick buying.

**Problematic**: Creates risk of unauthorized commitments, difficulty enforcing vendor contracts/pricing, and potential fraud (e.g., employee colluding with vendor, then creating PO afterward to legitimize).

### Summary of Anomalies

| Case | Key Anomalies | Potential Risk |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1001 | None | Compliant |
| 1002 | PO before requisition approval; payment before goods receipt and matching; late approval | Fraud, unauthorized commitment, bypass of controls |
| 1003 | Payment before invoice receipt and goods receipt; no matching before payment | High fraud risk (e.g., fictitious payments) |
| 1004 | Goods received before PO issued | Unauthorized/maverick buying, retroactive justification |

**Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004** exhibit significant deviations from standard P2P best practices. These anomalies typically trigger alerts in process mining or internal audit reviews because they violate segregation of duties, three-way matching, and proper authorization—core mechanisms to prevent fraud, waste, and error in procurement. Case 1001 is the only fully compliant instance.
