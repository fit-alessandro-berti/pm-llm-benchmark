### **Justification of Naming Changes**

#### 1. **"Verify Documents"  "Initial Document Verification" and "Re-Verify Documents"**
- **Contextual Clue**: The *first* occurrence of "Verify Documents" happens before any customer interaction or document upload. The *second* occurrence follows a customer upload or internal change.
- **Rationale**: 
  - "Initial Document Verification" clearly indicates the first check in the process, typically based on initial data.
  - "Re-Verify Documents" emphasizes that this is a *follow-up* verification after new information (e.g., uploaded ID) has been received.
- This avoids ambiguity about whether the verification is preliminary or corrective.

#### 2. **"Call Customer"  Contextual Subtypes**
- The activity "Call Customer" appears in multiple cases with different purposes:
  - In **C001**, it's to *request missing documents*.
  - In **C002**, it's to *clarify an account discrepancy*.
  - In **C003**, it's to *request the customer to return* after stepping out.
- **Rationale**: 
  - Renaming to specific purpose-based names (e.g., "Request Missing Documents Call", "Clarify Account Discrepancy Call", "Request Customer Return Call") improves clarity and enables better process analysis, automation, or reporting.
  - These names reflect the *intent* of the call, which is critical for understanding workflow dynamics and customer experience.

#### 3. **"Adjust Account"  "Adjust Account Internally"**
- This activity occurs after a call or due to missing information.
- **Rationale**: 
  - "Adjust Account Internally" specifies that the change is made *within the system* by a back-office agent, not due to a customer action. 
  - It differentiates from potential future actions like customer-facing adjustments or external approvals.
  - Avoids confusion with possible customer-initiated account changes.

#### 4. **"Submit Additional"  "Customer Uploads Documents"**
- Originally ambiguous: "Submit Additional" could imply internal submission or customer action.
- **Contextual Clue**: The additional action is done by the *customer* via *CustomerSelfServe* and involves uploading an ID scan.
- **Rationale**: 
  - "Customer Uploads Documents" precisely captures who performs the action and what is submitted.
  - It aligns with the user journey and supports traceability in audit or compliance logs.

### **Conclusion**

By renaming recurring activities with **context-sensitive, purpose-driven labels**, we transform vague, ambiguous activity names into **actionable, process-aware events**. This enables better:
- Process mapping
- Root cause analysis
- Customer experience tracking
- Compliance auditing
- Automation rule design

The revised log now accurately reflects the *flow*, *intent*, and *context* of each step — making it far more useful for operational and analytical purposes.
