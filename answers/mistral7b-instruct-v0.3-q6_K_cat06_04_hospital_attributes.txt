 In the context of process mining and event logs, fairness can be discussed in terms of equality of treatment or outcomes across different attribute groups. In the given event log, the following attributes could potentially influence the fairness of the process if there are disparities observed:

1. case:citizen: If the process shows any differences in the frequency or performance for "Treatment" and its subsequent activities (e.g., "Diagnosis", "Treatment successful", "Discharge") between citizens and non-citizens, this could raise concerns about fairness.

2. case:gender: Similar to the case:citizen attribute, differences in the frequency or performance for main activities based on a patient's gender might indicate some degree of inequality in treatment or outcomes.

3. resource: If certain healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses and doctors) are consistently involved in more "Treatment" events than others or if they have better average performance, it could suggest that some resources may be used disproportionately, potentially affecting fairness in the process.
