A great question in the field of Petri nets!

Here are the proposed opposite concepts and a more general concept for each:

1. **Source Place**
	* Opposite concept: **Sink Place**: A place with no outgoing arcs, i.e., a place that cannot be the target of any transition.
	* More general concept: **Boundary Place**: A place that has either no incoming arcs (source place), no outgoing arcs (sink place), or both (isolated place).
2. **Immediate Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Delayed Transition**: A transition that cannot fire immediately, i.e., a transition that requires a certain delay or condition to be met before firing.
	* More general concept: **Timed Transition**: A transition with a timing constraint, which can be either immediate, delayed, or have a specific duration.
3. **Live Transition**
	* Opposite concept: **Dead Transition**: A transition that cannot fire at all, i.e., a transition that is not live and can never be enabled.
	* More general concept: **Quasi-Live Transition**: A transition that may not be live but can be quasi-live, i.e., can be enabled under certain conditions or through a specific sequence of firings.
4. **Bounded Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Unbounded Net**: A net that has no bounds on the number of tokens in any place, i.e., a net that can have an unbounded number of tokens.
	* More general concept: **K-Bounded Net**: A net that is bounded for a specific value of k, i.e., the number of tokens in any place does not exceed k.
5. **Free Choice Net**
	* Opposite concept: **Conflict Net**: A net with at least one pair of transitions that have a common input place and are in conflict with each other, i.e., can never be enabled simultaneously.
	* More general concept: **Chosen Net**: A net with a mix of free choice and conflict transitions, where some transitions can be freely chosen while others are in conflict.

Please note that these proposals are not unique and might vary depending on the specific context or interpretation of the original concepts.
