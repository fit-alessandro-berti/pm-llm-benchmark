Here are the proposed opposite concepts and more general concepts for each of the given concepts in the Petri nets field:

1. Source Place:
   - Opposite Concept: Sink Place
     A sink place is a place in a Petri net that has no outgoing arcs. It is the opposite of a source place because it only receives tokens and does not send them to any other place or transition.

   - More General Concept: Boundary Place
     A boundary place is a place in a Petri net that has either no incoming arcs (source place) or no outgoing arcs (sink place). This concept generalizes both source and sink places.

2. Immediate Transition:
   - Opposite Concept: Timed Transition
     A timed transition is a transition in a Petri net that has a non-zero time delay associated with it. It is the opposite of an immediate transition because it takes time to fire, whereas immediate transitions fire instantly.

   - More General Concept: Labeled Transition
     A labeled transition is a transition in a Petri net that has some label or attribute associated with it, such as a time delay or a priority. This concept generalizes both immediate and timed transitions.

3. Live Transition:
   - Opposite Concept: Dead Transition
     A dead transition is a transition in a Petri net that cannot be fired in any marking, i.e., it is not live. It is the opposite of a live transition because it is not possible to fire a dead transition.

   - More General Concept: Potentially Firable Transition
     A potentially firable transition is a transition in a Petri net that can be fired in at least one marking. This concept generalizes live transitions and also includes transitions that can be fired only under certain conditions.

4. Bounded Net:
   - Opposite Concept: Unbounded Net
     An unbounded net is a Petri net that has no bound on the number of tokens that can accumulate in any place. It is the opposite of a bounded net because the token count can grow indefinitely.

   - More General Concept: K-Bounded Net
     A k-bounded net is a Petri net where the number of tokens in any place is bounded by a constant k. This concept generalizes bounded nets (where k is a fixed constant) and also includes nets where the bound is not constant.

5. Free Choice Net:
   - Opposite Concept: Conflicting Choice Net
     A conflicting choice net is a Petri net where two or more transitions are in conflict, i
