The user request:

They have two parts: normative process behavior (strict rules) and desiderata (recommended but not strict). They provide an event log in tabular format for three cases.

They ask:

1. Identify which cases are violating the normative rules and explain the reasons.
2. Identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions. Clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior.
3. When possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations.

Thus, we need to answer the three parts.

We must identify normative violations:

- The normative sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.

Also ordering constraints: Credit Check before Risk Assessment; Risk Assessment before Loan Decision; Inform Applicant after Loan Decision; If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case; If rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing.

In case 1:

Sequence: Application Received (09:00)  Credit Check (09:30)  Risk Assessment (10:00)  Loan Decision (Approved) (11:00)  Inform Applicant (13:00)  Finalize Documentation (13:30)  Close Case (14:00). All constraints satisfied.

Check also that Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes. Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes. Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes. For approved, Finalize Documentation before Close: yes. Also no finalization after rejection because it's approved. So case 1 meets all normative rules.

Case 2:

Sequence: Application Received (08:00)  Risk Assessment (08:20)  Credit Check (09:00)  Loan Decision (Rejected) (09:30)  Finalize Documentation (10:00)  Close Case (10:30). There's no "Inform Applicant" at all. Actually normative says after loan decision, you must inform applicant. That is missing. Also normative order: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment; here it's reversed (Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check). Also normative says: If loan is rejected, you must not finalize documentation before closing; but they do finalize documentation after a rejection (10:00). And they also didn't inform applicant. So normative violations: The ordering constraints: Credit Check before Risk Assessment is violated; also the sequence: after loan decision, must inform applicant (missing); finalization after rejection (should not be done). Additionally they close case after finalization, but normative says close case after informing (the normative is: ...Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case; if rejected, you close case after informing applicant, but there is no finalization step). So normative: after loan decision, must inform applicant (they didn't). Then if approved, finalization before close; if rejected, close after informing, but they close after finalization (which is disallowed). So normative violated.

Thus case 2 violates normative.

Case 3:

Sequence: Application Received (09:00)  Credit Check (14 Jan 10:00)  Risk Assessment (14 Jan 11:00)  Loan Decision (Approved) (14 Jan 12:00)  Inform Applicant (16 Jan 15:00)  Finalize Documentation (17 Jan 09:00)  Close Case (17 Jan 10:00). There's also no Follow-up Call. Check ordering: Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes; Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes; Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes; Finalize Documentation before Close: yes; Also there is no rejection, so finalization is allowed. However normative: after loan decision you must inform applicant; yes they did. Sequence is correct. There's no violation of normative ordering. They also didn't do a Follow-up Call but that's a desideratum, not normative. So case 3 meets normative.

Now second part: desiderata. They are recommended but not strict:

- It is preferred that Credit Check is completed within a short time window after application (e.g., within 24 hours). The log shows: case 1: credit check 30 mins after application, within 24h; OK. Case 2: there is no proper credit check before risk assessment; but if we consider that they performed credit check at 09:00 after application at 08:00: that's within 24h. However normative violation is the ordering. But as per desiderata: they'd also prefer credit check within 24h; it's satisfied. However the fact that risk assessment was done before credit check is normative violation, not a desideratum.

- It is also recommended that the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of loan decision). Let's compute: case 1: loan decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00 same day; within 48h; okay. Case 2: they never informed applicant, but that's normative violation. But as per desiderata, they didn't inform at all, obviously not within 48h. The desire is "preferably within 48 hours". So that is a violation of desideratum (though it's more serious). But let's separate: normative violation is that they didn't inform. But for desiderata: they didn't meet the "promptly" recommendation.

- Also recommended: follow-up call before closing case (optional). Cases 1: no follow-up call recorded; case 2: no follow-up; case 3: no follow-up. So all three cases fail to meet that desideratum (lack of follow-up). However case 1 also didn't have a follow-up but normative is satisfied.

- Also there is suggestion that credit check should be within 24 hours after application. Cases 1 and 2 (if we consider correct credit check at 09:00) are within 24h. Case 3: credit check at 2024-01-14 10:00 vs application at 2024-01-12 09:00 = about 49 hours (2 days + 1 hour?). Let's compute: Application at Jan 12 09:00; credit check Jan 14 10:00: that's 2 days + 1 hour = 49 hours > 24. So case 3 deviates from the 24h recommendation, i.e., a desideratum violation.

- Also recommended: applicant informed within 48h after loan decision. Cases: case 1: loan decision 11:00 on Jan 10; inform at 13:00 same day -> within 48h; ok. Case 2: no inform (normative violation). Case 3: loan decision at Jan 14 12:00; inform at Jan 16 15:00 = about 51 hours later (approx 2 days + 3 hours), which is >48h, so it's a desideratum violation. So case 3 fails both the 24h credit check timing and the 48h inform timing, and also lacks follow-up call.

- For case 2: they didn't inform at all, but normative violation is bigger; also they performed finalization after rejection (normative). That's not just desideratum, but normative violation. Also they didn't follow-up call.

Thus we need to categorize case-level:

Case 1: Normative: no violation. Desiderata: No major violation: credit check within 24h, inform within 48h, but no follow-up call (that's a desideratum not met). But follow-up is optional. So it partially meets desiderata: credit check 30 mins after app; informs 2 hours after decision (<48h). Only missing follow-up.

Case 2: Normative: many violations. Desiderata: they did credit check within 24h (8:20? Wait risk assessment then credit check at 09:00; it's within 1 hour of app), but they didn't inform at all (normative violation also not meeting inform within 48h). They also didn't do follow-up. Also they finalized documentation after rejection (normative). So also desiderata not met.

Case 3: Normative: satisfied. Desiderata: credit check >24h; inform >48h; no follow-up call. So all three desiderata violated.

Now we need to answer: Identify which cases violate normative and why. Identify which cases fail to meet desiderata, clarifying that deviations are not severe but suboptimal. Provide possible interpretations or justifications.

We also need to maintain context: the normative rules are strict; the desiderata are recommended but not required. Provide analysis.

We may also need to consider that in case 2 they didn't do "Inform Applicant" which is normative requirement; perhaps they omitted it because they finalized documentation after rejection; but normative says that after rejection, you close case without finalizing. But they performed finalization, which is not allowed. So normative violation.

Interpretation: Could be data entry mistake; perhaps they inadvertently entered finalization step due to workflow, or they might have attempted to finalize but it's not needed.

Potential justification: maybe they wanted to provide closure documentation for rejected case for legal reasons, but normative says no finalization, so it's a violation.

Now for case 3: It's okay normative but not meeting desiderata. Perhaps due to resource constraints: credit check delayed because of high volume; inform delayed due to internal process; follow-up not done due to oversight.

Thus we should answer accordingly.

Now we need to ensure we answer each point clearly:

1. Identify normative violations and explain.

2. Identify desiderata violations and note they are not severe but suboptimal.

3. Suggest interpretations or justifications.

We need to mention each case.

We need to clarify that normative violations are considered serious and must be corrected.

Potential extra nuance: For case 2, the ordering of risk assessment before credit check is reversed. That is also normative.

Thus final answer should contain:

- For each case: normative status: whether it violates normative rules. Provide specific violations.

- For each case: desiderata status: does it meet timing preferences and optional follow-up? Provide any deviations.

- Provide justification.

Potential to format a table summarizing normative and desiderata compliance.

Also note that in case 2 they didn't inform at all: normative violation.

Now answer.

We need to make answer structured: maybe use bullet points.

We should also note the normative constraints in answer.

Now the user didn't ask for any code or further steps. So just analysis.

Thus final answer.

We should also address potential ambiguity: The "Follow-up Call" is a desideratum; it's optional, but recommended.

Thus answer includes:

Case 1: normative compliance; desiderata: follow-up missing (just optional). Suggest maybe they didn't think it necessary.

Case 2: normative noncompliance; also fails desiderata; maybe they mis-ordered steps due to oversight; finalization after rejection might be a mistake.

Case 3: normative compliance; fails desiderata in two timing constraints and missing follow-up; perhaps due to resource constraints.

Now we must be clear about what is "strict violation" vs "suboptimal but not severe".

Potential classification:

- Normative violation: case 2 only.

- Desiderata violation: case 2 and case 3 (and case 1 missing follow-up). Also case 2 also fails to inform.

Now note that "case 2" does not have "Inform Applicant" entry; but if we treat missing as "not within 48 hours" we can also note it as a desideratum violation, but it's also normative violation. But normative is more serious.

Now we can provide interpretation: Might be oversight, process error, or system glitch.

Now answer accordingly.

Let's proceed.

Below is a concise “compliancebycase” review that separates **strict (normative) rule breaches** from **soft (desiderata) shortcomings** and offers possible explanations for what was observed.

---

## 1.  Normative (Strict) Rule Violations  

| Case | Violation(s) | Why it violates the rule |
|------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **1** | **None** | All activities appear in the required order: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. The ordering constraints (Credit Check before Risk Assessment, etc.) are all satisfied. |
| **2** | • **Wrong order** – *Risk Assessment* performed before *Credit Check*.<br>• **Missing activity** – *Inform Applicant* never occurs after the *Loan Decision*.<br>• **Illegal finalisation** – *Finalize Documentation* is executed **after a rejected** loan (the rule explicitly forbids documentation finalisation when the outcome is “Rejected”).<br>• **Premature close** – *Close Case* follows the illegal finalisation rather than directly after *Inform Applicant* (or after *Finalize Documentation* only when approved). | The normative process model requires the exact sequence **Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  (if Approved) Finalize Documentation  Close Case**. Case2 deviates on three points: (1) the order of the two early activities is reversed, (2) the mandatory “Inform Applicant” step is omitted, and (3) documentation is finalised for a rejected application – a direct contradiction of the “no documentation on rejection” rule. |
| **3** | **None** | The sequence is exactly as prescribed: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. All ordering constraints are met. |

**Summary:** Only **Case2** breaches the hardandfast normative rules. Cases1 and3 are fully compliant from a strictprocess perspective.

---

## 2.  Desiderata (RecommendedbutNotStrict) Shortcomings  

| Case | Desideratum | Meets? (Yes/No) | Remarks (suboptimal but not a rule breach) |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **1** | • Credit check **24h** after Application.<br>• Applicant informed **48h** after Loan Decision.<br>• Followup Call before Close. | • **Yes** – 30min after Application.<br>• **Yes** – 2h after Decision.<br>• **No** – No Followup Call recorded. | The only deviation is the missing optional Followup Call, which is only a “soft” recommendation. |
| **2** | • Credit check **24h** after Application.<br>• Applicant informed **48h** after Loan Decision.<br>• Followup Call before Close. | • **Yes** – Credit check performed 1h after Application.<br>• **No** – *Inform Applicant* never occurs (so certainly not 48h).<br>• **No** – No Followup Call recorded. | The absence of the “Inform Applicant” step is a **normative** breach, but even if we view it as a timingrecommendation, the applicant is never notified, which is far below the desideratum. |
| **3** | • Credit check **24h** after Application.<br>• Applicant informed **48h** after Loan Decision.<br>• Followup Call before Close. | • **No** – Credit check performed **49h** after Application.<br>• **No** – Inform Applicant performed **51h** after Decision.<br>• **No** – No Followup Call recorded. | All three soft recommendations are missed, but the hardprocess sequence is still honoured. |

**Interpretation of “desiderata” failures:**  
- **Timing lapses** (24h / 48h) are *tolerated* in the sense that they do not make the process invalid, but they indicate slower operational performance.  
- **Missing Followup Call** is purely optional; its absence is noted but not considered a process error.  

Thus, **Case2** and **Case3** both fall short of the desiderata (Case1 only lacks the optional followup).  

---

## 3.  Possible Interpretations / Justifications  

| Case | Plausible explanation (consistent with the constraints) |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | The case ran smoothly; the only “gap” (no Followup Call) could be because the client was already satisfied with the immediate communication (email/SMS) and the loan officer judged a call unnecessary. |
| **2** | • **Order reversal** – Likely a dataentry slipup or a workflow that allowed “Risk Assessment” to be triggered automatically before the credit check was logged. <br>• **Missing “Inform Applicant”** – May have been an oversight; perhaps the system autoclosed the case after the rejection and the officer forgot to log the notification. <br>• **Finalisation after rejection** – Could reflect a “goodwill” gesture (e.g., sending a rejection letter with a summary of the decision) that was mistakenly recorded as a formal documentation step. <br>In any case, the observed behavior violates the strict rules and would need corrective action (reordering the steps, ensuring the applicant is notified, removing the finalisation for rejections). |
| **3** | • **Delayed Credit Check** – Could be due to a backlog of external creditbureau queries (e.g., weekend or holiday). <br>• **Delayed Notification** – The 51hour gap may stem from internal routing (the decision had to be reviewed by a supervisor before communication). <br>• **No Followup Call** – Possibly omitted because the applicant had already been emailed the decision and the officer saw no need for an extra call. <br>All three are softrecommendation breaches, not processinvalidating errors, but they suggest a need for tighter SLA monitoring (e.g., autoreminders for the 24h/48h windows). |

### BottomLine Takeaways  

1. **Strict Normative Compliance:** Only **Case2** is seriously noncompliant. It must be corrected (reorder the Credit Check and Risk Assessment, add the “Inform Applicant” activity, and remove the finalisation step for the rejected loan).  

2. **Soft Desiderata Compliance:**  
   - **Case1** – perfect timing, only missing the optional followup.  
   - **Case2** – fails the timing recommendations (no notification at all) and lacks the followup.  
   - **Case3** – violates both the 24hour creditcheck and 48hour notification windows and also omits the followup, but the core process sequence remains intact.  

3. **Improvement Suggestions:**  
   - Implement automated sequence checks in the casemanagement system to prevent ordering violations (e.g., block “Risk Assessment” until “Credit Check” is recorded).  
   - Set SLAs (e.g., 24h for credit check, 48h for applicant notification) with alert flags when they are breached.  
   - Add a simple “Followup Call” tickbox that can be left blank, but remind users to consider it.  

By addressing the normative breach in **Case2** and tightening the SLA monitoring for **Cases2** and **3**, the organisation can achieve full strict compliance while also moving closer to the desired bestpractice performance.
