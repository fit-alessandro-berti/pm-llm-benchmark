Here's the structured **process tree** that captures the observed behavior from the event log:  

```
-> ( 'Receive Application (RA)',
    -> ( 'Validate Form (VF)',
        * ( -> ( 'Assess Eligibility (AE)',
                X ( tau, -> ( 'Request Missing Info (RMI)', 'Validate Form (VF)' ) )
              ),
            tau
          ),
        -> ( 'Approval Decision (AD)',
            -> ( 'Send Confirmation (SC)', 'Archive Case (AC)' )
          )
      )
  )
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sequence (`->`) starts with `Receive Application (RA)`.**
2. **Validation (`Validate Form (VF)`) happens next.**
3. **Loop (`*`) captures the re-validation scenario:**
   - After `Assess Eligibility (AE)`, there's an **exclusive choice (`X`)**:
     - Either proceed (`tau`, meaning no additional steps).
     - Or enter a **loop**, where `Request Missing Info (RMI)` occurs, followed by another `Validate Form (VF)`.
   - The loop allows multiple repetitions before exiting.
4. **After validation and possible looping, process moves forward (`->`) to:**
   - `Approval Decision (AD)`, followed by:
   - `Send Confirmation (SC)`, then:
   - `Archive Case (AC)` as the final step.

### Key Features:
âœ… **Captures the main sequence** from application receipt to archiving.  
âœ… **Models optional rework loop** for missing information requests and re-validation.  
âœ… **Balances fitness, precision, and simplicity** by keeping the structure clear and aligned with observed behavior.
