Based on the comparison of the event logs, **the log for Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits systematic bias favoring its members.**

This bias manifests not as a penalty against the Protected Group (A), but rather as a built-in, positive mechanism applied exclusively to the Unprotected Group (B) based on specific demographic or affiliation data.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how this bias is identified:

---

## 1. Analysis of Attributes and Score Adjustment

The core difference lies in how the `ScoreAdjustment` column is utilized:

### Group A (Protected Group)
*   **LocalResident:** Consistently `FALSE`.
*   **CommunityGroup:** Consistently `None`.
*   **ScoreAdjustment:** Consistently `0` or `N/A`. No positive modifications are applied to the preliminary score (720, 710, 740).

### Group B (Unprotected Group)
*   **LocalResident:** Consistently `TRUE`.
*   **CommunityGroup:** For cases U001 and U003, the applicant is associated with the **"Highland Civic Darts Club."** Case U002 has `None`.
*   **ScoreAdjustment:** Cases linked to the community group (U001 and U003) receive a **+10 (Community Boost)** during both the `PreliminaryScoring` and `ManualReview` stages. Case U002, which has no community affiliation, receives 0 adjustment.

### Identification of Bias
The system demonstrates a clear **systematic advantage** for members of Group B who possess the attributes (`LocalResident=TRUE` and association with a specific `CommunityGroup`). This advantage manifests as a guaranteed **+10 point boost** that is entirely absent in the workflow for Group A, irrespective of their initial scores or affiliation status.

## 2. Impact on Final Decisions

This systematic score inflation for Group B leads to different outcomes for applicants with otherwise similar base scores compared to Group A.

### The Critical Comparison

The most telling evidence of bias is found by comparing an applicant from Group A who was rejected with an applicant from Group B who was approved despite having a lower baseline score:

| CaseID | Group | LocalResident | PreliminaryScore | ScoreAdjustment | Final Adjusted Score | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P002** | A (Protected) | FALSE | **710** | 0 | 710 | **Rejected** |
| **U003** | B (Unprotected) | TRUE | **695** | +10 (Boost) | 705 | **Approved** |

**Conclusion on Systematic Difference:**
Applicant U003 from the Unprotected Group (B) was approved with a final adjusted score of 705. If U003 had followed the process for Group A (i.e., received no score adjustment), their score would have remained 695, which is significantly lower than the 710 score achieved by applicant P002, who was rejected.

**The bias demonstrates that belonging to Group B and meeting the criteria for the `Community Boost` creates a lower threshold for approval compared to the baseline established by Group A.** The system is structurally engineered to provide preferential treatment via score manipulation for the Unprotected Group members associated with that specific community attribute.
