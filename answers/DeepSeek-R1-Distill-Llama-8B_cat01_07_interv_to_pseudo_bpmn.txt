Okay, so I need to create a BPMN-like textual model based on these interview transcripts about the invoice approval process. I'm not very familiar with BPMN, but I know it's a way to model business processes visually. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by identifying the key steps in the process. From the interviews, the process begins when an invoice arrives. Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk, checks for a valid purchase order number. If it's missing, she sends it back to the supplier. If it has a PO, she logs it, then sends it to Purchasing for confirmation. After that, she matches the invoice to the PO and sends it to the manager for approval. If there are discrepancies, she handles them by contacting Purchasing or escalating to her supervisor. Once approved, it's scheduled for payment.

Then, Dan, the Purchasing Officer, receives the invoice from AP and checks against the PO. He looks for quantity, price, and delivery charges mismatches. If there's an issue, he contacts the supplier or asks AP to hold the invoice. Once everything's correct, he confirms it, and it goes to the manager for approval.

Carlos, the Department Manager, is one of the last to approve. He checks quantities, pricing, and budget compliance. If something's off, he might reject it or ask for further investigation. His approval is a final step before it goes back to AP for payment.

Rita, the AP Supervisor, deals with exceptions. She steps in when there are issues Mary can't resolve, like missing info or discrepancies. She works with suppliers and departments to resolve these, then the invoice moves back into the normal flow for manager approval and payment.

Karen, the Supplier Relationship Manager, is involved when invoices don't match the agreed terms. She helps resolve issues by contacting suppliers for missing POs or pricing discrepancies, ensuring the process can continue.

Now, I need to structure this into a BPMN-like model. I know BPMN includes elements like Start, Task, Gateway, Role, and Data Object. Let me outline the sequence and the possible decision points.

Starting with the Invoice Arrival. Mary receives it via email. Then she checks for PO number. If no PO, she sends back to supplier. If yes, she logs it. Then to Purchasing for confirmation. She matches the invoice, sends to manager. If discrepancies, she handles them, and escalates if needed. After approval, it's scheduled for payment.

Dan's role is to confirm from Purchasing. So after Mary logs in and sends to Purchasing, Dan checks against PO. If issues, contact supplier or hold. Then confirms.

Carlos is the manager, so after Purchasing confirms, the manager gets notified. He checks quantities, pricing, etc. If issues, he may reject or ask for more info. If okay, he approves.

Exceptions: If discrepancies can't be resolved by Mary or Purchasing, it goes to Rita. She works on resolving, then sends back to normal flow.

Karen is involved when there's a missing PO or pricing issues. She contacts suppliers to get the info or revised invoices.

So, the process has several steps: Invoice Arrival, Check PO, Send Back if No PO, Log and Forward to Purchasing, Confirm from Purchasing, Match Invoice to PO, Send to Manager, Manager Approval,.Resolve Discrepancies, Schedule Payment.

The decision points are at Mary's step: does the invoice have a PO? And at Carlos' step: does the manager approve or reject? Also, when Rita is involved, if discrepancies can't be resolved.

For Roles, we have Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, AP Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager.

Artifacts include the Invoice, Purchase Order, Confirmation email, and any discrepancies noted.

Exceptions are missing PO, pricing discrepancies, or PO number issues that can't be resolved, leading to Rita's involvement.

Now, I'll structure this into a BPMN-like textual model.
