To diagnose the performance issues in the process based on the provided process variants, let’s analyze the specific routes that have high performance times (latency). We'll extract key details such as variants with high performance values and then investigate potential causes within the process flow.

### Key Observations from the data:

1. **Variants without rejections or re-submissions (The best-case scenario)**
   - **Highest Frequency**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`  
     - Frequency: 4618
     - Performance: 810,187.903
     - **Analysis**: This is one of the most efficient paths with the highest volume. The time taken is around 810K, which serves as a reasonable baseline. However, this is not the fastest path, which implies there could still be process inefficiencies.
      
2. **High-performance issues are strongly correlated with processes involving rejections and re-submissions**:
   - Variants that include rejections exhibit much longer performance times.
   - **For Example**:
     - `Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> (Multiple Resubmissions)`  
       - Frequency: 36
       - Performance: 2,542,497.917
       - **Root Cause**: Rejections followed by multiple re-submissions drastically increase the time to resolution. Potential issues:
         - Extensive communication loops between employees and approvers.
         - Delays related to employees needing to revise and resubmit declarations.
         - Repeated rejections could indicate unclear rejection reasons.

### Highlighting Underperforming Variants:

1. **Rejections by Multiple Approvers Slows Down the Process Significantly**:
   - **Example Variant**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
     - Frequency: 10
     - Performance: 2,054,847.800
     - **Root Cause**: This variant involves approvals by both ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER followed by a rejection by the SUPERVISOR. Reaching this stage only to be rejected and sent backward significantly increases process time. Rejections at later stages introduce long bottlenecks because it forces earlier steps to be repeated.

2. **Rejection Loops Between EMPLOYEE and ADMINISTRATION:**
   - **Example Variant**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration REJECTED -> RE-Approval cycle (various roles)`
     - Frequency: Variable (common pattern seen in many variants: 11, 6, etc.)
     - Performance: As high as **3,502,608.250** for this pattern.
     - **Root Cause**: Similar to #1 but with even more cyclic rejections between multiple approvers (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, or SUPERVISOR). This suggests that rejections are causing serious delays, especially when repeated multiple times in a single instance. Improvements could focus on streamlining the clarity of rejection criteria or reducing the need for subsequent resubmission steps.

3. **Variant with BUDGET OWNER Rejecting Declarations**:
   - **Example Variant**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Resubmit and get approved`  
     - Frequency: 14
     - Performance: **1,005,677.500** to **2,247,841.050**
     - **Root Cause**: When the rejection happens at the "BUDGET OWNER" level after already being approved by ADMINISTRATION, it indicates that there's likely miscommunication or inconsistency in criteria for approvals amongst approvers. The EMPLOYEE has to rework the submission only after significant processing time has already passed.

4. **"Missing" Approval/ Rejection Issues**:
   - **Example Variant**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED -> FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration RESUBMITTED -> FINAL_APPROVED and Payment Handled`
     - Frequency: 40
     - Performance: **1,947,246.400** 
     - **Root Cause**: A process step marked as **MISSING** causes performance issues. It may be an unclear or undefined event in the process flow where responsibilities are poorly defined. This requires further investigation as gaps in responsibility (or missing actors in the process) seem to cause delays and errors in handling declarations.

5. **Delays from PRE_APPROVER-related rejections and approvals**:
   - **Example Variant**:  
     `Declaration SUBMITTED -> Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Resubmitted`  
     - Frequency: 8  
     - Performance: **4922455.714**   
     - **Root Cause**: Steps involving PRE_APPROVER roles introduce a noticeable delay in performance, especially if the role both rejects and later re-approves declarations. There could be inconsistencies or delays in communication between this approver and the employee.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Multiple Roles Involved in Re-Approval**: The performance issues compound when more roles (e.g., BUDGET OWNER, ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER) join the rejection/approval process. This introduces longer waiting periods between role handoffs.
- **Employee Delays in Reacting to Rejections**: Many of these re-submissions seem to be bottlenecked by reactions to rejection. Employees might delay resubmissions due to unclear rejection reasons or required amendments, further contributing to delays.
  
### Summary of Process-Specific Root Causes:

1. **Rejections by Multiple Approvers (ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, and SUPERVISOR)** significantly amplify performance issues, especially when declarations have to be reworked and resubmitted.
  
2. **Repeated Rejections and Resubmissions** (particularly loops between EMPLOYEE and ADMINISTRATION, or other approvers) create cyclical delays that should be minimized where possible.

3. **Late-Stage Rejections** after prior approvals, such as rejections by BUDGET OWNER or SUPERVISOR, introduce major bottlenecks because earlier approvals become obsolete, requiring time-consuming rework.

4. **Gaps or Undefined Roles** (e.g., "MISSING" steps) create inefficiencies and need further investigation and clarification.

5. **PRE_APPROVER Roles** sometimes add considerable delays, especially when decisions are reversed or inconsistently handled.

### Recommendations:
1. **Improve Communication between Approvers** to reduce cases where declarations are approved by one party and rejected by another due to misaligned decision-making criteria.
2. **Clarify Rejection Reasons** to minimize the number of resubmissions and speed up the employee’s revision process.
3. **Streamline Touchpoints with PRE_APPROVER and BUDGET OWNER** in particular, as they add significant overhead during the decision-making phases.
4. **Investigate Undefined "MISSING" steps** to address any ambiguity and reduce delays related to this process step.
