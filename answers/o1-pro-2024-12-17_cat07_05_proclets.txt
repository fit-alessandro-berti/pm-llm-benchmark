The provided visualization is a depiction of a process modeling concept involving two related "proclet classes" (in this case, "Lab visit" and "Lab test") that communicate and synchronize their activities through defined channels. Essentially, it’s showing how two distinct but interconnected sub-processes (proclets) coordinate their work as part of a larger healthcare workflow—such as a patient’s lab visit and the associated laboratory tests.

**Breaking down the visualization:**

1. **Top-left diagram (a): Two proclets and their interactions**  
   In the main figure (labeled (a)), you see two main “proclet classes” represented as separate but connected diagrams:

   - **Lab visit proclet** (on the left):  
     This represents the process of a patient visiting a lab, having a blood sample taken, and waiting for results. The flow might be something like:
     - **Order entry**: A physician or system places an order for tests.
     - **Take blood sample**: A lab assistant collects the sample from the patient.
     - **Judge results**: Once results come back, the lab staff checks whether the outcomes are sufficient or if additional testing is needed.
     - If further testing is required: the process loops back to “Do tests again,” after which updated results are received.
     - **Everything is fine**: If results are satisfactory, the process moves on to “Send report” and provides the final outcome.

   - **Lab test proclet** (on the right):  
     This represents the actual laboratory testing process handled by a chemical analyst or a test machine. The flow might be:
     - **Perform test**: The lab test is initiated based on the order.
     - **Make report**: The test results are compiled into a preliminary report.
     - If retesting is needed: the process performs the test again and provides an updated report.
     - **Finish lab test**: Once the test(s) are complete and final results are provided, the laboratory portion of the workflow concludes.

   In the center, you see two sets of lines or edges connecting the two proclet classes. These represent communication channels (for instance, through a Hospital Information System (HIS)) where test requests and results flow between the “Lab visit” side and the “Lab test” side. Each arrow or communication point indicates a message exchange or data transfer—such as sending a request for a test, receiving preliminary results, requesting a retest, or receiving updated reports.

   The “1.1,” “1.2,” “1.3,” etc. markings within the dashed connectors could represent specific message interactions or interface steps between the two classes.

2. **Center-right diagram (b): Class diagram**  
   The small class diagram (b) shows a conceptual relationship between the two proclet classes. It clarifies that:
   - A “Lab visit” (the main patient workflow) *requires* one or multiple “Lab tests.”  
   This is basically a static, high-level relationship: the lab visit process depends on the lab tests being performed to complete its purpose.

3. **Bottom diagram (c): Example of a performative**  
   The table at the bottom (c) gives a concrete example of a communication act (a “performative”) between the two proclets:
   - **Time**: 11:00
   - **Channel**: Order system
   - **Sender**: “Lab visit” - HGB John (HGB might stand for hemoglobin test requested for patient John)
   - **Receivers**: Lab test – HGB John
   - **Action**: Create (this indicates the action being requested or performed)
   - **Content**: “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”
   - **Scope**: Private (the scope or visibility of this message)
   - **Direction**: OUT (the message is being sent out from the Lab visit to the Lab test proclet)

   This table shows how a single message in time is structured and clarifies the semantic content and direction of the communication. Such a “performative” is a formal way to specify what kind of action is being initiated or requested through the channel between the two processes.

**In summary**:  
The visualization is illustrating how two separate but interdependent workflow components—the patient’s lab visit process and the laboratory testing process—interact. The top section (a) displays a process-level interaction with arrows representing communication links for results and requests. The middle (b) shows a conceptual modeling relationship, and the bottom (c) provides a detailed example of a single communication event. Together, they highlight the modeling approach for distributing and coordinating tasks across multiple process “modules” (proclets) in a healthcare scenario.
