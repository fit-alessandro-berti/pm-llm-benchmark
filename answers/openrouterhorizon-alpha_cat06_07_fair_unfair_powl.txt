Below are two POWL models encoded using the described constructs. Both include the data-completeness loop and the overall sequence, but they differ in how the cultural fit step is handled.

Model 1: POWL with Potential Unfairness (XOR branch including CommunityAffiliationCheck)
Python-style construction using pm4py POWL classes:

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities
receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
parse_check = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
affiliation = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness: do parse_check; if incomplete, request_info then parse_check again
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[parse_check, request_info])

# XOR after skill assessment: either standard cultural fit or community affiliation path (potential bias)
xor_culture = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, affiliation])

# Partial order over the main blocks
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive, data_loop, skill, xor_culture, manager, final_decision])
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill, xor_culture)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor_culture, manager)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(manager, final_decision)

Notes:
- The loop models the completeness check and re-requesting info.
- After SkillAssessment, the XOR allows either StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck. This second branch encodes the subtle uplift and is the potential unfairness source.
- ManagerialReview can be influenced by implicit affiliation cues, then FinalDecision.

Model 2: POWL Without Unfairness (no special community-based branch; a single cultural fit step for all)
Python-style construction using pm4py POWL classes:

from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Activities
receive = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
parse_check = Transition(label="ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck")
request_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_uniform = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
manager = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[parse_check, request_info])

# No XOR here; everyone takes the same cultural fit path
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[receive, data_loop, skill, cultural_fit_uniform, manager, final_decision])
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill, cultural_fit_uniform)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_uniform, manager)
root_fair.order.add_edge(manager, final_decision)

Summary of the difference:
- Unfair model: SkillAssessment -> XOR(StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.
- Fair model: SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck (uniform for all) -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision.
Both models preserve the initial ReceiveApplication and the data completeness loop before skills assessment. The unfairness is explicitly isolated in the XOR branch that can grant an implicit advantage to affiliated/local applicants. Removing that XOR in the fair model ensures identical treatment during the cultural fit phase.
