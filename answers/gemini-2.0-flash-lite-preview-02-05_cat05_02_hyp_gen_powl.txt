# Identify anomalies in the POWL model
# 1. Loop
# 2. XOR for skipping
# 3. Potential for closing prematurely.

# 1. Loop behavior: claims that go through evaluation
# 2. The system allows for a loop of claims which contains the (E,P) nodes.

# 3. The system allows for closing before and after steps are taken
#    because it does not strongly enforce that A must complete before loop,
#    or that the loop must complete before C.
#    It allows for edge cases that might not be valid.
#    This is observed by the `root.order.add_edge(A, C)` edge.
#    If we also consider the loops, any path to C can be reached.

# 4. It's an XOR that chooses between the notification and the skip event, or if they should be performed.

# Hypothetical causes for the anomalies:
# 1. The loop structure represents a reimplementation of the evaluation/approval process.
# 2. The XOR represents a potential workaround or bypass for scenarios.
# 3. It could represent a lack of control mechanisms.
# 4. The model might be a result of a poor design.
# 5. The claims can be closed and handled by the loop, so it might also lead to closing
#    before approval/evaluation.

# Queries

# 1. Query to find claims where C happens before the loop or before E or P:
#   - This is an edge case anomaly.
#   - select * from claim_events ce where activity = 'C' and claim_id in (
#      select ce2.claim_id from claim_events ce2 where activity in ('E','P') and ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
#   )
#   - select * from claim_events ce where activity = 'C' and claim_id in (
#      select ce2.claim_id from claim_events ce2 where activity in ('A') and ce2.timestamp > ce.timestamp
#   )

# 2. Queries to identify claims where the loop structure may be at play:
#   - Identify claims where E and P appear multiple times for the same claim_id
#   - select claim_id, count(*) from claim_events where activity in ('E','P') group by claim_id having count(*) > 1
#   - Identify claims where there is an E followed by another E or P.

# 3. Queries to identify claims where the notification has been skipped:
#   - Claims for which we have R, A, E, P, and C, but not N
#   - select c.claim_id from claims c inner join claim_events ce on c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
#     where ce.activity in ('R', 'A', 'E', 'P', 'C')
#     except
#     select c.claim_id from claims c inner join claim_events ce on c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
#     where ce.activity = 'N';

# 4. Queries to identify claims where the approval or eval happened, then C:
#   - select * from claim_events ce where activity = 'C' and claim_id in (
#      select ce2.claim_id from claim_events ce2 where activity in ('E','P') and ce2.timestamp < ce.timestamp
#   );
