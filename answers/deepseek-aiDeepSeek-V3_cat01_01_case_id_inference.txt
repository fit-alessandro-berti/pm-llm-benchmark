To infer the case groupings, we need to analyze the attributes of each event, such as `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, `department`, and the logical sequence of activities. Hereâ€™s how the events can be grouped into separate cases:

### **Case 1:**
- **Patient:** 45-year-old male
- **Department:** ER
- **Activities:**
  1. **Register patient** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:05:13Z, resource: Admin Clerk)
  2. **Initial triage** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:10:50Z, resource: Nurse Joy, triage_code=3)
  3. **X-ray imaging** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:15:42Z, resource: Radiology Tech, body_part=left_leg)
  4. **Doctor consultation** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:23:10Z, resource: Dr. Lee, diagnosis=hairline_fracture)
  5. **Patient discharged** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:30:05Z, resource: Ward Clerk, followup=outpatient_clinic)

### **Case 2:**
- **Patient:** 62-year-old female
- **Department:** ER
- **Activities:**
  1. **Register patient** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:02Z, resource: Admin Clerk)
  2. **Initial triage** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:12:29Z, resource: Nurse Mark, triage_code=2)
  3. **Lab test requested** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:10Z, resource: Dr. Smith, test_type=blood_panel)
  4. **Lab test completed** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:20:27Z, resource: Lab Technician, results=normal_levels)
  5. **Doctor consultation** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, resource: Dr. Smith, diagnosis=minor_infection)
  6. **Prescription created** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:27:00Z, resource: Dr. Smith, medication=antibiotics)
  7. **Patient discharged** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, resource: Ward Clerk, followup=pharmacy_pickup)

### **Case 3:**
- **Patient:** 28-year-old male
- **Department:** Surgery
- **Activities:**
  1. **Register patient** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, resource: Admin Clerk)
  2. **Doctor consultation** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, resource: Dr. Lee, reason=scheduled_knee_surgery)
  3. **Surgery preparation** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, resource: Surgical Nurse, prep_type=general_anesthesia)
  4. **Surgery performed** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:25:19Z, resource: Dr. Lee, procedure=arthroscopy)
  5. **Recovery room** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:31:37Z, resource: Recovery Nurse, condition=stable)
  6. **Patient discharged** (timestamp: 2024-03-15T08:40:13Z, resource: Ward Clerk, followup=physiotherapy_sessions)

### **Summary of Case Groupings:**
- **Case 1:** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15
- **Case 2:** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
- **Case 3:** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18

Each case represents a distinct patient journey, with events logically ordered based on the sequence of activities and consistent patient attributes.
