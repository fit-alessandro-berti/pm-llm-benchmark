Justification of Renaming Choices

1. Verify Documents  
   • “Initial Document Verification”: Always the first check of customer-supplied documents immediately after the request is initiated.  
   • “Supplementary / Post-Adjustment Document Verification”: Occurs after new evidence (extra ID) or after an internal account change; purpose is to confirm that the earlier deficiency has been resolved.  
   • Branch cases carry “(Branch)” to stress that the verification happens face-to-face rather than remotely.

2. Call Customer  
   • “Call Customer – Request Missing Docs”: Triggered by incomplete documentation (Additional Context explicitly says so).  
   • “Clarification Call to Customer”: First outbound call in C002; goal is to clarify an account discrepancy.  
   • “Confirmation Call to Customer”: Second call in C002; confirms that adjustments were made—clearly a follow-up.  
   • “Return-to-Branch Call”: In-branch scenario where the officer tries to get the walk-away customer to come back.

3. Other activities either do not recur in the same case or their meaning does not shift, so their names remain unchanged (with a “(Branch)” suffix only where it clarifies the on-site origin).

By encoding purpose, sequence, and location directly in the activity names, the revised log disambiguates repeated labels and makes the process flow self-explanatory for both analysts and automated discovery tools.
