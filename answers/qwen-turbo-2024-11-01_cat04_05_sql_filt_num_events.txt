Sure, here's a DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task described:

```sql
WITH case_event_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM 
        event_log
    GROUP BY 
        case_id
),
filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id
    FROM 
        case_event_counts
    WHERE 
        event_count <= 6
)
SELECT 
    el.*
FROM 
    event_log el
JOIN 
    filtered_cases fc ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation:
1. **case_event_counts CTE**: This common table expression (CTE) calculates the number of events (`event_count`) for each `case_id`.
2. **filtered_cases CTE**: This CTE filters out `case_id`s where the `event_count` is greater than 6.
3. **Final SELECT Statement**: The final query selects all rows from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` is present in the `filtered_cases` CTE.

This ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.
