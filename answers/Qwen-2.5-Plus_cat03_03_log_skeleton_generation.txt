To construct the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to define the constraints based on logical dependencies and business rules that typically govern such processes. Below is a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        # Example: If RO occurs, then IC should have the same occurrences.
        ('Receive Order', 'Invoice Customer')
    },
    'always_before': {
        # Example: CA must always occur before RI.
        ('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items'),
        ('Reserve Items', 'Pick Items'),
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')
    },
    'always_after': {
        # Example: Invoice Customer should be executed after Dispatch.
        ('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer')
    },
    'never_together': {
        # Example: Receive Order and Record Payment cannot co-exist in the same case.
        ('Receive Order', 'Record Payment')
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        # Bounds the number of occurrences for each activity.
        'Receive Order': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Check Availability': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Reserve Items': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Pick Items': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Quality Check': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Pack Order': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Generate Shipping Label': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Dispatch': {1},  # Should occur exactly once per case.
        'Invoice Customer': {0, 1},  # Can occur zero or one time (if payment is not immediate).
        'Record Payment': {0, 1}  # Can occur zero or one time (depending on payment method and timing).
    },
    'directly_follows': {
        # Example: Quality Check should directly follow Pick Items.
        ('Pick Items', 'Quality Check'),
        ('Quality Check', 'Pack Order'),
        ('Pack Order', 'Generate Shipping Label'),
        ('Generate Shipping Label', 'Dispatch')
    }
}

# Display the log skeleton
print(log_skeleton)
```

### Explanation:
- **Equivalence:** In this example, `('Receive Order', 'Invoice Customer')` implies that if an order is received, it should also be invoiced with the same frequency.
- **Always Before:** These are sequential dependencies where one activity must precede another. For instance, `('Check Availability', 'Reserve Items')` indicates that availability checking must happen before reserving items.
- **Always After:** This ensures that certain activities follow others at some point, like `('Dispatch', 'Invoice Customer')`.
- **Never Together:** Activities like `('Receive Order', 'Record Payment')` should not co-occur in the same case, as receiving an order happens long before any potential payment record update.
- **Activity Occurrences:** Each activity has specific bounds on how many times it can occur within a case. For instance, most activities should occur exactly once, while invoicing and payment recording might vary.
- **Directly Follows Constraints:** These enforce strict sequences where one activity must immediately follow another, ensuring smooth transitions between key steps.

This structure provides a clear and structured way to represent the constraints governing the order fulfillment process using the Log Skeleton framework.
