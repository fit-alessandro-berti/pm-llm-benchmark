**Explanation of Added Constraints to Mitigate Bias:**

1.  **Added Existence Constraints for Sensitive Attributes and Mitigation:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Explicitly includes an activity for checking the applicant's race, making this step visible in the process.
    *   `"CheckApplicantGender": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Explicitly includes an activity for checking the applicant's gender.
    *   `"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Introduces a `ManualReview` activity, which can serve as a point for closer scrutiny.
    *   `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Adds a dedicated activity for performing a bias check before making a final decision.
    *   `"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Explicitly models the 'Approve' decision.
    *   `"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}`: Explicitly models the 'Reject' decision.

2.  **Added Coexistence Constraints:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Enforces that if the applicant's race is checked, a `ManualReview` must also occur within the process instance. This ensures that sensitive race information is not used in an automated or unreviewed fashion.
    *   `"CheckApplicantGender": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Similar to the race constraint, ensures a manual review happens if gender is checked.
    *   `"Approve": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Requires that a `BiasMitigationCheck` coexists with an `Approve` decision. This promotes fairness even in positive outcomes, ensuring that the approval wasn't biased towards a non-sensitive attribute.
    *   `"Reject": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Requires that a `BiasMitigationCheck` coexists with a `Reject` decision. This is crucial for preventing discriminatory rejections.

3.  **Added Response Constraints:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Mandates that after the `CheckApplicantRace` activity occurs, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must eventually occur in the trace. This prevents proceeding directly to a decision without a bias check after seeing racial information.
    *   `"CheckApplicantGender": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Similar to the race constraint, ensures a bias check after checking gender.

4.  **Added Succession Constraints:**
    *   `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Enforces that the `Approve` decision must immediately follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`. This ensures the bias check is the last step before a decision.
    *   `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Similarly, enforces that the `Reject` decision must immediately follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`.

5.  **Added Non-Succession Constraints:**
    *   `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Explicitly prevents the `Reject` activity from immediately following the `CheckApplicantRace` activity. This is a direct constraint against biased decisions based on race information without any intervening activities.
    *   `"CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`: Prevents the `Reject` activity from immediately following the `CheckApplicantGender` activity.

These added constraints work together to inject fairness into the process. They ensure that sensitive attribute information triggers additional review steps and explicit bias checks before decisions are made, and they directly forbid immediate transitions from sensitive attribute checks to negative outcomes. This makes the process more transparent and provides structural safeguards against discriminatory decision-making.
