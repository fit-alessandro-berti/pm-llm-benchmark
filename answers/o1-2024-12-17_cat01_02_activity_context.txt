**Justification for Renaming**

- **Verify Documents**:  
  This activity occurs multiple times within the same case, but its context changes. The first occurrence is always the initial check. A subsequent occurrence takes place after the customer provides additional documents or after the account is adjusted.  
  - Example: "Verify Documents (Initial)" vs. "Verify Documents (Re-check with Additional Documents)" or "Verify Documents (Re-verify After Account Adjustment)"

- **Call Customer**:  
  This activity also appears multiple times in the same case, each time for a different purpose. The first call might be to request missing documents or clarify discrepancies. The subsequent call could be to confirm changes or follow up on a customerâ€™s action.  
  - Example: "Call Customer (Request Additional Documents)" vs. "Call Customer (Confirm Adjustments)"

By explicitly encoding these contextual nuances into the activity names, it becomes easier to understand the purpose and sequence of events in the process. The naming reveals the evolution of the case, from initial checks to problem resolution and final approval.
