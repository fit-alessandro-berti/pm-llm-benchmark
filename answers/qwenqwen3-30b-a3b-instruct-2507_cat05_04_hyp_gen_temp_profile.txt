**Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model:**

1. **(R  P): Receive to Approve**  
   - Average: ~25 hours (90,000 seconds), with a very low standard deviation (3,600 seconds = 1 hour).  
   - **Anomaly:** The consistency of timing (low STDEV) suggests a rigid, possibly automated or scheduled approval process that may bypass real evaluation. This uniformity is suspicious in a natural workflow where delays vary due to complexity, adjuster workload, or claim type.

2. **(P  N): Approve to Notify**  
   - Average: 7 days (604,800 seconds), STDEV: 2 days (172,800 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** The long average delay combined with high variability indicates inconsistent handling—some claims are notified immediately, others wait up to 11 days. This inconsistency may point to a backlog, lack of prioritization, or manual intervention delays.

3. **(A  C): Assign to Close**  
   - Average: 2 hours (7,200 seconds), STDEV: 1 hour (3,600 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** Closure occurring so quickly after assignment—without apparent evaluation or approval—suggests that some claims may be closed prematurely. This raises concerns about process integrity, especially if the "Evaluate" or "Approve" steps are skipped.

4. **(E  N): Evaluate to Notify**  
   - Average: 5 minutes (300 seconds), STDEV: 1 minute (60 seconds).  
   - **Anomaly:** The extremely short and consistent time between evaluation and notification is implausible in most real-world scenarios. It may indicate that the notification step is automated immediately after evaluation, possibly without proper review or customer communication protocols.

**Hypotheses on Root Causes:**

1. **(R  P) Low STDEV:**  
   - *Hypothesis:* A backend system or workflow engine is scheduling approvals at fixed intervals (e.g., every 25 hours), regardless of claim complexity. This could be an artificial batch process or a system bug that forces approvals without human oversight.

2. **(P  N) High STDEV & Long Average:**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Notification is manually triggered by a small team, leading to inconsistent response times. Some claims may be delayed due to low priority, lack of staffing, or poor integration between approval and communication systems.

3. **(A  C) Short Duration:**  
   - *Hypothesis:* Claims are being closed prematurely—possibly due to automation logic that closes claims after assignment if no further actions are recorded. This may indicate missing audit trails or a flawed closure rule.

4. **(E  N) Extremely Fast & Consistent:**  
   - *Hypothesis:* The "Notify" event is being triggered automatically and instantly upon "Evaluate" completion, bypassing any required review or customer service touchpoint. This could indicate a lack of proper process validation or a misconfigured workflow.

**Verification via SQL Queries:**

1. **Identify claims with suspiciously short (R  P) time:**
```sql
WITH claim_time_deltas AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS receive_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('R', 'P')
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) AS r_to_p_seconds
FROM claim_time_deltas
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (approve_time - receive_time)) < 7200  -- < 2 hours
ORDER BY r_to_p_seconds ASC;
```
> *Purpose:* Find claims where approval happens unusually fast—possibly indicating batch processing or automation bypassing evaluation.

2. **Check for claims with (P  N) delay exceeding 5 days:**
```sql
WITH claim_time_deltas AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS approve_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('P', 'N')
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) AS p_to_n_seconds,
  (notify_time - approve_time) AS p_to_n_duration
FROM claim_time_deltas
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - approve_time)) > 432000  -- > 5 days
ORDER BY p_to_n_seconds DESC;
```
> *Purpose:* Identify claims with long approval-to-notification delays, flagging potential bottlenecks.

3. **Check for claims closed immediately after assignment (A  C):**
```sql
WITH claim_time_deltas AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS assign_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS close_time
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('A', 'C')
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) AS a_to_c_seconds
FROM claim_time_deltas
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (close_time - assign_time)) < 3600  -- < 1 hour
ORDER BY a_to_c_seconds ASC;
```
> *Purpose:* Flag claims where closure happens within an hour of assignment—potential premature closure.

4. **Investigate (E  N) anomalies: Immediate notifications after evaluation:**
```sql
WITH claim_time_deltas AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS evaluate_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS notify_time
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  WHERE ce.activity IN ('E', 'N')
  GROUP BY c.claim_id
  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
    AND MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  claim_id,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) AS e_to_n_seconds,
  (notify_time - evaluate_time) AS e_to_n_duration,
  c.claim_type,
  c.claim_amount
FROM claim_time_deltas
JOIN claims c ON claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (notify_time - evaluate_time)) < 120  -- < 2 minutes
ORDER BY e_to_n_seconds ASC;
```
> *Purpose:* Identify claims where notification follows evaluation too quickly, potentially indicating skipped steps or automated bypasses.

5. **Correlate anomalies with adjusters and regions:**
```sql
WITH anomaly_flags AS (
  SELECT 
    c.claim_id,
    c.claim_type,
    c.claim_amount,
    a.name AS adjuster_name,
    a.region,
    -- Flag short R  P
    CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p_time - r_time)) < 7200 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS r_to_p_fast,
    -- Flag long P  N
    CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time)) > 432000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS p_to_n_long,
    -- Flag fast A  C
    CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c_time - a_time)) < 3600 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS a_to_c_fast,
    -- Flag fast E  N
    CASE WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - e_time)) < 120 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS e_to_n_fast
  FROM claims c
  JOIN claim_events ce ON c.claim_id = ce.claim_id
  JOIN adjusters a ON ce.resource = a.name
  -- Pivot timestamps
  PIVOT (
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'R' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS r_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'A' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS a_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'E' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS e_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'P' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS p_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'N' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS n_time,
    MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = 'C' THEN ce.timestamp END) AS c_time
  ) ON (c.claim_id)
  WHERE r_time IS NOT NULL AND p_time IS NOT NULL AND n_time IS NOT NULL AND c_time IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  adjuster_name,
  region,
  COUNT(*) AS total_claims,
  SUM(r_to_p_fast) AS fast_r_to_p,
  SUM(p_to_n_long) AS long_p_to_n,
  SUM(a_to_c_fast) AS fast_a_to_c,
  SUM(e_to_n_fast) AS fast_e_to_n
FROM anomaly_flags
GROUP BY adjuster_name, region
ORDER BY fast_r_to_p DESC, long_p_to_n DESC;
```
> *Purpose:* Identify if certain adjusters or regions are disproportionately responsible for anomalous timing patterns—indicating training gaps, process deviations, or system configuration issues.

These queries provide a data-driven approach to validate the anomalies, isolate root causes, and guide corrective actions in the claims process.
