<answer>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the event log, identify recurring activities with changing contextual meanings, rename them to reflect their differences, and justify the choices. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:


### **1. Identify Recurring Activities and Contextual Differences**
We examine activities that appear multiple times (e.g., `Verify Documents`, `Call Customer`, `Initiate Request`) and interpret how their meaning changes based on position, purpose, or context:

- **"Verify Documents"**  
  - Appears in multiple cases (C001 twice, C002 once, C003 twice). Contexts differ: initial verification (before follow-ups) or verification after obtaining additional documents/adjustments.  
- **"Call Customer"**  
  - Appears in multiple cases (C001 once, C002 twice, C003 once). Purpose differs: requesting documents, clarifying discrepancies, confirming adjustments, or fetching customers.  
- **"Initiate Request"**  
  - Appears in all cases, differing by initiation channel (online vs. branch).  
- **"Adjust Account"**  
  - Appears in two cases (C002, C003). Contexts differ: resolving discrepancies or correcting missing information.  
- **"Approve Request"**  
  - Appears once per case, with consistent context ("Final approval given").  


### **2. Renaming Recurring Activities**
We rename activities to reflect their contextual differences, ensuring clarity in process flow.

- **"Verify Documents"**:  
  - *Initial Document Verification* (initial check before follow-ups)  
  - *Post-upload Document Verification* (verification after document upload)  
  - *Post-adjustment Document Verification* (verification after account adjustment)  
- **"Call Customer"**:  
  - *Document Upload Request Call* (requesting document upload)  
  - *Discrepancy Clarification Call* (clarifying account issues)  
  - *Adjustment Confirmation Call* (confirming account changes)  
  - *Customer Fetch Call* (fetching a customer who stepped out)  
- **"Initiate Request"**:  
  - *Online Initiate Request* (via WebPortal, online)  
  - *Branch Initiate Request* (via BranchReception, walk-in)  
- **"Adjust Account"**:  
  - *Discrepancy Adjustment* (adjusting for account discrepancies)  
  - *Missing Information Adjustment* (adjusting for missing information)  
- **"Approve Request"**:  
  - *Final Approval* (consistent final step)  


### **3. Revised Event Log with Renamed Activities**
Here's the updated log with clarified activity names:

### **4. Justification of Naming Choices**
Each renaming is driven by **contextual clues** to eliminate ambiguity:

- **"Verify Documents"**:  
  Renamed to reflect the stage (initial, post-upload, post-adjustment), so users can tell if it's the first verification or a re-verification after an action. For example, *"Post-upload Document Verification"* clarifies it happens *after* document upload, rather than being confused with the first verification.  

- **"Call Customer"**:  
  Renamed to explain the purpose of the call (e.g., *Discrepancy Clarification Call* shows the call is to clarify account issues, not for a different reason). This avoids confusion between calls with different goals.  

- **"Initiate Request"**:  
  Renamed by channel (online/branch) to show how the customer reached out, which is a key operational difference between cases.  

- **"Adjust Account"**:  
  Renamed based on the reason (discrepancy/missing info) to show why the adjustment occurred, ensuring clarity on the root cause of the step.  

- **"Final Approval"**:  
  Retained as a consistent term since all instances are the final approval step, making it clear that this is the last action in the workflow.  

These changes ensure each activity name reflects its specific role in the process, reducing confusion and improving readability of the log.
