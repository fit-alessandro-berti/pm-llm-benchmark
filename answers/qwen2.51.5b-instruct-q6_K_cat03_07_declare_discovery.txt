Certainly! Below is a simplified and simplified example of how you might structure the `DECLARE` clause in SQL, assuming that each operation can be represented as an individual state or step in a larger business process.

### Simplified Example Model

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create Fine
CREATE_FINE:
CREATE_FINE: /* This will create a fine, possibly with various notifications and payment steps. */

-- Payment (frequency=10)
PAYMENT():
PAYMENT:
   INSERT_FINE_NOTIFICATION:
   ADD_PENALTY:
   SEND_FINE:
    WHEN_FREQUENCY(10):
       PROCESS_APPEAL_TO_JUDGE: // Check for court appeal
       IF_APPEARED TO JUDGE THEN
          PAY:
           RECONSIDERED THEN UPDATE PERFORMANCE:

          END IF_REAPPEALED;

                INSERT_DATE_APPEalTToPrefectUtY:
                PROCESS_RESULT_APpeal_toPREFECTY
            ADD_PENALTY_TO_FINE: // Add any fines or penalties for appeal process.
            
       ELSEIF_NOT_FREQUENCY(10):
           PAYMEnt

     WHEN_FREQUENCY(15)
   IF_FREQUENCY(12) THEN 
      /* Notification to offender, further credit collection steps */
      ELSE_IF_FREQUENCY(9)

    END IF_FREQUENCY(11); 

-- Additional states could include:
-- // Any other fine or penalty types (CREATE_FINE, PAYMENT, etc.)
END;
```

In this model:

- `CREATE_FINE` is a state where you create the initial fine.
- Each operation is represented by its associated steps within parentheses.

### Example Explanation

1. **Create Fine**:
   - Creates a general fine with notifications and starts the payment flow.
2. **Payment** (frequency=10):
   - Tracks fines that fall under specific periods. This step will add additional penalties, send for credit collection based on frequency, etc.
3. **Reconsidered OR Appeal Process to Judge**:
   - If the fine is reconsidered or appealed, the process will continue to handle court proceedings and payment adjustments.

### Key Aspects of the Schema

1. **Frequency Tracking**: Different fines have different criteria for frequency (how often they renew).
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks the performance metrics associated with each operation.
3. **Notification System**: Implements a system for notifications regarding appeals, credit collections, etc.
4. **Process Handling**: Handles multiple outcomes based on predefined conditions.

This model provides a basic structure to manage your state machine in SQL. Adjustments can be made as per specific requirements or additional validations you add to the workflow.
