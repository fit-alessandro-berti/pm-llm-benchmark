To create a DECLARE model for the given process variants, we need to translate each variant into rules that capture both existence and non-existence constraints between activities. Given the complexity of some variants (e.g., `Chain response` and `Chain precedence`, which include multiple activities with specific orderings), it might be beneficial to break down these processes into more manageable components before modeling.

Here's a simplified version of the DECLARE model for this process, assuming each activity is represented by its name:

```python
{
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': 1.0,
        'Send Fine': 1.0,
        'Insert Fine Notification': 1.0,
        'Add penalty': 1.0,
        # Other activities should also be added similarly.
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {},
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': None,  # Indicates the process starts with Create Fine
    },
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {},
    'precedence': {
        # Placeholder for the order of precedence constraints (e.g., before and after).
    },
    'succession': {
        # Placeholder for successions.
    },
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {},
    'chainprecedence': {},
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {},
    'nonsuccession': {},
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Existence and Absence**: Both `existence` and `absence` fields are initially set to `{}` since no specific activities have been excluded or explicitly included.

2. **Exactly One**: Similarly, the `exactly_one` field is empty as no constraints specify exactly one activity should be executed.

3. **Initialization**: The `init` dictionary indicates that the process starts with the "Create Fine" activity.

4. **Responded Existence and Coexistence**: These fields are initialized to `{}` since no specific activities have been responded to or co-occurred in any variant.

5. **Response, Precedence, Succession, Alternate Response, Alternate Precedence, Alternate Succession, Chain Response, Chain Precedence, Chain Succession, Non-Coexistence, and Non-Succession**: These fields are similarly empty due to the lack of detailed constraints specified for each activity invariants.

### Further Steps:

To fully model this process, you would need more information about specific orderings or exclusions. For example, if `Chain response` or `Chain precedence` were present, it could look like this:

```python
{
    'existence': {
        # Existing activities here...
    },
    'absence': {},
    'exactly_one': {},
    'init': {
        # Initialization rule for the process (e.g., "Create Fine" at start)
    },
    'responded_existence': {},
    'coexistence': {},
    'response': {
        # Response rules here...
    },
    'precedence': {
        # Precedence constraints
    },
    'succession': {
        # Succession rules
    },
    'altresponse': {},
    'altprecedence': {},
    'altsuccession': {},
    'chainresponse': {
        # Chain response rules...
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        # Chain precedence rules...
    },
    'chainsuccession': {},
    'noncoexistence': {
        # Non-coexistence constraints
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        # Non-succession constraints
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {}
}
```

This model will help you understand the relationships between activities and their support/frequencies, making it easier to analyze and visualize process behavior.
