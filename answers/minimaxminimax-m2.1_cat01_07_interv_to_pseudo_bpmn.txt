The user is asking me to create a BPMN-like textual process model based on interview transcripts about an invoice approval process. I need to analyze the interviews and create a structured, visualizable model that captures:

1. Activities/Tasks
2. Sequence Flow
3. Gateways/Decision Points
4. Roles/Participants
5. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs
6. Exceptions/Variations

Let me analyze each interview:

**Interview 1 (Mary - Accounts Payable Clerk):**
- Invoice received (usually by email)
- Check if PO number exists
- If no PO  send back to supplier
- If PO exists  log into accounting system
- Forward to purchasing for confirmation of receipt
- Get confirmation from purchasing
- Match invoice line items against PO
- If match  send to department manager
- If discrepancy  email purchasing to clarify
- If can't resolve  escalate to supervisor
- After manager approval  schedule for payment
- Manager approval triggered by system after receipt confirmation and invoice matches PO

**Interview 2 (Dan - Purchasing Officer):**
- Receives invoice from AP
- Checks if invoice matches PO (quantities, prices, delivery charges)
- If issues  contact supplier or ask AP to hold until corrected
- If everything correct  send confirmation to AP
- If PO missing  tell Mary to get info
- Never approve without PO reference
- After confirmation  moves to manager for approval
- After approval  goes to AP for payment run

**Interview 3 (Carlos - Department Manager):**
- Gets notification after invoice matched to PO and Dan confirms
- System shows invoice details, PO, confirmation
- If good  approve in system
- If suspicious (budget issues, unexpected items)  reject or ask Mary to hold
- After approval  goes back to AP for payment cycle

**Interview 4 (Rita - AP Supervisor):**
- Involved in exceptions
- If Mary can't match or purchasing has issues  escalated to Rita


- Handles missing information, invoice discrepancies, and informal service contracts
- Creates retrospective POs or decides on invoice rejection
- Works to resolve problems and return invoice to normal process
- Ensures problematic invoices don't get stuck

**Interview 5 (Karen - Supplier Relationship Manager):**
- Collaborates with Accounts Payable and Purchasing to resolve invoice issues
- Contacts suppliers for missing PO numbers or pricing discrepancies
- Verifies contract terms to correct invoice problems
- Supports smooth invoice processing without direct system approvals

**Key Process Flow:**
1. Invoice arrives via email
2. Verify purchase order existence
3. Route invoice to relevant stakeholders
4. Confirm receipt and match details
5. Escalate unresolved issues
6. Obtain department manager approval
7. Process payment in accounting system

**Roles:**
- Mary handles initial invoice processing
- Dan validates purchase order details
- Carlos provides final approval
- Rita manages complex invoice exceptions
- Karen resolves supplier-related discrepancies

**Artifacts:**
- Critical documents: Invoice, Purchase Order, Email Correspondence
- System Integration: Accounting software tracks each process stage

**Process Variations:**
- Multiple resolution paths for missing or incorrect documentation
- Exception handling through targeted intervention
- Collaborative problem-solving across departments

# BPMN-Like Process Model: Invoice Approval Process

## Overview

This textual BPMN model captures the invoice approval process based on stakeholder interviews. The process begins when an invoice arrives and ends when the invoice is scheduled for payment. Multiple roles participate, with a primary flow and several exception handling paths.

---

## Participants/Roles

- **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary):** Primary handler of incoming invoices; responsible for initial processing, logging, matching, and scheduling payments
- **Purchasing Officer (Dan):** Validates invoice against purchase orders; confirms goods/services receipt
- **Department Manager (Carlos):** Provides final approval before payment scheduling
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita):** Escalation point for unresolved exceptions and discrepancies
- **Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen):** Facilitates supplier communication for issue resolution
- **Supplier:** External participant who provides invoices and responds to clarification requests

---

## Process Flow

### Start Event: Invoice Received

The process initiates when an invoice arrives, typically via email, to the Accounts Payable department.

---

### Activity 1: Receive and Log Invoice

- For invoices without PO (informal service contracts): work with department heads to create retrospective PO or determine rejection
- Ensure problem invoices do not get stuck indefinitely

**Output:** Resolved invoice or rejection decision

**Artifacts:** Correspondence records, retrospective PO (if created), rejection documentation

---

##### Path 2A-iii-a: Create Retrospective PO

**Condition:** Invoice is valid but lacks PO because it was for informally contracted services

**Action:** AP Supervisor coordinates with department head to create a retrospective purchase order

**Next Step:** Invoice returns to normal flow with retrospective PO

---

**Output:** Approval request notification to Department Manager

**Artifacts:** Invoice details, PO reference, Purchasing confirmation summary

---

### Path 3B: Match Fails

**Condition:** System cannot match invoice to PO (data entry errors, pricing mismatches, quantity discrepancies)

**Action:** Return to exception handling flow (Gateway 2A)

**Notes:** This creates a loop back to discrepancy resolution before manager approval can proceed.

---

### Activity 4: Manager Review and Approval

**Output:** Invoice scheduled for payment

---

### End Event: Payment Scheduled

The invoice has successfully completed the approval process and is queued for payment disbursement according to the organization's payment schedule.

---

## Exception Handling Summary

The process includes multiple exception paths that create loops back to earlier stages:

1. **Missing PO Number:** Invoice returned to supplier, held pending response
2. **Invoice-PO Mismatch:** Multiple resolution paths including supplier correction, Supplier Relationship Manager engagement, or AP Supervisor escalation
3. **System Match Failure:** Returns to discrepancy resolution before manager approval
4. **Manager Rejection:** Returns to investigation and potential escalation

The Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita) serves as the central escalation point for complex exceptions, particularly:
- Unresolved discrepancies
- Invoices without POs (informal contracts)
- Retrospective PO creation
- Invoices at risk of becoming "stuck" in the process

---

## Artifacts and Data Objects

| Artifact | Description | Role/Location |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Invoice | Original billing document from supplier | Received by AP Clerk, referenced throughout |
| Purchase Order | Original order document authorizing purchase | Held by Purchasing, referenced by AP |
| Confirmation Email | Purchasing Officer's validation of receipt | Sent to AP Clerk |
| Discrepancy Report | Documentation of invoice-PO mismatches | Created by Purchasing Officer |
| Contract/Agreement | Supplier contract with pricing terms | Referenced by Supplier Relationship Manager |
| Retrospective PO | PO created after the fact for informal contracts | Created by AP Supervisor with department head |
| Approval Notification | System-generated request to Manager | Triggered by successful match |
| Payment Run Record | Record of invoices scheduled for payment | Created by AP Clerk |

---

## Process Start and End

**Start Event:** Invoice received by Accounts Payable (typically via email)

**End Event:** Invoice scheduled for payment (after Manager approval and AP processing)

---

## Notes on Consolidation and Ambiguities

The model represents a consolidation of perspectives from all five interviews. Key points of consolidation include:

- The three-way match concept (invoice, PO, receipt confirmation) is consistently described across interviews
- The role of the system in triggering manager approval after match confirmation is mentioned by both Mary and Carlos
- Dan's role as the purchasing validation point is confirmed by both Mary and Carlos's accounts
- Rita's escalation role is clearly defined as the exception handler who prevents invoices from being stuck
- Karen's indirect role as facilitator through supplier relationships is acknowledged but she does not directly participate in the approval flow

**Uncertainty noted:** The timing of payment runs (daily, weekly, etc.) is not specified in the interviews and would need clarification for a complete model. Additionally, the exact trigger for when Karen becomes involved versus when Purchasing handles issues directly is not fully detailed.
