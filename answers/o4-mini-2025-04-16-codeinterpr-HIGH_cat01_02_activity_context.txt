Justification of renamings:

• Verify Documents  
  – “Initial Check” flags the very first documentvalidation step.  
  – “Post-Upload Re-Check” (C001) and “Post-Adjustment Re-Check” (C003) distinguish those follow-up verifications, triggered by new uploads or by internal corrections.  

• Call Customer  
  – In C001 the call is explicitly to *request missing documents*, so “Missing-Docs Request.”  
  – In C002 the first call *clarifies an account discrepancy* (“Account-Discrepancy Clarify”); the second *confirms* that the agent’s internal adjustments were applied (“Adjustment Confirmation”).  
  – In C003 the call’s purpose is to *recall a walk-out customer back to the branch*, hence “Recall-to-Branch.”  

These more granular names remove ambiguity about *which* “Verify Documents” or “Call Customer” step is occurring and make the workflow logic immediately clear.
