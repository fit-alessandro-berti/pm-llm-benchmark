Below is a casebycase analysis, highlighting sequences that deviate from a typical, wellcontrolled ProcuretoPay (P2P) process and why they are problematic.

### Reference: Typical P2P Order of Activities

A standard P2P flow (simplified) is usually:

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order (PO)  
4. Receive Goods / Services  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO (3way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

The key principles:  
- Approval before PO issuance.  
- PO before delivery and invoice.  
- Goods receipt before or at least by the time of invoice matching/payment.  
- Invoice matching before payment is released.

## Case 1001 – Looks Standard

Sequence:

1. Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  
2. Receive Goods  
3. Vendor Invoice Received  
4. Match Invoice to PO  
5. Release Payment  
6. Close Case  

No anomalies:  
- Approval is before issuing PO.  
- Goods are received before invoice matching and payment.  
- Payment happens after invoice matching.  
This case matches best practices.

## Case 1002 – Multiple Anomalies

**Actual sequence:**

1. Create Purchase Requisition (08:30, Feb 1)  
2. Issue Purchase Order (08:40, Feb 1)  
3. Vendor Invoice Received (07:00, Feb 3)  
4. Release Payment (07:15, Feb 3)  
5. Approve Purchase Requisition (08:00, Feb 3)  
6. Receive Goods (Feb 4)  
7. Match Invoice to PO (Feb 5)  
8. Close Case (Feb 6)

### Anomaly 1: PO Issued Before PR Approval  
- **Problem:** “Issue Purchase Order” occurs before “Approve Purchase Requisition.”  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - It undermines the authorization control: spending is committed before formal approval.  
  - This can violate internal control policies, audit rules, or delegated authority limits.  
  - Risk of unauthorized purchases and budget overruns.

### Anomaly 2: Payment Before PR Approval  
- Payment is released (Feb 3, 07:15) before the requisition is approved (Feb 3, 08:00).  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - Funds are disbursed before there is any documented approval for the underlying demand.  
  - This breaks segregation of duties and approval hierarchy principles.  
  - Strong red flag in audits and could indicate fraud or serious control weakness.

### Anomaly 3: Payment Before Goods Receipt  
- Payment (Feb 3) happens before “Receive Goods” (Feb 4).  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - Standard practice: pay only after goods/services are received and verified.  
  - Paying early exposes the company to:
    - Risk of nondelivery or partial delivery.  
    - Potential disputes about quality/quantity that are harder to resolve once payment is made.  

### Anomaly 4: Payment Before Invoice Matching  
- Payment (Feb 3) happens before “Match Invoice to PO” (Feb 5).  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - The 2 or 3way match (PO, goods receipt, invoice) is a key control to prevent overbilling or duplicate billing.  
  - Paying before matching can lead to:
    - Overpayments or payment of incorrect prices/quantities.  
    - Missed detection of errors or fraudulent invoices.

**Summary for Case 1002:**  
- Multiple severe control violations (authorization, matching, timing of payment).  
- This case is strongly anomalous and highrisk in a standard P2P environment.

## Case 1003 – Payment Before Invoice and Goods Receipt

**Actual sequence:**

1. Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  
2. Release Payment (Feb 8)  
3. Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 9)  
4. Receive Goods (Feb 10)  
5. Match Invoice to PO (Feb 11)  
6. Close Case (Feb 12)

### Anomaly 1: Payment Before Vendor Invoice  
- Payment (Feb 8) occurs before “Vendor Invoice Received” (Feb 9).  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - Usually, the invoice is the formal request for payment and the basis for accounting entries.  
  - Paying before an invoice:
    - Complicates reconciliation between payment and invoice.  
    - Can create unsupported payments (no invoice document to tie to at the time of payment).  

### Anomaly 2: Payment Before Goods Receipt  
- Payment (Feb 8) occurs before “Receive Goods” (Feb 10).  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - Same as in Case 1002: paying before confirming receipt violates a basic P2P control.  
  - Increases risk of paying for goods that are never delivered or delivered incorrectly.

### Anomaly 3: Payment Before Invoice Matching  
- “Match Invoice to PO” happens on Feb 11, after payment on Feb 8.  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - The control step (matching) is performed after the irreversible action (payment).  
  - Errors found during matching require recovery efforts (credit notes, refunds) rather than preventing the error.

**Summary for Case 1003:**  
- Structure at the start is fine (PR, approval, PO), but the financial control sequence is inverted (pay first, then receive invoice/goods, then match).  
- This is a serious process anomaly in a typical P2P setup.

## Case 1004 – Goods Received Before PO Issuance

**Actual sequence:**

1. Create PR  Approve PR  
2. Receive Goods (Feb 6, 09:00)  
3. Issue Purchase Order (Feb 6, 09:15)  
4. Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 7, 08:00)  
5. Match Invoice to PO (Feb 7, 08:30)  
6. Release Payment (Feb 7, 09:00)  
7. Close Case  

### Anomaly 1: Goods Receipt Before Issuing PO  
- “Receive Goods” occurs before “Issue Purchase Order.”  
- **Why problematic:**  
  - Standard practice: PO is a formal commitment and should be issued before the supplier ships or delivers.  
  - Receiving goods without a PO suggests:
    - Maverick/unauthorized purchasing (supplier ships based on informal communication).  
    - Difficulty in matching and controlling what was ordered vs. what was received.  
  - It weakens spend control and can complicate pricing disputes.

### Other Steps  
- Invoice receipt, matching, and payment occur in the correct order relative to each other.  
- The main anomaly is the timing of goods receipt vs. PO.

**Summary for Case 1004:**  
- Operationally plausible but noncompliant with standard control expectations: goods should not be received before a formal PO exists.

## Overall Anomaly Summary

- **Case 1001:** Normal, aligned with best practices.  
- **Case 1002:**  
  - PO before PR approval.  
  - Payment before PR approval, goods receipt, and invoice matching.  
  - This case is severely anomalous and highrisk.  
- **Case 1003:**  
  - Payment before invoice, goods receipt, and matching.  
  - Serious control violation from a financial and audit standpoint.  
- **Case 1004:**  
  - Goods received before PO issuance.  
  - Indicates uncontrolled or “maverick” purchasing behavior.

From a standard P2P and internal controls perspective, Cases 1002 and 1003 show critical financialcontrol anomalies, and Case 1004 shows significant operational/control issues around ordering discipline.
