Below is the standard highlevel ProcuretoPay (P2P) order of activities for reference:

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Receive Goods/Services  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO (and goods receipt)  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

Case 1001 closely follows this order, so I’ll treat that as the “reference” case. The anomalies are mainly in Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004.

### Case 1002 – Multiple Serious Sequence Violations

**Observed sequence (simplified):**

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Issue Purchase Order  
3. Vendor Invoice Received  
4. Release Payment  
5. Approve Purchase Requisition  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case  

**Anomalies:**

1. **PO issued before requisition approval**  
   - `Issue Purchase Order` (08:40) occurs before `Approve Purchase Requisition` (two days later, 08:00).  
   - Problem: In standard control frameworks, you should not commit to a supplier before internal approval. This undermines budgetary control and authorization procedures.

2. **Payment released before PR approval, before goods receipt, and before matching**  
   - `Release Payment` (20240203 07:15) comes:
     - Before `Approve Purchase Requisition` (20240203 08:00),
     - Before `Receive Goods` (20240204 09:00),
     - Before `Match Invoice to PO` (20240205 08:00).
   - Problem:
     - Paying before requisition approval undermines segregation of duties and approval workflows.
     - Paying before confirming goods were received exposes the company to paying for items that might never arrive or arrive incorrectly.
     - Paying before a 3way match (PO–Goods Receipt–Invoice) bypasses a key financial control for detecting errors and fraud.

3. **Invoice matching occurs after payment**  
   - `Match Invoice to PO` is after `Release Payment`.  
   - Problem: Matching after payment turns a preventive control into a detective one. Overpayments, wrong quantities, or fraud might only be discovered after the money is already gone, increasing recovery and audit risks.

Overall, Case 1002 shows a highly noncompliant P2P flow with several control breakdowns.

### Case 1003 – Payment Before Invoice, Goods Receipt, and Matching

**Observed sequence:**

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Issue Purchase Order  
4. Release Payment  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Receive Goods  
7. Match Invoice to PO  
8. Close Case  

**Anomalies:**

1. **Payment before invoice receipt**  
   - `Release Payment` (20240208 11:00) occurs before `Vendor Invoice Received` (20240209 12:00).  
   - Problem: Payment without an invoice removes a basic financial document needed to justify and post the liability. It complicates accounting, audit trails, and VAT/compliance treatment.

2. **Payment before goods receipt**  
   - `Release Payment` is also before `Receive Goods` (20240210 13:00).  
   - Problem: As in Case 1002, this means the company pays without confirming delivery, increasing risk of nondelivery, partial delivery, or quality issues with no leverage left over the vendor.

3. **Invoice matching after payment**  
   - `Match Invoice to PO` (20240211 14:00) is after payment.  
   - Problem: Same as above—key control is executed too late, making it harder to prevent errors or fraudulent invoices.

This looks like prepayment or advance payment behavior. While not always wrong in itself, in standard P2P best practice such prepayments are explicitly controlled, approved as exceptions, and clearly flagged. Here, it appears as an uncontrolled deviation from the normal flow.

### Case 1004 – Goods Receipt Before Purchase Order

**Observed sequence:**

1. Create Purchase Requisition  
2. Approve Purchase Requisition  
3. Receive Goods  
4. Issue Purchase Order  
5. Vendor Invoice Received  
6. Match Invoice to PO  
7. Release Payment  
8. Close Case  

**Anomalies:**

1. **Goods received before PO issuance**  
   - `Receive Goods` (20240206 09:00) occurs before `Issue Purchase Order` (20240206 09:15).  
   - Problem:
     - Normally, a PO is the formal commitment sent to the supplier before delivery. Receiving goods before there is a PO suggests:
       - Maverick buying (ordering outside the formal process),
       - Backdated or “covering” POs to regularize an alreadyoccurred transaction,
       - Weak purchasing controls and lack of traceability of who authorized the order and on what terms.
     - It makes it harder to verify agreed prices, delivery terms, or discounts at the moment of receipt.

The rest of the flow (invoice receipt  matching  payment) is in the proper order, but the frontend control (PO before delivery) is compromised.

### Summary of Main Anomalies Across Cases

- **Case 1001:** Follows standard P2P sequence; no material anomalies.
- **Case 1002:**  
  - PO issued before requisition approval.  
  - Payment before requisition approval, before goods receipt, and before invoice matching.  
  - Matching done after payment.  
   High control risk, weak authorization, and elevated fraud/overpayment risk.

- **Case 1003:**  
  - Payment before invoice receipt.  
  - Payment before goods receipt.  
  - Matching done after payment.  
   Looks like uncontrolled prepayment; weak financial and operational controls.

- **Case 1004:**  
  - Goods receipt before PO issuance.  
   Indicates potential maverick buying, backdated POs, and poor purchasing discipline.

All these deviations are problematic because they bypass standard preventive controls embedded in P2P, increase exposure to fraud and error, and create audit and compliance issues.
