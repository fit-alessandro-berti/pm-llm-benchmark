### Step 1: Analyze the Patterns in the Event Log

To infer activities from the event log, we will examine trends and patterns across the sensor readings. Here's a breakdown of the key observations for each column:

- **Temperature (°C):** Significant increases in temperature often indicate energy-intensive operations like cutting or welding.
- **Pressure (bar):** High pressure might suggest processes requiring force, such as welding or assembling parts under pressure.
- **Vibration Level (Hz):** High vibration levels are typically associated with mechanical actions like cutting or grinding.
- **Material Flow (units/s):** Non-zero values here likely correspond to material being processed or moved, which could relate to assembly or packaging.
- **Tool Position (mm):** Changes in tool position may indicate different stages of operation, such as moving tools into place for specific tasks.
- **Energy Consumption (kWh):** Higher energy usage correlates with more intensive operations like cutting or welding.

### Step 2: Group Events Based on Patterns

#### Group 1: Idle State
- **Events:** 1–3, 13–15
- **Characteristics:**
  - Low temperature (~20°C)
  - Minimal pressure (~1 bar)
  - No vibration (~0 Hz)
  - Zero material flow
  - Tool position at rest (0 mm)
  - Very low energy consumption (~0.4–0.5 kWh)
- **Rationale:** These events represent an idle state where no activity is occurring.

#### Group 2: Cutting Metal
- **Events:** 4–6
- **Characteristics:**
  - Temperature rises sharply (~50–58°C)
  - Slight increase in pressure (~1–1.5 bar)
  - High vibration levels (~30–38 Hz)
  - Moderate material flow (~5 units/s)
  - Tool position moves incrementally (~5–10 mm)
  - Increased energy consumption (~2–3 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The combination of rising temperature, high vibration, and moderate energy use strongly suggests a cutting operation.

#### Group 3: Assembling Parts
- **Events:** 7–8
- **Characteristics:**
  - Stable temperature (~40°C)
  - Moderate pressure (~2 bar)
  - Low vibration (~10 Hz)
  - Low material flow (~2 units/s)
  - Fixed tool position (~15 mm)
  - Moderate energy consumption (~2 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The steady conditions with low vibration and consistent material flow align well with an assembling process.

#### Group 4: Welding
- **Event:** 9
- **Characteristics:**
  - Extremely high temperature (~80°C)
  - Moderate pressure (~2 bar)
  - Very high vibration (~50 Hz)
  - No material flow (~0 units/s)
  - Fixed tool position (~15 mm)
  - High energy consumption (~5 kWh)
- **Rationale:** The extreme temperature and high energy usage point to a welding operation.

#### Group 5: Quality Inspection
- **Events:** 10–12
- **Characteristics:**
  - Cooling down after previous activity (~30–25°C)
  - Minimal pressure (~1 bar)
  - Low vibration (~1–5 Hz)
  - Low material flow (~0–1 units/s)
  - Tool position adjusted slightly (~15–20 mm)
  - Moderate energy consumption (~1–1.6 kWh)
- **Rationale:** After completing a task, the system stabilizes while performing checks, likely quality inspection.

### Step 3: Assign Labels to Each Group

| **Group** | **Label**          | **Events** | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Idle State         | 1–3, 13–15 | System is not actively processing; all sensors show minimal activity.           |
| 2         | Cutting Metal      | 4–6        | Sharp rise in temperature, high vibration, and moderate energy usage indicate cutting. |
| 3         | Assembling Parts   | 7–8        | Stable conditions with low vibration and consistent material flow suggest assembly. |
| 4         | Welding            | 9          | Extreme temperature and high energy usage correspond to welding.                |
| 5         | Quality Inspection | 10–12      | Cooling period with slight adjustments in tool position suggests inspection.     |

### Final Output

Here’s the labeled sequence of activities based on the event log:

1. **Idle State** (Events 1–3)
2. **Cutting Metal** (Events 4–6)
3. **Assembling Parts** (Events 7–8)
4. **Welding** (Event 9)
5. **Quality Inspection** (Events 10–12)
6. **Idle State** (Events 13–15)

This analysis demonstrates how process mining techniques can be applied to unlabeled numerical data to infer meaningful manufacturing activities.
