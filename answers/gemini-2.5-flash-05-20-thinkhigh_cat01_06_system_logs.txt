To transform the raw Windows activity log into a process mining event log, we need to identify logical units of work (cases), define meaningful activities, and extract relevant attributes for each event.

### Logic Applied for Transformation:

1.  **Case Identification (`Case ID`):**
    *   A "case" is defined as a continuous work session centered around a specific document or a singular task.
    *   The `Window` title (e.g., `Quarterly_Report.docx`, `Document1.docx`, `Report_Draft.pdf`, `Budget_2024.xlsx`) is primarily used to identify distinct documents, which form the basis for case identification.
    *   For generic windows like "Email - Inbox", the specific action (e.g., "Open Email about Annual Meeting") is used to infer a distinct logical unit (e.g., handling a particular email).
    *   When the user switches from one document/task to another (`SWITCH` or `FOCUS` on a new distinct window), a new case is initiated *unless* they return to a previously active document.
    *   If a user returns to a document they were working on earlier, the activities are appended to the *existing* case for that document, indicating a resumption of work.
    *   Case IDs are named descriptively (e.g., `WORD_QuarterlyReport_Case_1`, `EMAIL_AnnualMeeting_Case_1`) to reflect the primary artifact or task.

2.  **Activity Naming (`Activity Name`):**
    *   Raw actions (`FOCUS`, `TYPING`, `SAVE`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`, `HIGHLIGHT`, `CLOSE`) are translated into higher-level, standardized activity names that are more representative of process steps.
    *   Context from `App`, `Window`, and `Action`/`Keys`/`Text` attributes helps in refining activity names. For instance, `TYPING` in Word becomes "Edit Word Document", while `TYPING` in Chrome (Email) becomes "Compose Email Reply".
    *   `SWITCH` events are generally treated as transitions between activities or cases and are not explicitly included as standalone activities in the final log. The subsequent `FOCUS` or `CLICK` event then marks the start of the activity for the new context or the resumption of an existing one.

3.  **Event Attributes:**
    *   **Case ID**: Unique identifier for the process instance.
    *   **Activity Name**: Standardized description of the user action.
    *   **Timestamp**: Original time of the event.
    *   **Application**: The software application involved in the event.
    *   **Document_Window**: The specific window title or document name being interacted with, providing granular context.

### Explanation of Logic:

The transformation creates five distinct cases, each representing a logical unit of work focused on a specific document or email interaction:

1.  **`WORD_QuarterlyReport_Case_1`**: This case captures the user's work on "Quarterly\_Report.docx". It starts with the initial `FOCUS` on the document at `08:59:50Z`, then gets interrupted, and is later `FOCUS`ed on again at `09:07:15Z`, showing a resumption of work on the same report. The case concludes when the document is `CLOSE`d at `09:08:15Z`.

2.  **`WORD_Document1_Case_1`**: This case represents the drafting and editing of "Document1.docx". It begins at `09:00:00Z` with the initial `FOCUS`. The user performs several `TYPING` and `SAVE` actions. There's a notable interruption where the user switches to email and then Excel. However, the case resumes at `09:06:15Z` when the user switches *back* to "Document1.docx" to continue editing (likely referencing the budget figures). The case officially ends when "Document1.docx" is `CLOSE`d at `09:07:00Z`.

3.  **`EMAIL_AnnualMeeting_Case_1`**: This case captures the entire email handling process. It starts when the user `CLICK`s to "Open Email about Annual Meeting" at `09:02:00Z`, follows through with `SCROLL`ing (reviewing), `CLICK`ing "Reply", `TYPING` the response, and finally `CLICK`ing "Send Email" at `09:03:20Z`. The email actions are grouped into a single case, as they relate to one coherent interaction.

4.  **`PDF_ReportDraft_Case_1`**: This case focuses solely on the review and annotation of "Report\_Draft.pdf". It begins with the `SCROLL` action at `09:04:30Z` (implied opening after the switch) and includes `HIGHLIGHT`ing actions, indicating a review process.

5.  **`EXCEL_Budget2024_Case_1`**: This case represents the work done on "Budget\_2024.xlsx". It starts at `09:05:00Z` with the `FOCUS` event, involves `TYPING` (editing figures), and concludes with a `SAVE` at `09:05:45Z`. This case is distinct, even though its output might have influenced `WORD_Document1_Case_1`, as the primary entity of work shifted.

**Activity Naming Standardization:**
Activities are named consistently across different applications where the underlying action is similar (e.g., "Open Word Document", "Open Excel Document"). Specific actions like "Open Email", "Send Email", "Annotate PDF Document" are used when they represent unique, higher-level steps. Low-level actions like "SCROLL" are generalized into "Review Email" or "Review PDF Document" to reflect the user's intent. `SWITCH` actions are omitted from the event log as activities themselves, as they merely signal a context change rather than a process step within a specific case. The subsequent `FOCUS` or `CLICK` events effectively mark the beginning of the relevant activity in the new or resumed case.
