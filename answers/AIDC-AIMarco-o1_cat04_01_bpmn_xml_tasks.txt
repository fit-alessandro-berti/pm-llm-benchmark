Alright, I need to extract and list all the tasks from the given BPMN 2.0 XML. First, I'll analyze the XML structure to identify elements that represent tasks. In BPMN, tasks are typically represented by the `<bpmn:task>` element. 

Looking at the XML, I see several `<bpmn:task>` elements with unique identifiers and names:
1. `id="idb86a1356-bb12-4a45-b1a3-d430cf587b6b"` with name "decide"
2. `id="idd3814e0c-ae8b-41d6-b7a1-7c0e9385eb3e"` with name "pay compensation"
3. `id="id8c2e27f2-838e-47e7-9506-1387d1d642eb"` with name "check ticket"
4. `id="id1c963927-0fbe-4028-9d31-536a6e5362a9"` with name "examine casually"
5. `id="id3a2e2f29-0e15-4dca-9602-6f8929a0dbcb"` with name "register request"
6. `id="idfe1bd2a5-fb67-4a1a-b520-d7d02ee587e7"` with name "reject request"
7. `id="idc5b9256f-0a5c-43f7-9877-8a7d17977ee2"` with name "examine thoroughly"
8. `id="id25fcead3-d54b-47a1-b9dc-5ac5df8a31db"` with name "reinitiate request"

These are the tasks identified in the process model. Each task has a unique identifier (`id`) and a descriptive name. It's important to note that these tasks are part of a parallel and exclusive gateway structure, which suggests a complex workflow with decision points and branching paths.

Additionally, there are start and end events, but since the question specifically asks for tasks, I'll focus on the `<bpmn:task>` elements. The start event is `id="id56711e94-7c7b-4c1d-8d12-ef3ed256da80"` with name "start", and the end event is `id="id3fe498e9-097b-4628-96b0-639beba726c7"` with name "end". However, these are not tasks but control flow elements.

To summarize, the process model includes the following tasks:
- decide
- pay compensation
- check ticket
- examine casually
- register request
- reject request
- examine thoroughly
- reinitiate request

These tasks are interconnected through various exclusive and parallel gateways, indicating a dynamic workflow where decisions are made at certain points, leading the process in different directions based on specific conditions or inputs.
