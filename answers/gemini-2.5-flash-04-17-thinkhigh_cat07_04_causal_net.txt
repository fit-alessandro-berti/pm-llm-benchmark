The image displays a process flow diagram, likely representing a business process or workflow. The diagram consists of labeled rectangular nodes (tasks or activities) connected by directed edges. Small black circles are interspersed along the edges, representing points of control or decision-making.

Here's a breakdown of the visual elements:

* **Nodes:** Square nodes labeled with letters and descriptive text. These represent distinct steps in the process (e.g., "a: register request", "b: examine thoroughly", "e: decide", "z: end").
* **Edges:** Arrows connecting the nodes, indicating the sequence of activities.
* **Black Circles:** These dots along the edges represent transitions or synchronization points. Their configuration and placement indicate the type of control flow.
* **Inset Diagram:** In the bottom right corner, there's a gray box illustrating different types of control flow structures:
    * **Splits:**
        * **XOR-split:** One input, multiple outputs, only one path is taken.
        * **AND-split:** One input, multiple outputs, all paths are taken in parallel.
        * **OR-split:** One input, multiple outputs, one or more paths are taken.
    * **Joins:**
        * **XOR-join:** Multiple inputs, one output, merges exclusive paths.
        * **AND-join:** Multiple inputs, one output, merges parallel paths (requires all inputs to arrive).
        * **OR-join:** Multiple inputs, one output, merges alternative or parallel paths.

The main diagram utilizes these split and join patterns to depict the flow of the process, including choices, parallel activities, and merging of paths. For example, after "register request (a)", the process splits into multiple possibilities, and after "decide (e)", the process joins the paths leading to either "pay compensation (g)" or "reject request (h)". The curved arrows between nodes "d" and "f" and from "f" back to nodes "b", "c", and "d" suggest a loop or iteration within the process.

In summary, the visualization is a detailed diagram illustrating the steps and flow of a process using labeled nodes, directed edges, and control flow indicators (black circles and the inset legend).
