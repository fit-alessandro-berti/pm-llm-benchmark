 To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to compare the process variants and their performance metrics. Here are the main differences based on the provided information:

1. **Rejection Rates**:
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of rejection after screening (1036 vs 2490 for the unprotected group) and even after extensive screening (793 vs 1022). This suggests a potential bias in the screening process where the protected group is more likely to be rejected.

2. **Extensive Screening**:
   - The protected group undergoes extensive screening more frequently before rejection (793 times) compared to the unprotected group (1022 times). This could indicate that members of the protected group are subjected to more stringent checks, which may not be justified and could be discriminatory.

3. **Contract Signing and Tenancy Duration**:
   - The protected group has fewer instances of signing a contract and moving in compared to the unprotected group. For example, the variant with the most rent payments before cancellation in the protected group involves eight payments (frequency = 11), while in the unprotected group, it involves ten payments (frequency = 45). This suggests that even when the protected group is accepted, their tenancy duration may be shorter on average.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - The performance metrics (total time spent in the process) for similar process variants are generally higher for the protected group. For instance, the process of moving in and then canceling after several rent payments shows higher performance numbers for the protected group, indicating that they may be experiencing longer processing times or delays.

5. **Eviction Rates**:
   - The unprotected group has a specific process variant involving missing a rent payment, receiving a warning, and then being evicted (frequency = 6). There is no similar variant mentioned for the protected group, which could mean that the protected group is either not given a warning or is evicted without this step, or simply that this scenario is less common or not captured in the data provided.

6. **Frequency of Process Variants**:
   - The unprotected group shows a higher frequency across almost all process variants, suggesting that they are more successful in navigating the process and reaching the final
