Based on the provided log skeleton process model and its constraints, here is a high-level description of the process:

1. **Process Initiation**: The process begins with the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL" activity. This typically involves an employee seeking approval from the admin, supervisor, or another key approver. There are 5 occurrences of this activity addressed to different roles within the process.

2. **Approval Flow**: 
   - If the "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION" is approved, subsequent actions include:
     - If APPROVED: "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" follows. This could indicate that the employee is proceeding to the next step based on approval.
     - If REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION: "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" follows.
     - If REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER: "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" also follows, potentially suggesting the action is discarded at this stage.
   
   - If "Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR" is approved, it leads to:
     - "Declaration REJECTED by MISSING": A notification role handling rejections.
     - "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" follows.
     - Can potentially lead to "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE" again if re-tested or re-submitted based on Supervisor's decision.
   
   - The approval process culminates with "Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR" where the decision signifies final approval.

3. **Rejection Paths**:
   - Functions as a fallback line if the primary approval processes fail. "Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE" indicates the end of the approval path from the first level without valid reception.
   - "Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION", "REJECTED by SUPERVISOR", or "REJECTED by BUDGET_OWNER" indicate various points in the process where insufficiencies or conditions are not met leading to rejection. These paths are looped through if the process requires multiple attempts or reconsiderations.

4. **Resource Handling**: Activities such as "Request Payment" and "Payment Handled" may be a step somewhere in the approval flow, indicating when the final decision has been made to proceed with a financial transaction.

5. **Error Handling and Rejection**: The "Declaration REJECTED by" roles handle irregularities or issues flagged throughout the process, giving opportunities for re-submission, correction, or reconsideration.

6. **Saving Steps**: "Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE" records actions or states where the employee takes responsibility for saving data or records within the
