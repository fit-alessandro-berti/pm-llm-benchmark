Let's analyze the event log cases one by one against the standard Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process, which, in an ideal situation, follows this order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Deviations or out-of-order steps can indicate process violations, risks, or even potential fraud.

## **Case-by-Case Analysis**

### **Case 1001**
**Order of Steps:**  
Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

**Analysis:**  
This follows the standard P2P process. **No anomalies detected**.

### **Case 1002**
**Order of Steps:**  
Create PR  Issue PO  Vendor Invoice Received  Release Payment  Approve PR  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Anomalies Detected:**

- **'Issue Purchase Order' BEFORE 'Approve Purchase Requisition':**  
  - Normally, a purchase requisition must be approved before a PO is issued.  
  - *Problem:* Issuing a PO before approval could lead to unauthorized purchases.

- **'Vendor Invoice Received' and 'Release Payment' BEFORE 'Approve Purchase Requisition':**  
  - Payment is being processed before the requisition is even approved.
  - *Problem*: Serious compliance issue—can result in payment for unapproved or potentially fraudulent purchases.

- **'Release Payment' BEFORE 'Receive Goods' & 'Match Invoice to PO':**  
  - Payment is made before verifying receipt or matching invoice to PO.
  - *Problem:* Risk of paying for goods not yet received or for incorrect invoices.

**Summary:**  
This case violates several P2P controls, allowing purchases and payments before required approvals and confirmations.

### **Case 1003**
**Order of Steps:**  
Create PR  Approve PR  Issue PO  Release Payment  Vendor Invoice Received  Receive Goods  Match Invoice to PO  Close Case

**Anomalies Detected:**

- **'Release Payment' BEFORE 'Vendor Invoice Received', 'Receive Goods', and 'Match Invoice to PO':**  
  - Payment released before invoice is even received, goods are received, or the invoice is matched.
  - *Problem:* High risk of paying for goods never ordered, never received, or incorrect amounts. Breaches financial controls and increases risk of fraud or error.

---

### **Case 1004**
**Order of Steps:**  
Create PR  Approve PR  Receive Goods  Issue PO  Vendor Invoice Received  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case

**Anomalies Detected:**

- **'Receive Goods' BEFORE 'Issue Purchase Order':**  
  - Goods are being received before a purchase order is created.
  - *Problem:* Indicates goods may be supplied without any formal order, which undermines supply chain control, contract compliance, and opens potential for fraud or mistakes.

## **Summary Table of Anomalies**

| Case  | Anomaly Explanation                                        | Control/Risk Issue            |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1002  | PO issued & payment made before PR approval; payment before goods/invoice | Authorization, compliance, fraud risk |
| 1003  | Payment released before invoice received, goods received, or matching | Payment controls, fraud risk  |
| 1004  | Goods received before PO is issued                         | Supply chain control, compliance, fraud risk |

---

## **Why These Are Problematic**

- **Payment without approval or verification**: Greatest risk for fraud, overpayment, or paying for unreceived goods/services.
- **PO before PR approval**: Weakens spending controls; exposes the company to unauthorized commitments.
- **Receiving goods before issuing PO**: Generates confusion, potential for suppliers to deliver unapproved or unordered goods, and difficulty in tracking against contracts.

---

## **Conclusion**
**Standard P2P processes are bypassed in cases 1002, 1003, and 1004.**  
These anomalies are significant as they undermine essential internal controls, increase the risk of financial and compliance issues, and may indicate weaknesses in process adherence or system integrity. Immediate review and remediation is recommended.
