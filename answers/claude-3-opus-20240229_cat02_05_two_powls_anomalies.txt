After analyzing both POWL models in relation to a standard Hire-to-Retire process, I have identified several anomalies in each model. Let's discuss these anomalies and then determine which model more closely aligns with the normative version of the process.

**Anomalies in Model 1:**
1. The model allows "Conduct_Interviews" to happen in parallel with "Make_Hiring_Decision". This is illogical, as the decision should be made after all interviews are completed.
2. There is no explicit loop structure for potentially repeating the screening and interviewing steps for different candidates.

**Anomalies in Model 2:**
1. "Post_Job_Ad" and "Conduct_Interviews" can happen in parallel, which is not realistic. Interviews should only occur after candidates have been sourced through the job posting and screening process.
2. The loop structure around "Onboard_Employee" suggests that onboarding can happen multiple times for the same hiring case, which is usually not the case.
3. The exclusive choice (XOR) operator allows skipping the "Add_to_Payroll" activity. However, adding a new hire to payroll is typically a mandatory step, not optional.

**Comparison and Justification:**
Despite the anomalies present in both models, Model 1 more closely aligns with a normative Hire-to-Retire process for the following reasons:

1. Model 1 maintains a more logical sequence of key activities: posting the job, screening candidates, making a decision, onboarding, adding to payroll, and closing the case. While the parallel execution of interviews and decision-making is not ideal, the overall flow is closer to the standard process.

2. The anomalies in Model 1 are less severe compared to Model 2. Allowing interviews and decisions to happen concurrently is a deviation from best practice but doesn't fundamentally break the process logic. The lack of an explicit loop for screening and interviewing multiple candidates is also a less critical issue.

In contrast, the anomalies in Model 2 more significantly deviate from the standard process:

1. Allowing interviews to happen in parallel with posting the job ad fundamentally breaks the logical sequence of the hiring process.

2. The loop around onboarding suggests a structural issue that deviates from the typical one-time onboarding per hire.

3. Making payroll an optional step through the XOR operator is a severe anomaly, as adding a new employee to payroll is usually a critical, non-optional part of the process.

In conclusion, while both models contain anomalies, Model 1 more closely represents a standard Hire-to-Retire process. The anomalies in Model 1 are less severe and don't fundamentally break the core process logic, whereas the anomalies in Model 2 represent more significant deviations that undermine the integrity of the hiring workflow.
