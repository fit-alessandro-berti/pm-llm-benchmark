<think>
Alright, I have to create two POWL models based on the hiring process description at GlobalTeq Solutions. One model should include a potential source of unfairness, and the other should be fair by removing that source. Let me first understand the process steps and identify where the potential bias occurs.

From the description, the hiring process has several stages:

ReceiveApplication: Applicants submit their resumes and fill out a questionnaire.
DataCompletenessCheck: An automated system checks if the resume is complete. If not, there's a loop where the applicant is asked to provide more information.
SkillAssessment: Applicants take an online skill test, and those who pass proceed.
CulturalFitCheck: This is where potential bias can occur. There's an XOR branch: one path is a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other is a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that gives an advantage to applicants with certain affiliations.
ManagerialReview: A human reviewer looks at borderline candidates, and there might be unconscious bias based on affiliations.
FinalDecision: The final hiring decision is made.
Wait, actually, the description says that after the skill assessment, there's an XOR branching for the cultural fit check. One branch is the standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other is the CommunityAffiliationCheck, which gives a subtle advantage. Then, there's a managerial review and final decision.

But in the summary, it mentions that the XOR branch is where subtle bias can be introduced. So, in the unfair model, there should be an XOR choice between the standard cultural fit check and the CommunityAffiliationCheck.

In the fair model, there should be no such XOR branch; all applicants should go through the same cultural fit evaluation without any special path for community affiliations.

Also, there's a loop for data completeness: if the resume is incomplete, the applicant is asked to provide more information, and the check is repeated until the data is complete.

Additionally, after the cultural fit check, there's a managerial review for borderline candidates, but I think for the POWL model, we can simplify it to a sequence: after the cultural fit check, there's a managerial review, and then the final decision.

Wait, actually, the description says: "A human reviewer (hiring manager) examines borderline candidates. In the presence of implicit affiliations or local-community-based cues, reviewers may—consciously or unconsciously—view these candidates more favorably. The final decision is then made, either approving the candidate for hire or rejecting them."

So, the managerial review is specifically for borderline candidates, but in the workflow, it's probably part of the sequence after the cultural fit check. Maybe it's better to model it as a sequence: after cultural fit check, there's a managerial review, and then the final decision.

But to keep it simple, perhaps I can model the cultural fit check and the managerial review as part of the same step, since the bias can occur in both. Wait, no, the bias is primarily in the cultural fit check with the XOR branch.

Actually, in the unfair model, the XOR branch in the cultural fit check is where the bias is introduced, and then the managerial review might also be influenced, but for the POWL model, I think the key is to represent the XOR branch in the cultural fit check.

Let me try to outline the steps for both models.

For the POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

ReceiveApplication
DataCompletenessCheck: This should be part of a loop. If the data is incomplete, request more info and check again.
So, it's a loop: do DataCompletenessCheck, and if incomplete, request more info and repeat.

Wait, actually, in process modeling, a loop typically involves doing an activity, then deciding whether to repeat or exit.

In this case, it's: check data completeness; if complete, proceed; if not, request more info and check again.

So, it can be modeled as a loop where the body is "RequestMoreInfo" and the condition is whether the data is complete.

Wait, in POWL, a loop is defined as *(A, B), meaning execute A, then either exit or execute B and repeat A, and so on.

In this context, perhaps A is "DataCompletenessCheck", and B is "RequestMoreInfo". Wait, but actually, the check is performed, and if incomplete, request more info and check again.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as: while data is incomplete, request more info.

But in workflow terms, often it's modeled as: perform the check, and if not complete, go back to request more info.

Wait, perhaps I can model it as a sequence: ReceiveApplication → DataCompletenessCheck, and then an XOR: if complete, proceed to SkillAssessment; if not, RequestMoreInfo and go back to DataCompletenessCheck.

But in POWL, loops are modeled with the loop operator *(A, B), where A is the body and B is the redo part.

Wait, actually, in process trees, the loop operator is often used for do-while loops.

For example, *(A, B) means: do A, then either exit or do B and repeat A, and so on.

In this case, for the data completeness, it could be: do DataCompletenessCheck, then if incomplete, do RequestMoreInfo and repeat DataCompletenessCheck, until it's complete.

Wait, but actually, the check is performed, and based on the result, either proceed or request more info and check again.

So, perhaps it's better to model it as a loop where the body is "DataCompletenessCheck" and the redo part is "RequestMoreInfo".

Wait, let's see: in *(A, B), A is executed first, then either exit or execute B and then A again, and so on.

So, if A is "DataCompletenessCheck", and B is "RequestMoreInfo", then it would be: do DataCompletenessCheck, then if incomplete, do RequestMoreInfo and then DataCompletenessCheck again, and so on, until it's complete.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) represents the process of checking and requesting more info until the data is complete.

Wait, almost: actually, in the loop *(A, B), after executing A, you decide whether to exit or do B and then A again. So, in this case, after DataCompletenessCheck, if the data is complete, you exit the loop; if not, you do RequestMoreInfo and then DataCompletenessCheck again.

Yes, that fits.

So, the initial part is: ReceiveApplication → loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo).

Wait, more precisely, since ReceiveApplication is before the loop, and then the loop handles the checking and requesting.

Actually, in many workflows, the application is received, then checked, and if incomplete, request more info, and so on.

So, perhaps it's better to think of it as: after ReceiveApplication, enter the loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo), where DataCompletenessCheck includes checking if the data is complete, and if not, the loop continues by requesting more info.

Wait, but technically, in the loop *(A, B), A is executed first, which is DataCompletenessCheck, and based on its result, either exit or do B (RequestMoreInfo) and then A again.

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, after the loop, when the data is complete, proceed to SkillAssessment.

After SkillAssessment, there's the cultural fit check with the XOR branch.

So, after SkillAssessment, there's an XOR choice: either do StandardCulturalFitCheck or do CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Then, after that, proceed to ManagerialReview, and then FinalDecision.

Wait, is it that simple? In the description, it says: "the process is not purely merit-based. Applicants who indicate membership in the “Global Business Leaders Club” or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation. This step is often an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments."

So, it seems that based on certain conditions (like membership or local residency), the applicant might go through a different path where their cultural fit score is adjusted.

So, in the XOR branch, one path is StandardCulturalFitCheck, and the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck, which includes some score adjustment.

Then, after that, regardless of which path was taken, proceed to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision.

Wait, but in the managerial review, there might also be bias, but for the POWL model, I think the key is to represent the XOR branch in the cultural fit check.

So, to summarize for the unfair model:

Start with ReceiveApplication
Then, loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
Then, SkillAssessment
Then, XOR choice: either StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck
Then, ManagerialReview
Then, FinalDecision
Wait, and probably, the FinalDecision is based on the outcomes of the previous steps.

But in POWL, since it's a workflow, the final decision is the last activity.

Alternatively, perhaps the FinalDecision is an XOR choice itself: hire or reject, but since it's a decision based on the previous steps, in workflow modeling, often the final activity is just "MakeDecision" or something similar.

But in this case, since the process ends with either hiring or rejecting, but for simplicity, I can just have FinalDecision as the last activity.

Now, regarding the loop: actually, in the loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo), it's implied that after DataCompletenessCheck, if the data is complete, the loop exits, and proceeds to the next step.

Similarly, after SkillAssessment, presumably, if the applicant fails the skill test, they are disqualified, but in the description, it says: "Applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified, while those above the threshold proceed."

So, actually, after SkillAssessment, there should be a decision: if pass, proceed to cultural fit check; if fail, reject.

But in workflow terms, this can be modeled as an XOR choice after SkillAssessment: one path leads to cultural fit check and further steps, the other path leads to rejection.

Wait, but in the description, it seems that the SkillAssessment is a filtering step, and only those who pass proceed to the next stages.

So, perhaps it's better to model it as: after SkillAssessment, if pass, proceed to cultural fit check; if fail, go to rejection.

But since the final decision is made later, maybe the rejection is part of the FinalDecision.

Alternatively, perhaps the process can have early exits.

In POWL, I think it's possible to have XOR choices that lead to different paths, including early termination.

For example, after SkillAssessment, there could be an XOR: if pass, proceed to cultural fit check; if fail, go directly to FinalDecision with rejection.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the SkillAssessment is part of the sequence, and the disqualification is handled within the FinalDecision.

But to make it accurate, since the description says "Applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified", it's likely that if they fail the skill test, they are immediately rejected, without proceeding to further steps.

So, in that case, the workflow should reflect that.

Similarly, in the cultural fit check, there might also be a decision, but the description doesn't specify that; it seems that all applicants who pass the skill test go through the cultural fit check and then managerial review.

So, perhaps the structure is:

ReceiveApplication
Then, loop for data completeness: *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
Then, SkillAssessment
After SkillAssessment, XOR: if pass, proceed to cultural fit check; if fail, go to FinalDecision with rejection
Then, for those who pass, do the cultural fit check, which itself has an XOR: StandardCulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck
Then, ManagerialReview
Then, FinalDecision
Wait, but in the XOR after SkillAssessment, if they fail, they are disqualified, which means rejection, so perhaps it's better to have a separate activity like "RejectApplicant" or something.

But in workflow modeling, often there are terminal activities like "Hire" or "Reject".

Alternatively, since the FinalDecision is the last step, perhaps I can have the process flow such that after SkillAssessment, if fail, go to FinalDecision with rejection, and if pass, proceed through the other steps, and finally to FinalDecision.

But that might not be straightforward in POWL.

Wait, actually, in POWL, since it's a partially ordered workflow, I can have different paths leading to the final activity.

For example, I can have an XOR choice after SkillAssessment: one path is to go directly to FinalDecision (with rejection), and the other path is to go through cultural fit check, managerial review, and then to FinalDecision.

But since FinalDecision is the last activity, perhaps it's better to think of it as different outcomes.

Wait, another way is to model the entire process as a sequence up to ManagerialReview, and then have FinalDecision as an XOR choice: hire or reject, based on the previous evaluations.

But that might not accurately reflect that some applicants are disqualified early.

However, for simplicity, and since the description focuses on the cultural fit check as the source of bias, perhaps I can assume that all applicants go through all steps, and the decision is made at the end.

But that wouldn't be accurate, because clearly, if they fail the skill test, they are disqualified early.

So, to properly model it, I need to include the early exit.

In POWL, I can use an XOR operator to represent the choice after SkillAssessment.

For example, after the data completeness loop, there is SkillAssessment, then an XOR: one branch is "Proceed to CulturalFit", the other is "Reject".

Then, from "Proceed to CulturalFit", there is another XOR for the cultural fit check, and so on.

But actually, since POWL allows for partial orders and operators, I can structure it accordingly.

Let me try to formalize it.

First, let's define the activities:

ReceiveApplication
DataCompletenessCheck
RequestMoreInfo
SkillAssessment
StandardCulturalFitCheck
CommunityAffiliationCheck
ManagerialReview
FinalDecision
Additionally, since there are decisions, I might need silent transitions or other constructs, but for now, let's see.

For the unfair model, I can think of the structure as follows:

Start with ReceiveApplication
Then, a loop for data completeness: *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
Then, SkillAssessment
Then, an XOR choice: if the skill assessment is passed, proceed to the cultural fit check; if not, go to FinalDecision with rejection.
But wait, FinalDecision is an activity that probably involves deciding based on all previous steps, so perhaps it's better to have a separate activity like "Reject" or "Disqualify".

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as: after SkillAssessment, there is an XOR: one path is to proceed to cultural fit check and further steps, and the other path is to a silent transition leading to the end, representing disqualification.

But in workflow terms, often there is a final activity that collects the outcome.

Another way is to have the FinalDecision activity, and have different paths leading to it with different outcomes.

But in POWL, since it's more about the structure, perhaps I can have the XOR after SkillAssessment: one branch is a sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and then FinalDecision, and the other branch is directly to FinalDecision with rejection.

But that might not be directly representable, because FinalDecision is an activity that is executed at the end.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the process as having multiple possible paths, and the FinalDecision activity is always executed at the end, but based on the path taken, the decision is different.

For example, if the applicant was disqualified early, the FinalDecision is rejection; if they went through all steps, the FinalDecision is based on the evaluations.

But to simplify, maybe I can assume that the FinalDecision activity encapsulates the logic of deciding based on the previous steps, including early disqualification.

However, that might not be precise.

Alternatively, in many workflow models, there are activities like "AssessSkill" and then a decision gate: if pass, proceed; if fail, reject.

In POWL, since it's based on process trees, which can have operators like XOR, I can use that.

Actually, in the example provided, there is an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator, which can represent a choice between sub-models.

So, for instance, I can have a structure where after the data completeness loop, there is SkillAssessment, and then an XOR between two paths: one path is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and the other path is a silent transition leading to FinalDecision with rejection.

But wait, perhaps it's better to have the FinalDecision as the last activity, and have different conditions leading to it.

Wait, let's consider this: in process modeling, often the final decision is represented as an activity that depends on the previous activities.

But in POWL, since it's a partially ordered workflow, I can have a partial order where FinalDecision depends on the previous activities, and there are different paths.

For example, I can have a partial order where FinalDecision depends on SkillAssessment and on ManagerialReview, but with the XOR in between.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the entire process as a sequence up to SkillAssessment, then an XOR: if pass, do the sequence of cultural fit check and managerial review, then FinalDecision; if fail, do a silent transition and then FinalDecision with rejection.

But that still has the issue of how to represent the rejection.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can have the SkillAssessment activity, and then an XOR choice between "Proceed" and "Reject", where "Proceed" leads to the cultural fit check and so on, and "Reject" leads directly to the end.

But in POWL, since it's not necessarily a linear structure, I need to define the dependencies.

Actually, let's think in terms of process trees.

In process trees, which POWL is based on, the XOR operator can be used to represent choices, and the leaves are activities.

So, for example, I can have a process tree where the root is a sequence or a partial order, but since POWL allows for partial orders, I can define it accordingly.

Wait, perhaps for the unfair model, I can have the following structure:

A partial order with nodes: ReceiveApplication, loop for data completeness, SkillAssessment, XOR for cultural fit, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision, with appropriate order relations.
Wait, specifically:

Let's define the nodes:

Node1: ReceiveApplication
Node2: loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
Node3: SkillAssessment
Node4: XOR ( StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )
Node5: ManagerialReview
Node6: FinalDecision
Then, the order relations: ReceiveApplication → loop, loop → SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment → XOR, XOR → ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview → FinalDecision.

But wait, this doesn't account for the early disqualification after SkillAssessment.

So, to include that, perhaps I need to have an XOR after SkillAssessment: one branch is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and the other branch is directly to FinalDecision with rejection.

But in POWL, I can represent it as an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator, where one child is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and the other child is a silent transition leading to FinalDecision with rejection.

Wait, but actually, since FinalDecision is an activity, and in POWL, activities are leaves, I need to structure it properly.

Let's try to build it step by step.

First, the initial part: ReceiveApplication, then the loop for data completeness, then SkillAssessment.

So, I can have a partial order where ReceiveApplication is first, then the loop, then SkillAssessment.

Specifically, PO1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment], order={ReceiveApplication→loop, loop→SkillAssessment})

Then, after SkillAssessment, there is an XOR: if pass, proceed to the next steps; if fail, reject.

So, I can have an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator, where one child is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and the other child is a silent transition representing rejection.

But actually, since the rejection leads to FinalDecision with a different outcome, perhaps I need to model FinalDecision as an activity that can have different inputs.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can have two different FinalDecision activities: one for hire and one for reject, but that might not be standard.

Wait, let's see the example provided: in the example, there is a loop followed by an XOR between C and a silent transition.

So, similarly, I can have after SkillAssessment, an XOR between the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and a silent transition representing rejection.

But then, how does the process end? In the example, the root is a partial order with the loop and the XOR, and the order is loop→XOR, so after the loop, you do the XOR.

In my case, similarly, I can have a partial order with nodes: the initial sequence up to SkillAssessment, and then the XOR.

Wait, let's define it more precisely.

Perhaps I can have the root as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: the sequence up to SkillAssessment, and then the XOR node.

But let's define the sequence up to SkillAssessment first.

Actually, since there is a loop, I need to include it.

Let's define:

Let loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
Then, the initial sequence is ReceiveApplication → loop_node → SkillAssessment
So, I can have PO_initial = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment})

Then, after SkillAssessment, there is an XOR: one branch is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and FinalDecision, and the other branch is a silent transition.

But to make it accurate, perhaps the XOR is between proceeding to the next steps or going to rejection.

So, let's define the proceeding path: let's say node_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision], order={cultural_fit_xor→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→FinalDecision}), where cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then, the rejection path can be a silent transition, but since the process needs to end with FinalDecision, perhaps I can have the XOR between node_proceed and a silent transition, and then both lead to FinalDecision.

Wait, but in process tree terms, typically, the XOR is between alternative sub-trees, and the process ends after the sub-tree is executed.

But in this case, since FinalDecision is the last activity, perhaps I can have the XOR between two paths: one is the sequence cultural_fit_xor → ManagerialReview → FinalDecision, and the other is silent_transition → FinalDecision.

But actually, in the rejection path, the FinalDecision would be to reject, while in the proceeding path, it would be based on the evaluations.

So, to represent that, perhaps I can have the XOR between the proceeding path and a path that directly goes to FinalDecision with rejection.

But since FinalDecision is an activity, and in POWL, activities are executed, perhaps I need to have different instances of FinalDecision, but that might not be possible.

Wait, another way is to consider that the FinalDecision activity takes into account the path taken.

But in workflow modeling, often the decision is modeled as part of the control flow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the FinalDecision as an XOR choice itself: after the managerial review, decide to hire or reject, and for the rejection path from SkillAssessment, directly go to reject.

But that might be more complicated.

Let's consider a different approach.

Perhaps I can model the entire process as a partial order where there are different paths leading to FinalDecision.

For example, from SkillAssessment, there is an XOR: one branch leads to cultural_fit_xor, then to ManagerialReview, then to FinalDecision, and the other branch leads directly to FinalDecision with rejection.

But to represent that in POWL, I can use an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator, where one child is the sequence cultural_fit_xor → ManagerialReview → FinalDecision, and the other child is a silent transition, and then the root partial order has the initial sequence up to SkillAssessment, then the XOR, and the FinalDecision depends on the XOR.

Wait, let's try to formalize it.

Actually, in process trees, often the structure is nested, so I can have a structure like: sequence of initial part, then XOR between proceeding path and rejection path.

But since POWL allows for partial orders, perhaps I can define it as follows:

Let's define the proceeding path as a partial order: cultural_fit_xor → ManagerialReview → FinalDecision

Then, the rejection path as a silent transition.

But then, how to connect them.

Wait, perhaps I can have the root as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: PO_initial (which is ReceiveApplication → loop_node → SkillAssessment), then an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator having two children: the proceeding path and the silent transition, and then have the order that after SkillAssessment, the XOR is executed, and after the XOR, the FinalDecision is executed if the proceeding path was taken.

But wait, that's not accurate, because if the rejection path is taken, there is no FinalDecision, or the FinalDecision is rejection.

Wait, let's think differently.

Perhaps I can model the process as having the FinalDecision activity always at the end, and the previous activities influence its outcome.

But in POWL, since it's about the structure, not the data, I need to represent the control flow.

Another idea: maybe I can have two different FinalDecision activities: one for hire and one for reject, but that might not be standard.

Wait, let's look back at the example provided.

In the example, there is a loop followed by an XOR between C and a silent transition, and the partial order is loop → XOR.

So, in that case, after the loop, you either do C or do nothing, and then the process ends.

Similarly, in my case, after the initial sequence, I can have an XOR between the proceeding path and a silent transition, where the proceeding path includes the cultural fit check, managerial review, and then FinalDecision, and the silent transition represents rejection.

But then, how does the process end for the rejection path? Perhaps the silent transition can be connected to a "Reject" activity or something.

Wait, perhaps I can have the XOR between the proceeding path, which leads to FinalDecision, and a path that goes to a "Reject" activity.

But to keep it simple, maybe I can assume that the FinalDecision activity encompasses both possibilities: if the applicant was disqualified early, it's rejection; if they went through all steps, it's based on the evaluations.

But that might not be precise for modeling purposes.

Alternatively, perhaps in the POWL model, I can have the XOR after SkillAssessment: one branch is the sequence of cultural fit check, managerial review, and then Hire or Reject, and the other branch is directly to Reject.

But since Hire and Reject are outcomes, not activities, perhaps I can have activities like "ApproveHire" and "RejectApplicant".

For example, after ManagerialReview, there is an XOR between "ApproveHire" and "RejectApplicant", and for the rejection path from SkillAssessment, it goes to "RejectApplicant".

Then, both "ApproveHire" and "RejectApplicant" can be considered terminal activities.

So, in that case, the process can have multiple terminal points.

In POWL, I believe it's possible to have multiple leaves.

So, let's define it that way.

So, for the unfair model:

Start with ReceiveApplication

Then, loop *(DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)

Then, SkillAssessment

Then, XOR:

Branch 1: cultural_fit_xor = XOR ( StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck )

Then, ManagerialReview
Then, XOR ( ApproveHire, RejectApplicant )
Branch 2: RejectApplicant

So, in this way, if the applicant fails the skill assessment, they go directly to RejectApplicant; if they pass, they go through the cultural fit check, managerial review, and then either ApproveHire or RejectApplicant.

Yes, that seems reasonable.

Similarly, for the fair model, there will be no XOR for the cultural fit check; instead, all applicants go through the same StandardCulturalFitCheck.

So, let's formalize the POWL models.

First, for the unfair model:

Let's define the activities:

ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
ApproveHire = Transition(label="ApproveHire")
RejectApplicant = Transition(label="RejectApplicant")
Then, the loop for data completeness: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

Then, the cultural fit XOR: cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

Then, the proceeding path after cultural fit: PO_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={cultural_fit_xor→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision}), where XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])

Wait, actually, since XOR_decision is an XOR between ApproveHire and RejectApplicant, and it's after ManagerialReview.

Then, the main XOR after SkillAssessment: main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])

Wait, almost: one branch is PO_proceed, which is the sequence cultural_fit_xor → ManagerialReview → XOR_decision, and the other branch is RejectApplicant.

But in POWL, the children of OperatorPOWL are POWL models, so RejectApplicant is a Transition, which is a POWL model.

Similarly, PO_proceed is a StrictPartialOrder, which is also a POWL model.

So, yes, main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])

Then, the initial part: PO_initial = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor})

Wait, but actually, since main_xor is the XOR after SkillAssessment, and then the process continues based on the choice.

But in the partial order, the nodes should be the activities or sub-models that are directly part of the order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire process as PO_root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor}), and since main_xor contains the rest of the process.

Yes, that should work.

So, to summarize for the unfair model:

loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])
PO_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={cultural_fit_xor→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})
main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])
PO_root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor})
Wait, actually, in PO_root, the nodes are ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, and main_xor, with the order as specified.

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, for the fair model, the difference is that there is no XOR for the cultural fit check; instead, all applicants go through the StandardCulturalFitCheck.

So, in this case, the proceeding path would be: StandardCulturalFitCheck → ManagerialReview → XOR_decision

So, let's define PO_proceed_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={StandardCulturalFitCheck→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})

Then, the main_xor_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed_fair, RejectApplicant])

And the root would be similar: PO_root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor_fair], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor_fair})

Yes, that should be the fair model.

So, to confirm:

POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

Activities: ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo, SkillAssessment, StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck, ManagerialReview, ApproveHire, RejectApplicant
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])
XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])
PO_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={cultural_fit_xor→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})
main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])
PO_root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor})
POWL Model Without Unfairness:

Activities: same as above, but without CommunityAffiliationCheck, or rather, it's not used in the XOR
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])
XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])
PO_proceed_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={StandardCulturalFitCheck→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})
main_xor_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed_fair, RejectApplicant])
PO_root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor_fair], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor_fair})
So, in the fair model, the cultural fit check is always StandardCulturalFitCheck, without the XOR choice that could lead to CommunityAffiliationCheck.

Therefore, the two POWL models are as defined above.

To present them in a boxed format, I can summarize the key differences.

But since the question asks to produce two POWL models, and given that POWL models are defined programmatically, I think providing the structural description as above is sufficient.

Alternatively, if needed, I can write the code snippets similar to the example.

For instance, for the unfair model:

python
Wrap
Copy
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
StandardCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="StandardCulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
ApproveHire = Transition(label="ApproveHire")
RejectApplicant = Transition(label="RejectApplicant")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR for cultural fit check
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define XOR for final decision
XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])

# Define proceeding path
PO_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision])
PO_proceed.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview)
PO_proceed.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, XOR_decision)

# Define main XOR after SkillAssessment
main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])

# Define root partial order
PO_root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor])
PO_root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
PO_root.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
PO_root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, main_xor)
Similarly, for the fair model:

python
Wrap
Copy
# Define proceeding path without XOR for cultural fit
PO_proceed_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision])
PO_proceed_fair.order.add_edge(StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
PO_proceed_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, XOR_decision)

# Define main XOR after SkillAssessment
main_xor_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[PO_proceed_fair, RejectApplicant])

# Define root partial order
PO_root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor_fair])
PO_root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_node)
PO_root_fair.order.add_edge(loop_node, SkillAssessment)
PO_root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, main_xor_fair)
So, the two POWL models are PO_root and PO_root_fair, as defined above.

Therefore, the final answer is the two POWL models structured as described.

But since the question likely expects a textual description, I can summarize:

POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:

A workflow starting with "ReceiveApplication", followed by a loop for data completeness check and request for more information, then "SkillAssessment". After "SkillAssessment", there is an XOR choice: either proceed to a cultural fit check that itself has an XOR between "StandardCulturalFitCheck" and "CommunityAffiliationCheck", followed by "ManagerialReview" and then an XOR between "ApproveHire" and "RejectApplicant", or directly go to "RejectApplicant".

POWL Model Without Unfairness:

Similar to the above, but without the XOR in the cultural fit check; instead, all applicants go through "StandardCulturalFitCheck", followed by "ManagerialReview" and then the XOR between "ApproveHire" and "RejectApplicant", or directly to "RejectApplicant" if they fail the skill assessment.

So, the key difference is the presence or absence of the XOR branch in the cultural fit check that allows for potential bias through the "CommunityAffiliationCheck".

Thus, the two POWL models are as specified in the structural descriptions above.
</think>

Below, I present two POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) models for the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, based on the provided description. The first model includes a potential source of unfairness in the cultural fit evaluation, while the second model removes this unfairness to ensure a fair process. Each model is structured using activities, loops, XOR choices, and partial orders, adhering to the POWL formalism.

### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

This model reflects the hiring process with a subtle bias introduced in the cultural fit evaluation, where applicants with certain affiliations (e.g., membership in the “Global Business Leaders Club” or local residency) may receive preferential treatment via a separate evaluation path.

#### Activities
- **ReceiveApplication**: Applicants submit resumes and questionnaires.
- **DataCompletenessCheck**: Automated system checks resume completeness.
- **RequestMoreInfo**: Applicants provide additional details if data is incomplete.
- **SkillAssessment**: Online skill test with a pass/fail threshold.
- **StandardCulturalFitCheck**: Standard evaluation of cultural alignment.
- **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: Alternative evaluation giving a subjective advantage to affiliated applicants.
- **ManagerialReview**: Human review of candidates, potentially influenced by prior steps.
- **ApproveHire**: Final decision to hire the candidate.
- **RejectApplicant**: Final decision to reject the candidate.

#### Structure
The process begins with receiving applications, followed by a loop to ensure data completeness. After a skill assessment, an XOR choice determines whether the applicant proceeds or is rejected early. For those who proceed, another XOR choice in the cultural fit evaluation introduces potential unfairness, followed by managerial review and a final decision.

1. **Initial Sequence and Data Completeness Loop**:
   - **ReceiveApplication** starts the process.
   - **loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])**: Checks data completeness; if incomplete, requests more info and repeats until complete.

2. **Skill Assessment and Early Rejection**:
   - **SkillAssessment**: Applicants take the skill test.
   - After **SkillAssessment**, an XOR choice:
     - Proceed to cultural fit evaluation if passed.
     - Go to **RejectApplicant** if failed.

3. **Cultural Fit Evaluation with Unfairness**:
   - **cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])**: An XOR choice where:
     - **StandardCulturalFitCheck**: Standard evaluation for all applicants.
     - **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: Alternative path giving affiliated applicants an advantage (source of unfairness).

4. **Managerial Review and Final Decision**:
   - **PO_proceed = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={cultural_fit_xor→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})**:
     - **ManagerialReview**: Human review, possibly influenced by affiliations.
     - **XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])**: Final choice to hire or reject.

5. **Main XOR After Skill Assessment**:
   - **main_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed, RejectApplicant])**: If the skill test is passed, proceed through cultural fit and further steps; if failed, reject immediately.

6. **Root Partial Order**:
   - **PO_root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor})**: Defines the overall process order.

#### Description
The workflow starts with **ReceiveApplication**, followed by a loop ensuring data completeness (**DataCompletenessCheck**, **RequestMoreInfo**). After **SkillAssessment**, an XOR branches to either reject the applicant (**RejectApplicant**) if they fail, or proceed if they pass. The proceeding path includes an XOR in the cultural fit check (**StandardCulturalFitCheck** or **CommunityAffiliationCheck**), where the latter introduces unfairness by favoring affiliated applicants. This is followed by **ManagerialReview** and a final XOR decision (**ApproveHire** or **RejectApplicant**). The unfairness stems from the **CommunityAffiliationCheck** path.

---

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

This model ensures fairness by removing the XOR branch in the cultural fit evaluation, requiring all applicants to undergo the same standard process without preferential treatment based on affiliations.

#### Activities
- Same as above, except **CommunityAffiliationCheck** is not used in an XOR choice:
  - **ReceiveApplication**
  - **DataCompletenessCheck**
  - **RequestMoreInfo**
  - **SkillAssessment**
  - **StandardCulturalFitCheck** (only this is used for cultural fit)
  - **ManagerialReview**
  - **ApproveHire**
  - **RejectApplicant**

#### Structure
The process mirrors the unfair model up to the skill assessment, but the cultural fit evaluation has no XOR choice, ensuring all applicants are evaluated equally.

1. **Initial Sequence and Data Completeness Loop**:
   - **ReceiveApplication**
   - **loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])**: Same loop as above.

2. **Skill Assessment and Early Rejection**:
   - **SkillAssessment**
   - After **SkillAssessment**, an XOR choice (same as above).

3. **Fair Cultural Fit Evaluation**:
   - **StandardCulturalFitCheck**: All applicants undergo this standard evaluation; no **CommunityAffiliationCheck** branch exists.

4. **Managerial Review and Final Decision**:
   - **PO_proceed_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[StandardCulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, XOR_decision], order={StandardCulturalFitCheck→ManagerialReview, ManagerialReview→XOR_decision})**:
     - **ManagerialReview**
     - **XOR_decision = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[ApproveHire, RejectApplicant])**

5. **Main XOR After Skill Assessment**:
   - **main_xor_fair = OperatorPOWL(operator=XOR, children=[PO_proceed_fair, RejectApplicant])**: Same structure as the unfair model for passing or failing the skill test.

6. **Root Partial Order**:
   - **PO_root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, main_xor_fair], order={ReceiveApplication→loop_node, loop_node→SkillAssessment, SkillAssessment→main_xor_fair})**

#### Description
The workflow begins with **ReceiveApplication**, followed by the data completeness loop (**DataCompletenessCheck**, **RequestMoreInfo**). After **SkillAssessment**, an XOR branches to **RejectApplicant** if failed, or to a fair proceeding path if passed. The proceeding path includes only **StandardCulturalFitCheck** (no XOR choice), followed by **ManagerialReview**, and a final XOR decision (**ApproveHire** or **RejectApplicant**). By eliminating the **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, this model removes the source of unfairness.

---

### Key Difference
- **Unfair Model**: Includes an XOR in the cultural fit evaluation (**cultural_fit_xor**) with **CommunityAffiliationCheck**, potentially favoring affiliated applicants.
- **Fair Model**: Replaces the XOR with a single **StandardCulturalFitCheck**, ensuring all applicants are evaluated equally.

Both models maintain the loop for data completeness and the XOR for early rejection after skill assessment, but the fair model eliminates the biased branch in the cultural fit stage, aligning with GlobalTeq Solutions’ goal of transparency and fairness.
