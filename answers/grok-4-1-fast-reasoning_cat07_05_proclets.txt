### Overall Description
This visualization is a multi-part diagram illustrating a **healthcare workflow for lab testing**, focusing on the interaction between **two protocol classes** (likely software or communication protocols in a hospital information system) connected via **two channels**. It depicts the flow of lab orders, sample processing, testing (including chemical analysis), results reporting, and feedback loops. The diagram combines a **central flowchart** (showing system interactions), **sub-diagrams for lab tests**, and a **sample interaction table** labeled as "(c) Example of a performative" (a term from speech act theory or protocol messaging, e.g., in HL7 standards for healthcare interoperability).

The diagram is divided into:
- **Main flowchart** (left/center/right panels).
- **Side panels** for specific lab test protocols (b).
- **Bottom table** with a timestamped example message exchange.

Key themes: Order placement, sample collection, lab processing (chemical and class-based tests), result reporting to HIS (Hospital/Health Information System), and iterative feedback (e.g., "Do test again").

### Main Flowchart (Central Diagram: "Two protocol classes connected through two channels")
This is a **box-and-arrow flowchart** showing bidirectional interactions between systems. Arrows are labeled (1), (2), etc., indicating message sequences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

#### Left Side (Order and Sample Flow):
```
Order system  Lab visit (requires 1.1)

Sample collection (blood sample)  HIS (central hub)

Lab judgment  "Do test again?" (loop with lab assistant)

Send report
```
- **Starts** at **Order system** (e.g., clinician places order).
- Flows to **Lab visit** (patient sample collection).
- **Sample** (e.g., blood) sent to **HIS** (central database).
- **Lab judgment** on results; if needed, **lab assistant** loops back ("Do test again").
- **Send report** closes the loop.

#### Center (HIS - Hub):
- **HIS** box connects everything with multiple incoming/outgoing arrows (labeled 1–5).
- Acts as a **message broker** for orders, results, and reports.
- Incoming: Sample results, lab judgments.
- Outgoing: To lab systems for processing.

#### Right Side (Lab Test Processing):
Two parallel **lab test sub-flows**:
1. **Chemical Lab Test**:
   ```
   HIS  Perform chemical test  Chemical report  HIS
   ```
   - HIS triggers **chemical test**.
   - Generates **chemical report** back to HIS.

2. **Class Test** (Labeled "Lab.1 requires 1.1", "Lab.2"):
   ```
   Lab.1 (class test)  Requires chemical test  Lab.2
   ```
   - **Lab.1** (initial class-based test) depends on **chemical test**.
   - Involves **test result** and **chemical finish**.

#### Loops and Feedback:
- Dotted lines show **iterative paths** (e.g., "Receive result  HIS  Do test again").
- **Global** elements: "Lab test" overarching both chemical and class tests.

### Side Panels (b) "Class test containing the two protocol classes"
- Two small diagrams showing **nested protocols**:
  - **Left**: "Lab.1" box with internal "requires 1.1" and chemical test dependency.
  - **Right**: "Lab.2" with "chemical finish" and test result output.
- Illustrates how **class tests** encapsulate the two protocol classes (chemical and another), with dependencies.

### Bottom Table (c) "Example of a performative"
A **single-row table** showing a sample **message exchange** (performative = a structured action/message in a protocol):

| Time   | Channel | Sender | Receiver | Action          | Content       | Scope  | Direction |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 11:30 | Order  | Lab   | Lab test | Create test for John? | Private | OUT   | HIS      |

- **Timestamp**: 11:30.
- **Channel**: "Order" (one of the two connecting channels).
- **Flow**: Lab  Lab test system  HIS.
- **Action**: "Create test for John?" (inquiry/creation performative).
- **Content Scope**: Private (patient-specific).
- **Direction**: OUT to HIS.

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Purpose**: Models **interoperable lab workflows** between ordering systems, HIS, and lab protocols, emphasizing **channel-based communication** (e.g., Order channel) and dependencies (chemical tests required for class tests).
- **Style**: UML-like activity diagram with swimlanes (systems as columns), numbered interactions, and a concrete example.
- **Context**: Likely from medical informatics (e.g., HL7 FHIR or similar standards), showing how protocols enable automated lab order fulfillment and result reporting.
