###  **Transformation Logic Summary**

#### **1. Case Identification**
I grouped events into **cases based on logical user tasks**, typically centered around a **specific document or workflow**. Each case represents a coherent unit of work:
- **CASE-01**: Work on `Document1.docx` (drafting and finalizing a document, interrupted by other tasks).
- **CASE-02**: Handling an email thread about the annual meeting.
- **CASE-03**: Passive review of `Report_Draft.pdf` in Acrobat (no edits, just navigation and highlighting).
- **CASE-04**: Active editing session on `Budget_2024.xlsx` in Excel.
- **CASE-05**: Editing and closing `Quarterly_Report.docx` (started early, but only worked on toward end).

> Note: Even though `Document1.docx` was interrupted by email and Excel, it’s treated as a **single case** because the user returns and continues working on it, indicating task resumption.

#### **2. Activity Naming**
Raw low-level actions (e.g., `TYPING`, `CLICK`, `SCROLL`) were **abstracted into meaningful business activities**:
- `TYPING` + context  named based on content (e.g., "Draft Executive Summary").
- `SCROLL`  interpreted as "Scroll Report Content" to reflect review activity.
- `SAVE`, `CLOSE`, `SWITCH` were aggregated into **significant process steps** (e.g., "Finalize and Save Draft").
- `CLICK` on "Reply"  mapped to "Reply to Meeting Email", and "Send"  "Send Meeting Confirmation".

#### **3. Temporal Context & Order**
Timestamps are preserved exactly. The chronological flow across applications was used to infer **task switching** and **case continuation or closure**. For example:
- The switch back to `Document1.docx` at `09:06:15` confirms the case was paused, not abandoned.
- The close of `Document1.docx` after a save suggests task completion.

#### **4. Why This Works for Process Mining**
- Each **case** tells a clear story of user work.
- **Activities** are standardized, not too granular.
- **Ordering** reflects real user behavior and possible process flows (e.g., draft  revise  save  close).
- Suitable for discovery algorithms (e.g., **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristic Miner**) to extract process models.

Let me know if you'd like this exported in CSV or XES format, or analyzed further (e.g., process model visualization, bottleneck analysis).
