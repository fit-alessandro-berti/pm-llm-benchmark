**Identified Anomalies:**

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):** The average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation. This could indicate that approvals are being scheduled at fixed intervals, which is unusual and may not reflect the actual evaluation process.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):** A significant delay of 7 days on average with a high standard deviation suggests inconsistent notification processes. Sometimes notifications are delayed, while others are almost immediate, indicating potential issues with resource management or system backlogs.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):** The quick 2-hour average time from assignment to closure without consistent evaluation or approval steps in between is suspicious and might imply some claims are being closed without thorough review.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):** An exceedingly short 5-minute average transition suggests either a very efficient process or potential data entry errors where necessary steps may be skipped.

**Hypotheses on Anomalies:**

1. **Fixed Approval Schedule (R to P):** This could be due to a scheduled batch processing system for approvals that doesn't align with actual claim evaluation times.

2. **Notification Delays (P to N):** This might be a result of high claim volumes, resource constraints, or an inefficient notification system that sporadically causes delays.

3. **Premature Closures (A to C):** Could indicate that adjusters are closing claims without completing the necessary evaluation and approval steps, possibly due to time pressure or lack of monitoring.

4. **Skipped Steps (E to N):** This anomaly might stem from a system configuration error or a process where notifications are automated to follow evaluations immediately, without human intervention checking for completeness.

**Proposed Verification Approaches using SQL Queries:**

1. **Identifying Claims with Unusually Short R to P Times:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, resource, 
          TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01' + (extract(epoch FROM TIMESTAMP(timestamp) - TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01') / 3600) as hours_between
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('R', 'P')
   GROUP BY claim_id, resource
   HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END) + INTERVAL '25 hours' > MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END);
   ```

2. **Examining Delays in P to N Notifications:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, resource, 
          TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01' + (extract(epoch FROM TIMESTAMP(timestamp) - TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01') / 3600) as hours_between
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('P', 'N')
   GROUP BY claim_id, resource
   HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END) + INTERVAL '7 days' < MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END);
   ```

3. **Checking for Premature Closures (A to C):**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, resource, 
          TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01' + (extract(epoch FROM TIMESTAMP(timestamp) - TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01') / 3600) as hours_between
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('A', 'C')
   GROUP BY claim_id, resource
   HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'A' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END) + INTERVAL '2 hours' > MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'C' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END);
   ```

4. **Verifying E to N Notifications:**
   ```sql
   SELECT claim_id, resource, 
          TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01' + (extract(epoch FROM TIMESTAMP(timestamp) - TIMESTAMP '2023-01-01') / 3600) as minutes_between
   FROM claim_events
   WHERE activity IN ('E', 'N')
   GROUP BY claim_id, resource
   HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'E' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END) + INTERVAL '5 minutes' > MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'N' THEN TIMESTAMP(timestamp) END);
   ```

These queries aim to pinpoint specific claims where the time intervals between activities fall outside expected norms, allowing for targeted investigation into the root causes of these anomalies.
