Based on the normative process description and the event log provided, let's analyze each case to identify any deviations from the intended process flow.

### Case 1
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1       | 2023-10-05 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 11:00    | Authorize payment  |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 12:00    | Package items      |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 13:00    | Ship order         |
| 1       | 2023-10-05 14:00    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None
- This case follows the normative process correctly. The activities are in the correct sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close.

### Case 2
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 09:30    | Check inventory    |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:00    | Package items      |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 2       | 2023-10-06 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None
- This case also follows the normative process correctly. The activities are in the correct sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize Payment, Ship, Close.

### Case 3
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:20    | Check inventory    |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 09:40    | Authorize payment  |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:00    | Cancel order       |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 10:30    | Ship order         |
| 3       | 2023-10-07 11:00    | Close order        |

**Violation:** Yes
- **Violation Explanation:** The normative process states that "Cancel order" should be the immediate next step after "Check inventory" if the inventory is insufficient. However, in this case, "Authorize payment" is performed before "Cancel order." This violates the rule that "Authorize payment" should only occur after "Check inventory" and before packaging.

### Case 4
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:10    | Check inventory    |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:20    | Cancel order       |
| 4       | 2023-10-08 09:50    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None
- This case follows the normative process correctly. The activities are in the correct sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close.

### Case 5
| Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity           |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 5       | 2023-10-09 09:00    | Receive order      |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:00    | Check inventory    |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 10:30    | Authorize payment  |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:00    | Ship order         |
| 5       | 2023-10-09 11:30    | Close order        |

**Violation:** None
- This case follows the normative process correctly. The activities are in the correct sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Ship, Close.

### Summary of Violations
- **Case 3** violates the normative process by performing "Authorize payment" before "Cancel order" after checking inventory.

### Conclusion
The normative process is correctly followed in Cases 1, 2, 4, and 5. Case 3 is the only case that deviates from the normative process by authorizing payment before canceling the order when inventory is insufficient.
