### **Detailed Explanation of the Business Process**

This pseudo-BPMN diagram represents a **customer request processing workflow** that handles both **standard** and **custom** requests, with conditional approvals and parallel validation steps. Below is a breakdown of the process:

---

### **1. Start Event  Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Purpose:** The process begins when a customer submits a request (e.g., for a product or service).
- **Output:** The request is captured and categorized for further processing.

---

### **2. Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**
- **Purpose:** Determines whether the request is **standard** (predefined) or **custom** (unique).
- **Decision Logic:**
  - If **Standard**  Proceed to **Task B1** ("Perform Standard Validation").
  - If **Custom**  Proceed to **Task B2** ("Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis").

---

### **3. Standard Path (If Request Type = Standard)**
#### **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Purpose:** Validates the request against predefined business rules (e.g., eligibility, completeness).
- **Output:** If valid, proceeds to parallel checks.

#### **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**
- **Purpose:** Splits the workflow into **two parallel tasks** (must both complete before proceeding).
  - **Task C1: "Credit Check"**  Ensures the customer is financially eligible.
  - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"**  Verifies product availability.

#### **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- **Purpose:** Waits for both **credit** and **inventory checks** to finish before proceeding.

#### **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Purpose:** Determines the expected delivery time based on validation results.
- **Output:** Delivery date is set, and the process moves to approval checks.

---

### **4. Custom Path (If Request Type = Custom)**
#### **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Purpose:** Assesses whether the custom request can be fulfilled (e.g., technical feasibility, cost).
- **Output:** Proceeds to a decision gateway.

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If Yes**  Proceed to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"** (then move to approval checks).
  - **If No**  Proceed to **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"**  End Event.

---

### **5. Approval Check (Common for Both Paths)**
#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- **Purpose:** Determines if managerial approval is required (e.g., based on request value, customization complexity).
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If Yes**  Proceed to **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**.
  - **If No**  Skip directly to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.

#### **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- **Purpose:** Submits the request for managerial review.
- **Next Step:** Proceeds to another **XOR Gateway** ("Is Approval Granted?").

#### **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- **Decision Logic:**
  - **If Yes**  Proceed to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.
  - **If No**  Proceed to **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**.

#### **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"**
- **Purpose:** Reassesses the request (e.g., renegotiates terms, adjusts feasibility).
- **Loop Back Logic:**
  - For **Custom Path**  Loops back to **Task E1** (re-prepare quotation).
  - For **Standard Path**  Loops back to **Task D** (recalculate delivery date).

---

### **6. Final Steps (Common for Both Paths)**
#### **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**
- **Purpose:** Creates the final invoice for the customer.

#### **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- **Purpose:** Notifies the customer of approval and provides next steps.

#### **End Event**
- **Purpose:** The process concludes.

### **Key Differences Between Standard and Custom Paths**
| **Aspect**               | **Standard Request**                          | **Custom Request**                          |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Validation**          | Predefined rules (Task B1)                    | Feasibility analysis (Task B2)             |
| **Parallel Checks**     | Required (credit + inventory)                  | Not applicable (only feasibility check)    |
| **Approval Logic**      | May loop back to Task D (recalculate date)     | May loop back to Task E1 (re-prepare quote)|
| **Rejection Path**      | Not applicable (always proceeds to approval)   | Direct rejection if not feasible (Task E2) |

---

### **When Approvals or Rework Are Triggered**
- **Approval Needed?**  Triggered based on predefined rules (e.g., high-value requests).
- **Rejection/Re-evaluation**  Triggered if:
  - Custom request is **not feasible** (Task E2).
  - Manager **denies approval** (Task H loops back for adjustments).

---

### **Summary of Process Flow**
1. **Start**  Receive request  Check if standard or custom.
2. **Standard Path:**
   - Validate  Run parallel checks (credit + inventory)  Calculate delivery date.
3. **Custom Path:**
   - Assess feasibility  If feasible, prepare quotation; else, reject.
4. **Approval Check:**
   - If needed, obtain manager approval; if denied, re-evaluate.
5. **Final Steps:**
   - Generate invoice  Send confirmation  End.

This process ensures structured handling of both standard and custom requests while incorporating parallel validation, conditional approvals, and rework loops where necessary.
