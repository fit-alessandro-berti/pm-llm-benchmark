The visualization consists of three parts:

**(a) Two proclet classes connected through two channels:** This is a process model showing two interconnected processes: "Lab visit" and "Lab test". It uses various symbols representing activities (rectangles), events (circles), gateways (diamonds), and connections between them. The processes are connected through "Order system" and "HIS" (Hospital Information System) channels, indicated by dashed boxes and lines with multiplicities (e.g., 1..*, 1..1). Roles like "doctor", "lab assistant", and "chemical analyst" are also indicated.

**(b) Class diagram containing the two proclet classes:** This is a UML class diagram showing the relationship between the "Lab visit" and "Lab test" classes. It indicates that a "Lab visit" requires one or more "Lab test" (1..*).

**(c) Example of a performative:** This is a table presenting an example of a "performative," which seems to be a message or communication event within the system. The table has columns for Time, Channel, Sender, Receivers, Action, Content, Scope, and Direction, and provides specific values for an example communication.
