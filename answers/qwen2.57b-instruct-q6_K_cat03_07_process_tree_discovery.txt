Based on the given event log and its observed behavior, we can construct a process tree that captures the main sequence of activities as well as the optional repeating loop for requesting missing info and re-validation before the final approval, confirmation, and archival steps. Here's how the process tree could be structured:

1. **Main Flow**: 
   - Receive Application (RA)
   - Validate Form (VF)
   - Assess Eligibility (AE)
   - Request Missing Info (RMI) if necessary
   - Validate Form (VF) again after addressing missing info
   - Approval Decision (AD)

2. **Optional Loop for Re-Validation**:
   - This loop allows the process to return to "Validate Form" (VF) after receiving a request for missing information.

3. **Final Steps**:
   - Send Confirmation (SC)
   - Archive Case (AC)

Given this, we can model it using the defined operators:

```plaintext
-> ( 'Receive Application', 
     -> ( 'Validate Form', 
          + (
             * ('Request Missing Info', -> ( 'Validate Form', 'Approval Decision' )),
             'Approval Decision'
          )
       ),
     'Send Confirmation',
     'Archive Case'
)
```

Here's a breakdown of the process tree structure:

- **Root Node**: A sequence (`->`) that starts with "Receive Application".
- **Child 1**: Another sequence (`->`) starting with "Validate Form".
  - This sequence has two branches:
    - One branch is an inclusive choice (`+`):
      - A loop (`*`) for handling missing information.
        - The activity `Request Missing Info`.
        - After receiving the request, it returns to `Validate Form`, then continues to `Approval Decision`.
      - Directly proceeding to `Approval Decision` if no further requests are needed.
    - The other branch is simply "Approval Decision".
- **Child 2**: "Send Confirmation".
- **Child 3**: "Archive Case".

So the final process tree model can be represented as:

```plaintext
+ ( 
   -> ( 'Receive Application', 
        + (
           * ('Request Missing Info', -> ( 'Validate Form', 'Approval Decision' )),
           'Approval Decision'
        ),
        'Send Confirmation',
        'Archive Case'
     )
)
```

This structure ensures that the process tree captures the main flow, handles optional loops for re-validation due to missing information, and concludes with the final steps of approval, confirmation, and archival.
