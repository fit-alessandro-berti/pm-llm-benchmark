Alright, I need to create a temporal profile for a global supply chain process in the high-tech electronics industry. The process involves several activities from supplier selection all the way to after-sales support. I have to estimate average times and standard deviations for the time intervals between various activity pairs.

First, I need to understand the sequence of activities:

1. Supplier Selection (SS)
2. Order Placement (OP)
3. Receive Components (RC)
4. Quality Inspection (QI)
5. Component Assembly (CA)
6. Product Testing (PT)
7. Packaging (PK)
8. Warehouse Storage (WS)
9. Distribution (DT)
10. After-Sales Support (AS)

These activities are sequential, but some might have overlapping periods or dependencies that could affect the time intervals.

I need to consider pairs of activities that follow each other in the process, not just directly connected ones. For example, the time between SS and OP, SS and RC, SS and QI, and so on, up to AS.

Estimating average times and standard deviations requires some knowledge of typical durations in each phase of the supply chain. Since I don't have specific data, I'll have to make reasonable assumptions based on general industry practices.

Let's start by estimating the average time and standard deviation for each direct transition:

1. **SS to OP:**
   - Supplier selection might take a few days to a week, depending on the complexity of the selection process.
   - Average: 3 days (259200 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 1 day (86400 seconds)

2. **OP to RC:**
   - Order placement to receipt of components depends on the supplier's lead time, which could be a week to a month.
   - Average: 15 days (1296000 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 5 days (432000 seconds)

3. **RC to QI:**
   - Receiving components to starting quality inspection might be immediate or take a few hours.
   - Average: 12 hours (43200 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 6 hours (21600 seconds)

4. **QI to CA:**
   - Assuming inspection is completed before assembly starts, this could take a day or two.
   - Average: 1 day (86400 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 12 hours (43200 seconds)

5. **CA to PT:**
   - Assembly to testing might be immediate or take a few hours.
   - Average: 6 hours (21600 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 3 hours (10800 seconds)

6. **PT to PK:**
   - Testing to packaging could be immediate upon successful testing.
   - Average: 2 hours (7200 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 1 hour (3600 seconds)

7. **PK to WS:**
   - Packaging to warehouse storage is likely immediate.
   - Average: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)

8. **WS to DT:**
   - Storage to distribution could vary based on order demand, possibly from a few hours to a few days.
   - Average: 2 days (172800 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 1 day (86400 seconds)

9. **DT to AS:**
   - Distribution to after-sales support might be considered at the time of sale or shipment.
   - Average: 1 day (86400 seconds)
   - Standard Deviation: 12 hours (43200 seconds)

Now, I need to consider non-direct transitions as well. For example, the time from SS to QI, which would be the sum of SS to OP, OP to RC, and RC to QI.

But for simplicity and to manage the complexity, I'll select a representative subset of both direct and indirect activity pairs.

Let's choose the following pairs:

- ('SS', 'OP')
- ('SS', 'RC')
- ('SS', 'QI')
- ('OP', 'RC')
- ('OP', 'QI')
- ('RC', 'QI')
- ('QI', 'CA')
- ('CA', 'PT')
- ('PT', 'PK')
- ('PK', 'WS')
- ('WS', 'DT')
- ('DT', 'AS')
- ('SS', 'CA')
- ('SS', 'PT')
- ('OP', 'CA')
- ('RC', 'CA')
- ('QI', 'PK')
- ('CA', 'WS')
- ('PT', 'DT')
- ('PK', 'AS')

I'll estimate the average and standard deviation for these pairs based on the assumed durations for the direct transitions.

For example:

- **('SS', 'RC')**: SS to OP (3 days) + OP to RC (15 days) = 18 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(1^2 + 5^2) days  5.1 days

- **('SS', 'QI')**: SS to OP (3 days) + OP to RC (15 days) + RC to QI (0.5 days) = 18.5 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(1^2 + 5^2 + 0.5^2) days  5.12 days

- **('OP', 'QI')**: OP to RC (15 days) + RC to QI (0.5 days) = 15.5 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(5^2 + 0.5^2) days  5.01 days

- **('SS', 'CA')**: SS to OP (3 days) + OP to RC (15 days) + RC to QI (0.5 days) + QI to CA (1 day) = 19.5 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(1^2 + 5^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^2) days  5.12 days

- **('SS', 'PT')**: SS to OP (3 days) + OP to RC (15 days) + RC to QI (0.5 days) + QI to CA (1 day) + CA to PT (0.25 days) = 19.75 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(1^2 + 5^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.25^2) days  5.12 days

- **('OP', 'CA')**: OP to RC (15 days) + RC to QI (0.5 days) + QI to CA (1 day) = 16.5 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(5^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^2) days  5.02 days

- **('RC', 'CA')**: RC to QI (0.5 days) + QI to CA (1 day) = 1.5 days average
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5^2) days  0.71 days

- **('QI', 'PK')**: QI to CA (1 day) + CA to PT (0.25 days) + PT to PK (0.083 days)  1.333 days
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.25^2 + 0.167^2) days  0.57 days

- **('CA', 'WS')**: CA to PT (0.25 days) + PT to PK (0.083 days) + PK to WS (0.042 days)  0.375 days
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(0.25^2 + 0.167^2 + 0.083^2) days  0.29 days

- **('PT', 'DT')**: PT to PK (0.083 days) + PK to WS (0.042 days) + WS to DT (2 days)  2.125 days
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(0.167^2 + 0.083^2 + 1^2) days  1.02 days

- **('PK', 'AS')**: PK to WS (0.042 days) + WS to DT (2 days) + DT to AS (1 day)  3.042 days
  - Standard deviation: sqrt(0.083^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) days  1.41 days

Now, converting these averages and standard deviations into seconds:

- 1 day = 86400 seconds
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds
- 1 minute = 60 seconds

For example:

- ('SS', 'OP'): 3 days avg, 1 day std dev
  - avg: 3 * 86400 = 259200 seconds
  - std dev: 1 * 86400 = 86400 seconds

- ('SS', 'RC'): 18 days avg, 5.1 days std dev
  - avg: 18 * 86400 = 1555200 seconds
  - std dev: 5.1 * 86400  440640 seconds

And so on for each pair.

I need to ensure that the dictionary is comprehensive yet manageable, so I'll select a subset of these pairs to include in the temporal profile.

Let's choose the following pairs for the temporal profile:

- ('SS', 'OP')
- ('SS', 'RC')
- ('SS', 'QI')
- ('OP', 'RC')
- ('OP', 'QI')
- ('RC', 'QI')
- ('QI', 'CA')
- ('CA', 'PT')
- ('PT', 'PK')
- ('PK', 'WS')
- ('WS', 'DT')
- ('DT', 'AS')
- ('SS', 'CA')
- ('SS', 'PT')
- ('OP', 'CA')
- ('RC', 'CA')
- ('QI', 'PK')
- ('CA', 'WS')
- ('PT', 'DT')
- ('PK', 'AS')

Now, I'll calculate the average and standard deviation for each in seconds.

1. **('SS', 'OP')**: 3 days avg, 1 day std dev
   - avg: 259200 s
   - std dev: 86400 s

2. **('SS', 'RC')**: 18 days avg, 5.1 days std dev
   - avg: 1555200 s
   - std dev: 440640 s

3. **('SS', 'QI')**: 18.5 days avg, 5.12 days std dev
   - avg: 1,598,400 s
   - std dev: 441408 s

4. **('OP', 'RC')**: 15 days avg, 5 days std dev
   - avg: 1,296,000 s
   - std dev: 432,000 s

5. **('OP', 'QI')**: 15.5 days avg, 5.01 days std dev
   - avg: 1,339,200 s
   - std dev: 432,864 s

6. **('RC', 'QI')**: 0.5 days avg, 0.5 days std dev
   - avg: 43,200 s
   - std dev: 43,200 s

7. **('QI', 'CA')**: 1 day avg, 0.5 days std dev
   - avg: 86,400 s
   - std dev: 43,200 s

8. **('CA', 'PT')**: 6 hours avg, 3 hours std dev
   - avg: 21,600 s
   - std dev: 10,800 s

9. **('PT', 'PK')**: 2 hours avg, 1 hour std dev
   - avg: 7,200 s
   - std dev: 3,600 s

10. **('PK', 'WS')**: 1 hour avg, 0.5 hours std dev
    - avg: 3,600 s
    - std dev: 1,800 s

11. **('WS', 'DT')**: 2 days avg, 1 day std dev
    - avg: 172,800 s
    - std dev: 86,400 s

12. **('DT', 'AS')**: 1 day avg, 0.5 days std dev
    - avg: 86,400 s
    - std dev: 43,200 s

13. **('SS', 'CA')**: 19.5 days avg, 5.12 days std dev
    - avg: 1,684,800 s
    - std dev: 441,408 s

14. **('SS', 'PT')**: 19.75 days avg, 5.12 days std dev
    - avg: 1,700,800 s
    - std dev: 441,408 s

15. **('OP', 'CA')**: 16.5 days avg, 5.02 days std dev
    - avg: 1,425,600 s
    - std dev: 432,864 s

16. **('RC', 'CA')**: 1.5 days avg, 0.71 days std dev
    - avg: 129,600 s
    - std dev: 61,584 s

17. **('QI', 'PK')**: 1.333 days avg, 0.57 days std dev
    - avg: 115,200 s
    - std dev: 49,248 s

18. **('CA', 'WS')**: 0.375 days avg, 0.29 days std dev
    - avg: 32,400 s
    - std dev: 25,056 s

19. **('PT', 'DT')**: 2.125 days avg, 1.02 days std dev
    - avg: 183,600 s
    - std dev: 87,840 s

20. **('PK', 'AS')**: 3.042 days avg, 1.41 days std dev
    - avg: 262,080 s
    - std dev: 121,632 s

Now, I'll round these values to the nearest thousand for simplicity, unless the value is already exact.

For example:

- ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 86400)
- ('SS', 'RC'): (1555200, 440640)
- ('SS', 'QI'): (1598400, 441408)
- ... and so on.

To make it more manageable, I'll round them:

- ('SS', 'OP'): (259000, 86000)
- ('SS', 'RC'): (1555000, 441000)
- ('SS', 'QI'): (1598000, 441000)
- ('OP', 'RC'): (1296000, 432000)
- ('OP', 'QI'): (1339000, 433000)
- ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 43200)
- ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 43200)
- ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 10800)
- ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 3600)
- ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 1800)
- ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 86400)
- ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 43200)
- ('SS', 'CA'): (1685000, 441000)
- ('SS', 'PT'): (1701000, 441000)
- ('OP', 'CA'): (1426000, 433000)
- ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 61600)
- ('QI', 'PK'): (115200, 49200)
- ('CA', 'WS'): (32400, 25100)
- ('PT', 'DT'): (184000, 87800)
- ('PK', 'AS'): (262000, 122000)

I need to make sure that the standard deviations are reasonable and not larger than the averages, unless it makes sense in certain scenarios.

Looking at ('SS', 'RC'), for example, with an average of 1,555,200 seconds and a standard deviation of 440,640 seconds, which is about 28% of the average. This seems plausible for supply chain processes where lead times can vary significantly.

Similarly, for ('PK', 'AS'), with an average of 262,080 seconds and a standard deviation of 121,632 seconds, which is about 46% of the average. This higher variability could be due to fluctuating demand and distribution schedules.

I should also consider that some activities might have smaller variability relative to their averages. For instance, in manufacturing processes, certain stages like assembly or testing might have more controlled times, leading to smaller standard deviations.

Given that, I might adjust some standard deviations to be smaller percentages of their averages.

For example:

- ('CA', 'PT'): Average 21,600 s, Std Dev 10,800 s (50%)
  - Perhaps reduce std dev to 2,160 s (10% of average)

- ('PT', 'PK'): Average 7,200 s, Std Dev 3,600 s (50%)
  - Reduce std dev to 720 s (10% of average)

- ('PK', 'WS'): Average 3,600 s, Std Dev 1,800 s (50%)
  - Reduce std dev to 360 s (10% of average)

This adjustment assumes that these transitions are more tightly controlled in the manufacturing process.

Similarly, for ('QI', 'CA'), with an average of 86,400 s and std dev of 43,200 s (50%), maybe reduce std dev to 8,640 s (10%).

For ('WS', 'DT'), average 172,800 s, std dev 86,400 s (50%), perhaps reduce to 17,280 s (10%).

For ('DT', 'AS'), average 86,400 s, std dev 43,200 s (50%), reduce to 8,640 s (10%).

For ('SS', 'CA'), ('SS', 'PT'), ('OP', 'CA'), which have higher averages and standard deviations, perhaps keep the higher variability to account for the longer chains involving more steps and thus more potential for variation.

So, the adjusted temporal profile dictionary would look like this:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 25920),  # 3 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1555200, 155520),  # 18 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1598400, 159840),  # 18.5 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1296000, 129600),  # 15 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1339200, 133920),  # 15.5 days, 10%
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 4320),  # 12 hours, 10%
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 8640),  # 1 day, 10%
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 2160),  # 6 hours, 10%
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 720),  # 2 hours, 10%
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 360),  # 1 hour, 10%
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 17280),  # 2 days, 10%
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 8640),  # 1 day, 10%
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1684800, 168480),  # 19.5 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1700800, 170080),  # 19.75 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1425600, 142560),  # 16.5 days, 10%
    ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 12960),  # 1.5 days, 10%
    ('QI', 'PK'): (115200, 11520),  # 1.33 days, 10%
    ('CA', 'WS'): (32400, 3240),  # 9 hours, 10%
    ('PT', 'DT'): (183600, 18360),  # 2.125 days, 10%
    ('PK', 'AS'): (262080, 26208)  # 3.042 days, 10%
}
```

This dictionary provides a comprehensive view of the expected time intervals between various activities in the supply chain process, along with their variability. This information can be used to identify deviations in process executions that may indicate inefficiencies or issues that require attention.

## Final Solution
To create a temporal profile for the global supply chain process in the high-tech electronics industry, we need to estimate the average time and standard deviation for the intervals between various activities. This will help in identifying any deviations from the expected norms.

### Approach
1. **Activity Sequence**: Identify the sequence of activities involved in the supply chain.
2. **Time Estimation**: Estimate average times and standard deviations for direct and indirect transitions between activities.
3. **Dictionary Construction**: Construct a Python dictionary where keys are tuples of activity pairs and values are tuples of `(average_time, standard_deviation)` in seconds.

### Solution Code
```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (259200, 25920),     # 3 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1555200, 155520),   # 18 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1598400, 159840),   # 18.5 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1296000, 129600),   # 15 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'QI'): (1339200, 133920),   # 15.5 days, 10%
    ('RC', 'QI'): (43200, 4320),       # 12 hours, 10%
    ('QI', 'CA'): (86400, 8640),       # 1 day, 10%
    ('CA', 'PT'): (21600, 2160),       # 6 hours, 10%
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 720),         # 2 hours, 10%
    ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 360),         # 1 hour, 10%
    ('WS', 'DT'): (172800, 17280),     # 2 days, 10%
    ('DT', 'AS'): (86400, 8640),       # 1 day, 10%
    ('SS', 'CA'): (1684800, 168480),   # 19.5 days, 10%
    ('SS', 'PT'): (1700800, 170080),   # 19.75 days, 10%
    ('OP', 'CA'): (1425600, 142560),   # 16.5 days, 10%
    ('RC', 'CA'): (129600, 12960),     # 1.5 days, 10%
    ('QI', 'PK'): (115200, 11520),     # 1.33 days, 10%
    ('CA', 'WS'): (32400, 3240),       # 9 hours, 10%
    ('PT', 'DT'): (183600, 18360),     # 2.125 days, 10%
    ('PK', 'AS'): (262080, 26208)      # 3.042 days, 10%
}
```

### Explanation
- **Activity Pairs**: The dictionary includes pairs of activities that are directly or indirectly connected in the supply chain process.
- **Average Time**: The first element in each value tuple represents the average time in seconds between the two activities.
- **Standard Deviation**: The second element represents the standard deviation in seconds, set to 10% of the average time to account for variability.

This temporal profile can be used to monitor and analyze the supply chain process for any significant deviations from the expected time intervals, thereby helping in identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
