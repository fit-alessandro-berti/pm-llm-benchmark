**Solution:**

To create a temporal profile for the global supply chain process of manufacturing high-tech electronics, we need to estimate the average time and standard deviation for the time intervals between various pairs of activities. These activities include Supplier Selection (SS), Order Placement (OP), Receive Components (RC), Quality Inspection (QI), Component Assembly (CA), Product Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Warehouse Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and After-Sales Support (AS).

Given the complexity and variability in such a process, the following dictionary provides estimated average times and standard deviations for selected pairs of activities. These estimates are based on typical industry practices and may vary depending on specific circumstances such as supplier location, component complexity, and market demand.

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (14400, 3600),  # 4 hours avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('OP', 'RC'): (604800, 86400), # 7 days avg, 1 day stdev
    ('RC', 'QI'): (3600, 1800),    # 1 hour avg, 0.5 hour stdev
    ('QI', 'CA'): (7200, 3600),    # 2 hours avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('CA', 'PT'): (14400, 3600),   # 4 hours avg, 1 hour stdev
    ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 1800),    # 1 hour avg, 0.5 hour stdev
    ('PK', 'WS'): (1800, 900),     # 0.5 hours avg, 0.25 hour stdev
    ('WS', 'DT'): (86400, 17280),  # 1 day avg, 4 hours stdev
    ('DT', 'AS'): (2592000, 604800)# 30 days avg, 7 days stdev
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP):**
   - **Average Time:** 4 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - *Reasoning:* Once a supplier is selected, placing an order typically follows shortly afterward, with some variability based on administrative processes.

2. **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC):**
   - **Average Time:** 7 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 day
   - *Reasoning:* The time to receive components depends on the supplier's lead time, which can vary based on location and supplier efficiency.

3. **Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI):**
   - **Average Time:** 1 hour
   - **Standard Deviation:** 0.5 hours
   - *Reasoning:* Quality inspection usually starts soon after receiving components, with some flexibility depending on inspection resources.

4. **Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA):**
   - **Average Time:** 2 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - *Reasoning:* After inspection, components are assembled, with time varying based on assembly line availability and complexity.

5. **Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT):**
   - **Average Time:** 4 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 1 hour
   - *Reasoning:* Testing follows assembly, with time depending on the testing queue and test duration.

6. **Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK):**
   - **Average Time:** 1 hour
   - **Standard Deviation:** 0.5 hours
   - *Reasoning:* Packaging occurs shortly after successful testing, with some variability in packaging line availability.

7. **Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS):**
   - **Average Time:** 0.5 hours
   - **Standard Deviation:** 0.25 hours
   - *Reasoning:* Packaged products are quickly moved to warehouse storage, with minimal delay.

8. **Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT):**
   - **Average Time:** 1 day
   - **Standard Deviation:** 4 hours
   - *Reasoning:* Distribution occurs after products are stored, depending on shipping schedules and demand.

9. **Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS):**
   - **Average Time:** 30 days
   - **Standard Deviation:** 7 days
   - *Reasoning:* After-sales support typically begins after the product has been in use for some time, with variability based on customer usage and support needs.

This temporal profile provides a structured way to understand and manage the time intervals between critical activities in the supply chain process, enabling better planning and anomaly detection.
