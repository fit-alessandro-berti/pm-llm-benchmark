### **Process Name:** Invoice Approval Process  

---

#### **Roles/Participants:**  
- **Accounts Payable Clerk** (Mary)  
- **Purchasing Officer** (Dan)  
- **Department Manager** (Carlos)  
- **Accounts Payable Supervisor** (Rita)  
- **Supplier Relationship Manager** (Karen)  

#### **Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:**  
- Received Invoice (with or without PO number)  
- Purchase Order (PO)  
- Confirmation Email (from Purchasing to Accounts Payable)  
- Payment Schedule  
- Exception Notifications/Emails  
- Contract (referenced during pricing disputes)

#### **Main Process Sequence:**  

1. **Start Event:**  
   The process begins when **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** receives an invoice, typically via email.  

2. **Task 1: Check Invoice for Purchase Order (PO)**   
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Details:**  
     - If a **PO number is present**, proceed to Task 2.  
     - If no PO, send the invoice back to the supplier requesting additional details or the missing PO number. (Exception Path 1)

3. **Task 2: Log Invoice into Accounting System**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Details:** Record the invoice details in the accounting system for tracking purposes.  

4. **Task 3: Forward Invoice to Purchasing for Confirmation**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Details:** Send the logged invoice to the **Purchasing Officer (Dan)** to verify accuracy and validate against the PO.  

5. **Task 4: Validate Invoice Against PO**  
   - **Role:** Purchasing Officer  
   - **Details:**  
     - Compare the invoice with the PO in terms of quantities, pricing, and delivery charges.  
     - If there is a discrepancy (e.g., incorrect pricing, missing items), contact the supplier directly or request the invoice be held by Accounts Payable (Exception Path 2).  
     - If everything matches, send a confirmation email back to Accounts Payable.  

6. **Task 5: Match Invoice Line Items with PO Details**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Details:** Reconcile the invoice line items with the PO details in the system.  
     - If there are discrepancies that cannot be resolved by Accounts Payable, escalate to the **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** (Exception Path 3).  

7. **Gateway 1: Do Goods/Services Match and is the Invoice Accurate?**  
   - **Flow:**  
     - If **YES**, proceed to Task 6 (Manager Approval).  
     - If **NO**, escalate to **Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)** for resolution of exceptions.

8. **Task 6: Approve Invoice**  
   - **Role:** Department Manager  
   - **Details:**  
     - Review the invoice with its supporting documentation (PO, confirmation email).  
     - Approve if everything is accurate and in alignment with budget.  
     - If there are significant discrepancies (e.g., unexpected items or large variances in costs), reject the request or send it back to Accounts Payable for investigation (Exception Path 4).  

9. **Task 7: Schedule Invoice for Payment**  
   - **Role:** Accounts Payable Clerk  
   - **Details:** After approval by the Department Manager, schedule the invoice for payment in the next payment cycle.  

10. **End Event:**  
    The invoice is paid, and the process ends.  

---

#### **Exceptions and Variations:**  

1. **Exception Path 1:** Missing PO Number  
   - If the invoice does not have a PO number, the **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** sends the invoice back to the supplier requesting the missing information.  
   - The process resumes once the supplier provides the PO.  

2. **Exception Path 2:** Discrepancy During Purchasing Validation  
   - If the invoice details (e.g., quantities, pricing) do not match the PO, the **Purchasing Officer (Dan)**:  
     - Contacts the supplier for clarification or correction.  
     - Requests the **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** to hold the invoice until the supplier sends the corrected version.  
   - Once resolved, the process resumes at Task 4.  

3. **Exception Path 3:** Unresolvable Matching Issues  
   - If the **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** cannot reconcile the invoice with the PO and the **Purchasing Officer** is unable to resolve the issue, the case is **escalated to Accounts Payable Supervisor (Rita)**.  
   - The **Accounts Payable Supervisor** may:  
     - Contact suppliers directly.  
     - Coordinate with department heads to create a retrospective PO for informal contracts or resolve the issue through other means.  

4. **Exception Path 4:** Manager Flags Issues During Approval  
   - If the **Department Manager (Carlos)** identifies significant discrepancies during the final approval (e.g., unexpected items, budget variance), the invoice is either rejected or sent back to the **Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)** for further investigation.  
   - The process resumes after investigation.  

---

#### **Process Notes:**  
- **Automation:** The system automatically sends manager approval requests (Task 6) once confirmation and matching steps are completed.  
- **Artifacts Movement:** The invoice flows through multiple steps (physical or digital), starting from Accounts Payable to Purchasing, Manager, and back to Accounts Payable.  
- **System Support:** The accounting system facilitates tracking, matching, and generating notifications (e.g., approvals, escalations).
