 Based on the provided data, it appears that the process involves employees submitting declarations for some purpose (e.g., expenses, leave, projects). The declarations then go through a series of approvals, with different approvers involved depending on the variant of the process. Here's a high-level description of the process:

1. An employee submits a declaration.
2. The declaration is reviewed and approved by an administrator.
3. If the declaration requires additional approvals (as in some variants), it will be routed to either a budget owner, pre-approver, or supervisor for further approval.
4. Once all necessary approvals have been obtained, the declaration moves on to the "Request Payment" step.
5. After the request is made, the payment is handled, and the process ends.

Some variants of the process include additional steps such as rejection by an approver, which leads to the employee resubmitting or modifying their declaration. Other variants involve the declaration being saved by the employee without any further action. In some cases, the declaration may be rejected by a missing party, which suggests that there is a required role (e.g., supervisor) that was not involved in the approval process for that particular declaration.

Overall, it seems that the process involves multiple approvers reviewing and either approving or rejecting employee declarations before payment can be handled. The specific sequence of approvals may vary depending on the type of declaration being processed.
