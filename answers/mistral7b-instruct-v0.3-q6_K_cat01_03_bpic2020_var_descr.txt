 This data represents a workflow or approval process for employee declarations, followed by payment processing. Here's a breakdown of the steps and their outcomes:

1. An employee submits a declaration to the administration for approval.
2. If the declaration is approved by the administration, it moves on to the budget owner for approval. Depending on the results, the declaration can be either:
   - Approved -> The budget owner approves the declaration, which then leads to a request for payment. Once processed, the payment is handled (with various performance and frequency figures).
   - Rejected -> The budget owner rejects the declaration, and it goes back to the employee for resubmission.
   - Missing information -> An unusual case where the declaration is missing required information and cannot proceed further until the necessary details are provided by the employee.

3. If the declaration is initially rejected by the supervisor or employee, it will be resubmitted, and the process repeats until it is approved or reaches a dead-end due to continuous rejections.

4. After being approved by the administration and budget owner, the declaration moves on to the supervisor for final approval. If approved, a request for payment follows, and the payment is processed (again with different performance and frequency figures).

5. In some cases, there is an additional pre-approver stage before the declaration goes to the supervisor for final approval. Again, if rejected at any point in this process, it will be resubmitted by the employee until it is approved or reaches a dead-end due to continuous rejections.

6. Rejections from administrators, budget owners, supervisors, pre-approvers, and employees are common throughout the process. Some declarations may have multiple rejections and resubmissions before being finalized or discarded.

7. Certain declarations might not make it past certain stages due to various reasons (e.g., rejected by the administrator, missing information, etc.). In those cases, the declaration is not processed any further and does not result in a payment.
