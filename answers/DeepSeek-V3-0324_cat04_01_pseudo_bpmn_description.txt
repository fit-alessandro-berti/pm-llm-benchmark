### **Business Process Explanation**  

The provided **pseudo-BPMN** diagram outlines a **customer request handling process**, which branches based on whether the request is **standard** or **custom**. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process, including the purpose of each step, gateway logic, and path convergence.

---

### **1. Process Start & Initial Request Handling**  
- **Start Event → Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**  
  - The process begins when a customer submits a request.  
  - The request is logged and prepared for further processing.  

- **Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**  
  - A **decision point** that routes the request based on its type:  
    - **Standard Request** → Proceeds to **Task B1** (Standard Validation).  
    - **Custom Request** → Proceeds to **Task B2** (Custom Feasibility Analysis).  

---

### **2. Standard Request Path**  
- **Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**  
  - Ensures the request meets predefined business rules (e.g., valid customer, product availability).  

- **Gateway (AND): "Run Parallel Checks"**  
  - **Parallel execution** of two tasks:  
    - **Task C1: "Credit Check"** → Verifies customer’s creditworthiness.  
    - **Task C2: "Inventory Check"** → Confirms stock availability.  
  - **All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)** → Both tasks must finish before proceeding.  

- **Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**  
  - Determines the estimated delivery time based on inventory and credit status.  

---

### **3. Custom Request Path**  
- **Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**  
  - Assesses whether the requested customization is technically and financially viable.  

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**  
  - **If Yes** → Proceeds to **Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"** (creates a tailored offer).  
  - **If No** → Proceeds to **Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice"** → **End Event** (process terminates).  

---

### **4. Convergence of Paths & Approval Logic**  
After either the **Standard** or **Custom** path completes, the process converges at:  

- **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**  
  - **If No** → Skips to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"** (no further checks).  
  - **If Yes** → Proceeds to **Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"** (for high-value or complex requests).  

  - **Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**  
    - **If Yes** → Proceeds to **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**.  
    - **If No** → **Task H: "Re-evaluate Conditions"** → **Loops back** to:  
      - **Task E1 (Custom Path)** → Adjusts quotation.  
      - **Task D (Standard Path)** → Recalculates delivery date.  

---

### **5. Final Steps**  
- **Task G: "Generate Final Invoice"**  
  - Produces the final bill for the customer.  

- **Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**  
  - Notifies the customer of the approved request and invoice.  

- **End Event** → Process concludes.

### **Key Differences Between Standard & Custom Paths**  
| **Aspect**          | **Standard Request** | **Custom Request** |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **Initial Check**    | Basic validation (B1) | Feasibility study (B2) |
| **Parallel Checks**  | Credit & Inventory (C1, C2) | None |
| **Quotation**        | Not needed (predefined pricing) | Custom quote (E1) |
| **Rejection Path**   | Rare (only if checks fail) | Possible if unfeasible (E2) |

---

### **Conditions Triggering Approvals & Rework**  
- **Approval Needed?**  
  - High-value orders, exceptions, or policy requirements.  
- **Re-evaluation (Rework)**  
  - If **approval is denied**, adjustments are made before resubmission.  

This process ensures **efficient handling** of both standard and custom requests while maintaining **control via approvals and checks**. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!
