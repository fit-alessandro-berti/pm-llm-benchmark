What a massive and complex dataset!

To identify the main differences, I'll focus on the process flow, error rates, and outcomes. Here's my analysis:

**Differences in process flow:**

1. **Expert Examination**: The processes with Expert Examination ( Register at FD -> Expert Examination / Register at ER -> Expert Examination) have higher frequencies (~1466 / 1418 for FD, ~656 / 593 for ER) compared to the ones without (~505 for discharge).
2. **Thorough Examination**: Some processes include a Thorough Examination step, which seems to be more prevalent in the Register at FD (FD has two paths with this step: Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination and Examination -> Thorough Examination).

**Differences in error rates:**

1. **Failure rates**: The procedures with expert examination have higher failure rates (~5% for FD and ~6% ER compared to ~0% for direct discharge).
2. **Failure sequences**: Procedures with the word "unsuccessful" in their name seem to be more prone to errors: Thorough Examination -> Treatment unsuccessful, Expert Examination -> Diagnosis then Treatment unsuccessful.

**Differences in outcomes:**

1. **Success rates**: Procedures resulting from an examination (Expert, Thorough) have higher success rates (~60% for FD and ~70% ER compared to 0% direct discharge).
2. **Waiting times**: There is no explicit data on waiting times. However, the frequency of each process step suggests that the overall workflow might be affected by processing time.

**Domain-specific insights:**

1. **Higher failure rates in Direct Discharge paths**: These paths seem to have higher error rates or less successful treatments (~0% vs ~5%-6%).
2. **Expert Examination: A crucial step?**: Procedures with expert examination (FD and ER) tend to have better outcomes.

To address your original question – "which are the main differences?"

**Main differences:**

1. **The impact of Expert Examination**: Processes that include an expert examination seem to have higher frequencies, more successful treatments, but also higher failure rates.
2. **Differences in process flow**: There is a distinction between procedures with and without Thorough Examination and those starting from Expert Examination vs. direct examination steps.

**Potential areas for improvement:**

1. **Optimize Examinations**: Streamline the processes by combining or eliminating redundant examination steps.
2. **Reducing error rates**: Improve treatment success rates, especially in procedures where "unsuccessful" outcomes occur more frequently.

Please note that without knowing the specific context and application of these data, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. This analysis is intended as an exploratory approach to highlight potential differences and areas for improvement.
