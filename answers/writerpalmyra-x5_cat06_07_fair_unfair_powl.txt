Here are **two POWL models** representing the hiring process at *GlobalTeq Solutions*, reflecting the described workflow with and without potential bias. These models follow the **POWL syntax and structure** as defined in `pm4py.objects.powl.obj`, using `Transition`, `SilentTransition`, `OperatorPOWL`, and `StrictPartialOrder` to encode the process flow, including loops for data completeness, XOR branching (where applicable), and sequential dependencies.

---

###  **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model includes an **XOR branch** after the skill assessment, where applicants either undergo a **standard cultural fit check** or are routed to a **CommunityAffiliationCheck** that implicitly provides preferential treatment—introducing a potential source of bias.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Application and Data Completeness Loop
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")

# Loop: Check data completeness; if incomplete, request more info and re-check
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[
    DataCompletenessCheck,
    RequestMoreInfo
])

# Step 2: Skill Assessment
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")

# Step 3: XOR Branch – Source of Potential Unfairness
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

# XOR choice: Either standard evaluation OR community-affiliated path
cultural_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[
    CulturalFitCheck,
    CommunityAffiliationCheck
])

# Step 4: Final Human Review and Decision
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Assemble the overall flow in partial order with dependencies
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    cultural_xor,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define order constraints
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_xor, ManagerialReview)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

```

>  **Bias Note:** The `CommunityAffiliationCheck` activity in the XOR branch creates a parallel, less rigorous or implicitly favorable path for certain applicants—this is where **unfair advantage** can emerge due to subjective uplift based on affiliations or locality.

---

###  **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This version **removes the biased XOR branch**. All applicants follow the **same standardized cultural fit evaluation**, eliminating the preferential treatment pathway. Fairness is improved by ensuring **uniform treatment** post-skill assessment.

```python
# Reuse common components from above (ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck, etc.)
# Only the cultural evaluation part changes

# Step 3: Unified Cultural Fit Check – No Special Paths
CulturalFitCheck_fair = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

# No XOR – everyone goes through the same activity
# Remove CommunityAffiliationCheck entirely

# Assemble fair process
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    data_loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck_fair,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Define order constraints – same flow, but no choice
root_fair.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, SkillAssessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck_fair)
root_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck_fair, ManagerialReview)
root_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

```

>  **Fairness Note:** By collapsing the XOR into a **single mandatory CulturalFitCheck**, we ensure **equitable treatment** of all applicants. While the evaluation may still involve subjectivity, the structural bias from differential pathways is eliminated.

###  Summary of Key Differences:

| Feature                        | Model with Unfairness                          | Model without Unfairness                     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Bias Mechanism**            | Present via XOR to `CommunityAffiliationCheck`| Absent – no special tracks                   |
| **Control Flow**              | XOR branching after skill test                 | Linear path – all take `CulturalFitCheck`    |
| **Equity**                    | Lower – preferential treatment possible        | Higher – standardized process                |
| **Process Transparency**      | Reduced – opaque advantage for some            | Higher – all follow same steps               |

###  Recommendation:
Organizations seeking **fair and inclusive hiring** should adopt processes like the **second (fair) model**, possibly further enhancing objectivity by:
- Standardizing evaluation rubrics.
- Blinding affiliation data during review.
- Auditing outcomes for demographic disparities.

Let me know if you'd like these models visualized as graphs, exported in PM4Py format, or extended with probabilistic weights for bias simulation.
