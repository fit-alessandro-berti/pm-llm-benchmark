This dataset represents a flowchart in which various employees, administrators, and budget owners interact with different processes to ensure that projects are completed correctly each month. Here's a detailed breakdown of the operations described:

1. **Submission**: The employee submits their project or request.
   
2. **Approval**:
   - Approval by SUPERVISOR: Projects proceed to the payment phase after meeting certain performance benchmarks set for final approval criteria.
     - For example, 5133 projects are approved under ADMINISTRATION with final approval from SUPERVISOR and each has shown above average performance (with a frequency around 8202/574,69).

   - Approval by PRE_APPROVER: Similar to SUPERVISOR but for pre-approval.
     - Only a dozen operations follow this category.

3. **Further Processing**:
   - For APPROVED projects, it goes through various steps including the final approval phase that is only finalized with an approval from ADMINISTRATION or BUDGET OWNER as per 97087/42617 or 15472/408.
   
4. **Final Rejections**:
   - There are several rejection types and their associated frequencies and performances, which can be categorized into final approvals by different stages (SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER).

- Final rejections occur when projects or aspects of a project don't meet any of these criteria and must proceed to the missing data phase with frequencies ranging from 1 to 19.

5. **Payment Handling**:
   - All approved projects eventually move on to payment handling.
   
6. **Operations Flow Across Multiple Departments**:
   - The system works across numerous departments, including EMPLOYEE (employees), SUPERVISOR (superintendents), ADMINISTRATION (administrators, potentially managing budget owners or other key stakeholders), BUDGET OWNER (responsible for controlling project budgets and approving the overall feasibility of projects), PRE_APPROVER (pre-approved but not yet final approved).
