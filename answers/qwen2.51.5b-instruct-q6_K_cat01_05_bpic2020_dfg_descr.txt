Certainly! Let's break down the described process into its main components and steps:

### Process Components

1. **Declaration Submission**:
   - Declaration is submitted by either an employee (Submission) or a SUPERVISOR.
   
2. **Decision Making**:
   - The decision-making processes are controlled by different roles such as ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET OWNER, PRE_APPROVER, and SUPERVISOR.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Each process has associated frequency and performance metrics that indicate how many times the process occurred and its average performance score.

### Detailed Process Flow

1. **Declaration Submission (by EMPLOYEE or by SUPERVISOR)**:
    - If submitted by an employee, it may go through various checks like PRE_APPROVER and ADMINISTRATION before being finalized.
    
2. **Decision to APPROVE**:
   - There are several scenarios for approval: FINAL_APPROVED, APPROVED, REJECTED.
   - These decisions involve different levels of review (SUPERVISOR, BUDGET OWNER, etc.).

3. **Payment Handling**:
    - After an APPROVED declaration is received, it triggers a payment process.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Each step in the flow has its own frequency and performance score, indicating how often this type of interaction occurs with different levels of success or failure.
  
### Example:

- **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment (frequency = 10038)**
  - This indicates that for every final approval from a supervisor, there is an average request payment process involved.

- **Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 10037)**
  - For every request made after receiving a final payment, the payment handling step is typically completed on average with performance of approximately $289,605.81 per transaction.

### Detailed Flow Chart

Here's a simplified flow chart to illustrate the process:

```
Declaration Submission (EMPLOYEE/SUPERVISOR)
    |
Final Approve (SUPERVISOR) -> Request Payment
   /                              \
Final Approve (ADMINISTRATION)  Final Approve (BUDGET OWNER) 
     |                                       |                   |
   Approval -> Approval                    Rejected by ADMINIS            Approved and Paid
        SUPERVISOR                       BUDGET OWNER                 Superiors

Request Payment -> Payment Handled (frequency = 10037)
Declaration APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
```

### Summary:

- **Employee** submits a declaration which may go through various approvals before being finalized.
- If final approved, it triggers payment processing.
- The performance metrics for each step indicate the frequency and success rate of completing each action.

This process ensures that declarations are reviewed appropriately and payments are handled efficiently.
