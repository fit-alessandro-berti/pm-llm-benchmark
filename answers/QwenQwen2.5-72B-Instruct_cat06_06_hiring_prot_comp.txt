To identify the main differences between the treatment processes of the 'protected' and 'unprotected' groups, we can focus on several key aspects: process variants, frequency, and performance (execution time). Let's break down the main differences:

### 1. **Frequency of Process Variants:**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The most common process variants involve a straightforward path from registration to discharge, with or without thorough examinations or expert examinations. For example, "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (284 occurrences) and "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (269 occurrences).
  - There are also some instances where the treatment is unsuccessful and requires additional diagnosis and treatment (e.g., "Register at FD -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with 48 occurrences).

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The most common process variants also involve a straightforward path, but with a higher frequency of thorough examinations and expert examinations. For example, "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (1466 occurrences) and "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" (1418 occurrences).
  - There are also more instances of treatment failure and multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment (e.g., "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" with 225 occurrences).

### 2. **Performance (Execution Time):**
- **Protected Group:**
  - The performance times for the most common process variants are relatively low, around 260,000 to 320,000 units of time. For example, "Register at ER -> Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 260001.236.
  - Process variants involving treatment failure and multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment have significantly higher performance times, often around 400,000 to 600,000 units of time. For instance, "Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 480019.789.

- **Unprotected Group:**
  - The performance times for the most common process variants are also relatively low, around 320,000 units of time. For example, "Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 320004.432.
  - However, process variants involving treatment failure and multiple rounds of diagnosis and treatment have significantly higher performance times, often around 480,000 to 640,000 units of time. For instance, "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment unsuccessful -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" has a performance of 639982.275.

### 3. **Key Differences:**
1. **Frequency of Complex Processes:**
   - The unprotected group has a higher frequency of complex process variants involving multiple examinations and treatment failures, which suggests more prolonged and intensive care.
   - The protected group has a higher frequency of straightforward process variants, indicating a more streamlined and potentially less resource-intensive treatment process.

2. **Performance (Execution Time):**
   - Both groups have similar performance times for straightforward process variants, around 260,000 to 320,000 units of time.
   - However, the unprotected group has significantly higher performance times for complex process variants, indicating that when treatment fails, the follow-up care is more extensive and time-consuming.

3. **Initial Registration:**
   - Both groups have instances of direct registration without further processes, but the unprotected group has a higher frequency of discharges without further processes (505 occurrences), which might suggest a higher rate of immediate discharge or simpler cases.

### Conclusion:
The main differences lie in the frequency and complexity of the treatment processes. The unprotected group experiences more frequent and complex treatment processes, with higher performance times for complex variants, indicating a more resource-intensive and time-consuming treatment path. This suggests potential disparities in the care and treatment received by the two groups, with the unprotected group facing more challenges and delays in their treatment processes.
