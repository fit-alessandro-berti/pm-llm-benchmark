## 1. **Identification of Normative Rule Violations**

Normative rules are **strict** and must not be violated. Recalling the sequence:

- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case  
- Special rules:  
    - Credit Check **must precede** Risk Assessment.  
    - Finalize Documentation **only after approval, not after rejection**.

Let’s examine each case:

---

### **Case 1**

| Timestamp           | Activity                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 09:00               | Application Received        |
| 09:30               | Credit Check               |
| 10:00               | Risk Assessment            |
| 11:00               | Loan Decision (Approved)   |
| 13:00               | Inform Applicant           |
| 13:30               | Finalize Documentation     |
| 14:00               | Close Case                 |

**Analysis:**  
- All activities appear in the correct order.
- “Credit Check” happens before “Risk Assessment.”
- “Finalize Documentation” only after approval.
- No activities are skipped or out of sequence.
- No contradictory actions.

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations**.

### **Case 2**

| Timestamp           | Activity                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 08:00               | Application Received        |
| 08:20               | Risk Assessment            | ** Out of order**
| 09:00               | Credit Check               |
| 09:30               | Loan Decision (Rejected)   |
| 10:00               | Finalize Documentation     | ** Not allowed after rejection**
| 10:30               | Close Case                 |

**Analysis:**  
- **Violation 1:** “Risk Assessment” happens before “Credit Check” (rule: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment).
- **Violation 2:** “Finalize Documentation” is performed after a rejection, which is explicitly disallowed.

**Conclusion:** **Normative rule violations**:
- Activities are out of order.
- Finalization attempted after a rejected decision.

### **Case 3**

| Timestamp           | Activity                    |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| 09:00 (12 Jan)      | Application Received        |
| 10:00 (14 Jan)      | Credit Check               |
| 11:00 (14 Jan)      | Risk Assessment            |
| 12:00 (14 Jan)      | Loan Decision (Approved)   |
| 15:00 (16 Jan)      | Inform Applicant           |
| 09:00 (17 Jan)      | Finalize Documentation     |
| 10:00 (17 Jan)      | Close Case                 |

**Analysis:**  
- Activities are in proper order.
- “Credit Check” occurs before “Risk Assessment.”
- “Finalize Documentation” is performed after approval, not after rejection.
- All steps included; none skipped or reversed.

**Conclusion:** **No normative violations**.

---

## 2. **Identification of Desiderata (Recommended) Deviations**

Desiderata (recommended, but not strictly required):

- **Credit Check** should be within 24h after Application Received.
- **Inform Applicant** ideally within 48h after Loan Decision.
- It is **encouraged** to perform a **Follow-up Call** before closing.

---

### **Case 1**

- **Credit Check:** 30 minutes after Application Received  **OK**
- **Inform Applicant:** 2 hours after Loan Decision  **OK**
- **Follow-up Call:** Not mentioned, but not required.

**Conclusion:** Satisfies recommended timing. No desiderata violations.

---

### **Case 2**

- **Credit Check:** After Risk Assessment (but main issue is order, not timing; and timing is within the same hour as Application Received). Normative issue dominates here.
- **Inform Applicant:** NOT present.
    - However, the informing of applicant step is being done as expected in terms of ordering and timing, but the core issue *here* is the normative violation, not the desiderata.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not mentioned.

**Conclusion:** The primary concern is **normative violations**; desiderata aspects are less relevant because the process does not satisfy the minimal strict requirements.

---

### **Case 3**

- **Credit Check:** Occurs ~2 days (09:00, 12 Jan  10:00, 14 Jan) after Application Received (**later than recommended 24h**).
- **Inform Applicant:** Occurs approximately 2 days and 3 hours after Loan Decision (12:00, 14 Jan  15:00, 16 Jan; **later than recommended 48h**).
- **Follow-up Call:** Not present in the activity log (**desideratum missed**).

**Conclusion:** **Desiderata deviations:**
- Credit Check delayed.
- Inform Applicant delayed.
- Follow-up Call not performed.

---

## 3. **Interpretations and Justifications**

### **Case 1**
- This case represents perfect compliance—serves as a textbook example of process adherence.

---

### **Case 2**
- **Interpretation:** The process went out of sequence, possibly due to human error or data entry mistake (Risk Assessment before Credit Check). Finalizing documentation after rejection may indicate misunderstanding of the process or system flaw.
- **Justification:** Such violations are serious as they could compromise the integrity of the loan process (e.g., assessing risk without validated credit data, or undertaking unnecessary paperwork after rejection).
- **Recommendation:** Staff training and/or process automation to enforce correct ordering.

---

### **Case 3**
- **Interpretation:** Delays in the process steps (Credit Check and Inform Applicant) might be due to backlog, resource constraints, applicant delays (needing extra documentation), or system downtime.
- The absence of a Follow-up Call could reflect case volume pressures or simple forgetfulness; since it is not required, it represents a lost opportunity for enhanced customer satisfaction, but not noncompliance.
- **Recommendation:** Review resource allocation for time-sensitive steps and encourage use of reminders or checklists to boost adherence to best practices.

## **Summary Table**

| Case | **Normative Violation?** | **Desiderata Violations?** | **Explanation**                         |
|------|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------:|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | No                      | No                         | Fully compliant.                        |
| 2    | **Yes**                 | N/A                        | Risk Assessment before Credit Check; documentation finalized after rejection. |
| 3    | No                      | **Yes:**<br>• Credit Check delayed<br>• Applicant informed late<br>• No Follow-up Call | Only timing/best practice recommendations missed. |

---

## **Summary Statements**
- **Case 1:** Perfect compliance.
- **Case 2:** **Serious (normative) violations**—sequence out of order and prohibited documentation action after rejection.
- **Case 3:** **No severe violations**—but process is less optimal due to timing delays and a missing Follow-up Call (all recommendatory).
