**Explanation of Added Constraints and Bias Reduction:**

1.  **Coexistence: `Reject_Minority` & `Approve_Minority` with `ManualReview`:** This constraint enforces that if a decision to `Reject` or `Approve` is linked to an applicant's belonging to a "minority" demographic (represented by `Reject_Minority` and `Approve_Minority`), a `ManualReview` activity must also occur within the process.  This ensures that sensitive decisions are subjected to human oversight, preventing the algorithmic bias that could be present in the initial stages.

2.  **Response: `CheckApplicantRace` with `BiasMitigationCheck`:** This constraint makes it mandatory that a `BiasMitigationCheck` step must occur after `CheckApplicantRace`. This prevents immediate biased outcomes.  If the system checks the applicant's race, there *must* be a dedicated step to specifically address and mitigate any potential biases that might have arisen from considering the applicant's race.

3.  **Non-succession: `CheckApplicantRace` and `Reject`:** This prevents a `Reject` decision immediately following a `CheckApplicantRace` event. This is a strong measure to prevent racial bias. This constraint means that a rejection decision *cannot* be made immediately after a check of the applicant's race. Some other step must happen in between to evaluate all factors to ensure there is no bias in this decision.

These added constraints aim to mitigate bias by:
    *   Adding a human check for decisions that involve sensitive attributes.
    *   Requiring explicit mitigation steps when sensitive attributes are considered.
    *   Preventing sensitive attribute checks from directly leading to potentially biased outcomes. These mechanisms collectively make the process fairer and more transparent by limiting the potential for biased decisions.
