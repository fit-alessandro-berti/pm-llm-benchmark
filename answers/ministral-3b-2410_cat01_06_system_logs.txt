### Explanation

**Case Identification:**
- The user's activities are grouped into a single case (Case ID 1) because they are part of a coherent work session. The user switches between different applications and documents, but the sequence of activities is continuous and related to a single task (e.g., preparing a report, updating a budget, and replying to an email).

**Activity Naming:**
- The raw actions (e.g., "FOCUS," "TYPING," "SWITCH") are translated into higher-level activities that describe the user's actions more meaningfully (e.g., "Focus on Doc1," "Typing Draft," "Save Doc1").
- Standardized activity names are chosen to ensure consistency and clarity for process analysis.

**Event Attributes:**
- Each event includes a Case ID, Activity Name, and Timestamp. Additional attributes such as application name and window title are included to provide context.

**Coherent Narrative:**
- The event log tells a story of the user's work session, starting with focusing on and typing into a document, switching to an email, replying to it, switching to a PDF, highlighting key findings, switching to an Excel spreadsheet, updating figures, switching back to the document, typing a reference, saving the document, closing it, focusing on another document, typing a summary, saving it, and finally closing it.

This event log is designed to be suitable for analysis with standard process mining tools, providing a clear and coherent narrative of the user's activities.
