Here is an example of how the DECLARE model could be defined for this process:
```yaml
declare fine -> sendFine -> insertFineNotification -> addPenalty -> appealToJudge -> payment
or
    insertDateAppeal -> sendAppeal -> receiveResultAppeal -> notifyResultAppeal -> payment

declare
  fine -> sendFine -> insertFineNotification -> addPenalty -> appealToJudge -> payment
  or
      insertDateAppeal -> sendAppeal -> receiveResultAppeal -> notifyResultAppeal -> payment
  end if
end declare
```
