The visualization is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) swimlane diagram that maps how a computer hardware shop prepares a shipment.  
It is organized into three horizontal swimlanes representing the roles involved:

1. **Logistics** – handles parcel insurance and labeling.
2. **Dispatch of goods / Secretary** – manages most of the shipment planning and coordination tasks.
3. **Warehouse** – packages goods, manages delays, and prepares the shipment for pickup.

Starting from the left, the process begins when goods need to be shipped. The workflow includes:

- Determining the shipment method and whether special handling is required.
- Depending on the decision, obtaining offers from logistic companies and choosing one.
- Checking if parcel insurance is needed; if so, insuring the parcel.
- Writing the package label, filling out shipment paperwork, and moving the package to a pickup area.

Parallel warehouse actions package the goods within 48 hours; if a delay occurs, the customer is notified. The process concludes when the shipment is prepared for pickup.
