### Step 1: Understand and Analyze Logs

- **Log A (System A)**: Primary timeline, events have `timestamp`, `event_type`, and `order_id`. Timestamps might reflect when events were *received*, not when events started.
- **Log B (System B)**: Richer metadata—`user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`. Timestamps may be slightly offset, event names differ, some events are only present here.

---

### Step 2: Identify Corresponding Events and Matching Criteria

- **Matching key:** `order_id` + events that are semantically the same  
- **Timestamp tolerance:** 2 seconds diff or less  consider same event  
- **Mapping of event names:**

| Log A Event Type    | Log B Event Name     | Comment                          |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| Order Received      | OrderReceived       | Same logical event              |
| Order Validated     | OrderValidation     | Same logical event              |
| Payment Processed   | PaymentCheck        | Payment-related event           |
| Item Shipped        | Shipping            | Shipping event                  |
| Item Delivered      | (no match)          | No equivalent event in Log B    |
| (Additional in B)   | Quality Check       | No corresponding event in Log A |

---

### Step 3: Match Events Based on Timestamp and Name Similarity

| Log A Event                    | Log B Event                | Timestamps (Log A vs Log B)      | Time Diff | Match?           |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z - Order Received       | 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z - OrderReceived   | 2 seconds apart                 | 2 sec     | Yes              |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z - Order Validated      | 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z - OrderValidation  | 1 second apart                 | 1 sec     | Yes              |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z - Payment Processed    | 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck     | 5 seconds apart                | 5 sec     | No (outside tolerance)     |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z - Item Shipped         | 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z - Shipping         | 2 seconds apart                 | 2 sec     | Yes              |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z - Item Delivered       | No matching event                         |                                  | N/A       | No               |
|                               | 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z - Quality Check      | No corresponding event in Log A                    | N/A       | No               |

---

### Step 4: Matching Decisions

- **Order Received**: Matches perfectly, timestamps differ by exactly 2 seconds  accept as same event.
- **Order Validated**: Matches, 1 second difference  same event.
- **Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck**: 5 seconds apart — outside 2 second threshold, treat as separate events.
- **Item Shipped vs Shipping**: 2 second difference, treat as same event.
- **Item Delivered**: Only in Log A — include as is.
- **Quality Check**: Only in Log B — include as is.

---

### Step 5: Merged Log Structure & Attributes

- Attributes from Log A: `timestamp`, `event_type`, `order_id`
- Attributes from Log B: `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes`
- For matched events: merge attributes, keep Log A timestamp as primary timestamp; also store Log B timestamp if it differs.
- For unmatched events: preserve available attributes, mark origin (`System A` or `System B`).

---

### Step 6: Final Merged Event Log (Chronological Order)

| **Primary Timestamp**       | **Merged Event Type**  | **Order ID** | **Log A Timestamp**      | **Log B Timestamp**      | **user_id** | **resource_id** | **notes**                      | **Origin**       |

### Step 7: Explanatory Notes

- For **matching events**, Log A’s timestamp is chosen as the primary timestamp for chronology since Log A is the primary system timeline.
- For exact timestamp matches differing by <= 2 seconds, the events were merged to form an enriched record containing attributes from both logs.
- The **Payment Processed** and **PaymentCheck** events differ by 5 seconds, exceeding our 2-second threshold tolerance; hence, they are treated as separate events. This reflects possible different phases or retries in the payment process.
- Events only in Log B (**Quality Check**) or only in Log A (**Item Delivered**) are included as separate items preserving their origin.
- Some event naming differences (e.g., "OrderValidatED" vs "OrderValidation") were resolved by semantic equivalence.
