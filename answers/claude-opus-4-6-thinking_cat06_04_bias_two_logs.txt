# Bias Analysis of the Two Event Logs

## Which Log Exhibits Bias?

The **Group B (Unprotected Group) log** reveals the mechanism of bias, but the bias operates **against Group A (the Protected Group)**. The systematic advantage embedded in the process—through the `ScoreAdjustment` column—is exclusively accessible to Group B members, creating inequitable outcomes for Group A applicants.

## How the Bias Manifests

### 1. The Community Boost Mechanism

During **PreliminaryScoring**, certain Group B applicants receive a **+10 "Community Boost"** to their scores. This adjustment is triggered by membership in a recognized `CommunityGroup` (here, the *Highland Civic Darts Club*). Critically:

| Attribute | Group A (Protected) | Group B (Unprotected) |
|---|---|---|
| **LocalResident** | Always `FALSE` | Always `TRUE` |
| **CommunityGroup** | Always `None` | Sometimes affiliated |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always `0` | `+10` when affiliated |

Group A members are **structurally excluded** from this benefit. They are not local residents, have no community group ties, and therefore **never** receive a score adjustment. The boost is facially neutral (it references "community involvement"), but in practice it functions as a **proxy advantage** that only flows to the unprotected group.

### 2. The Critical Comparison: P002 vs. U003

This pairing makes the disparate impact unmistakable:

| Attribute | P002 (Group A) | U003 (Group B) |
|---|---|---|
| **Preliminary Score** | **710** | **695** |
| **Score Adjustment** | 0 | +10 |
| **Final Effective Score** | **710** | **705** |
| **Decision** | **Rejected** | **Approved** |

- **P002** starts with a *higher* raw score (710 > 695) yet is **rejected**.
- **U003** starts with a *lower* raw score but, after the community boost, reaches 705 and is **approved**.

This means U003 is approved at an effective score (705) that is **lower** than the score at which P002 is rejected (710). The protected group applicant is held to a **stricter de facto threshold** than the unprotected group applicant.

### 3. Reinforcing Comparison: P001 vs. U001

Both begin at a preliminary score of **720**. Both are approved. However, U001's score is inflated to **730**, giving that applicant a more comfortable margin above any decision threshold. If the threshold were slightly higher (e.g., 725), P001 would be rejected while U001 would still pass—illustrating how the boost creates a **systematic safety net** for Group B that Group A lacks.

## Structural Pathway of the Bias

The bias operates through a **chain of correlated attributes**:

```
Protected Group Membership
     LocalResident = FALSE
         CommunityGroup = None
             ScoreAdjustment = 0
                 Higher effective threshold for approval
                     Worse outcomes
```

While no single rule explicitly references group membership, the combination of `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` serves as a **proxy** for it. Every Group A applicant is a non-local resident with no community affiliation, so the "neutral" community boost rule **systematically and exclusively disadvantages** them.

## Summary of Findings

| Bias Indicator | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Differential score adjustment** | Group B members receive +10 boosts; Group A members never do |
| **Lower raw-score approvals for Group B** | U003 approved at raw 695; P002 rejected at raw 710 |
| **Proxy discrimination** | `LocalResident` and `CommunityGroup` are perfectly correlated with group membership, making a facially neutral rule function as a discriminatory one |
| **Unequal effective thresholds** | Group A effectively needs a higher score to achieve the same outcome |

**Conclusion:** The process embeds bias against the **Protected Group (Group A)** through a scoring adjustment mechanism that is nominally based on community involvement but is structurally inaccessible to that group. This results in Group A applicants being held to higher effective standards, leading to worse outcomes even when their underlying qualifications (preliminary scores) are equal or superior.
