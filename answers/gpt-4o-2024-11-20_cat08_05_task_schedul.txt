### Advanced Process Mining and Scheduling Optimization
#### **1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics**
To optimize Precision Parts Inc.'s scheduling, the MES event logs offer key insights into job flow, resource utilization, setup times, disruptions, and tardiness. Process mining provides a data-driven framework to reconstruct and quantify operational performance. Below is a detailed outline of how process mining techniques can be applied:

---

#### **Reconstructing the Actual Flow of Jobs and Task Execution Sequences**

* **Event Log Preprocessing:** Use MES logs to create event traces representing the life cycle of each job. Each trace includes task sequences, transition timestamps, machine-resource mappings, and job priorities.
* **Process Discovery Algorithms:**
  - Employ algorithms such as the **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristics Miner**, or **Inductive Miner** to generate process models. These models will include paths showing deviations (e.g., skipped tasks, loops from rework).
  - Specifically, the Inductive Miner enables capturing parallelism (tasks running simultaneously) for job-shop-like environments.
* **Visualization:** Use process maps and Gantt charts to visualize operations. Overlay timestamps to highlight bottlenecks, including long queue times or task execution delays.

#### **Key Metrics and Analytical Techniques**

1. **Job Flow Times, Lead Times, and Makespan Distributions (Job-Level Metrics):**
   - Use timestamps to compute flow times (release time to completion), lead times (order placement to completion), and makespan (total time for a single job from start to finish).
   - Visualize distributions using histograms or box plots to identify variability, trends, and outliers (identify jobs with excessive delays).

2. **Task Waiting Times (Queue Times):**
   - For each machine, analyze task queue entry timestamps vs. start times to compute waiting times.
   - Aggregate waiting times by machine and job priority to assess work center congestion and task prioritization effectiveness.
   - Identify long idle or starved periods for downstream machines due to upstream delays.

3. **Resource Utilization (Machine and Operator Metrics):**
   - Compute utilization percentages for each resource type:
     ```
     Utilization (%) = (Productive Time + Setup Time) / Total Available Time
     ```
   - Segment times into productive (working on tasks), idle (no jobs), and setup times. Highlight underutilized resources or overburdened bottlenecks.
   - Operator performance: Analyze task start and end times by operator to benchmark efficiency.

4. **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times:**
   - Use logs capturing `Setup Start` and `Setup End` events. Analyze durations as a function of the preceding and current job’s attributes (materials, dimensions).
   - Build correlation heatmaps showing pairwise sequence-dependent setup times per machine to flag particularly disruptive transitions.

5. **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness:**
   - Compute lateness per job: `Lateness = Completion Time - Due Date`.
   - Measure tardiness (positive lateness) distributions and frequency of early/on-time vs. late completions.
   - Trend analysis: Highlight late jobs across order priorities (e.g., medium-priority jobs delayed due to preemption by urgent "hot" jobs).

6. **Impact of Disruptions:**
   - Analyze breakdown events to compute downtime frequency and repair times.
   - Measure the time and magnitude of scheduling ripple effects for breakdown-prone machines or hot jobs.
   - Identify whether jobs completed before interruptions or delayed disproportionately by urgent task insertions.

Metric outputs highlight areas for improvement, such as inefficiencies caused by suboptimal job sequencing or underperforming machines.

#### **2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies**

Process mining and the above metrics enable diagnosis of the following inefficiencies:

1. **Bottleneck Identification:**
   - Use resource utilization and task queue times to pinpoint overloaded machines (e.g., high utilization >85%, long queues).
   - Bottleneck contributions to WIP accumulation can also be traced by analyzing synchronized job flows.

2. **Poor Task Prioritization:**
   - Variant analysis: Compare high-priority or near-due-date jobs completed late vs. on time. Poor prioritization may show hot jobs cutting in line while medium-priority jobs languish in queues.
   - Triage-specific delays at underutilized machines due to static rule application.

3. **Suboptimal Job Sequencing (Setup Waste):**
   - Evidence: Heatmaps of large, frequent setup times between dissimilar job configurations on critical machines. Significant lost time from poor sequencing reduces productivity.

4. **Starvation of Downstream Work Centers:**
   - Insights: Waiting jobs at downstream bottlenecks are caused by delay chains or upstream "batching" inefficiencies.
   - Identify periods of machine idleness downstream of bottlenecks while upstream queues grow.

5. **Bullwhip Effect in WIP:**
   - Process mining highlights variability in WIP levels across workstations. For example:
     - Bottleneck queue spikes cascade into erratic starvation downstream.
     - Hot jobs introduce unexpected WIP accumulation in intermediate stations.

#### **3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness**

**Key Drivers:**

1. **Static Scheduling Rules:**
   - Current rules (First-Come-First-Served, Earliest Due Date) fail to account for real-time shop floor states, such as bottlenecks or sequence-dependent setups.
   - Static rules neglect frequent disruptions or dynamic early/late prioritization.

2. **Poor Real-Time Visibility:**
   - Lack of global coordination leads to myopic scheduling, with independent machine-level optimizations exacerbating systemic imbalances.

3. **Inaccurate Task and Setup Time Estimates:**
   - Planning relies on fixed, assumed setup/duration times, ignoring historical data variability (e.g., operator skill differences or preceding job sequences).

4. **Disruptive Sequencing:**
   - Pairwise setup times and lack of batch optimization lead to excessive setups and machine under-utilization.

5. **Disruption Response:**
   - Ad-hoc handling of breakdowns and hot jobs compounds delays without predictive impact assessment.

#### **4. Developing Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies**

Advanced scheduling must incorporate dynamic, adaptive, and predictive mechanisms:

---

### **Strategy 1: Dynamic Dispatching Rules**
**Core Logic:** Replace static rules with dynamic logic informed by:
   - Job Priority
   - Remaining Processing Time
   - Setup requirements for subsequent jobs
   - Downstream machine queue lengths

**Implementation:**
   - Use process mining to define multi-attribute priority scores. A weighted scoring function assigns each job-mapping:
     ```
     Priority = (w1*Due Date Slack) + (w2*Setup Cost) + (w3*Downstream Queue Impact)
     ```
   - Dynamic re-evaluation with real-time machine and queue status updates.

**Expected Impact:**
   - Reduced tardiness (better prioritization).
   - Balanced WIP.

---

### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling**
**Core Logic:** Predict realistic schedules by embedding historical variability and predictive analytics:
   - Task durations are modeled using probability distributions derived from historical cases.
   - Predictive maintenance flags breakdown-risk machines for immediate scheduling adjustments.

**Implementation:**
   - Monte Carlo simulations simulate task paths. Augment with machine breakdown probabilities to warn planners of potential downstream congestion.

**Expected Impact:**
   - Enhanced adherence to due dates through delay/risk anticipation.

---

### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization**
**Core Logic:** Minimize sequence-dependent setup times via intelligent sequencing and batching algorithms.
   - Use historical heatmaps of job-pair setup times to design "optimal" processing sequences.
   - Cluster similar jobs into dynamic batches to optimize shared setups.

**Implementation:**
   - Optimize sequence transitions at bottleneck machines by solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)–type formulations.

**Expected Impact:**
   - Higher throughput via reduced transition waste.

#### **5. Simulation, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement**

Simulation ensures rigorous testing of proposed strategies under variable conditions:
- **Simulation Inputs:** Derived from process mining (e.g., distribution models, breakdown frequencies).
- **Scenarios to Test:**
  - High workload with few hot jobs.
  - Low workload but frequent breakdowns.
  - Mixed scenarios combining rush orders and bottleneck disruptions.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Tardiness distribution.
   - WIP accumulation rates.
   - Resource utilization balance.

**Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Periodically re-mining logs to detect drift in KPIs.
   - Automatic trigger for rule refinement upon detecting inefficiencies (e.g., breakdown pattern shifts).
