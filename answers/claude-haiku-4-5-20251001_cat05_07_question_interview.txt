# Clarifying Questions on Property Onboarding Process

## **Documentation & Verification Phase**

1. When a property coordinator requests missing or outdated documents from a landlord, what is the typical response time expectation, and what happens if a landlord is unresponsive or unable to provide certain documents?

2. Are there any documents that are absolute blockers (i.e., the process cannot proceed without them), versus documents that can be obtained later or waived under certain circumstances?

3. How do you handle properties in different cities or states where local housing regulations and required compliance certificates vary significantly?

4. Once documentation is verified and property details are entered into the database, is there a formal sign-off or approval step before moving to the next phase?

## **Property Manager Assignment & Matching**

5. You mentioned that assignment depends on workload, geography, property type, and landlord requirements—how are these factors weighted against each other? Is there a formal scoring system, or is it more of a judgment call?

6. What happens if no available property manager is a good fit for the property (e.g., a specialized property type that no current manager has experience with)?

7. How frequently are property managers reassigned to properties, and what triggers a reassignment?

8. Are there scenarios where a property might have multiple property managers (e.g., one for leasing and another for maintenance), or is one manager always the single point of contact?

## **Introductory Meeting & Expectation Setting**

9. What specific outcomes or agreements should result from the initial landlord-property manager meeting? Is there a documented checklist or template to ensure nothing is missed?

10. If the landlord expresses unusual requirements during this meeting (e.g., "only accept tenants from specific professions"), how does the company determine whether to accommodate them or push back?

11. How are special policies or conditions documented, and where are they stored so that all relevant team members are aware?

## **Inspection, Photography & Issue Resolution**

12. When the inspector identifies issues, who decides whether they must be fixed before listing, versus being disclosed to prospective tenants, versus being handled post-lease?

13. If repairs are needed, does the company cover the cost, or is it always the landlord's responsibility? Are there any cost-sharing arrangements?

14. How long does the repair process typically take, and what happens to the property's timeline if repairs are needed?

15. Is there a re-inspection step after repairs are completed, or is the landlord's confirmation sufficient?

## **Marketing & Activation**

16. What market trend data does the pricing team use to set the rental price, and how frequently is that data updated if a property sits unlisted for an extended period?

17. Are there scenarios where a property is ready for activation but deliberately held back from listing (e.g., awaiting a specific lease start date)?

18. Once a property is activated in the portal, can the listing be paused or removed without going through a formal deactivation process?

## **Tenant Screening & Selection**

19. What are the specific criteria or thresholds used when reviewing credit checks and employment verification? Are there hard cutoffs, or is there room for discretion?

20. How do you balance fair housing compliance with landlord preferences? For example, if a landlord expresses a preference (even an implicit one), how is that managed?

21. When multiple qualified tenants apply, what is the decision-making hierarchy—first-come-first-served, longest lease commitment, highest credit score, or something else?

22. Who has final authority over tenant selection—the property manager, the landlord, or a committee?

23. If a tenant fails screening, is there a formal appeal or reconsideration process?

## **Lease Finalization & Security Deposits**

24. Are lease agreements standardized templates, or does each one require customization? Who approves customized clauses?

25. When you mentioned compliance officers review leases for fair housing adherence, what specific violations or red flags are they checking for?

26. How are security deposits held and tracked? Is there a separate account, and what are the rules around interest accrual or deductions?

27. Is there a formal move-in walkthrough with the tenant, and how are pre-existing conditions documented?

## **Quality Checks & System Integration**

28. What is the typical turnaround time for the compliance, financial, and IT reviews at the end of onboarding? Do these happen in parallel or sequentially?

29. If the financial analyst determines the rental price doesn't meet profitability targets, what happens at that stage—can the price be renegotiated, or is the deal jeopardized?

30. How are discrepancies or errors caught during the IT integration step, and who is responsible for fixing them?

## **Timeline & Process Duration**

31. From initial landlord contact to a tenant moving in, what is the typical total duration? What are the longest and shortest timelines you've observed?

32. Are there any hard deadlines or seasonal factors that create pressure (e.g., "properties must be listed by summer" or "landlords want tenants in by a specific date")?

## **Exception Handling & Edge Cases**

33. You mentioned properties requiring special insurance—what triggers that need, and who arranges it?

34. How do you handle situations where a landlord's expectations are fundamentally misaligned with company policy or local regulations?

35. Are there properties or landlords that enter the onboarding process but ultimately don't make it to activation? What are the typical reasons, and how is that tracked?

36. If a landlord wants to withdraw during the process, is there a formal off-boarding or is it simply ceased?

## **Communication & Stakeholder Coordination**

37. You mentioned communication is tracked across email, CRMs, and project management tools—is there a primary system of record, or are all three equally important?

38. How is information shared between regional offices? Are there handoff protocols, or does each office operate independently?

39. When there's a delay in one phase (e.g., contractor repairs), how does the property manager communicate status updates to both the landlord and internal teams?

## **Post-Activation & Ongoing Management**

40. Once a tenant is moved in and the property is generating rental income, at what point does the property "exit" the onboarding process and enter steady-state property management?

These questions are designed to reveal process ambiguities, decision-making criteria, stakeholder dependencies, and exception handling that will provide a richer understanding of how the process actually works in practice.
