**Explanation:**

1. **Coexistence Constraint:** Added `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` to ensure that every time a sensitive attribute check (`CheckApplicantRace`) occurs, a subsequent bias mitigation check (`BiasMitigationCheck`) must happen before any final decision (`FinalDecision`). This constraint helps ensure fairness by preventing immediate decisions based solely on sensitive attributes.

2. **Response Constraint:** Introduced `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`. This ensures that after the sensitive attribute is checked (`CheckApplicantRace`), there must be a bias mitigation check (`BiasMitigationCheck`) before any decision can occur. This prevents immediate biased outcomes by forcing a review step to ensure fairness.

3. **Succession Constraint:** Added `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`. This constraint requires that any decision (`FinalDecision`) must follow a bias mitigation check (`BiasMitigationCheck`). This helps ensure that decisions are based on a fair review process and not solely on sensitive attributes.

4. **Non-succession Constraint:** Added `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"FinalDecision": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}`. These constraints prevent a direct succession from sensitive attribute checks to rejections, thereby reducing the risk of immediate biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.

These new constraints collectively mitigate bias by enforcing additional steps that ensure fairness and consistency throughout the loan application process, particularly in handling sensitive information.
