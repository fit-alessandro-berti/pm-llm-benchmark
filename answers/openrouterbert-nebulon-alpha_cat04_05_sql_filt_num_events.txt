Here's a well-crafted DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes the task:

```sql
-- First, identify cases with 6 or fewer events
WITH cases_with_few_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) <= 6
)

-- Then return all events from those cases
SELECT
    e.*
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    cases_with_few_events c ON e.case_id = c.case_id
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:

1. The CTE (`cases_with_few_events`) first groups the events by `case_id` and counts the number of events per case.
2. The `HAVING` clause filters to keep only cases with 6 or fewer events.
3. The main query then joins the original event log with this filtered list of cases to return all events from qualifying cases.
4. The results are ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp` for better readability (though this is optional).

### Alternative Version (using window functions):

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM (
    SELECT
        *,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count_per_case
    FROM
        event_log
) subquery
WHERE
    event_count_per_case <= 6
ORDER BY
    case_id, timestamp;
```

Both queries will return the same result, but the first version is generally more efficient for this specific task. The second version might be preferable if you need to perform additional calculations based on the event count.
