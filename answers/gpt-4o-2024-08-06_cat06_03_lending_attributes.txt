In the context of fairness, sensitive attributes are characteristics that can potentially lead to biased or unfair treatment of individuals or groups. In process mining and event logs, sensitive attributes are those that could influence decision-making-processes or outcomes in a discriminatory manner if not handled with care.

From the attributes provided in the event log, the following can be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. **case:citizen**: Whether a case involves a citizen or not could influence outcomes in a discriminatory way. It is important to ensure that being a citizen or not does not lead to biased decisions.

2. **case:gender**: This attribute indicates gender, which is a well-known sensitive attribute. Processes should ensure that decisions are not biased by gender.

3. **case:german speaking**: The ability of an individual to speak German could potentially influence the outcome of a process in settings where language plays a significant role. It's important to monitor this attribute to ensure it doesn't lead to unfair treatment.

Other attributes, such as the resources involved or timestamps, are typically not considered sensitive in the context of fairness, as they are generally operational or process-related characteristics rather than personal, demographic, or socio-economic characteristics. However, careful monitoring of process efficiency and resource allocation can help ensure fairness in terms of service delivery and operation.
