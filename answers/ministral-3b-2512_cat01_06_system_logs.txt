### **Process Mining Event Log Transformation**

Below is the transformed event log, structured for analysis in standard process mining tools (e.g., Disco, Celonis, or ProM). Each case represents a coherent work session, and activities are standardized for clarity.

### **Key Transformation Logic**

#### **1. Case Identification**
- **Case_001**: Focused on drafting the **Quarterly Report** while handling an **email response** and reviewing the PDF draft.
- **Case_002**: Dedicated to **updating the Budget** in Excel and integrating it into the report.
- **Case_003**: Finalized the **Executive Summary** after closing the previous document.

**Rationale**:
- Events were grouped by **application focus** and **logical workflow** (e.g., typing in Word  switching to email  returning to Word).
- The **SWITCH** events were treated as transitions between tasks rather than separate cases.

#### **2. Activity Naming**
- **Raw Actions  Process Steps**:
  - `FOCUS`  `Start Activity` (e.g., "Drafting Quarterly Report").
  - `TYPING`  `Typing [Content]` (e.g., "Typing Report Introduction").
  - `SAVE`  `Save Draft` (e.g., "Save Report Draft").
  - `SWITCH`  `Switch to [Task]` (e.g., "Switch to Email (Annual Meeting)").
  - `CLICK`  `Action` (e.g., "Reply to Email").
  - `CLOSE`  `Finalize Activity` (e.g., "Finalize Executive Summary").

**Justification**:
- Standardized activities improve readability and enable **discovery-based analysis** (e.g., identifying deviations from expected workflows).

#### **3. Event Attributes**
- **Case ID**: Auto-generated (e.g., `Case_001`).
- **Activity Name**: Descriptive and process-aware.
- **Timestamp**: Preserved for temporal analysis.
- **Activity Duration**: Calculated from start to end of an activity.

#### **4. Coherent Narrative**
The log tells a **multi-step workflow**:
1. **Drafting the report** (with interruptions for email).
2. **Updating the budget** (with integration into the report).
3. **Finalizing the executive summary**.

This structure allows for **process mining techniques** like:
- **Process Discovery** (e.g., finding the most common path).
- **Conformance Checking** (e.g., comparing against a reference model).
- **Anomaly Detection** (e.g., identifying unusual email interruptions).

### **Additional Notes**
- **Derived Attributes**: Duration and case description enhance interpretability.
- **Flexibility**: If more granularity is needed, sub-activities (e.g., "Typing Introduction"  "Typing Details") can be added.
- **Validation**: The log aligns with **XES (XML Event Stream)** standards for interoperability with most PM tools.
