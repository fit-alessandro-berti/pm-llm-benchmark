This image displays a process model diagram, likely an Event-driven Process Chain (EPC), which illustrates the workflow for handling a request. The diagram consists of two main parts: the process flow itself and a legend that explains the notation used for control flow.

### Process Flow Diagram

The main part of the image is a directed graph that models a business process. The components are:
*   **Events/Functions (Tasks):** Rounded rectangles represent the activities or states in the process. These are labeled with letters (a-h, z) and descriptive text (e.g., "register request").
*   **Control Flow Connectors:** Small black circles represent logical operators (AND, OR, XOR) that manage the flow of the process at points where paths split (diverge) or join (converge).
*   **Arcs:** Arrows indicate the direction of the process flow from one element to the next.

The process can be described as follows:

1.  The process starts with task **a: register request**.
2.  Following this, an **OR-split** occurs. This means one or more of the subsequent paths can be activated:
    *   Path 1 leads to task **b: examine thoroughly**.
    *   Path 2 leads to task **c: examine casually**.
    *   Path 3 leads to a connector that initiates tasks **d: check ticket** and **f: reinitiate request**. The split leading to 'd' and 'f' is an **AND-split**, meaning both tasks are performed in parallel.
3.  Task **f: reinitiate request** creates a loop, feeding back to the OR-split after the initial "register request" task.
4.  The paths from tasks **b**, **c**, and **d** all converge at an **OR-join** before task **e: decide**. This means the process waits for all active examination branches to complete before making a decision.
5.  At task **e: decide**, an **XOR-split** occurs, representing a choice between three exclusive outcomes:
    *   Path 1 leads to task **g: pay compensation**.
    *   Path 2 leads to task **h: reject request**.
    *   Path 3 creates another loop, directing the flow back to the path that triggers "check ticket" and "reinitiate request" for further processing.
6.  The paths from "pay compensation" (g) and "reject request" (h) merge at an **XOR-join**. This means the process continues as soon as either of these tasks is completed.
7.  The process concludes at the final state **z: end**.

### Legend

In the bottom right corner, a grey box serves as a legend, defining the different types of connectors used in the diagram:

*   **Splits (Diverging Paths):**
    *   **XOR-split:** An exclusive choice where only one of the subsequent paths is taken.
    *   **AND-split:** A parallel fork where all subsequent paths are activated concurrently.
    *   **OR-split:** An inclusive choice where one or more of the subsequent paths can be taken. This is visually distinguished by an arc over the outgoing connectors.

*   **Joins (Converging Paths):**
    *   **XOR-join:** The process continues as soon as any one of the incoming paths arrives.
    *   **AND-join:** The process waits for all incoming paths to complete before continuing (synchronization).
    *   **OR-join:** A more complex join that typically waits for all currently active incoming branches to finish. It is visually marked with an arc over the incoming connectors.

Notably, in this notation, XOR and AND connectors for both splits and joins are visually identical (a single black dot), so their interpretation depends on the logical context of the process. The OR connectors are uniquely identified by the arc symbol.
