This image displays a business process model, likely depicted using a notation similar to Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). The visualization consists of two main parts: a primary workflow diagram and a legend explaining the symbols for control flow.

### Main Workflow Diagram

The main diagram illustrates the steps involved in handling a request. It uses rounded rectangles to represent tasks or activities and arrows to show the sequence of these tasks.

The process flow can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Start:** The process begins with task **'a' (register request)**.
2.  **Examination Phase:** After registration, an **OR-split** occurs. This means one or more of the subsequent examination tasks can be initiated. The options are:
    *   **'b' (examine thoroughly)**
    *   **'c' (examine casually)**
    *   **'d' (check ticket)**
    There is also a potential loop between tasks 'c' and 'd', suggesting they might be performed iteratively or in conjunction.
3.  **Decision Point:** All active examination paths converge at an **OR-join** before leading to task **'e' (decide)**. This means the process waits for all initiated examination tasks to complete before a decision is made.
4.  **Outcome:** After the decision in 'e', an **XOR-split** (an exclusive choice) determines the next step:
    *   The request is approved, leading to task **'g' (pay compensation)**.
    *   The request is denied, leading to task **'h' (reject request)**.
    *   The process can loop back via task **'f' (reinitiate request)**, which can lead back to the start of the process (before 'a') or to the "check ticket" step ('d').
5.  **End:** Both the "pay compensation" and "reject request" paths lead to an **XOR-join** before the final step, **'z' (end)**, which concludes the process.

### Legend (Gray Box)

The gray box at the bottom right serves as a key to understand the logic of the branching (split) and merging (join) points in the diagram.

*   **Top Row (Splits):**
    *   **XOR-split:** An exclusive choice. The process follows exactly one of the outgoing paths.
    *   **AND-split:** A parallel split. The process follows all outgoing paths concurrently.
    *   **OR-split:** An inclusive choice. The process follows one or more of the outgoing paths.

*   **Bottom Row (Joins):**
    *   **XOR-join:** A simple merge. The process continues once any one of the incoming paths completes.
    *   **AND-join:** A synchronization point. The process waits for all incoming paths to complete before continuing.
    *   **OR-join:** A synchronizing merge. The process waits for all *active* incoming paths to complete.

In summary, the visualization provides a detailed and formal representation of a business workflow for processing a request, clearly defining the sequence of activities, decision points, parallel tasks, and potential loops using a specific modeling notation.
