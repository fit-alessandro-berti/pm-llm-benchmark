The **event log for Group B (Unprotected Group)** exhibits **systematic bias** in the decision-making process, primarily due to the influence of the **CommunityGroup** attribute, which leads to **favorable ScoreAdjustments** for applicants who are part of certain community groups (e.g., the "Highland Civic Darts Club"). This results in **systematic differences in final decisions** compared to applicants from Group A (Protected Group), who do not receive such adjustments.

---

### **Key Evidence of Bias in Group B:**

#### 1. **ScoreAdjustment Based on CommunityGroup**
- **Group B** applicants who belong to the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive a **+10 point adjustment** to their PreliminaryScore during the **PreliminaryScoring**, **ManualReview**, and **FinalDecision** stages.
  - For **U001**, the PreliminaryScore is **720**, but the adjusted score becomes **730**.
  - For **U003**, the PreliminaryScore is **695**, which is adjusted to **705**.
- In contrast, applicants in Group B who are **not part of any community group (e.g., U002)** do **not** receive any ScoreAdjustment.
- **Group A** (Protected Group) never receives any ScoreAdjustment, regardless of their CommunityGroup or LocalResident status.

#### 2. **Systematic Differences in Outcomes**
- **Group B applicants from the Highland Civic Darts Club** are **approved**, even when their adjusted score is **below the score of some rejected applicants from Group A**:
  - **U003** is approved with an adjusted score of **705**, whereas **P002** (Group A) is rejected with a score of **710**.
- This suggests that **belonging to the Highland Civic Darts Club** provides an **unjustified advantage** in the decision-making process.

#### 3. **LocalResident Attribute Correlated with CommunityGroup**
- All applicants in **Group B** are **LocalResidents = TRUE**, and some of them are associated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club**.
- While being a **LocalResident** alone does not appear to directly influence decisions, its **correlation with CommunityGroup membership** means that the bias indirectly affects a protected attribute (residency status), potentially violating fairness principles.

### **Impact of Bias on Final Decisions**

| CaseID | Group | PreliminaryScore | ScoreAdjustment | FinalScore | Decision   | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------|------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| P002   | A     | 710              | 0                | 710        | Rejected   | No adjustment |
| U003   | B     | 695              | +10              | 705        | Approved   | Approved despite lower score due to adjustment |
| P001   | A     | 720              | 0                | 720        | Approved   | Approved |
| U001   | B     | 720              | +10              | 730        | Approved   | Approved with boost |
| P003   | A     | 740              | 0                | 740        | Approved   | Highest score, approved |

- The **adjustment of scores based on CommunityGroup** results in **different treatment of otherwise similarly qualified applicants**, depending on their group affiliation.
- This is a **clear case of disparate treatment**, where individuals are treated differently based on group membership rather than objective merit.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Group B exhibits bias** because applicants affiliated with the **Highland Civic Darts Club** receive **favorable ScoreAdjustments**, which influence the **FinalDecision**.
- This leads to **systematic differences** where **less qualified applicants from Group B are approved**, while **more qualified applicants from Group A are rejected**.
- The **bias is unjustified**, **systematic**, and potentially **discriminatory**, especially if the Highland Civic Darts Club is disproportionately composed of individuals with certain socioeconomic or demographic characteristics.

### **Recommendations to Mitigate Bias**

1. **Standardize the scoring process** to ensure that no applicant receives arbitrary score boosts based on group affiliation.
2. **Audit and log all ScoreAdjustments** with explicit, justifiable reasons, and ensure they are **applied equitably** across all groups.
3. **Separate the influence of CommunityGroup from decision-making**, unless there is a legally justified and transparent rationale.
4. **Monitor for disparate impact** across groups (Protected vs. Unprotected) and adjust policies accordingly.

By addressing these issues, the decision-making process can be made **fairer, more transparent, and equitable** for all applicants.
