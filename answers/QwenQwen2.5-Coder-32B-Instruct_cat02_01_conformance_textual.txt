**Analysis of Event Log Against Normative Process:**

To determine deviations from the normative process in the provided event log, we will compare each case's activity sequence against the expected ideal flows. The two possible sequences are:

1. **Sufficient Inventory Flow:**
   - Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order

2. **Insufficient Inventory Flow:**
   - Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order

Let’s evaluate each case against these sequences:

### Case 1:
**Activities:**
- Receive order (2023-10-05 09:00)
- Check inventory (2023-10-05 10:00)
- Authorize payment (2023-10-05 11:00)
- Package items (2023-10-05 12:00)
- Ship order (2023-10-05 13:00)
- Close order (2023-10-05 14:00)

**Analysis:**
- This case perfectly follows the sufficient inventory flow.
- All activities occur in the correct order, and no deviations exist.

### Case 2:
**Activities:**
- Receive order (2023-10-06 09:00)
- Check inventory (2023-10-06 09:30)
- Package items (2023-10-06 10:00)
- Authorize payment (2023-10-06 10:30)
- Ship order (2023-10-06 11:00)
- Close order (2023-10-06 11:30)

**Analysis:**
- This case contains multiple violations.
- **Violation 1:** "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment." According to the process, "Package items" should only happen after "Authorize payment."
- **Violation 2:** "Authorize payment" occurs before "Package items," but due to the previously mentioned violation, this is also out of the expected sequence.

### Case 3:
**Activities:**
- Receive order (2023-10-07 09:00)
- Check inventory (2023-10-07 09:20)
- Authorize payment (2023-10-07 09:40)
- Cancel order (2023-10-07 10:00)
- Ship order (2023-10-07 10:30)
- Close order (2023-10-07 11:00)

**Analysis:**
- This case also contains violations.
- **Violation 1:** "Authorize payment" occurs before "Cancel order," which contradicts both expected flows. Payments should never be authorized when insufficient inventory prompts a cancellation.
- **Violation 2:** "Ship order" follows "Cancel order," which is strictly prohibited under any scenario, as shipping should never occur after an order has been canceled.
- **Violation 3:** The logical sequence is disrupted throughout, particularly the payment and shipping activities occurring after the cancellation rather than concluding with order closure.

### Case 4:
**Activities:**
- Receive order (2023-10-08 09:00)
- Check inventory (2023-10-08 09:10)
- Cancel order (2023-10-08 09:20)
- Close order (2023-10-08 09:50)

**Analysis:**
- This case adheres to the intended flow for insufficient inventory.
- All activities occur in the correct order.

### Case 5:
**Activities:**
- Receive order (2023-10-09 09:00)
- Check inventory (2023-10-09 10:00)
- Authorize payment (2023-10-09 10:30)
- Ship order (2023-10-09 11:00)
- Close order (2023-10-09 11:30)

**Analysis:**
- This case contains violations.
- **Violation 1:** "Ship order" occurs before "Package items," which violates the process rules. The items must be packaged before they can be shipped.
- **Violation 2:** "Package items" is missing from the sequence, which is essential when the inventory is sufficient.

### Conclusion:
In summary, **Cases 2, 3, and 5** violate the normative process as described. The specific violations in each case are:

- **Case 2:** "Package items" before "Authorize payment."
- **Case 3:** "Authorize payment" and "Ship order" after "Cancel order."
- **Case 5:** "Ship order" before "Package items," as well as "Package items" missing.

These deviations conflict with the expected sequence rules and constraints outlined in the normative process description.
