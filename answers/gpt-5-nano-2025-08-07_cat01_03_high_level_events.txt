Here is a concise, structured way toGroup the low-level, granular events into meaningful high-level process steps, with rationale and example mappings for the sample cases.

1) Proposed High-Level Activities (names, purpose, and what they include)

- 1) Material Handling & Preparation
  - Purpose: Acquire and stage the raw material, verify identity, and set up the workpiece for processing. This includes initial checks, part identification, and pre-processing setup.
  - Typical included low-level events:
    - Retrieve raw sheet
    - Scan barcode
    - Place sheet on table
    - Align sheet
    - Preheat sheet
  - Common resources: Operators (A, C), Robot Arm/Equipment used for alignment, Heating units.

- 2) Welding & Assembly
  - Purpose: Perform the joining/assembly operations to form the core structure.
  - Typical included low-level events:
    - Pick up welding tool
    - Weld corner A
    - Weld corner B
  - Common resources: Operator (B), Welding tool, related tooling.

- 3) Weld Quality Assessment
  - Purpose: Immediately verify the integrity of the welds after joining.
  - Typical included low-level events:
    - Measure weld integrity (or similar quality check)
  - Common resources: Quality Sensor

- 4) Surface Treatment
  - Purpose: Apply and cure surface coatings to finished parts.
  - Typical included low-level events:
    - Apply protective coating
    - Dry coating
  - Common resources: Coating Unit, Heating/Drying units

- 5) Final Quality Check
  - Purpose: Final pass/fail inspection to confirm product readiness.
  - Typical included low-level events:
    - Visual check
  - Common resources: Operator (C)

2) Rationale for the groupings

- Temporal proximity and logical flow
  - The sequence follows a natural manufacturing flow: material is handled and prepared first, then welding/assembly, followed by weld quality checks, then surface treatment, and finally a final visual QA. Grouping events by contiguous time windows that represent a single phase aligns with the process lifecycle.
- Resource/type consistency
  - Each high-level step is driven by distinct activity clusters (e.g., initial handling by Operators and Robotic alignment tools; welding by Operator B; QA by Quality Sensor; coating by Coating Unit). Grouping by these clusters yields coherent stages rather than ad-hoc mixes of actions.
- Purpose-driven aggregation
  - Material Handling & Preparation covers part identity checks and setup (barcode, placement, alignment, preheat) before any joining occurs.
  - Welding & Assembly collects all tool-use and joining steps that create the core bond.
  - Weld Quality Assessment isolates measurements that verify weld integrity, separating it from the subsequent coating steps.
  - Surface Treatment captures coating work and drying, which are technically distinct from mechanical joining or QA.
  - Final Quality Check represents the last acceptance step, independent from the manufacturing steps.

3) Names for the high-level activities (domain-relevant)

- Material Handling & Preparation
- Welding & Assembly
- Weld Quality Assessment
- Surface Treatment
- Final Quality Check

5) Optional: Simple rules to apply this approach to other logs

- Rule 1: Look for a natural pre-welding sequence (retrieve, barcode/ID check, place, align, preheat). Cluster these into Material Handling & Preparation.
- Rule 2: Consecutive tool-use or action cluster that performs joining/assembly goes into Welding & Assembly.
- Rule 3: Any measurement or test immediately following assembly belongs to Weld Quality Assessment.
- Rule 4: Any subsequent coating or curing steps form Surface Treatment, unless followed by a QA step (then QA is Final Quality Check).
- Rule 5: The last independent QA action (often a visual check) is Final Quality Check, representing acceptance readiness.

Summary
- The proposed high-level steps capture the natural phases of the given manufacturing process: material handling, joining, quality verification, surface treatment, and final inspection.
- The grouping rationale relies on the logical progression of the workflow, temporally close actions, and distinct resource roles for each phase.
- The names are domain-relevant and transferable to other, similar manufacturing logs.
- The example mappings for A1 and B2 illustrate how raw events collapse into a concise, plottable sequence of stages, simplifying process understanding and analytics.
