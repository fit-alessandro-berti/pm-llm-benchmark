The process involves creating a fine, sending it to the offender, and then potentially adding a penalty or allowing the offender to pay the fine. If the offender appeals the fine, the process includes sending the appeal to the prefecture, receiving a result from the prefecture, and notifying the offender of the result. If the offender disagrees with the result of the appeal, they may choose to appeal to a judge.
