Here are 20 relevant questions about the process with confidence scores reflecting how directly answerable they are based on the provided process flow and descriptive data:

**Confidence Score Guide:**
- **High (8-10)**: Directly answerable from the provided flows.
- **Medium (4-7)**: Inferred or partially answerable from the flows.
- **Low (1-3)**: Not directly answerable, requires additional context or assumptions.

### Questions and Confidence Scores

1. **What is the starting point of every declaration process?**
	* Confidence: **9** (Directly observable)
2. How many distinct outcomes can occur when an employee submits a declaration?
	* Confidence: **8** (Inferable from multiple paths)
3. What is the most frequent outcome after an employee submission?
	* Confidence: **10** (Directly observable: Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE)
4. Can a declaration be approved without being reviewed by a budget owner?
	* Confidence: **6** (Some paths suggest yes, but not all are clear)
5. What is the average performance impact of a declaration being rejected by the administration?
	* Confidence: **3** (Performance data provided, but "average" requires calculation and context)
6. How many steps are in the longest declaration approval process?
	* Confidence: **9** (Directly observable from the flows)
7. Can an employee resubmit a declaration after it's been rejected by a supervisor?
	* Confidence: **8** (Inferable from recursive submission patterns)
8. What is the role of "PRE_APPROVER" in the declaration process?
	* Confidence: **5** (Role exists, but specific responsibilities aren't detailed)
9. Is there a time limit for an employee to resubmit a rejected declaration?
	* Confidence: **1** (Not mentioned in provided flows)
10. Can a declaration be approved without going through "ADMINISTRATION" approval first?
	* Confidence: **4** (Some paths start with PRE_APPROVER, but initial step is always EMPLOYEE submission)
11. How does the performance metric change when a declaration is finally approved by a supervisor?
	* Confidence: **7** (Performance data is provided, but specific changes need calculation)
12. What triggers the "Request Payment" step in the process?
	* Confidence: **9** (Directly observable from successful approval paths)
13. Are there any declarations that skip the "SUPERVISOR" review entirely?
	* Confidence: **6** (Most paths include SUPERVISOR, but flow details for all paths are not exhaustive)
14. Can a declaration be rejected by both ADMINISTRATION and BUDGET OWNER in the same process instance?
	* Confidence: **8** (Inferable from multiple rejection outcomes, though not explicitly one after the other)
15. How many different types of approvers/reviewers are involved in the declaration process?
	* Confidence: **9** (Directly observable: EMPLOYEE, ADMINISTRATION, PRE_APPROVER, BUDGET OWNER, SUPERVISOR)
16. What is the significance of "Payment Handled" in the context of declaration approval?
	* Confidence: **5** (Implies financial transaction but specifics like who handles it are unclear)
17. Are there any automatic approval or rejection steps based on declaration content?
	* Confidence: **2** (Not explicitly mentioned, seems to rely on manual reviews)
18. Can an employee submit a declaration without going through the standard submission process?
	* Confidence: **1** (No information suggests alternative submission methods)
19. How is the "performance" of a declaration process measured or calculated?
	* Confidence: **3** (Performance values are provided but methodology is not explained)
20. Are there seasonal or periodic variations in declaration submission and approval rates?
	* Confidence: **1** (Not mentioned or inferable from provided data)
