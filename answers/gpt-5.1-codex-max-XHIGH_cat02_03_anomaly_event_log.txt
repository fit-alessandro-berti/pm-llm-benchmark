In a textbook procuretopay cycle you would normally expect to see a requisition created and approved before any commitment is made to a supplier, a purchase order issued on the back of that approval, goods received against the order, an invoice received from the vendor, a threeway match between PO/receipt/invoice, and only then the release of funds.

Against that backdrop the following patterns stand out in your log:

- Case1001 follows that sequence and can be taken as a reference.

- In case1002 the controls are essentially inverted: the PO is issued before the requisition is approved, the requisition is approved only after the vendor has invoiced and been paid, and payment is released before any goods have been received and before the invoice has been matched to the PO. That undermines approval and matching controls and creates a risk of paying for unapproved or undelivered goods.

- In case1003 payment is released on 8Feb, well before any vendor invoice is recorded (9Feb) or goods are received (10Feb), and before any invoice/PO matching. Unless this was a deliberate advance payment, paying before receiving an invoice or confirming delivery bypasses standard threeway match controls.

- In case1004 the goods are receipted on 6Feb at 09:00, and the PO is only issued at 09:15. Receiving goods without a prior purchase order is atypical and suggests afterthefact ordering or “maverick” purchasing, which weakens commitments and budgetary control.

In each of these cases the outofsequence activities would normally be flagged, because they increase the chance of errors, fraud, or noncompliance with established P2P controls.
