Process cubes are a crucial component in multi-dimensional process mining, offering a novel approach to analyze and visualize business processes. Unlike traditional process mining approaches, process cubes enable the examination of multiple dimensions of process data simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying processes.

**Traditional Process Mining Approaches:**

Traditional process mining techniques focus on analyzing process data from a single perspective, typically using one of the following approaches:

1. **Process discovery**: Automatically constructs a process model from event logs, revealing the underlying process structure.
2. **Conformance checking**: Verifies whether the actual process behavior conforms to a pre-defined process model.
3. **Performance analysis**: Analyzes the performance of a process, focusing on metrics such as throughput time, waiting time, and service level agreements (SLAs).

These traditional approaches often rely on 2D representations of process data, such as process maps or Gantt charts. However, modern organizations often generate vast amounts of data from various sources, making it challenging to analyze and understand process behavior from a single perspective.

**Process Cubes:**

Process cubes are a multi-dimensional data structure that allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple dimensions of process data. A process cube consists of a set of dimensions, hierarchies, and measures. Dimensions represent different aspects of the process, such as:

* Time (e.g., date, hour, minute)
* Resource (e.g., organization, department, team)
* Process instance (e.g., case ID, order ID)
* Activity (e.g., task, action)

Hierarchies define the relationships between the different levels of granularity within each dimension. Measures represent the quantitative data associated with each cell in the process cube, such as counts, durations, or costs.

**Key Features of Process Cubes:**

1. **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Enables the simultaneous examination of multiple dimensions of process data.
2. **Drill-down capabilities**: Allows for the detailed analysis of specific process aspects by drilling down into lower levels of granularity.
3. **Aggregation and filtering**: Enables the aggregation of data across different dimensions and the filtering of data based on specific criteria.
4. **Visualization**: Supports various visualization techniques, such as OLAP (online analytical processing) cubes, to represent the process data in an intuitive and interactive manner.

**Differences from Traditional Process Mining Approaches:**

1. **Multi-dimensionality**: Process cubes enable the analysis of multiple dimensions of process data, whereas traditional approaches typically focus on a single perspective.
2. **Scalability**: Process cubes
