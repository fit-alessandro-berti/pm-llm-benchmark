Below is an example of how you could group the given low-level events into higher-level process steps, along with the rationale for each grouping and proposed names.

---

### Proposed High-Level Steps and Groupings

1. **Material Preparation**  
   **Included Low-Level Events (for each case):**  
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet (e.g., "Retrieve raw metal sheet")  
   - Scan barcode (e.g., "Scan barcode")  
   - Place metal sheet on table (e.g., "Place metal sheet on table")  
   - Align metal sheet (e.g., "Align metal sheet")  
   - Preheat metal sheet (e.g., "Preheat metal sheet")

   **Justification:**  
   All these events deal with preparing the raw material before any assembly work is done. They are executed in sequence at the start of the process and are logically related to making the material ready for the next stage. The tasks move from raw material handling to getting the piece properly aligned and heated, which is essential groundwork for welding.

   **Rationale:**  
   - **Temporal Proximity:** These events occur one after the other at the start of the case.  
   - **Functional Similarity:** Each step involves preparing the component before actual assembly (welding) begins.  
   - **Resource Type & Logic:** Activities like retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating are all about getting the material into a correct state and position.

   **Proposed Name:** **"Material Preparation"**

2. **Welding Operations**  
   **Included Low-Level Events (for each case):**  
   - Pick up welding tool (e.g., "Pick up welding tool")  
   - Weld corner A (e.g., "Weld corner A")  
   - Weld corner B (e.g., "Weld corner B")

   **Justification:**  
   These events mark a clear transition into the core assembly operation. Once the material is ready, the operator or machine proceeds to weld the piece into its desired form. The use of a welding tool and the sequential weld steps are a logical and cohesive set of actions that produce a core structural change to the item.

   **Rationale:**  
   - **Temporal Proximity & Process Phase:** Occurs after material preparation and before any quality checks or finishing steps.  
   - **Functional Similarity:** All activities involve the welding operation, transforming the raw prepared material into a partially assembled component.  
   - **Resource-Based Grouping:** These steps are predominantly performed by the operator responsible for welding and utilize the welding tool.

   **Proposed Name:** **"Welding Operations"**

3. **Initial Quality Verification**  
   **Included Low-Level Event (for each case):**  
   - Measure weld integrity (e.g., "Measure weld integrity")

   **Justification:**  
   After the welding operations, a quick check of the weld quality ensures the product meets basic structural standards. This step stands apart from material preparation and welding, serving as the first point of quality assurance before additional finishing.

   **Rationale:**  
   - **Logical Breakpoint:** Following the welding, a quality sensor checks the weld.  
   - **Distinct Activity Purpose:** This is a measurement/inspection activity, distinct from either preparation or assembly.

   **Proposed Name:** **"Initial Quality Verification"**

---

4. **Coating & Finishing**  
   **Included Low-Level Events (for each case):**  
   - Apply protective coating (e.g., "Apply protective coating")  
   - Dry coating (e.g., "Dry coating")

   **Justification:**  
   Once the structural integrity is confirmed, the piece undergoes a protective finishing process. Applying and drying the coating ensures the product meets durability and corrosion-resistance standards. These steps naturally group together as part of a finishing operation prior to final checks.

   **Rationale:**  
   - **Functional Similarity:** Both activities relate to surface treatment and finishing.  
   - **Process Phase:** Occur after verification of weld quality and before the final inspection.

   **Proposed Name:** **"Coating & Finishing"**

---

5. **Final Inspection**  
   **Included Low-Level Event (for each case):**  
   - Visual check (e.g., "Visual check")

   **Justification:**  
   The last step before the product leaves this part of the production line is a final visual inspection. This ensures that all prior steps (preparation, assembly, quality checks, finishing) have been completed successfully and that the final product meets the required standards.

   **Rationale:**  
   - **Logical End-Point:** Comes at the very end of the manufacturing process flow, confirming the item is ready for the next phase (packaging, shipping, or further assembly).  
   - **Distinct Activity Purpose:** A human or machine-based final verification that the product meets specifications.

   **Proposed Name:** **"Final Inspection"**

**In essence, the grouping is based on logical process phases and a natural workflow progression: preparation → assembly → verification → finishing → final inspection. This makes it easier to interpret the lengthy, granular event log as a structured and meaningful process.**
