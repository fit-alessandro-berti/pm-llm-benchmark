### Analysis of the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process
A normative Hire-to-Retire process typically follows this logical sequence:

1. **Post_Job_Ad** – Initiate the recruitment.
2. **Screen_Candidates** – Review applications (usually after posting).
3. **Conduct_Interviews** – Interview selected candidates (usually after screening).
4. **Make_Hiring_Decision** – Decide whether to hire (after interviews).
5. If hired:
   - **Onboard_Employee** – Integrate the new employee.
   - **Add_to_Payroll** – Register in payroll system.
6. **Close_Case** – Finalize the recruitment case (whether successful or not).

Key logical constraints in a normative model:
- Screening and interviews should follow job posting.
- Interviews should follow (or at least not precede) screening.
- Hiring decision should follow interviews.
- Onboarding and payroll addition only make sense after a positive hiring decision.
- Closing the case is the final step.
- The process supports rejection at various points (e.g., no suitable candidates after screening or interviews), but onboarding/payroll should not occur without hiring.

### Anomalies in Model 1
Model 1 is a **StrictPartialOrder** with the following explicit edges:
- Post → Screen
- Screen → Decide
- Screen → Interview
- Decide → Onboard
- Onboard → Payroll
- Payroll → Close

Since it is a strict partial order over all activities with only these edges defined, the remaining relations are unconstrained (activities can occur in parallel or in any order if no path exists).

**Identified anomalies**:

1. **No ordering between Interview and Decide**  
   There is no path from Interview to Decide (or vice versa). This allows **Conduct_Interviews** to happen **after** **Make_Hiring_Decision**, which is illogical — you cannot reasonably decide to hire before interviewing candidates.

2. **Interview can be skipped entirely**  
   There is no incoming edge to Interview except from Screen, but since Decide only requires Screen, the process can proceed Post → Screen → Decide → Onboard → Payroll → Close **without ever executing Conduct_Interviews**. Skipping interviews entirely while still onboarding and adding to payroll is a severe anomaly.

3. **Decide directly after Screen, enabling onboarding without interviews**  
   The path Screen → Decide → Onboard allows hiring and onboarding based only on screening, bypassing interviews completely.

4. **No constraint forcing Interview before Onboard/Payroll**  
   Due to missing edges, Interview could theoretically occur concurrently with or even after onboarding/payroll (though less likely in practice).

**Severity**: These are **severe anomalies**. The model fundamentally violates core process logic by allowing hiring, onboarding, and payroll addition without interviews and even with the decision preceding interviews.

### Anomalies in Model 2
Model 2 is a **StrictPartialOrder** containing:
- Activities: Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, Close
- Constructs: 
  - `loop_onboarding` = LOOP(Onboard, skip) → allows zero or more executions of Onboard
  - `xor_payroll` = XOR(Payroll, skip) → allows executing Payroll or skipping it

Explicit ordering edges:
- Post → Screen
- Post → Interview
- Interview → Decide
- Decide → loop_onboarding
- loop_onboarding → xor_payroll
- xor_payroll → Close

**Identified anomalies**:

1. **Screen and Interview are in parallel after Post**  
   Both Screen and Interview directly follow Post with no ordering between them. This allows **Conduct_Interviews** before **Screen_Candidates** (interviewing candidates before screening applications), which deviates from best practice. In a normative model, screening should precede interviews.

2. **Onboarding can be repeated (loop)**  
   The LOOP allows Onboard to be executed multiple times (or zero times). Repeating onboarding is unusual, though skipping it (zero times) could model rejection.

3. **Payroll can be skipped entirely**  
   The XOR allows bypassing Add_to_Payroll even after onboarding has occurred. While rare edge cases might exist (e.g., contractors), in a standard Hire-to-**Retire** process, adding to payroll is typically mandatory after successful onboarding of an employee.

**Severity**: These are **moderate to mild anomalies**.  
- Parallel screening/interviewing is a deviation from ideal sequential practice but does not break core logic — interviews still precede the decision.  
- Optional/repeatable onboarding and optional payroll represent flexibility that might occur in real variants (e.g., rejections, repeated onboarding steps, or non-payroll hires), but they are not strictly normative.

Importantly, Model 2 enforces the critical sequence:  
Post → (Screen ‖ Interview) → Interview → Decide → (Onboard)* → (Payroll)? → Close  
This ensures that **Make_Hiring_Decision** only happens after interviews, and onboarding/payroll only after a decision.

### Conclusion: Which Model Aligns More Closely with a Normative Hire-to-Retire Process?

**Model 2 more closely aligns with a normative version of the Hire-to-Retire process.**

**Justification**:

- Model 1 contains **fundamental violations** of process integrity: it permits hiring decisions before interviews, complete skipping of interviews while still proceeding to onboarding and payroll, and even interviews after the hiring decision. These anomalies undermine the essence of a structured recruitment and hiring process.

- Model 2 maintains the **essential causal dependencies**: interviews precede the hiring decision, and onboarding/payroll only occur after the decision. Its anomalies (parallel screening/interview, optional/repeatable onboarding, optional payroll) are deviations from strict best practice but do not allow logically impossible or severely incorrect executions.

Therefore, despite its imperfections, Model 2 preserves the core logic and correctness of the Hire-to-Retire process far better than Model 1.
