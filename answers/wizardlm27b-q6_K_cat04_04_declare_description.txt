Based on the constraints provided in your DECLARE declarative process model, we can describe the underlying process as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The process starts with the activity "Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE." This means that every trace of the process must begin with this activity occurring exactly once.

2. **Existence Constraints**: Each of the following activities—'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', 'Request Payment', and 'Payment Handled'—must occur at least once in any execution of the process. This ensures that all these activities exist in at least one trace.

3. **Responsiveness**: The 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' must eventually follow the 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'. Similarly, both 'Request Payment' and 'Payment Handled' must eventually occur after 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'. This indicates a sequence of events where the employee submits a declaration, which is then approved by a supervisor, leading to requests for payment and their subsequent handling.

4. **Co-Existence**: All activities ('Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE', 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled', and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR') can occur concurrently or in any order after the initial submission of the declaration. However, once an activity has occurred, it cannot occur again (as indicated by the absence constraints).

5. **Responsiveness with Precedence and Exclusivity**: The 'Request Payment' must occur after both 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' and 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR', and it cannot happen before or simultaneously with the declaration submission. Similarly, 'Payment Handled' must come after 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' and cannot precede or occur at the same time as the supervisor's approval.

6. **Response and Succession Patterns**: The response pattern indicates that once 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, it must be followed by either 'Request Payment' or 'Payment Handled'. Similarly, after 'Request Payment', 'Payment Handled' must occur next. This suggests a direct and immediate response to the approval of the declaration and the request for payment being handled.

7. **Chain Response and Succession**: The chain response indicates that once 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, it must be immediately followed by 'Request Payment', which in turn must be followed by 'Payment Handled'. This is a strict sequence without any intervening activities.

8. **Succession**: The 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' can lead to either 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' or 'Request Payment', indicating alternative paths after the initial declaration submission. Once 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' occurs, it can lead to either 'Request Payment' or 'Payment Handled', but not both in a trace (due to the absence of repeated activities).

9. **Absence Constraints**: Certain activities ('Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER', 'Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION', etc.) are explicitly stated as absent, meaning they cannot occur within any trace of the process.

In summary, the process begins with an employee submitting a declaration. This submission must be approved by a supervisor before any payments can be requested or handled. Once the declaration is approved, there is a strict chain where the approval leads to a payment request, and that request leads to the handling of payment. All these activities occur once and only once in each trace, following the specified constraints. There are no alternative branches for rejection or further approvals; the process is linear with a clear beginning and end sequence after the initial submission.
