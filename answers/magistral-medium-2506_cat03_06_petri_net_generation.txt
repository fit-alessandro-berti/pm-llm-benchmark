Below is the Python code to construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process described. The net includes places representing states between activities, transitions representing activities, and arcs connecting them. Loops are included for the re-submission of documents and in-depth fraud investigations. The initial marking starts with a token in the "Claim Received" place, and the final marking represents a closed claim.

```python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet("Insurance Claim Process")

# Define places (representing states between activities)

doc_verification_completed = PetriNet.Place("Document Verification Completed")

fraud_check_started = PetriNet.Place("Fraud Check Started")
fraud_check_completed = PetriNet.Place("Fraud Check Completed")
in_depth_investigation_needed = PetriNet.Place("In-Depth Investigation Needed")
claim_assessment_started = PetriNet.Place("Claim Assessment Started")
claim_assessment_completed = PetriNet.Place("Claim Assessment Completed")
approval_needed = PetriNet.Place("Approval Needed")
approval_completed = PetriNet.Place("Approval Completed")
payment_processed = PetriNet.Place("Payment Processed")
notification_sent = PetriNet.Place("Notification Sent")
claim_closed = PetriNet.Place("Claim Closed")

### Explanation:
1. **Places**: Represent states in the process (e.g., "Claim Received", "Document Verification Completed").
2. **Transitions**: Represent activities (e.g., "Claim Registration (CR)", "Fraud Check (FC)").
3. **Arcs**: Define the flow of tokens between places and transitions, modeling the process sequence.
   - Loops are created for re-submission of documents and in-depth investigations by connecting places/transitions back to earlier steps.
   - The approval step is optional (modeled with a direct path and an approval path).
4. **Initial Marking**: A token is placed in "Claim Received" to start the process.
5. **Final Marking**: A token in "Claim Closed" indicates the process is complete.

This Petri net captures the complex workflow of insurance claim management, including loops for rework and conditional paths. You can visualize it using tools like PM4Py for further analysis.
