Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants a DuckDB SQL query that does several things. Let me break down the requirements again to make sure I understand them correctly.

First, the task is to process an event log stored in a table called `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to find the top K process variants, where a variant is the ordered sequence of activities for a case, and then return all events from the cases that fall into those top K variants. 

Breaking down the steps:

1. **Determine the activity sequence for each case.** For each case_id, I need to order the activities by timestamp and then create a sequence string, like "A,B,C".

2. **Group cases by their sequence (variant) and count how many cases have each variant.** So, group by the sequence and count the case_ids.

3. **Identify the top K variants by their count.** This means ordering the variants by their count in descending order and picking the top K. But how do we handle K here? Since the query needs to be parameterized, I might need to use a common table expression (CTE) to compute the top K first.

4. **Retrieve all events from the original log that belong to these top K cases.** So, after figuring out which case_ids are part of the top K variants, we need to filter the original event_log to include only those case_ids.

Hmm, the challenge here is to structure the query so that we first compute the sequences, then get the counts, filter for the top K, and then join back to the original table. Let me think about how to structure this in SQL.

First, step 1: getting the sequence per case. To create the ordered list of activities for each case, I can use the LISTAGG function in DuckDB (or STRING_AGG with ORDER BY). Wait, DuckDB's STRING_AGG can take an ORDER BY clause. So for each case_id, sorted by timestamp, aggregate the activities into a string. 

The basic part for the sequence would be something like:

SELECT 
    case_id,
    STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id

That gives each case's sequence. 

Then, the next step is to count how many cases have each sequence. So, group by activity_sequence and count the case_ids:

SELECT 
    activity_sequence,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM (the above query)
GROUP BY activity_sequence

Then, order these by count descending and pick the top K. But since K is a parameter, perhaps we can use a variable or a parameter placeholder here. Since the problem says to write the query, maybe K is a variable that can be substituted, so in the SQL, we'll have to have a LIMIT K clause. Wait, but the problem says "top K variants", so the final output needs to include only those K variants. 

But to get the case_ids that belong to these top K variants, we need to first find which sequences are in the top K. 

So, the plan is:

1. Create a CTE (common table expression) that first computes the sequences for each case.

CTE1: sequences_with_case (case_id, activity_sequence)

2. Then, another CTE that counts the number of cases per sequence and ranks them to get the top K.

CTE2: variant_counts (activity_sequence, count, row_number())

Wait, but how to get the top K? Maybe using RANK() or ROW_NUMBER(), but since there can be ties, perhaps using DENSE_RANK() might be better. But the problem says "top K by frequency". So, the top K based on the count. So, to get the top K, we can order by count desc and then limit to K. 

Alternatively, we can compute the count for each sequence, then select the top K, and then get the sequences from that, then join back to the cases that have that sequence.

Putting this together, here's the approach:

First, compute the sequences for each case:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

Then, compute the counts per sequence and rank them:

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)

Wait, but the ROW_NUMBER() here would assign a unique rank to each variant based on case_count, so the highest count gets rank 1, next rank 2, etc. But if there are ties, it will still give different ranks. However, if the user wants exactly K, even if there are ties, maybe using DENSE_RANK() is better? But the problem says "top K variants", so perhaps the problem expects exactly K rows, so using ROW_NUMBER() is okay as long as K is the number of rows needed. 

Alternatively, the problem might not care about ties, so we can proceed with the top K as per the ranking.

Then, the next step is to select the activity_sequences where rank <= K. 

Wait, but how do we parameterize K here? Let's assume K is a variable, like 10, but in the SQL, we can use a placeholder. 

Wait, the problem says "the top K variants", so the user will have to specify K when running the query. So in the SQL, it might be something like:

SELECT ... WHERE rank <= K

But in SQL, you can't directly use a variable unless using a parameterized query. Since the problem requires writing the query, perhaps K is a parameter, so the user can replace it with a specific number. 

Putting this together, the steps are:

Compute the sequences for each case (case_sequences CTE).

Then, compute the counts and rank (variant_counts CTE).

Then, select the sequences where rank <= K. 

Then, join back to the original event_log to get all events from cases that have those sequences.

Wait, but how to connect the case_sequences to the original event_log? Because the case_sequences table has case_id and activity_sequence. So to get the case_ids that are in the top K variants, we need to first find the activity_sequences that are in the top K, then get all case_ids that have those sequences, then filter the original event_log with those case_ids.

Alternatively, the process is:

Top_sequences CTE is the list of activity_sequences that are in the top K. 

Then, the cases in case_sequences that have those sequences.

Then, the final result is all events from the original log where their case_id is in those cases.

Putting this into SQL steps:

First, the case_sequences CTE.

Then, compute the counts and rank:

variant_counts CTE:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) AS case_count,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank

FROM case_sequences

GROUP BY activity_sequence

Then, the top K sequences are those where rank <= K. 

But we need to collect those sequences, then get the case_ids associated with them. 

So, in the next step, create a CTE that gets the qualifying sequences:

top_k_sequences AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Then, the cases that are part of these top K sequences are the case_ids in case_sequences where their activity_sequence is in top_k_sequences. 

Then, the final step is to select all events from event_log where case_id is in those case_ids.

Putting all together, the query would be structured as:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_sequences AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE rank <= K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_sequences)

Wait, but the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants." So the final result is the original events where the case_id is in the cases that are in the top K variants.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to structure the joins so that for each case_id, if their activity_sequence is in the top K, include all their events.

Wait, the case_sequences CTE already has the case_id and their sequence. So, the top_k_sequences have the sequences, so we can do:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_k_sequences)
)

Alternatively, using a JOIN:

JOIN case_sequences to event_log on case_id, then check if the activity_sequence is in top_k_sequences.

But perhaps the most efficient way is to first get all the case_ids that are in the top K variants. So the steps would be:

1. Get all case_ids where their activity_sequence is in the top K. 

Thus, the CTEs can be structured such that the final query is:

SELECT el.* 
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
WHERE vc.rank <= K

But wait, the variant_counts table has activity_sequence and rank. So, if we join the case_sequences with variant_counts, then we can filter by rank <= K. 

Alternatively, maybe that's a better way. Let me think:

The case_sequences has case_id and their sequence.

The variant_counts has the count and rank for each sequence.

So, for each case_id, their sequence's rank is determined by the variant_counts. Thus, if we join case_sequences with variant_counts on the sequence, then we can filter where variant_counts.rank <= K.

Thus, the final SELECT would be:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
WHERE vc.rank <= K

Alternatively, the subquery approach:

SELECT * 
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM case_sequences 
    WHERE activity_sequence IN (
        SELECT activity_sequence 
        FROM variant_counts 
        WHERE rank <= K
    )
)

Either approach works. The first approach might be more efficient using joins.

Now, putting all together, the full query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence 
    FROM variant_counts 
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Wait, but in the variant_counts, the GROUP BY is on activity_sequence, so the rows in variant_counts are one per activity_sequence. Then, the IN subquery will get all the activity_sequences with rank <= K. Thus, the case_sequences.activity_sequence must be in that list. 

Alternatively, the WHERE clause could also be:

JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
AND vc.rank <= K

Either way should work.

Wait, but in the above approach, the variant_counts is already aggregating by activity_sequence, so in the WHERE clause, we can use a subquery that gets the list of activity_sequences with rank <= K, then filter the case_sequences to have their activity_sequence in that list.

But in the first part, in the variant_counts, the rank is assigned via ROW_NUMBER(), which assigns a unique rank even if counts are the same. But if two variants have the same count, they will have different ranks. If the user wants to include all variants with the same count as the Kth, maybe DENSE_RANK would be better. 

Wait, the problem says "top K variants by frequency". So if two variants have the same count, then the rank depends on the ordering. If the first K rows (including ties beyond K?), but the problem says "top K variants", so perhaps use ROW_NUMBER() which will strictly pick the top K even if there's a tie. But maybe the problem expects that if multiple variants have the same count as the Kth variant, they should also be included. Hmm, the problem statement says "determine the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)".

The problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So if two variants have the same count, which one is considered part of the top K? The problem probably expects that the user chooses to take the first K, but since the problem doesn't specify handling ties, maybe using ROW_NUMBER() is acceptable. Alternatively, using DENSE_RANK() and then choosing all those where rank <= K. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that if K=2, and two variants have the same count, then they would both be included even if their rank is 2 and 2, so DENSE_RANK would be better.

Wait, the problem says "top K variants by frequency". So if there's a tie, like the Kth and (K+1)th have the same count, do they both get included? The problem statement isn't clear, but the user probably expects the top K, so using ROW_NUMBER() would exclude some, while DENSE_RANK() might include more. To be safe, maybe the problem expects that we use ROW_NUMBER(), because the problem says "top K variants", so maybe K is fixed. But since the problem says "determine the top K variants by their frequency", the exact method for ties is unclear. But since the problem says "top K", perhaps using ROW_NUMBER() is acceptable. 

Proceeding with ROW_NUMBER() for now.

Putting it all together, the CTEs would be as above.

Wait, but the variant_counts CTE's first part is grouping by activity_sequence, then in the variant_counts CTE, the rows are per activity_sequence. The ROW_NUMBER() is ordered by the count descending, so the highest count gets rank 1, etc.

Thus, the final SELECT would need to link the case_id's sequences to see if they are part of the top K.

Now, the next step is to write this as a single query, making sure to use the correct joins.

Wait, but in the first CTE, case_sequences has case_id and activity_sequence. Then, the variant_counts CTE produces for each activity_sequence the count and rank. 

Thus, for each case_id in case_sequences, we can get the rank of their activity_sequence's rank. 

So, the final step is to get all event_log entries where the case_id's activity_sequence has a rank <= K. 

Therefore, in the final SELECT, we can:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
WHERE vc.rank <= K

But wait, in the variant_counts, the activity_sequence is grouped, so the join between case_sequences and variant_counts is necessary.

Alternatively, the variant_counts is computed as:

variant_counts has the count and rank for each sequence. 

So, the case_sequences has all cases with their sequences, and we can compute for each case's sequence whether it's in the top K.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Compute for each case its sequence (case_sequences).

2. For each sequence, compute its count and rank (variant_counts).

3. Select all event_log entries where their case's activity_sequence has a rank <= K.

Thus, the query would be structured as above.

Now, putting all together, the full query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence 
    FROM variant_counts 
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Alternatively, using a join with variant_counts:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
WHERE vc.rank <= K

Wait, but in that case, the join with variant_counts would add the rank, and then filter. 

But the IN approach might be simpler. 

Wait, but the variant_counts is a CTE that has activity_sequence and rank, so the subquery in the IN clause would get all activity_sequences with rank <= K. Then, the case_sequences must have an activity_sequence in that list.

Alternatively, the first approach is okay.

Now, the problem requires that the final result is all events from cases in the top K variants.

Another way: the case_sequences's activity_sequence must be in the list of top K sequences. 

Now, the question is: does the STRING_AGG function in the first CTE correctly capture the sequence in order of the timestamps?

Yes, because STRING_AGG with ORDER BY timestamp will order the activities in the order they occurred for that case. 

Wait, but in the case_sequences CTE, the aggregate function STRING_AGG is ordered by timestamp, so the order of the activities in the string is the correct sequence. 

Wait, but in the STRING_AGG, the activities are ordered by the timestamp. 

Wait, yes, the STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp). 

Wait, but the timestamp is part of the grouping in the case_sequences. The STRING_AGG is within each case_id group, so the order within each case is determined by the timestamp. So that's correct.

Now, the next step is to compute the counts and rank. 

Wait, the variant_counts CTE is:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*), etc. 

Wait, the FROM clause in variant_counts is case_sequences, so the COUNT(*) there is the number of case_ids per activity_sequence, which is correct. 

Now, putting it all together, the query should look like that.

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, the GROUP BY is on activity_sequence. 

Wait, the variant_counts CTE is:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) AS case_count, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank

FROM case_sequences

GROUP BY activity_sequence

Wait, but the GROUP BY is on activity_sequence, so the count is the number of cases per activity_sequence, which is correct. So the variant_counts has the count of cases for each variant (activity_sequence), and assigns a rank based on the count.

Thus, the rest is okay.

Now, the final SELECT uses the case_sequences and links back to the original event_log. 

Wait, but the case_sequences is needed to get the activity_sequence for each case_id. 

Thus, by joining the event_log with case_sequences on case_id, we can then check if the activity_sequence of that case's sequence is in the top K.

Alternatively, the IN clause gets all the qualifying activity_sequences from the variant_counts where rank <= K, then case_sequences's activity_sequence must be in that list.

Yes.

Putting it all together, the full query would be as follows.

Wait, but what if K is 0? Probably K is a positive integer provided as a parameter, so the user would replace K with a number. 

Now, let me check possible errors. 

Wait, in the variant_counts CTE, the ROW_NUMBER is over the list of activity_sequences ordered by their count in descending order. 

Yes, that should work.

Testing this logic with an example:

Suppose there are 3 variants. Suppose K is 2. 

The variant_counts would have the highest count first, so rank 1, then next rank 2, then 3. 

Thus, selecting those with rank <= 2 would include the top two. 

So far, so good. 

Another thing: the activity_sequence is constructed by concatenating activities in the order of their timestamps. So that's correct. 

Wait, but in the case_sequences CTE, the STRING_AGG is over the events in the case, ordered by timestamp. So the STRING_AGG's order is the correct sequence. 

Now, the final SELECT is getting all events from cases where their activity_sequence is in the top K. 

Thus, this should work.

Wait, but in the case_sequences, each case_id's activity_sequence is stored, so joining with that and checking if the activity_sequence is in the top K's sequences gives the desired case_ids. 

Therefore, the final query should work.

Wait, but in the variant_counts, the ROW_NUMBER() is assigned to each activity_sequence based on their case_count. So the rank is computed within the variant_counts. 

Therefore, the query should work.

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, the SELECT in the variant_counts is:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) AS case_count, ROW_NUMBER() over (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank

Wait, wait a second, the ROW_NUMBER() is over the entire set, ordered by count(*). But the COUNT(*) is the count of case_ids per activity_sequence, which is already grouped by activity_sequence. Wait, the variant_counts is a CTE that is computed by grouping the case_sequences by activity_sequence. So the FROM clause in variant_counts is case_sequences, which is grouped by case_id, but then the variant_counts is grouping by activity_sequence (since it's a GROUP BY activity_sequence). 

Wait, no. Let me look at the variant_counts CTE again:

variant_counts is defined as:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) AS case_count,

        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank

FROM case_sequences

GROUP BY activity_sequence

Wait, wait a second: the variant_counts CTE is:

The FROM is case_sequences, and the GROUP BY is activity_sequence. 

Wait, the SELECT clause has COUNT(*). The COUNT(*) here is the number of rows per activity_sequence. Since each row in case_sequences is a case_id with their sequence, the COUNT(*) would be the number of case_ids per activity_sequence. Wait, because in the case_sequences, each case_id has exactly one row. 

Wait, in case_sequences, each case_id corresponds to exactly one row (since it's grouped by case_id). So, in the variant_counts, when we do GROUP BY activity_sequence, the COUNT(*) would be the number of case_ids that have that activity_sequence.

Thus, the variant_counts CTE is correct.

So, the CTEs are okay.

Another possible issue: what if two sequences have the same count? The ROW_NUMBER() will assign a rank based on the order of their counts, so the first one encountered would have a lower rank, but that's an issue. 

But since the ORDER BY is by COUNT(*) DESC, then the ROW_NUMBER() will order first by the highest count, so if two sequences have the same count, the first one is rank 1, the next same count would get rank 2, but in the case of ties, the rank would increment even though counts are the same. 

If K is 2 and two variants have the same count and are first and second, then they will both be included. Wait no, because if two have the same count, the first one would have rank 1, the next would have rank 2, so that is okay. 

Wait, ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique rank, so even if two have the same count, they get different ranks. So if two have same count, they would have adjacent ranks. 

Thus, the rank is based on their order in the sorted list, so the first has rank 1, second rank 2, etc., even with same counts. So in the case of a tie at the Kth position, only the first one in that group would be included. 

The problem says "top K variants by their frequency". The problem might not care about ties, but the user must have chosen K and the query must pick the top K. 

Thus, this approach is correct as per the problem's requirements.

Another consideration: the activity_sequence is built using STRING_AGG with the ORDER BY timestamp. But in STRING_AGG, the order is determined by the ORDER By clause in the aggregate function. So the activities are ordered by timestamp, which is correct for the process variant's definition.

Now, putting all together, the final query.

Now, the problem says "Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

Wait, the "only" might imply that cases not in the top K are excluded. So the query above does that.

Thus, the full query would be as outlined.

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, the rank is calculated via ROW_NUMBER(), so if K is 3, and the third has the same count as the second, but rank is 3, so it's included. But if the user wants all those with the same count as the Kth, the problem might require using DENSE_RANK instead of ROW_NUMBER if the user wants to include all sequences with the same count as the Kth variant. 

Wait, the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". The problem's wording is "top K variants by their frequency", which would mean the top K by count, so the first K in the list ordered by count DESC, with ties broken arbitrarily. Since the problem doesn't specify handling ties, the query must proceed with the standard approach. 

Thus, the current approach is correct.

Now, putting it all into the full SQL query.

Wait, also, need to make sure that the final query selects from event_log, joining with case_sequences to get the activity_sequence, then check if that activity_sequence is among those with rank <= K.

Alternatively, the final SELECT can be written as:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.activity_sequence = vc.activity_sequence
    WHERE vc.rank <= K
)

But this may be more efficient? Not sure, but the query should be correct either way.

But the initial approach with the IN clause in the WHERE clause is straightforward.

Wait, but in the initial approach, the final query is:

SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_counts WHERE rank <= K)

Alternatively, the subquery can be written as:

SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_counts WHERE rank <= K

Yes.

Putting it all together, the complete query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity || ',', ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Wait, wait a second, the STRING_AGG syntax in DuckDB: the function is STRING_AGG(expression, delimiter ORDER BY ...). 

Wait, actually_sequence is generated by concatenating the activities in the order of the timestamp. 

Wait, the syntax for STRING_AGG in DuckDB is STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER By timestamp). 

Wait, the correct syntax is STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER by timestamp). 

Wait, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG takes the delimiter first, then the ORDER BY clause. The syntax is:

STRING_AGG(expression, delimiter [ORDER BY ...])

Wait, according to DuckDB's documentation, the syntax for STRING_AGG is:

STRING_AGG([DISTINCT] expression, delimiter [ ORDER BY order_expression [, ...] ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] ]

So the delimiter comes right after the expression. 

Wait, in the case_sequences, the first argument to STRING_AGG is activity, then the delimiter is ',', then the ORDER BY timestamp.

Wait, correct: the syntax is STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER by timestamp). 

Wait, so the correct syntax is:

STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp)

Wait, yes. So the case_sequences CTE's activity_sequence is correctly generated.

Now, putting all together.

Wait, in the variant_counts CTE, the COUNT is the number of case_ids per activity_sequence. 

Yes, because case_sequences has one row per case_id, so when grouping by activity_sequence in the variant_counts, COUNT(*) counts the number of cases with that sequence. 

Thus, the logic is correct.

Thus, the final query would look like this.

Now, putting it all into code:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_sequences AS (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE rank <= K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM top_sequences)

Wait, but the top_sequences CTE can be replaced with a direct subquery. But using CTE for clarity.

Alternatively, the top_sequences is not necessary, but using a CTE to make it clearer. 

Alternatively, the WHERE clause can directly reference variant_counts. 

Alternatively, the final query can be written without the top_sequences CTE, but perhaps the CTE makes it clearer.

Now, putting it all into a single query:

The full SQL query would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER by timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, the GROUP BY activity_sequence is necessary because when we do the SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) and the ROW_NUMBER().

Wait, the variant_counts is calculated as:

SELECT activity_sequence, COUNT(*) ...

FROM case_sequences

GROUP BY activity_sequence

Thus, each row in variant_counts is per activity_sequence, with its count and rank.

Thus, the above should work.

Now, but in DuckDB, the ROW_NUMBER() is computed after the GROUP BY? 

Wait, the variant_counts is built by first grouping the case_sequences by activity_sequence, and then the ROW_NUMBER() is computed over the list of those grouped rows, ordered by the count in DESC order. 

Yes, the OVER clause for the ROW_NUMBER() is over the entire result set of the SELECT in variant_counts, which is the list of activity_sequences with their counts. 

The ROW_NUMBER() is window function over the entire set, ordered by the count, so that the first has rank 1, next rank 2, etc.

Thus, the logic holds.

Now, testing for possible errors:

- The STRING_AGG might have the order of the activities correctly. 

Yes, because in the case_sequences, the activities are ordered by timestamp, so the STRING_AGG is ordered by the timestamp of the events in the case. 

Wait, wait: when STRING_AGG is used with the ORDER by timestamp, but the timestamp is part of the event_log, but in the case_sequences CTE, the timestamp is not present in the group by. Wait, that's okay because the STRING_AGG is computed within each case_id group. 

Wait, the case_sequences is built by grouping by case_id, so within each case_id, the STRING_AGG of the activities ordered by their timestamp. 

Yes, because in the case_sequences CTE, the group by is on case_id, so for each case_id, the activities are ordered by their own timestamps (i.e, the events for the case are ordered by their own timestamps, so the aggregate is ordered correctly.

Therefore, the activity_sequence is correctly built.

Another point: the final SELECT needs to include all events from the original table where the case's activity_sequence is in the top K.

So the final query should work.

Wait, but the case_sequences CTE is necessary to get the activity_sequence for each case_id.

Thus, the final query is correct.

Now, the user must replace K with the desired value. Since the problem states K is a parameter, the query uses K as a variable. 

Therefore, the final query is as outlined.

Another possible point: when using STRING_AGG, the order is determined by the timestamp. But in the case_sequences CTE, the STRING_AGG is ordered by the timestamp of the events. Since each case_id's events are ordered by their own timestamp, the STRING_AGG will concatenate them in the correct order.

Yes.

Another point: when joining back, the case_sequences must be joined with event_log on case_id. 

Thus, the final SELECT is joining the event_log with case_sequences to get the activity_sequence, then checking if that sequence is in the top K's sequences.

Thus, the query should work.

Therefore, the final answer should be the SQL query as constructed above. Let me write that out properly, making sure the syntax is correct.

Wait, in the variant_counts CTE, the ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC). The window is over the entire partition. 

Yes.

Putting all together, the SQL would be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence 
    FROM variant_counts 
    WHERE rank <= K
)

Wait, but in the JOIN between case_sequences and event_log, since case_sequences has one row per case_id, the JOIN is straightforward.

Thus, the final query should be as above.

Wait, but in the variant_counts, the count is the number of cases per variant. 

The WHERE clause in the final SELECT ensures only those activity_sequences that are in the top K.

Therefore, the SQL should work.

Thus, the final answer is this query. 

Wait, but in the variant_counts CTE, the SELECT is from case_sequences, then grouped by activity_sequence, so the COUNT(*) is the number of cases with that sequence, which is correct.

Thus, the query is correct.

So the final query is as outlined. The user can replace K with a specific number, like 5 for top 5.

Putting all together, the final answer is the above query.

Wait, but in the variant_counts, the ORDER BY for the ROW_number() is on the COUNT(*), so the highest count gets rank 1, etc.

Yes.

Another possible issue: in the STRING_AGG, the order is by the timestamp of the events in their case. 

Yes, because within each case_id (group by case_id), the STRING_AGG is ordered by the timestamp of the events in the group, which is the correct ordering.

Yes.

Therefore, the final SQL query should work.

To solve this problem, we need to identify the top K process variants from an event log and retrieve all events belonging to these variants. Here's a step-by-step explanation followed by the SQL query:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Activity Sequences:**
   - For each `case_id`, concatenate activities in the order they occurred (sorted by `timestamp`) into a sequence string.

2. **Count and Rank Variants:**
   - Count how many cases follow each sequence (variant).
   - Rank variants by their occurrence count in descending order.

3. **Filter Top K Variants:**
   - Identify the top K variants based on their rank.

4. **Retrieve Relevant Events:**
   - Select all events from the original log where their `case_id` belongs to the top K variants.

**DuckDB SQL Query:**
```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity, ',' ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (
    SELECT activity_sequence 
    FROM variant_counts 
    WHERE rank <= K
);
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

- **`case_sequences`:** This CTE creates a sequence of activities for each `case_id` by sorting events by `timestamp` and concatenating them into a string.
- **`variant_counts`:** This CTE calculates how many cases follow each sequence and assigns a rank based on their frequency.
- **Final Selection:** The main query joins the original event log with these CTEs to filter events belonging to the top K ranked variants.

Replace `K` with the desired number to get the top K variants. The query ensures only events from these top variants are returned.
