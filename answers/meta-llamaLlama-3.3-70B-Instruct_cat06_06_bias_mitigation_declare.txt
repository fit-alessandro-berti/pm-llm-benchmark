### Explanation of Added Constraints

The updated model includes several new constraints designed to mitigate bias in the loan application process:

1. **Coexistence Constraints (`coexistence`):** For decisions involving sensitive applicants (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` activity must coexist. This ensures that sensitive decisions are manually reviewed to prevent bias.

2. **Response Constraints (`response`):** After checking sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`), a `BiasMitigationCheck` must be performed before proceeding. This prevents immediate biased decisions based on sensitive information.

3. **Succession Constraints (`succession`):** A `BiasMitigationCheck` must precede both `Approve` and `Reject` decisions, ensuring that bias is mitigated before reaching a final decision.

4. **Non-Succession Constraints (`nonsuccession`):** Direct succession from sensitive attribute checks to `Reject` decisions is prevented, ensuring that decisions are not made based solely on sensitive attributes without additional mitigation checks.

These constraints work together to ensure that the loan application process is fair and unbiased, providing a safeguard against discriminatory practices based on sensitive applicant attributes.
