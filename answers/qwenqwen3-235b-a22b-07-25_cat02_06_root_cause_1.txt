### **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times**

We first calculate the **total resolution time** for each case — the time elapsed from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket".

---

#### **Case 101:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:00  
- End: 2024-03-01 10:15  
- **Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes**

#### **Case 102:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:05  
- End: 2024-03-02 09:15  
- **Duration: ~25 hours 10 minutes**

#### **Case 103:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:10  
- End: 2024-03-01 09:30  
- **Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes**

#### **Case 104:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:20  
- End: 2024-03-02 08:30  
- **Duration: ~24 hours 10 minutes**

#### **Case 105:**
- Start: 2024-03-01 08:25  
- End: 2024-03-03 09:30  
- **Duration: ~49 hours 5 minutes**

---

###  **Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times:**
- **Case 102 (~25.2 hours)**
- **Case 104 (~24.2 hours)**
- **Case 105 (~49.1 hours)**

> **Note:** Case 101 and 103 are resolved within a few hours and represent efficient processing. In contrast, the other three take over a full business day, with **Case 105 taking nearly two full days**.

---

### **2. Root Causes of Performance Issues**

We analyze delays by examining:
- **Escalations**
- **Gaps between activities**
- **Delays before investigation or resolution**

---

####  **Case 102 Analysis:**
- Escalated to Level-2 Agent at **11:30 on Mar 1**, but investigation begins only at **14:00 (2.5 hours later)**.
- Then, **investigation occurs on Mar 2 at 09:00** — a **19-hour gap** between escalation and next action.
- **Root Cause:** Long idle time after escalation. Suggests **Level-2 team was unavailable or backlog existed**.

>  **Key Delay:** 19-hour waiting period between escalation and investigation.

---

####  **Case 104 Analysis:**
- Assigned to Level-1 at 09:30, but investigation starts at **13:00 on Mar 1** — **3.5-hour delay**.
- Then, investigation on Mar 1, but resolution only on **Mar 2 at 08:00** — **19-hour gap**.
- No escalation, but **no activity overnight**.

>  **Key Delay:** Investigation started but not completed; **work paused overnight**, indicating lack of urgency or resource unavailability.

---

####  **Case 105 Analysis:**
- Escalated at **10:00 on Mar 1**, but next activity (investigation by Level-2) only at **14:00 on Mar 2** — **28-hour delay**.
- Resolution occurs on **Mar 3**, adding another day.
- Despite early triage and assignment, the **escalation caused a major bottleneck**.

>  **Key Delay:** Over **1 full day** between escalation and follow-up investigation.

###  Summary of Key Patterns:

| Case | Escalated? | Max Idle Time | Idle Period Timing | Total Duration |
|------|------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 101  | No         | ~10 min     | Minimal            | 2h 15m        |
| 102  | Yes        | ~19 hours   | Post-escalation    | ~25h          |
| 103  | No         | ~15 min     | Minimal            | 1h 20m        |
| 104  | No         | ~19 hours   | Overnight post-investigation | ~24h |
| 105  | Yes        | ~28 hours   | Post-escalation    | ~49h          |

### **3. Insights and Recommendations**

####  **Identified Performance Bottlenecks:**

1. **Escalation Delays (Cases 102 & 105):**
   - Tickets escalated to Level-2 experience **long waiting times** before being picked up.
   - **Root Cause:** Level-2 team may be overloaded, under-resourced, or lacks SLA tracking for escalated tickets.

2. **Overnight Pauses in Processing (Cases 104 & 105):**
   - Work is **not continuous**; investigations started but paused until next business day.
   - Suggests **lack of shift coverage** or **no prioritization of urgent tickets**.

3. **Delayed Assignment and Investigation (Case 104):**
   - 3.5-hour delay between assignment and investigation indicates **poor workload distribution** or **agent unavailability**.

4. **No Parallel Processing or Automation:**
   - All steps are sequential with **no overlapping or automated triage**, increasing idle time.

---

###  **Recommendations to Improve Performance:**

1. **Set SLAs for Escalated Tickets:**
   - Define **maximum response time for Level-2 teams** (e.g., within 4 business hours).
   - Implement **automated alerts** when escalation SLAs are near breach.

2. **Improve Handoff Visibility:**
   - Use a **ticketing system with real-time dashboards** to monitor handoffs (e.g., from Level-1 to Level-2).
   - Ensure **clear ownership** and reduce ambiguity in responsibility.

3. **Introduce Shift Overlaps or On-Call Rotations:**
   - Reduce overnight delays by having **coverage across shifts** or **urgent ticket queues** prioritized at start of day.

4. **Optimize Triage and Assignment:**
   - Reduce delays like in Case 104 (40 min from receive to triage, 1 hour to assign).
   - Use **automated assignment rules** based on issue type or agent availability.

5. **Analyze Escalation Frequency:**
   - If many tickets escalate, consider **upskilling Level-1 agents** or **improving knowledge base** to reduce dependency on Level-2.

6. **Conduct Root Cause Analysis on Long-Idle Tickets:**
   - Flag tickets with idle periods >2 hours for **process review**.
   - Identify whether delays are due to **systemic issues, staffing, or priority misalignment**.

---

###  **Conclusion**

The **primary drivers of long resolution times** are:
- **Delays after escalation to Level-2**, especially in Cases 102 and 105.
- **Overnight pauses** in processing, as seen in Cases 104 and 105.
- **Inefficient handoffs and assignment delays**.

While some delays may be due to business hours, the **lack of urgency and process visibility** is a systemic issue. Addressing escalation SLAs, improving shift coverage, and automating handoffs can **significantly reduce cycle times** and improve customer satisfaction.
