2. **Community Group Influence:**
   - **Group A:** All cases have no CommunityGroup association.
   - **Group B:** Cases U001 and U003 are members of "Highland Civic Darts Club," which results in a positive score adjustment.

3. **Local Resident Influence:**

   - **Group B:** All cases are local residents (TRUE).

### Manifestation of Bias

The bias is evident in Group B's event log, where members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club" receive a score adjustment of +10, which boosts their scores and influences the final decision to "Approved." This systematic adjustment favors members of this community group, leading to a higher likelihood of approval for those cases compared to those without the community group association. This suggests a potential bias in favor of members of the "Highland Civic Darts Club."

In contrast, Group A does not exhibit this type of bias because all cases are treated uniformly without any score adjustments or community group influences. The decisions in Group A are based solely on the preliminary scores without any additional adjustments.

### Conclusion

This bias manifests in the form of systematic score adjustments that favor individuals who are part of this community group, leading to a higher likelihood of approval.
