1. The initial step is "Create Fine", which seems to be the beginning of a traffic violation process. Each fine comes with a certain level of performance, measured by a numerical value.
2. After creating the fine, it's then sent to the offender using the action "Send Fine".
3. A notification about this fine is inserted into the system with "Insert Fine Notification", notifying relevant parties and setting a process in motion.
4. Depending on the subsequent actions, there are several possible outcomes:
   - The offender may pay the fine directly with "Payment". This results in the end of the process for that specific pathway (seen 12 times).
   - If the offender doesn't pay immediately, a penalty is added to the fine using "Add Penalty". From here, there are further options:
     - The offender might choose to appeal to the Prefecture with "Send Appeal to Prefecture". This may result in a payment once the result of the appeal is received ("Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture" followed by "Payment"), or it could lead to a notification of the appeal result to the offender without any further payment.
     - If there's no appeal, the process might continue with "Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture", and then either receive the result of the appeal from the prefecture ("Receive Result Appeal from Prefecture" followed by "Notify Result Appeal to Offender") or it could lead directly to credit collection through "Send for Credit Collection".
     - If there's no immediate response, the offender might decide to appeal to a Judge which eventually leads to payment.
5. The performance value associated with each pathway shows us how long and complex that process can be. The higher the performance value, the longer the entire sequence of actions takes to complete.
6. It's important to note that different paths have been taken by offenders a varying number of times (frequency) as indicated next to each pathway description. This data may help in understanding how common certain actions are and what outcomes are more likely under certain circumstances.
