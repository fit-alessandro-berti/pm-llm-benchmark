Below are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions. Both models include the initial application, a loop for data completeness, and a sequential flow toward the final decision, but they differ in how they handle the cultural evaluation stage.

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an `Operator.XOR` branch after the skill assessment. One path leads to the standard "CulturalFitCheck," while the other leads to the "CommunityAffiliationCheck," which allows for the subtle bias described in the text.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Individual Transitions
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
check_data = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
req_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 2. Control Flow Structures
# Loop for data completeness: Execute check_data, then optionally req_info and check_data again
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[check_data, req_info])

# XOR for Potential Bias: Either standard fit check or the community affiliation path
bias_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cultural_fit, community_check])

# 3. Partial Order (Sequential Workflow)
nodes = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, bias_xor, manager_review, final_decision]
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

unfair_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(skill_test, bias_xor)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(bias_xor, manager_review)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
In this refined model, the `Operator.XOR` branching logic is removed. Every applicant who passes the skill assessment proceeds to the exact same "CulturalFitCheck" stage, ensuring a uniform evaluation process regardless of community affiliations or local status.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Individual Transitions
receive_app = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
check_data = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
req_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_test = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck") # Standardized for everyone
manager_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# 2. Control Flow Structures
# Loop for data completeness remains the same to ensure data integrity
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[check_data, req_info])

# 3. Partial Order (Sequential Workflow)
# The XOR branch is removed, replaced by a single sequential step for CulturalFitCheck
nodes = [receive_app, data_loop, skill_test, cultural_fit, manager_review, final_decision]
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)

fair_model.order.add_edge(receive_app, data_loop)
fair_model.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_test)
fair_model.order.add_edge(skill_test, cultural_fit)
fair_model.order.add_edge(cultural_fit, manager_review)
fair_model.order.add_edge(manager_review, final_decision)
```
