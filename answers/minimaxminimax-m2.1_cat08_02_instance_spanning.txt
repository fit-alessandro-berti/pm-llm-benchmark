# Optimizing E-Commerce Fulfillment Through Process Mining: A Strategy for Managing Instance-Spanning Constraints

## Executive Summary

The fulfillment center's challenge extends beyond individual order inefficiencies to encompass complex interdependencies between process instances. These instance-spanning constraints—shared resources, batching requirements, priority handling, and regulatory limits—create systemic bottlenecks that traditional process improvement approaches fail to address adequately. This strategy document presents a comprehensive framework for identifying, analyzing, and optimizing these cross-instance dependencies using process mining techniques, simulation, and continuous monitoring. By treating the fulfillment process not as a collection of independent order journeys but as a networked system where orders compete for and influence access to constrained resources, we can develop targeted interventions that improve overall throughput, reduce end-to-end processing time, and ensure regulatory compliance while maintaining service level commitments.

## 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

### 1.1 Process Mining Approach to Constraint Identification

Effectively identifying instance-spanning constraints requires moving beyond traditional process discovery that focuses solely on control-flow patterns. While conformance checking can verify whether individual orders follow the expected sequence of activities, detecting cross-instance dependencies demands a multi-dimensional analysis that incorporates resource interactions, temporal patterns, and attribute-based filtering. The foundational technique involves constructing a resource-activity matrix from the event log, where rows represent resources (staff members, stations, systems) and columns represent activities. By analyzing the utilization patterns and transition frequencies within this matrix, we can identify resources that serve as convergence points where multiple orders compete for access.

The identification process begins with filtering the event log to isolate activities where resource contention is most likely to occur—specifically Packing and Quality Check activities. For each resource performing these activities, we calculate the inter-arrival times of orders requiring that resource and compare these against the average processing duration. When inter-arrival times consistently fall below processing durations, a queue forms, indicating a capacity constraint. This analysis should be performed separately for standard and specialized resources, as the Cold-Packing stations (Station C1-C5) will show different patterns than general packing stations.

Attribute-based filtering proves essential for identifying constraints tied to specific order characteristics. By filtering the event log for orders where "Requires Cold Packing" equals TRUE, we can isolate the subset of orders competing for the five Cold-Packing stations. Applying the resource-activity analysis to this filtered subset reveals whether these limited stations constitute a bottleneck. Similarly, filtering for "Hazardous Material" flagged orders allows us to assess whether the regulatory limit of ten concurrent processing activities creates delays, even though this limit applies across the entire facility rather than to specific stations.

### 1.2 Quantifying Constraint Impact Through Specialized Metrics

Measuring the impact of instance-spanning constraints requires metrics that capture waiting time attributable to external factors rather than inherent processing requirements. The primary metric for resource contention is **Resource Queue Time**, calculated as the difference between an order's activity start time and the completion time of the previous order on the same resource. However, this simple calculation overestimates waiting time when resources process multiple orders in parallel or when orders wait for reasons unrelated to the specific resource. A more refined approach involves constructing resource-specific timelines showing continuous activity intervals and identifying gaps where orders started but the resource was idle—these gaps indicate that other factors (such as batch formation or dependency violations) caused the delay rather than resource unavailability.

For **Batching Delays**, the metric of interest is **Batch Formation Waiting Time**, which captures the interval between an order completing Quality Check and the Shipping Label Generation activity. This interval should be zero for orders that immediately enter a batch, but the event log snippet shows ORD-5001 waited from 10:35:15 (Quality Check COMPLETE) to 10:45:50 (Shipping Label Gen COMPLETE)—a 10-minute 35-second delay attributable to batch formation. By aggregating this metric across orders with the same destination region, we can identify whether certain regions experience systematically longer batch waits, potentially due to lower order volumes for those regions or suboptimal batch triggering thresholds.

**Priority Disruption Impact** measures the delay imposed on standard orders when an express order interrupts their processing. This requires identifying instances where a standard order was actively using a resource (evidenced by a START timestamp followed by a gap before COMPLETE) and an express order used the same resource in the interim. The duration of the gap attributable to the express order's processing represents the disruption impact. Importantly, this metric must distinguish between true preemption (where the standard order was physically paused) and sequencing effects (where the standard order simply waited while the express order went first). The distinction matters because true preemption wastes work-in-progress inventory while simple sequencing only delays completion.

The **Hazardous Material Compliance Gap** measures the extent to which orders containing hazardous materials are forced to wait due to the ten-concurrent-order limit. This metric requires tracking, for each hazardous order reaching Packing or Quality Check, how many other hazardous orders were simultaneously active in these activities. When this count approaches or exceeds ten, subsequent hazardous orders must wait regardless of resource availability. The metric captures both the frequency of capacity constraints and the cumulative waiting time imposed on hazardous orders specifically.

### 1.3 Differentiating Within-Instance Versus Between-Instance Waiting Factors

Accurate diagnosis requires systematically decomposing total order duration into components attributable to different causes. The foundational technique is **Variant-Based Analysis**, where orders are grouped by their attribute combinations (order type, destination region, special requirements) and average durations are compared across variants. Significant variations between otherwise similar orders suggest external factors at play. For instance, if standard orders to the North region show consistently longer Packing durations than standard orders to the South region, despite similar item counts and packing requirements, the difference may stem from resource contention patterns specific to regional batching rather than inherent processing complexity.

**Resource Correlation Analysis** examines whether variations in order duration correlate with resource utilization patterns. If an order's duration spikes during periods when particular resources show high activity levels, the duration increase may reflect waiting rather than processing. This analysis requires temporal alignment of order timelines with resource utilization timelines, allowing us to attribute specific time intervals to resource contention when both the order and the resource were active simultaneously.

The **Comparative Conformance Approach** involves constructing an "ideal" process model from orders that completed successfully without delays, then measuring the conformance of all other orders against this baseline. Significant deviations—particularly in the form of long intermediate events between activities—indicate external interference. For example, an order showing a 45-minute gap between Packing COMPLETE and Quality Check START, while the ideal baseline shows immediate transition, suggests the order waited for Quality Check staff availability rather than requiring 45 minutes of processing.

Finally, **Attribute-Enriched Process Models** incorporate order attributes directly into the discovery process. By discovering separate models for express versus standard orders, or for cold-packing versus regular orders, we can compare how the same activity behaves differently across attribute combinations. If Quality Check shows similar duration distributions for cold-packing and regular orders when analyzed in isolation, but cold-packing orders show systematically longer Quality Check waits when analyzed alongside regular orders, the difference stems from cross-instance competition rather than within-instance complexity.

## 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

### 2.1 The Cold-Packing and Priority Handling Interaction

The interaction between Cold-Packing station availability and Priority Order Handling creates a compounding bottleneck with potentially severe performance implications. When an express order requiring cold-packing arrives while all five Cold-Packing stations are occupied by standard orders, the priority handling rule requires pausing one of those standard orders. This creates a triple impact: the express order experiences some waiting time (until a station becomes available), the preempted standard order experiences both the waiting time and the disruption of having its work interrupted, and subsequent standard orders face longer queues as the preempted order resumes after the express order completes.

The process mining analysis to quantify this interaction involves filtering for express orders requiring cold-packing and examining their Packing activity timestamps in relation to standard orders using Cold-Packing stations during the same periods. Specifically, we look for standard orders that show a START-COMPLETE pattern with a gap coinciding with an express order's Packing activity on the same station. The frequency and duration of these preemption events, aggregated across the analysis period, reveal the true cost of this interaction.

Simulation modeling helps explore how different station allocations between cold-packing and general packing might affect this interaction. If the five Cold-Packing stations represent dedicated capacity, express cold-packing orders never compete with standard non-cold-packing orders for the same stations. However, if these stations can also handle standard orders when no cold-packing work is available, the allocation decision affects overall throughput. The optimal allocation likely depends on the proportion of orders requiring cold-packing and their express status distribution.

### 2.2 Batching and Hazardous Material Limit Interactions

The interaction between shipping batch formation and hazardous material limits introduces a nuanced coordination challenge. When orders to the same geographical region are batched together, multiple hazardous material orders may arrive at the Shipping Label Generation step simultaneously. If the hazardous material limit of ten concurrent Packing or Quality Check activities has been binding, orders may have been artificially held in earlier stages to comply with regulations. When these held orders then proceed to batch formation together, the batch may include an unusually high concentration of hazardous materials.

This interaction matters because the hazardous material limit applies to Packing and Quality Check activities, but the batch formation for shipping occurs after these activities complete. An order cannot be held at the Quality Check stage indefinitely to manage hazardous material concurrency—eventually it must proceed, potentially triggering compliance violations if too many orders are released simultaneously. The process mining analysis should examine temporal clusters of hazardous orders reaching the Shipping Label Generation stage; tight clustering suggests these orders may have been queued at earlier stages due to the limit and then released in batches.

The optimization strategy for this interaction involves decoupling hazardous material management from batch formation. Rather than holding hazardous orders at earlier stages, the system could implement pre-screening that allocates hazardous orders to batches proactively, ensuring that no batch contains so many hazardous orders that their concurrent processing would violate the limit. Alternatively, the batch formation logic could be modified to release hazardous orders gradually rather than in concentrated batches, even if this slightly increases average batch size or reduces routing optimization.

### 2.3 Resource Competition Across Multiple Constraint Dimensions

The most complex interactions occur when orders compete on multiple constraint dimensions simultaneously. Consider an express order requiring cold-packing for a hazardous material: this order competes for the five Cold-Packing stations, triggers priority handling that preempts standard orders, and counts toward the ten-order hazardous material limit. If the hazardous material limit is already near capacity, this order may need to wait even after a Cold-Packing station becomes available, because releasing it would exceed regulatory limits.

This multi-dimensional competition requires understanding the joint distribution of order attributes. The process mining analysis should compute the frequency of orders falling into various attribute intersections: cold-packing and hazardous, express and cold-packing, express and hazardous, and the triple intersection of all three. If the triple-intersection set is small but growing during peak seasons, seasonal capacity planning can account for it. If this set is large year-round, the operational constraints may be fundamentally incompatible with the order mix, requiring process redesign.

The strategic implication is that optimizing for one constraint in isolation may exacerbate others. Adding more Cold-Packing stations would reduce cold-packing contention but might increase hazardous material concurrency if more cold-packing orders proceed through Packing simultaneously. Relaxing batch size requirements would reduce batch waiting time but might concentrate hazardous orders more tightly, triggering more frequent regulatory constraints. Effective optimization requires viewing these constraints as a coupled system rather than independent bottlenecks.

## 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

### 3.1 Strategy One: Dynamic Resource Allocation with Predictive Queue Management

This strategy addresses the Cold-Packing station bottleneck and its interaction with priority handling through a predictive, data-driven approach to resource allocation. Rather than treating the five Cold-Packing stations as a fixed pool competing equally for all incoming cold-packing orders, the strategy implements a tiered allocation system informed by real-time queue lengths and predicted demand.

The implementation begins with installing sensors or integrating with warehouse management systems to track Cold-Packing station utilization in real time, feeding data to a prediction engine that forecasts cold-packing demand based on order arrival patterns, lead times from the Item Picking stage, and historical seasonality. When predicted demand exceeds available capacity by a threshold margin, the system automatically allocates one of the five stations to an "express-only" pool during high-demand windows. This ensures that express cold-packing orders always have dedicated capacity, eliminating preemption of standard cold-packing orders during peak periods while maintaining overall station utilization during normal periods.

The prediction component leverages the three-month event log to identify patterns in cold-packing order arrivals, particularly correlations with time of day, day of week, and seasonal factors. Machine learning models trained on this historical data predict the probability distribution of cold-packing demand in future time windows, allowing the allocation system to proactively reserve express capacity before queues form. During low-predicted-demand periods, all stations serve both express and standard orders, maximizing utilization.

The expected outcomes include reduced waiting time for express cold-packing orders (since they never wait for a standard order to vacate a station), reduced disruption to standard cold-packing orders (since they are never preempted), and improved predictability of completion times for all cold-packing orders. The strategy explicitly addresses the interaction between cold-packing contention and priority handling by functionally decoupling the resource pools during high-demand conditions while maintaining flexibility during normal operations.

### 3.2 Strategy Two: Intelligent Batch Formation with Regulatory Constraints

This strategy transforms the Shipping Label Generation batching process from a passive wait-for-batch-full approach to an active optimization that considers hazardous material constraints, regional demand patterns, and desired service levels. The current approach—batching orders to the same geographical region—creates variable waiting times depending on regional order volumes and creates the potential for hazardous material concentration problems.

The proposed system implements dynamic batch triggering based on multiple factors. First, a time-based trigger ensures that no order waits longer than a maximum acceptable delay (e.g., 15 minutes) for batch completion, regardless of how many orders have accumulated for that region. Second, a hazardous material trigger monitors the count of hazardous orders currently in the batching queue for each region; when this count approaches a threshold that would create compliance issues if all proceeded simultaneously to Packing and Quality Check, the system releases a subset of hazardous orders to earlier stages even if the batch is not full. Third, a priority trigger ensures that express orders bypass regular batch formation logic and are processed individually or in express batches to meet their accelerated timelines.

The optimization algorithm underlying this strategy uses historical data to model the trade-off between batch size (which affects shipping route efficiency) and waiting time (which affects order completion time). By analyzing historical batches, the system identifies diminishing returns points where larger batches provide minimal routing benefits but add significant waiting time for early-arriving orders. The dynamic triggering logic balances these factors in real time, forming larger batches when regional order rates are high (naturally accumulating orders quickly) and accepting smaller batches when order rates are low (avoiding excessive waits).

The expected outcomes include reduced maximum and average waiting time for batch formation, maintained or improved shipping route efficiency through intelligent batch sizing, and elimination of hazardous material compliance issues caused by batch concentration. The strategy addresses the interaction between batching and hazardous material limits by proactively managing the release of hazardous orders rather than allowing them to accumulate to problematic levels.

### 3.3 Strategy Three: Integrated Scheduling with Constraint-aware Prioritization

This strategy addresses the fundamental challenge of priority handling by implementing a sophisticated scheduling system that considers multiple constraint dimensions simultaneously. Rather than the simple rule "express orders preempt standard orders," the proposed system implements weighted priority scoring that accounts for resource availability, constraint saturation, and system-wide impact.

Each order receives a dynamic priority score calculated from multiple components. The base priority reflects order type (express versus standard) and remaining time to deadline. The resource contention component adjusts the score based on how contested the resources required by the order currently are—an express order requiring a Cold-Packing station when all five are busy receives a higher boost than an express order requiring a general packing station with available capacity. The constraint saturation component monitors system-wide constraints like the hazardous material limit; when the limit is nearly reached, hazardous orders receive priority to prevent the system from blocking when a new hazardous order arrives.

The scheduling system implements a reservation mechanism where orders can reserve future capacity at constrained resources. When an order reaches Item Picking and its destination region and special requirements are known, the system checks availability of the resources it will need (Cold-Packing stations, Quality Check staff) and reserves slots if available. This reservation ensures that the order will not face resource contention later in its journey, at the cost of potentially leaving some reserved capacity unused if the order's trajectory changes.

The implementation leverages the event log to calibrate the priority scoring weights. By analyzing historical data, we can estimate the marginal impact on order completion time of different priority adjustments and set weights to optimize for overall throughput or on-time delivery rates. The system continuously learns from new data, adjusting weights as order patterns evolve.

The expected outcomes include reduced average order completion time (by avoiding inefficient preemption and waiting), improved express order on-time performance (by prioritizing them when it matters most), and better resource utilization (by spreading load across resources rather than concentrating it on the most popular options). This strategy addresses the interactions between priority handling, resource contention, and regulatory constraints by making these interactions explicit in the scheduling decision logic.

## 4. Simulation and Validation

### 4.1 Simulation Architecture for Constraint-Aware Testing

Effective simulation of the fulfillment process requires models that capture not just activity durations and sequences but also the resource contention, priority rules, and regulatory limits that create cross-instance dependencies. The simulation architecture should implement a discrete-event simulation framework where orders arrive according to historical patterns, flow through activities based on resource availability and process logic, and compete for constrained resources according to defined rules.

The resource model must distinguish between different resource types and their constraint characteristics. For shared resources like Cold-Packing stations, the model implements a capacity limit (five simultaneous activities) and a queue where arriving orders wait when capacity is full. For Quality Check staff, the model should incorporate individual resource characteristics—if certain staff members are certified for hazardous materials while others are not, the model must route hazardous orders only to certified staff, effectively reducing the available capacity for hazardous orders. For the batching system, the model implements batch formation logic that can be parameterized to test different triggering rules.

The priority handling mechanism requires careful implementation to reflect real-world behavior. When an express order arrives at a resource where a standard order is actively processing, the simulation must model whether true preemption occurs (the standard order is paused and resumes after the express order completes) or simple reordering (the express order goes to the head of the queue, and the standard order continues processing). The distinction matters for total work-in-progress inventory and for accurate estimation of order durations.

### 4.2 Validating Simulation Accuracy Against Historical Data

Before testing optimization strategies, the simulation must be calibrated and validated against the three-month event log to ensure it accurately reproduces historical behavior. The validation process involves comparing key statistical distributions between the simulation output and the historical data: distribution of order durations by order type, distribution of resource utilization across different resources, distribution of waiting times at constrained activities, and frequency of constraint activations (e.g., how often all five Cold-Packing stations were busy simultaneously).

Statistical tests determine whether simulation outputs differ significantly from historical data. If significant discrepancies exist, the model parameters require adjustment. Common sources of discrepancy include inaccurate activity duration distributions (particularly those that vary by time of day or resource), incorrect queueing disciplines (e.g., first-in-first-out versus priority-based), and missing constraint interactions. The calibration process iteratively refines model parameters until simulation outputs fall within acceptable confidence intervals of historical statistics.

Particular attention should be paid to validating the representation of instance-spanning constraints. The simulation should reproduce the observed frequency and duration of batch waiting times, the observed pattern of express order preemption of standard orders, and the observed behavior of hazardous material orders near the ten-concurrent-order limit. If the simulation cannot reproduce these patterns, the model is missing essential dynamics that would affect the evaluation of optimization strategies.

### 4.3 Scenario Testing for Optimization Strategy Evaluation

Once validated, the simulation enables systematic testing of optimization strategies under controlled conditions. For each proposed strategy, the simulation implements the strategy logic and runs multiple replications with random variation in order arrivals (sampled from historical distributions) to estimate outcome distributions rather than point estimates.

The testing matrix should include scenarios representing different demand levels: historical average demand, peak season demand (scaled up based on seasonal patterns), and extreme demand (e.g., 150% of average) to test strategy robustness under stress conditions. For each demand level, the simulation tests the current baseline (no optimization) and each proposed strategy, measuring key performance indicators including average order completion time, express order on-time percentage, standard order on-time percentage, resource utilization rates, and constraint violation frequency.

The simulation also enables sensitivity analysis to understand how strategy performance depends on parameter choices. For the Dynamic Resource Allocation strategy, sensitivity analysis examines how performance varies with different thresholds for activating express-only capacity and different prediction horizons. For the Intelligent Batch Formation strategy, sensitivity analysis tests different maximum wait times and different hazardous material release thresholds. This analysis identifies robust parameter ranges that perform well across multiple demand scenarios.

## 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

### 5.1 Process Mining Dashboards for Constraint Monitoring

Continuous monitoring requires dashboards that surface the key metrics for each instance-spanning constraint in real time, enabling operations managers to identify emerging problems before they escalate. The dashboard architecture implements role-based views with increasing granularity: executive dashboards showing high-level KPIs, operational dashboards showing resource-level details, and analytical dashboards supporting drill-down investigation.

The **Resource Contention Dashboard** displays current utilization and queue status for all constrained resources. For the Cold-Packing stations, the dashboard shows the number of busy stations, the number of orders waiting, and the average wait time for recent orders. Color coding highlights when utilization exceeds critical thresholds (e.g., more than four of five stations busy, or queue length exceeding five orders). Trend lines show whether contention is increasing or decreasing over time. The dashboard also distinguishes between express and standard orders in the queue, making priority violations immediately apparent.

The **Batching Efficiency Dashboard** monitors the Shipping Label Generation process across all destination regions. For each region, the dashboard shows batch size distribution (identifying regions with unusually small or large batches), average batch formation time, and the percentage of orders that wait beyond the target maximum. A heat map visualization shows batch formation activity over time, revealing patterns like delayed batch formation during shift changes or unusually rapid batching during peak periods.

The **Hazardous Material Compliance Dashboard** tracks the ten-concurrent-order limit in real time, showing the current count of hazardous orders in Packing or Quality Check activities, the historical maximum concurrent count, and the frequency and duration of periods where the count approached or exceeded the limit. The dashboard also tracks hazardous orders specifically, showing their average waiting time and completion time compared to non-hazardous orders, identifying whether hazardous status creates systematic disadvantage.

### 5.2 Alerting and Anomaly Detection

Beyond passive dashboard display, the monitoring system implements automated alerting for conditions requiring immediate attention. Alert thresholds should be set based on the simulation analysis, calibrated to trigger before problems become severe but not so sensitive that alert fatigue reduces response effectiveness.

Critical alerts trigger for constraint violations: when hazardous material concurrent count exceeds ten, when an express order's projected completion time falls below its deadline given current queue lengths, or when a batch formation wait exceeds a defined maximum. These alerts require immediate operator intervention to prevent service failures or regulatory violations.

Warning alerts indicate emerging issues that may not yet require intervention but warrant monitoring: when Cold-Packing station utilization exceeds 80% for sustained periods, when batch sizes fall below efficiency thresholds for multiple consecutive batches, or when express orders begin preempting standard orders at increasing rates. These warnings enable proactive management before situations escalate.

Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual patterns that rule-based alerting might miss. Machine learning models trained on normal operational data flag orders, resources, or time periods that deviate significantly from expected behavior. For example, if a particular Quality Check staff member shows unusually long processing times for a specific order type, the anomaly detection system flags this for investigation—it might indicate a training issue, a equipment problem, or a data quality problem.

### 5.3 Continuous Improvement Through Ongoing Process Mining

The monitoring system feeds back into the optimization cycle through regular process mining analyses that compare current performance against historical baselines and against the simulated targets. Monthly automated reports summarize performance trends, highlighting improvements and regressions. Quarterly deep-dive analyses apply the full range of process mining techniques to identify emerging bottlenecks and validate that optimization strategies continue to perform as expected.

Conformance checking against the optimized process model ensures that actual operations follow the intended procedures. If the intelligent batch formation strategy is implemented but orders continue to wait for batches beyond the defined maximum, conformance checking identifies this deviation for correction. Similarly, if the dynamic resource allocation strategy reserves express-only capacity but express orders continue to wait, the system flags this for investigation.

The monitoring framework also supports A/B testing of incremental improvements. When proposing refinements to optimization strategies (e.g., adjusting batch formation thresholds based on new data), the system can implement the refinement for a subset of orders while maintaining the existing strategy for others, comparing performance to validate the improvement before organization-wide deployment.

---

## Conclusion

Optimizing the e-commerce fulfillment process requires acknowledging and explicitly managing the instance-spanning constraints that create dependencies between orders. The shared Cold-Packing stations, shipping batch formation logic, priority handling rules, and hazardous material regulatory limits all introduce cross-instance dynamics that cannot be addressed by improving individual order processing in isolation.

The strategy presented here leverages process mining to identify and quantify these constraints, simulation to test optimization strategies before implementation, and continuous monitoring to ensure sustained improvement. The three proposed optimization strategies—dynamic resource allocation, intelligent batch formation, and integrated constraint-aware scheduling—address different aspects of the constraint system while explicitly accounting for their interactions.

Successful implementation requires organizational commitment to data-driven decision making, investment in the sensing and monitoring infrastructure needed to support real-time visibility, and ongoing analytical capability to refine strategies as order patterns evolve. The payoff is a fulfillment process that reliably meets delivery deadlines even during peak seasons, efficiently utilizes constrained resources, and maintains regulatory compliance while minimizing unnecessary delays imposed by poor coordination between order instances.
