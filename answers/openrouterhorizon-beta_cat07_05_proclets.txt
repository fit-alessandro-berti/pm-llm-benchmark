This visualization illustrates how two “proctlet” (process object) classes—Lab visit and Lab test—interact via messaging channels in a healthcare workflow.

a) Two proctlet classes connected through two channels:
- Left swimlane: Lab visit (roles include doctor and lab assistant).
  - Steps: Order entry  Take blood sample  Judge results  If not OK, Do tests again  Receive updated result  Send report. If OK, path goes to “Everything fine”.
- Right swimlane: Lab test (role: chemical analyst).
  - Steps: Perform test  Make report  Finish lab test. If asked to redo: Perform test again  Provide updated report  Finish.
- Channels:
  - “Order system” (top dashed oval) connects Lab visit’s “Order entry” to Lab test’s “Perform test”.
  - “HIS” (Hospital Information System, middle dashed box) carries results/reports between “Make report/Provide updated report” on the Lab test side and “Receive result/Receive updated result” and “Judge results” on the Lab visit side.
- Black circles/semi-circles denote start/end points; small black boxes on edges indicate message exchanges; diamonds show decision points (e.g., retesting).

b) Class diagram:
- Lab visit requires one or more Lab test instances.
- Cardinalities shown: Lab visit 1..1 requires Lab test 1..*.

c) Example performative (message log entry):
- Time: 11:00
- Channel: Order system
- Sender: Lab visit – HGB John
- Receiver: Lab test – HGB John
- Action: Create
- Content: “Can you perform an HGB test for John?”
- Scope: Private
- Direction: OUT

Overall, it models ordering a lab test, exchanging results via HIS, deciding on retests, and final reporting.
