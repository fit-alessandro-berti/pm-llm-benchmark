 To generate a DECLARE model for the given process variants, we need to analyze the provided traces and identify the constraints that hold true for the activities. We will use the activity frequencies and the nature of the process to determine the appropriate constraints and their confidence levels. Since the performance data is not directly used in defining the DECLARE constraints, we will focus on the activity sequences and their frequencies.

Here is a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model based on the provided process variants:

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        # ... (add other activities with existence constraint)
    },
    'absence': {
        # No activities are absent in all traces
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        # ... (add other activities if exactly one execution is intended)
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Fine': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        # ... (add other initial activities if any)
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Create Fine', 'Send Fine'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Fine', 'Insert Fine Notification'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Fine Notification', 'Add penalty'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Payment'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Add penalty', 'Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Insert Date Appeal to Prefecture', 'Send Appeal to Prefecture'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0
