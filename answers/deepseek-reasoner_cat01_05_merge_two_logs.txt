**Reasoning & Decisions:**

1. **Event Matching & Merging**:
   - **Order Received (A) + OrderReceived (B)**: 
     - Timestamps differ by 2 seconds (within tolerance). 
     - Event names are semantically identical. 
     - Merged with all attributes from both logs.
   - **Order Validated (A) + OrderValidation (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by 1 second. 
     - Event names align logically. 
     - Combined into a single record.
   - **Item Shipped (A) + Shipping (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by 2 seconds. 
     - Both events clearly describe the same activity (shipping). 
     - Merged.
   - **Payment Processed (A) vs. PaymentCheck (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by 5 seconds (exceeds 2-second tolerance). 
     - Event names suggest distinct stages (completion vs. validation). 
     - Left as separate events.
   - **Quality Check (B)** and **Item Delivered (A)**:
     - No matching counterpart in the other log. 
     - Included as-is with source indicated.

2. **Timestamp Handling**:
   - For merged events, both `timestamp_a` (Log A) and `timestamp_b` (Log B) are included. 
   - Chronological order is based on `timestamp_a` (Log A) for merged events to respect the "primary timeline" requirement. Events exclusive to Log B use their own timestamp.

3. **Attribute Enrichment**:
   - Merged events include all attributes from both logs (e.g., `user_id`, `resource_id`, `notes` from Log B, and `event_type` from Log A).
   - Non-merged events retain their original attributes and include a `source` field (System A or B).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **PaymentCheck (B)** and **Payment Processed (A)**: Kept separate due to timing and semantic differences.
   - **Quality Check (B)**: Added as a standalone event from Log B, enriching the log with additional context.

**Final Notes**:  
This merged log prioritizes Log A’s timeline for ordering but retains Log B’s richer metadata. Discrepancies in timestamps are documented to maintain transparency. Events are enriched with cross-system attributes, providing a comprehensive view of the order fulfillment process.
