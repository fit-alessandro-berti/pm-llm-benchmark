**Reasoning & Decisions:**

1. **Merged Events**:
   - **Order Received/OrderReceived**:  
     - Log A: `10:00:00`, Log B: `09:59:58` (2s difference).  
     - Event names semantically identical. Merged with Log A’s timestamp as primary (primary timeline) and Log B’s timestamp as `timestamp_b`.
   - **Order Validated/OrderValidation**:  
     - Log A: `10:01:30`, Log B: `10:01:29` (1s difference).  
     - Names align; merged with Log A’s timestamp.
   - **Item Shipped/Shipping**:  
     - Log A: `10:05:00`, Log B: `10:05:02` (2s difference).  
     - Combined, retaining both timestamps.

2. **Separate Events**:
   - **Payment Processed (A) vs PaymentCheck (B)**:  
     - 5s timestamp gap exceeds tolerance. Event names suggest different stages (processed vs check). Kept separate.
   - **Quality Check (B)**:  
     - No counterpart in Log A. Included as-is with Log B’s timestamp.
   - **Item Delivered (A)**:  
     - No match in Log B. Included as-is.

3. **Timestamp Handling**:  
   - For merged events, Log A’s timestamp is used for ordering (primary timeline), while Log B’s timestamp is preserved as `timestamp_b`.  
   - Unmatched events retain their original timestamps.

4. **Attribute Integration**:  
   - Merged events include all attributes from both logs (e.g., `user_id`, `notes` from Log B).  
   - Unmatched events include a `origin` field (A or B) to indicate their source.

5. **Naming Conventions**:  
   - Event names were matched based on semantic similarity (e.g., "Order Received" vs "OrderReceived").  
   - No name standardization was applied to preserve raw data integrity.
