### Merged Event Log (Chronological Order)

| Timestamp (Primary)       | Event Type/Name          | order_id    | system_a_timestamp        | system_b_timestamp        | user_id | resource_id | notes                          | Origin (if standalone) |

### Reasoning & Conflict Resolution

1. **Merged Events**:
   - **Order Received (A) + OrderReceived (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (A: `10:00:00`, B: `09:59:58`). 
     - Event names are semantically identical. 
     - Merged with **Log A’s timestamp** (primary timeline), but **Log B’s timestamp** included for transparency.
   - **Order Validated (A) + OrderValidation (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by **1 second** (A: `10:01:30`, B: `10:01:29`). 
     - Event names reflect the same activity. Merged.
   - **Item Shipped (A) + Shipping (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by **2 seconds** (A: `10:05:00`, B: `10:05:02`). 
     - Event names differ slightly but describe the same outcome. Merged.

2. **Unmatched Events**:
   - **Payment Processed (A)** and **PaymentCheck (B)**:
     - Timestamps differ by **5 seconds** (A: `10:02:00`, B: `10:02:05`), exceeding the tolerance. 
     - Event names suggest different stages (processing vs. verification). Kept separate.
   - **Quality Check (B)** and **Item Delivered (A)**:
     - No corresponding events in the other log. Included as-is with origin noted.

3. **Timestamp Handling**:
   - For merged events, **Log A’s timestamp** is prioritized for ordering (primary timeline), but **Log B’s timestamp** is preserved as an attribute.
   - Standalone events use their original timestamps.

4. **Attribute Enrichment**:
   - Merged events include all attributes from both logs (e.g., `user_id`, `notes` from B; `event_type` from A).
   - Standalone events retain their system-specific attributes (e.g., `notes` for B, no extra fields for A).

### Final Notes
- The merged log provides a unified view with enriched context from both systems.
- Events are ordered chronologically by **primary timestamp** (Log A for merged events, actual timestamp for standalone events).
- Discrepancies in timestamps or unmatched events are explicitly documented to maintain traceability.
