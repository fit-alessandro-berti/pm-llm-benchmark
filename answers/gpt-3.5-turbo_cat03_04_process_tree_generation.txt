Sure! Here is the Python code to implement a process tree for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Purchase process
purchase = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
create_purchase_order = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=purchase)
send_purchase_order = ProcessTree(label="Send Purchase Order", parent=purchase)
receive_approval = ProcessTree(label="Receive Approval", parent=purchase)
purchase.children.append(create_purchase_order)
purchase.children.append(send_purchase_order)
purchase.children.append(receive_approval)

# Payment process
payment = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
receive_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Receive Invoice", parent=payment)
review_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Review Invoice", parent=payment)
approve_payment = ProcessTree(label="Approve Payment", parent=payment)
payment.children.append(receive_invoice)
payment.children.append(review_invoice)
payment.children.append(approve_payment)

# Matching process
matching = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
match_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Match Invoice", parent=matching)
verify_matched_invoice = ProcessTree(label="Verify Matched Invoice", parent=matching)
execute_payment = ProcessTree(label="Execute Payment", parent=matching)
matching.children.append(match_invoice)
matching.children.append(verify_matched_invoice)
matching.children.append(execute_payment)

root.children.append(purchase)
root.children.append(payment)
root.children.append(matching)
```

This code creates a process tree for a Purchase-to-Pay process, with sub-processes for purchasing, payment, and matching. Each sub-process consists of multiple steps, and the overall process tree is structured using sequence operators.
