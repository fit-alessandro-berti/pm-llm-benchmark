This transformation converts the low-level system events into a structured process mining event log, where related activities are grouped into meaningful cases based on the document or task being addressed.

## Explanation of Transformation Logic

### Case Identification Strategy

The primary strategy for defining a **Case ID** was the concept of a single, coherent unit of work centered around a specific document or distinct application task. A new case is initiated when the user performs a significant context switch that opens a different file or application for a substantial purpose (e.g., switching from writing a report to handling email).

The identified cases are:

1.  **DOC-D1 (Document1 Drafting):** This case is defined by continuous work on `Document1.docx`. Critically, this case shows interruption management, as the user returns to this document after handling email, reviewing a PDF, and updating a budget spreadsheet, demonstrating a single underlying process objective (completing Document1).
2.  **EMAIL-AM (Annual Meeting Email):** A distinct short-term process focused entirely on receiving, reading, replying to, and sending an email.
3.  **REVIEW-PDF (Report Draft Review):** A focused session dedicated to reviewing and annotating the `Report_Draft.pdf`.
4.  **EXCEL-BUD (Budget Update):** A focused session dedicated to data entry and saving changes within the `Budget_2024.xlsx` file.
5.  **DOC-QR (Quarterly Report Drafting):** Focused work on `Quarterly_Report.docx`. (The brief focus at 08:59:50 was ignored as it was non-productive, immediate context switching; the actual work started at 09:07:15).

### Activity Naming Strategy

The raw actions (FOCUS, TYPING, CLICK, SCROLL) are too granular for high-level process analysis. They were aggregated and standardized based on context:

| Raw Actions & Context | Standardized Activity Name | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `FOCUS` on a document | **Start Drafting/Initiate Update** | Signals the beginning of productive work on that case. |
| Multiple consecutive `TYPING` events | **Drafting Content / Input and Edit Figures** | Groups fine-grained input into a meaningful phase of content creation or data manipulation. |
| `SAVE` | **Save Draft Progress / Save [Workbook/Document]** | A completion marker for a segment of work, important for understanding commitment points. |
| `SWITCH` followed by email actions | **Initiate Email Handling** | Marks the pivot to a communication task. |
| `CLICK` (reply, send) + `TYPING` (in email) | **Compose Reply Message / Send Email Reply** | Translates the sequence of interaction into structured steps of the email process. |
| `SCROLL` and `HIGHLIGHT` on PDF | **Review and Annotate Findings** | Aggregates navigation and marking into the single process step of "Review." |
| `CLOSE` | **Finalize and Close Document** | Marks the logical conclusion of the case/session for that specific document. |
