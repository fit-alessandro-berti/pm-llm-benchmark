To create a comprehensive event log for process mining, we'll integrate data from the provided tables. Here's the structured event log in Markdown format:

### Explanation:
1. **Identify Cases**: Each `order_id` is used as the `Case ID`.
2. **Derive Activities**: Activities are derived from the tables:
   - **Orders Table**: "Order Created".
   - **Order Lines Table**: "Items Picked".
   - **Delivery Table**: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived".
   - **Invoice Table**: "Invoice Issued".
   - **Payments Table**: "Payment Received".
3. **Map Timestamps**: Timestamps are directly taken from the respective tables.
4. **Combine Data**: Each event is linked using the `order_id`.
5. **Enrich with Resources and Attributes**: Resource information is derived from the `Resources` table.

### Assumptions:
- If multiple timestamps are available for the same activity, the first timestamp is used.
- If no resource information is available, it is left blank.
- The "Other Attributes" column includes additional relevant data such as item quantities and invoice amounts.

This structured event log can be used for process mining to analyze and visualize the order processing workflow.
