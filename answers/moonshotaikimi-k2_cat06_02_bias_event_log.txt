Bias in this process centres on the “Highland Civic Darts Club” column.

1. Concrete operational bias  
   • Every applicant who belongs to the club receives an explicit “+10 (Community)” score adjustment.  
   • No non-member receives any positive add-on; their adjustment is always 0.  

2. Resulting score gaps  
   • C001: 720 with adjustment (member)  approved  
   • C003: 715 with no adjustment, non-local, no club  rejected (the only rejection)  
   • C005: 740 with no adjustment, non-local, no club  approved because the raw score is already very high  
   • C004: raw 690  700 with adjustment  approved, whereas someone with 700 but no club membership would not receive the lift at all.

3. Conditional outcomes  
   • Two applicants who score  715 were non-members; one (C003) is rejected, one (C004, 700) is carried by the +10.  
   • No member scores below 715 because any member under the rule benefits from the added points.

4. Fairness / equity implications  
   • Disparate impact: individuals with no access to Highland Civic Darts Club (or analogous groups) may silently fail while peers with identical or lower credit strength succeed.  
   • Intersection with locality: all members shown here are also “LocalResident: TRUE.” When non-local residents attempt to join or create similar groups, they may be structurally excluded.  
   • Feedback loop: approved club members strengthen financial standing and eligibility for future club-related advantages, widening gaps with non-affiliated borrowers.  
   • Manual review by underwriters leaves the contextual +10 untouched, normalising the uplift rather than interrogating it.

5. Remedy suggestions  
   • Evaluate whether the +10 is empirically justified (strong correlation between club membership and repayment behaviour) or simply institutional preference.  
   • Look for correlated proxies such as “local residency,” “being recommended by an existing borrower,” etc., that compound the effect.  
   • Consider neutral alternatives: generic reward calibrated on documented community-service activity rather than fixed club status, scaleable such that it does not confer a guaranteed 10-point lift to exactly those with the named affiliation.
