1. In Case 1002, the activity sequence is problematic. The purchase requisition is created and purchase order is issued before the approval of the requisition. Typically, the approval process should precede the issuing of a purchase order to ensure the requested purchase is authorized. This deviation indicates a lack of control and adherence to standard approval procedures, which can lead to potential overspending or ordering of unauthorized items.

2. In Case 1003, the release of payment occurs before the goods are received, and the invoice is matched to the purchase order. This is a significant anomaly as payments should only be released after the goods have been received and verified against the purchase order and vendor invoice. Releasing payments prematurely can result in paying for goods that were not received, incorrect quantities or quality issues, leading to financial losses and potential disputes with vendors.

3. In Case 1004, the order of activities is reversed with the matching of the invoice to the purchase order happening before the issuance of the purchase order. This is highly irregular as the purchase order serves as the basis for matching incoming invoices; therefore, it should be generated before receiving the invoice. Such a deviation can cause confusion in reconciling invoices, delays in processing payments, and potential duplicate payments due to mismatched information.

Identifying and addressing these anomalies in the Procure-to-Pay process is crucial to maintain efficiency, accuracy, and financial control within an organization. Adhering to standard procedures and best practices ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with regulations and internal policies, ultimately safeguarding the organization from financial risks and operational inefficiencies.
