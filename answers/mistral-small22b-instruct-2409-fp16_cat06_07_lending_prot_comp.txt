 The primary differences between the outlined paths to loan approval or denial lie in the sequence of steps taken and the inclusion or exclusion of specific actions, such as requesting a co-signer or assessing collateral multiple times. Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:

### Key Differences:

1. **Number of Visits to Assess Collateral**:
    - Some paths include only one visit to assess collateral (e.g., the first path), while others have multiple visits (up to three).
    - Having more visits might indicate additional scrutiny or complexities in assessing the borrower's assets.

2. **Request for a Co-Signer**:
    - In some paths, a co-signer is requested early on before submitting the file to the underwriter (e.g., the second and third paths).
    - Other paths request a co-signer later in the process or not at all (e.g., the first path).

3. **Path Complexity**:
    - The sequences differ in terms of when specific actions are taken, such as visiting to assess collateral versus requesting a co-signer.
    - Some paths include additional steps like requesting a co-signer after an initial denial, which adds complexity and potentially delays the final outcome.

### Main Paths Analysis:

1. **Simple and Direct Path**:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 188, performance = 389994.777)
    ```
    - This path is straightforward and includes all necessary steps without additional complexity.

2. **Early Co-Signer Request**:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Sign Loan Agreement (frequency = 183, performance = 390000.066)
    ```
    - This path introduces an early request for a co-signer but proceeds smoothly to loan approval.

3. **Complex Path with Multiple Visits and Co-Signer Request**:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Request Co-Signer On Loan -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 58, performance = 390023.672)
    ```
    - This path includes multiple visits and requests for a co-signer, which could indicate a higher risk profile or more complex assessment needs.

4. **Path with Multiple Collateral Assessments**:
    ```plaintext
    Request Appointment -> Set Appointment -> Hand In Credit Appliaction -> Verify Borrowers Information -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Make Visit to Assess Colatteral -> Submit File to Underwriter -> Loan Denied (frequency = 23, performance = 440003.565)
    ```
    - This path indicates multiple assessments of collateral, which might suggest issues or the need for further verification.

### Performance and Frequency:
- The paths with higher frequencies generally have better performance (lower loan cost), indicating that simpler and more direct paths are often more efficient.
- Paths with lower frequency but high performance might represent edge cases or unique circumstances where additional steps were necessary but ultimately resulted in a successful loan at a low cost.

In summary, the main differences lie in the order and repetition of certain actions (like collateral assessments) and whether a co-signer is requested early or late in the process. Simpler paths generally correlate with better performance metrics.
