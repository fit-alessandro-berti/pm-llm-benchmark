To group the events into separate cases, we need to analyze the sequence of activities, timestamps, and other attributes like `patient_age`, `patient_gender`, and `department`. Each case corresponds to a distinct patient journey through the hospital process. Below is the reasoning for grouping the events:

---

### **Step 1: Identify Unique Patient Characteristics**
Each case involves a unique combination of `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. Based on this:
- **Patient 1**: Age = 45, Gender = M
- **Patient 2**: Age = 62, Gender = F
- **Patient 3**: Age = 28, Gender = M

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Activity Flow**
The logical flow of activities helps us confirm which events belong to the same case. For example:
- A "Register patient" event typically starts a case.
- Subsequent activities (e.g., triage, consultations, tests, surgeries) follow logically for the same patient.
- The case ends with a "Patient discharged" event.

---

### **Step 3: Group Events by Case**
Using the above criteria, we can group the events as follows:

#### **Case 1: Patient 1 (Age = 45, Gender = M)**
- **Event 1**: Register patient (timestamp: 08:05:13)
- **Event 4**: Initial triage (timestamp: 08:10:50)
- **Event 7**: X-ray imaging (timestamp: 08:15:42)
- **Event 12**: Doctor consultation (diagnosis: hairline fracture, timestamp: 08:23:10)
- **Event 15**: Patient discharged (followup: outpatient clinic, timestamp: 08:30:05)

#### **Case 2: Patient 2 (Age = 62, Gender = F)**
- **Event 2**: Register patient (timestamp: 08:07:02)
- **Event 5**: Initial triage (timestamp: 08:12:29)
- **Event 8**: Lab test requested (timestamp: 08:16:10)
- **Event 10**: Lab test completed (results: normal levels, timestamp: 08:20:27)
- **Event 11**: Doctor consultation (diagnosis: minor infection, timestamp: 08:22:54)
- **Event 14**: Prescription created (medication: antibiotics, timestamp: 08:27:00)
- **Event 17**: Patient discharged (followup: pharmacy pickup, timestamp: 08:35:29)

#### **Case 3: Patient 3 (Age = 28, Gender = M)**
- **Event 3**: Register patient (timestamp: 08:07:15)
- **Event 6**: Doctor consultation (reason: scheduled knee surgery, timestamp: 08:13:00)
- **Event 9**: Surgery preparation (prep type: general anesthesia, timestamp: 08:16:45)
- **Event 13**: Surgery performed (procedure: arthroscopy, timestamp: 08:25:19)
- **Event 16**: Recovery room (condition: stable, timestamp: 08:31:37)
- **Event 18**: Patient discharged (followup: physiotherapy sessions, timestamp: 08:40:13)

---

### **Final Grouping**
Here are the inferred case IDs with their respective events:

#### **Case 1 (Patient 1 - Age 45, Gender M):**
```
1, 4, 7, 12, 15
```

#### **Case 2 (Patient 2 - Age 62, Gender F):**
```
2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17
```

#### **Case 3 (Patient 3 - Age 28, Gender M):**
```
3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18
```

### **Conclusion**
By analyzing the attributes and logical flow of activities, we have successfully grouped the interleaved events into three distinct cases corresponding to three different patients. This approach ensures that each case represents a complete and coherent patient journey through the hospital process.
