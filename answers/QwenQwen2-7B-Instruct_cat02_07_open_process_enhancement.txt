Process Mining is a modern way to analyze, understand, and improve organizational processes by extracting insights from the data driven by these processes, often called event logs. It involves three main concepts: process discovery, process enhancement, and conformance checking. Let’s break down each concept and discuss how they differ:

1. **Process Discovery**:
   - Process Discovery is the process of automatically generating a process model (usually in the form of a BPMN diagram) from event logs. It captures the actual workflow activities, their sequences, and the timing (elapsed times) involved in executing the process. This model reflects how the process is executed in reality, based on historical data.
   - **Main Goal**: To visualize the 'as-is' state of the process, to identify bottlenecks, irregularities, and discrepancies from the intended process model.
   - **Method**: Algorithms such as Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), Event-driven Process Chain (EPC), or Statecharts are used to infer the process model.

2. **Conformance Checking**:
   - Conformance checking compares the actual process execution captured in the event logs with an expected process model. It quantifies how well the real process execution fits the model.
   - This method evaluates compliance, identifying cases that deviate from the expected behavior, or drifts, which indicate parts of the process that are not happening as intended.
   - **Main Goal**: To ensure that the process execution adheres to predefined rules or policies and to identify non-conformities in the process flow.
   - **Method**: Metrics such as Variant metric (showing the number of possible paths), Execution metric (comparing the percentage of events covered by the model), or Conformance metric (calculating the similarity between logs and model).

3. **Process Enhancement**:
   - Process Enhancement is a continuous and iterative process aimed at improving the process model based on insights obtained from previous analysis. It involves modifications, enhancements, or extensions to the existing model to make it more efficient and effective.
   - **Main Goal**: To optimize the process, reduce costs, minimize execution time, and improve quality by incorporating the findings from process discovery and conformance checking.
   - **Method**: This can involve adding missing activities ( gaps), removing unnecessary ones, automating repetitive tasks, or adding checks for compliance (integrity constraints). It may also involve refining the timing of activities and improving the flow of the process.
   
**Differences**:
- **Process Discovery focuses on** automatically transforming raw data into a visual representation
