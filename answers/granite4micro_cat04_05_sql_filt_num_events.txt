To accomplish the task described, we need a DuckDB SQL query that first identifies each `case_id` with its associated event count and filters out any `case_id` having more than six events. Then, it returns all events for cases that meet or fall below this threshold.

Here is how you can structure your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT case_id,
           activity,
           timestamp,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count
    FROM event_log
) AS subquery
WHERE event_count <= 6;
```

### Explanation

1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects all columns from `event_log` and adds an additional column, `event_count`, using the window function `COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id)`. This calculates the number of events for each `case_id`.

2. **Filtering in Subquery**: By applying the condition `WHERE event_count <= 6` directly within the subquery (`subquery`), we filter out any cases that exceed six events.

3. **Outer Query**: The outer query simply returns all columns from the filtered list of rows generated by the inner query, ensuring only valid cases are included in the final output.

This approach ensures that each `case_id` is correctly identified with its event count, and only those cases with six or fewer events are returned along with their full set of events.
