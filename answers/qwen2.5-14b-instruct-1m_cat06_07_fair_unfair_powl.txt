### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, after the skill assessment, there is an XOR branching. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other leads to a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" activity that provides a subtle advantage if the applicant is affiliated with a known local group.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = SilentTransition()  # Loop for missing information
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the XOR for cultural fit evaluation or community affiliation check
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the workflow
workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to define the order
workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)
workflow.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, cultural_fit_xor)
workflow.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, ManagerialReview)
workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Add loop condition
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, DataCompletenessCheck)  # Loop back to data check if more info is needed

print(workflow)
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any special community-based branch. The loop for data completeness and the sequence for skill checks are maintained, but no XOR branch providing selective advantages exists.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define individual activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = SilentTransition()  # Loop for missing information
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define the loop for data completeness
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the workflow without XOR for cultural fit evaluation
workflow = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, data_loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add edges to define the order
workflow.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, DataCompletenessCheck)
workflow.order.add_edge(DataCompletenessCheck, SkillAssessment)
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
workflow.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
workflow.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Add loop condition
workflow.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, DataCompletenessCheck)  # Loop back to data check if more info is needed

print(workflow)
```

### Summary

- **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness:** This model includes an XOR branching after the skill assessment where applicants can either go through a standard cultural fit evaluation or a "CommunityAffiliationCheck" that provides a subtle advantage to affiliated applicants.
- **POWL Model Without Unfairness:** This model ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, removing any selective advantages based on community affiliation.

These models illustrate how subtle biases can be introduced or eliminated in the hiring process through different workflow structures.
