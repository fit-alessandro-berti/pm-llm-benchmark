<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem of creating an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process. The user wants a Petri net that models the various steps with possible loops and re-submissions, and has an initial and final marking. 

First, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly. The process has eight steps: Claim Registration (CR), Document Verification (DV), Fraud Check (FC), Claim Assessment (CA), Approval (AP), Payment (P), Notification (N), and Closure (CL). But there are some exceptions. For example, if DV is incomplete, there's a Re-Document Submission (RDS) step. Similarly, if FC raises doubts, there's an In-depth Investigation (II) step that can happen multiple times.

So, the Petri net needs to represent these steps with possible loops. Let me think about how to model the loops. For instance, after DV, if documents are incomplete, the process goes back to DV with RDS. So, DV  RDS  DV again? Or maybe DV  RDS  DV  ...? Also, FC can lead to II, which might lead to II again, and then to CA. So, FC  II  II  ...  CA? Or maybe FC  II  ...  CA? Need to figure out the transitions.

Let me outline the steps and their possible transitions:

1. **CR** (Start)
2. **DV**
3. **RDS** (if needed)
4. **FC**
5. **II** (if FC is problematic)
6. **CA**
7. **AP** (if CA amount is over threshold)
8. **P**
9. **N**
10. **CL** (End)

But the initial marking is the start place, and the final is CL. Also, the initial marking has a token in the start place. The final marking has a token in CL.

Now, the Petri net places would be:

- Start (CR)
- DV
- RDS (if needed)
- FC
- II (if needed)
- CA
- AP
- P
- N
- CL

But also, the process might have loops. For example, after DV, if RDS is needed, then RDS is a place. Then, DV could be re-entered? Or maybe RDS is a place that leads back to DV? Wait, the problem says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, a re-submission happens. So, the process goes from DV to RDS, then back to DV? Or maybe RDS is a step that leads to the next DV? Hmm, the problem statement says "re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues." So after DV, if RDS is needed, the process goes to RDS, and then continues. So, perhaps DV  RDS  DV again? Or is RDS a separate step that is part of the process?

Wait, the original steps are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. So, if after DV, RDS is needed, then the process would go to RDS, then proceed. But maybe RDS is part of the process, so the sequence is DV  RDS  DV  ...? Or is RDS a separate step that can be done once? Maybe the RDS is a step that can be taken once, but if needed again, then it's a loop. So, the Petri net would have a loop between DV and RDS. But how?

Alternatively, maybe DV is a place, and RDS is a place. Then, after DV, you can go to RDS, which then leads to DV again. So, the loop is DV  RDS  DV. But that would require that after RDS, the process returns to DV. But that seems odd. Maybe the RDS is a step that is only done once. Wait, the problem says that if documents are incomplete after DV, then a re-submission occurs. So, the process would go from DV to RDS, and then after that, the process continues. So, the RDS is a step that is done once, and then the process proceeds. But if the documents are still incomplete, the process would go back to DV again. So, that would form a loop between DV and RDS. But how is that represented in the Petri net?

Alternatively, maybe after RDS, the process goes to FC. So, DV  RDS  FC. Then, FC can lead to II, which can loop. So, the structure would be:

DV  RDS  FC  II  II  ...  CA  AP  P  N  CL.

But the problem states that FC can lead to II multiple times. So, the II is a place that can be entered multiple times. So, the Petri net would have a transition from FC to II, and then II can loop back to itself, or maybe II can go to another step. But the problem says that the II can be performed multiple times before proceeding to CA. So, the II can be a place that can be entered multiple times. So, the Petri net would have a transition from FC to II, and then II can loop to itself (so, II  II), leading to multiple instances of II. Then, after that, the process would proceed to CA.

So, the steps would be:

CR  DV  RDS  FC  II  II  ...  CA  AP  P  N  CL.

But how to model the loops. For example, after DV, if RDS is needed, then the process goes to RDS, then maybe to FC. So, the loop is DV  RDS  FC  II  II  ...  CA. But the RDS is a separate step. So, the RDS is a place that can be reached once, and then the process proceeds. But if after RDS, the process is not done, then it goes back to DV. Wait, but the problem says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, a re-submission occurs. So, the process would go to RDS, and then after that, the process continues. But if the documents are still incomplete, then the process would go back to DV again. So, that would create a loop between DV and RDS. So, the Petri net would have a transition from RDS to DV, allowing the process to loop back.

But how to model that? For example, if after RDS, the process goes back to DV, then the transition from RDS to DV would be present. Then, the loop is DV  RDS  DV. But that would require that after RDS, the process goes back to DV. But in that case, the process would loop between DV and RDS. So, the Petri net would have transitions:

DV  RDS  DV.

But then, after RDS, the process goes back to DV. So, the RDS is a step that can be taken once, and then the process loops back. But how to model that. So, the Petri net would have a place for RDS, and a transition from RDS to DV. Then, the DV can have a transition to RDS. So, the loop is DV  RDS  DV.

But then, after RDS, the process proceeds to FC. So, the transitions would be:

DV  RDS  FC.

Then, FC  II  II  ...  CA. So, FC has a transition to II, and II has a transition to itself (to loop), and then eventually to CA.

So, the Petri net would have the following places:

- Start (CR)
- DV
- RDS
- FC
- II
- CA
- AP
- P
- N
- CL

But the initial marking is the start place, and the final is CL.

Now, the transitions would be:

Start  DV (CR step)

DV  RDS (if documents are incomplete)

DV  FC (if no re-submission needed)

Wait, but the problem says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, RDS is needed. So, DV can transition to RDS, or to FC? Or is RDS a separate step that is only triggered when documents are incomplete? Wait, the problem says that after DV, if documents are incomplete, then RDS occurs. So, the process can go from DV to RDS, but if the documents are complete, then it goes to FC. So, the DV has two possible transitions: one to RDS (if needed), and another to FC (if not needed). But how to model that? Maybe the DV has a transition to RDS (with a possibility of looping back), and another to FC. But since the problem says that the process can have re-submission steps, perhaps the DV can be followed by RDS, but the process can also go directly to FC. So, the Petri net would have a transition from DV to RDS, and another from DV to FC. But how to model the possibility of going back to DV after RDS? That would require a transition from RDS to DV. So, the loop is DV  RDS  DV.

Then, after DV, if RDS is not needed, the process goes to FC. So, the transitions would be:

DV  RDS (with a possibility to loop back to DV)

DV  FC (without looping back)

But how to model that in Petri net. Since the Petri net can have multiple transitions from a place, but in the case of DV, it can have two transitions: one to RDS and one to FC. But the problem says that the process can go through RDS, then back to DV, or go directly to FC. So, the Petri net would have transitions from DV to RDS and to FC.

Then, after FC, the process can go to II (if FC raises doubts). So, FC  II. Then, II can have transitions to itself (for multiple investigations), and then to CA. Then, after CA, AP (if amount exceeds threshold), then P, N, CL.

So, the transitions would be:

DV  RDS  DV (loop)

DV  FC

FC  II (if FC raises doubts)

II  II (loop)

II  CA

CA  AP (if amount is over threshold)

AP  P

P  N

N  CL

But how to model the possibility of the process looping back to DV after RDS. So, the Petri net would have a place for RDS, and a transition from RDS to DV. Then, the DV has transitions to RDS and to FC.

But how to represent the fact that after RDS, the process can loop back to DV. So, the Petri net would have a transition from RDS to DV.

So, the places would be:

Start (CR), DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL.

Transitions:

Start  DV (CR step)

DV  RDS (if documents are incomplete)

DV  FC (if documents are complete)

RDS  DV (loop back to DV)

DV  FC (if documents are complete)

FC  II (if FC raises doubts)

II  II (loop)

II  CA

CA  AP (if amount exceeds threshold)

AP  P

P  N

N  CL

But wait, the problem says that FC can lead to II multiple times. So, the II can be a place that can be entered multiple times. So, the transition from FC to II, and then from II to II, allowing for multiple instances of II. Then, after that, the process goes to CA. So, that's a loop between II and II, but after that, it proceeds to CA.

So, the transitions would be:

FC  II

II  II

II  CA

So, the Petri net would have a transition from FC to II, and then II can loop back to itself. Then, after that, it goes to CA.

Now, the initial marking is the start place, which has a token. The final marking is CL, which has a token.

Now, the code needs to create the Petri net, add all the places and transitions, and set the initial and final markings.

Let me outline the steps to code this.

First, create the Petri net. Then, add the places:

Places:

- Start (CR)
- DV
- RDS
- FC
- II
- CA
- AP
- P
- N
- CL

Then, transitions:

Start  DV

DV  RDS

DV  FC

RDS  DV

FC  II

II  II

II  CA

CA  AP

AP  P

P  N

N  CL

But wait, in the Petri net, each transition is a place. So, for each transition, we need to add the transition in the PetriNet object.

So, for example:

net.transitions.add(transition1)

But in the code, I need to create each transition.

Now, the initial marking is the start place with a token. The final marking is CL with a token.

But the problem says that the initial marking is the initial state of the Petri net, and the final is the final state. So, in the code, the initial marking is im = Marking(), and im[Start] = 1. The final marking is fm = Marking(), and fm[CL] = 1.

Now, the code steps.

First, create the Petri net.

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim")

Then, add the places:

net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="Start"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="DV"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="RDS"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="FC"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="II"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CA"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="AP"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="P"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="N"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CL"))

Wait, but the initial marking is the Start place. So, the initial marking is:

im = Marking()
im["Start"] = 1

The final marking is:

fm = Marking()
fm["CL"] = 1

But the problem says that the initial marking is the initial state of the Petri net, which is Start with a token. The final marking is CL with a token.

Now, transitions. Let's create them step by step.

First, the transitions:

Start  DV: So, add a transition from Start to DV.

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"))
Wait, the problem says that the transitions are labeled with the activity names. So, for example, the first step is CR, which is a transition. So, the transition for CR is labeled "Claim Registration".

But in the code, the transition names need to be unique. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV is labeled "Claim Registration". Similarly, the transition from DV to RDS is labeled "Re-Document Submission", etc.

Wait, the problem says that the transitions are labeled with the activity names. So, the labels are the activity names. So:

- Start  DV: Label "Claim Registration"

- DV  RDS: Label "Re-Document Submission"

- DV  FC: Label "Document Verification"

- RDS  DV: Label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)" ?

Wait, but the RDS is a step that is part of the process. So, the transition from RDS to DV would be labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? Or perhaps the label is "Re-Document Submission" but the transition is from RDS to DV. But the problem says that the label is the activity name. So, the label is the activity name, which is the step's name.

But the problem's example in the prompt has transitions labeled with the activity names. So, for example, the transition from source to execute_activity is labeled "Execute Activity".

So, in the code, each transition should have a label that's the activity name.

So, for the transitions:

Start  DV: label "Claim Registration"

DV  RDS: label "Re-Document Submission"

DV  FC: label "Document Verification"

RDS  DV: label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"

FC  II: label "Fraud Check"

II  II: label "In-depth Investigation"

II  CA: label "Claim Assessment"

CA  AP: label "Approval"

AP  P: label "Payment"

P  N: label "Notification"

N  CL: label "Closure"

But wait, the transition from RDS to DV is labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)", but the problem says that the RDS is a step that occurs when documents are incomplete. So, the transition from RDS to DV is labeled as "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? Or is the label for the transition "Re-Document Submission"? Because the transition is from RDS to DV, which is the next step.

But the problem says that the labels are the activity names. So, for example, the first activity is "Claim Registration", then "Document Verification", etc. So, the labels for the transitions would be:

- Start  DV: "Claim Registration"

- DV  RDS: "Re-Document Submission"

- DV  FC: "Document Verification"

- RDS  DV: "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"?

Wait, but the label for the transition from RDS to DV is "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? That's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the label for the transition from RDS to DV is "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

But the problem says that the transition from RDS to DV is part of the process. So, the label is the activity name. So, the activity name is "Re-Document Submission", which is the step. So, the transition from RDS to DV would be labeled "Re-Document Submission".

But that would imply that the transition from RDS to DV is labeled as "Re-Document Submission", which is the same as the transition from DV to RDS. But that's okay, because the transitions can have different labels. However, in the problem's example, the transition from source to execute_activity is labeled "Execute Activity". So, the label is the activity name. So, the label for the transition from RDS to DV is "Re-Document Submission".

But that would make the label for the transition from DV to RDS as "Re-Document Submission", and from RDS to DV as "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? That's not consistent. So, perhaps the labels should be:

- Start  DV: "Claim Registration"

- DV  RDS: "Re-Document Submission"

- RDS  DV: "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"

- DV  FC: "Document Verification"

- FC  II: "Fraud Check"

- II  II: "In-depth Investigation"

- II  CA: "Claim Assessment"

- CA  AP: "Approval"

- AP  P: "Payment"

- P  N: "Notification"

- N  CL: "Closure"

But this way, the labels for the transitions are the activity names. So, the transition from RDS to DV is labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

But this seems a bit redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the transition from DV to RDS is labeled "Re-Document Submission", and the transition from RDS to DV is labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

But that's acceptable. So, the code would have these transitions.

Now, adding the transitions to the Petri net.

For example:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
Wait, no. Wait, the transition from RDS to DV is labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

So, the code would need to create a transition for each of these. For example:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"))

Wait, but the transition from RDS to DV would be named "RDS" and labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? Or maybe the transition from RDS to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Re-Document Submission"? No, the transition from RDS to DV would be a separate transition. So, perhaps the transition from RDS to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Re-Document Submission"?

No, that's not correct. Each transition is a separate entity. For example, the transition from DV to RDS is a separate transition. The transition from RDS to DV is another transition. So, the labels are the activity names. So, the transition from RDS to DV would have a label of "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

But how to model that. Let's think again.

Each transition is a place (the source) to a destination. So, for example:

- The transition from Start to DV is labeled "Claim Registration".

- The transition from DV to RDS is labeled "Re-Document Submission".

- The transition from RDS to DV is labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

- The transition from DV to FC is labeled "Document Verification".

- The transition from FC to II is labeled "Fraud Check".

- The transition from II to II is labeled "In-depth Investigation".

- The transition from II to CA is labeled "Claim Assessment".

- The transition from CA to AP is labeled "Approval".

- The transition from AP to P is labeled "Payment".

- The transition from P to N is labeled "Notification".

- The transition from N to CL is labeled "Closure".

So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CR", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission (RDS)"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Fraud Check"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="In-depth Investigation"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"))

Wait, but the transition from RDS to DV is named "RDS" and labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? That would be incorrect. Because the transition from RDS to DV is a separate transition. So, the transition from RDS to DV would have a name that's unique. For example, the transition from RDS to DV could be named "RDS_to_DV" or something else. But the problem's example uses the transition names as the activity names. But in the example given in the prompt, the transition from source to execute_activity is labeled "Execute Activity". So, the label is the activity name, and the transition's name is the activity name. But in the example, the transition is named "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity".

So, perhaps the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. But the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Document Verification"? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the example in the prompt has the transition named "execute_activity" and the label "Execute Activity". So, the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, in the code, the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the same. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Document Verification"? That seems contradictory. Wait, the label in the example is the same as the transition's name. But in the example, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the code for the transition would be:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"))

But that's not possible because the name and the label can be different. Wait, the example in the prompt shows that the transition's name is "execute_activity" and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="execute_activity", label="Execute Activity"))

So, in this case, the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the same. So, for the transition from Start to DV, the name is "DV" and the label is "Document Verification"? That's not possible. So, maybe the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. But the label is the activity's name, which is the same as the transition's name. So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="Claim Registration"))

But then the label would be the same as the name. So, for the transition from Start to DV, the name is "Claim Registration", and the label is "Claim Registration". But that's not correct. The label should be the activity name, which is "Claim Registration".

So, the confusion here is whether the transition's name is the activity name or not. The problem's example shows that the transition's name is the activity name (e.g., "execute_activity"), and the label is the activity name (e.g., "Execute Activity"). So, the name and the label are different. Therefore, the code should have the transition's name as the activity name, and the label as the activity name. But how to do that.

Wait, in the example provided in the prompt:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils
net = PetriNet(name="example")

source = PetriNet.Place(name="source")
sink = PetriNet.Place(name="sink")
execute_activity = PetriNet.Transition(name="execute_activity", label="Execute Activity")

So, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (but with a space). So, the code should have the transition's name as the activity name, and the label as the activity name. Therefore, for the transition from Start to DV, the name is "DV" and the label is "Document Verification". But that's not correct, because the label should be the activity name, which is "Claim Registration".

Wait, the activity name is the name of the step. For example, the first step is "Claim Registration", which is the activity name. So, the transition from Start to DV should have a label of "Claim Registration", and the name of the transition could be "DV" or "Document Verification". But the problem says that the transitions are labeled with the activity names. So, the label is the activity name.

So, the code should have for the transition from Start to DV, the label is "Claim Registration", and the name could be "DV" or "Document Verification". But in the example, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (but with a space). Therefore, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="Claim Registration"))

But that's not correct. Because the label is the activity name, and the name is the activity name. So, the name is the same as the label. But the problem's example shows that the name is different. For example, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (but with a space). Therefore, the code should have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="Claim Registration"))

But that would be redundant. However, in the problem's example, the transition's name is "execute_activity" and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the code would have the transition's name as the activity name (like "execute_activity") and the label as the activity name (like "Execute Activity").

So, in the scenario, the transition from Start to DV should have the name "DV" and the label "Claim Registration"? Or the name "Claim Registration" and the label "Claim Registration"?

This is a bit confusing. To resolve this, perhaps the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV has a name of "DV" and a label of "Claim Registration". But that's not matching the example. So, perhaps the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). So, the code should have the transition's name as "Claim Registration", and the label as "Claim Registration".

But that would be redundant. However, in the example, the name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). Therefore, the code should have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="Claim Registration"))

But this would not make sense. Maybe the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). For example, the transition's name is "Claim Registration", and the label is "Claim Registration". But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. For example, the transition from Start to DV has name "DV" and label "Claim Registration". But that would not match the example. So, perhaps the label is the activity name, and the name is the activity name, but the label is the activity name with a space. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV has name "DV" and label "Document Verification".

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to create transitions with names that represent the activity name, and the labels are the activity names. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Claim Registration".

But this is conflicting with the example. However, the problem's example shows that the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Document Verification"))

But that would not match the example. Therefore, perhaps the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="Claim Registration", label="Claim Registration"))

But this is not helpful. This is getting too stuck.

Maybe I should look at the example in the problem's prompt again. The example says:

source = PetriNet.Place(name="source")
sink = PetriNet.Place(name="sink")
execute_activity = PetriNet.Transition(name="execute_activity", label="Execute Activity")

So, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). So, the code for the transition is:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="execute_activity", label="Execute Activity"))

Therefore, in our case, the transition from Start to DV should have the name "DV" and the label "Claim Registration". Or maybe the name is "Claim Registration" and the label is "Claim Registration". But that would be redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the transition from Start to DV has name "DV" and label "Claim Registration". But this is not matching the example. So, this is a problem.

Maybe the name of the transition is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, for example, the transition from Start to DV has name "DV" and label "Claim Registration". But in this case, the label is the activity name, which is "Claim Registration". So, the name is "DV", and the label is "Claim Registration".

But in the example, the name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name (with a space). Therefore, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))

But this would be correct. Because the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the transition's name is "DV", and the label is "Claim Registration".

But in this case, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. But the activity name is "Claim Registration", which is the label. So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))

But then, the transition from DV to RDS would have name "RDS" and label "Re-Document Submission".

This seems to fit the example. So, the code for the transitions would be:

- Start  DV: name "DV", label "Claim Registration"

- DV  RDS: name "RDS", label "Re-Document Submission"

- RDS  DV: name "DV", label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"?

Wait, no. The transition from RDS to DV would have name "DV" and label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"? Or the name is "DV" and the label is "Re-Document Submission"?

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best way is to create transitions with names that are the activity name, and labels that are the activity name. So, for example:

- Transition from Start to DV: name "DV", label "Claim Registration"

- Transition from DV to RDS: name "RDS", label "Re-Document Submission"

- Transition from RDS to DV: name "DV", label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)"

- Transition from DV to FC: name "FC", label "Document Verification"

- Transition from FC to II: name "II", label "Fraud Check"

- Transition from II to II: name "II", label "In-depth Investigation"

- Transition from II to CA: name "CA", label "Claim Assessment"

- Transition from CA to AP: name "AP", label "Approval"

- Transition from AP to P: name "P", label "Payment"

- Transition from P to N: name "N", label "Notification"

- Transition from N to CL: name "CL", label "Closure"

But this would mean that the label is the activity name, and the name is the activity name. So, the transition from RDS to DV has name "DV" and label "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

This seems to fit the example. So, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Re-Document Submission (RDS)"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="Fraud Check"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"))

But this is not correct because the transition from DV to RDS is named "RDS" and labeled "Re-Document Submission", and the transition from RDS to DV is named "DV" and labeled "Re-Document Submission (RDS)".

But this seems to be the way to model it.

Now, with these transitions, the Petri net would have the following structure.

Now, the places are:

- Start (CR)

- DV

- RDS

- FC

- II

- CA

- AP

- P

- N

- CL

So, the code would add these places.

Next, adding the arcs (edges) between the places and transitions.

For example:

Start  DV: arc from Start to DV.

DV  RDS: arc from DV to RDS.

DV  FC: arc from DV to FC.

RDS  DV: arc from RDS to DV.

FC  II: arc from FC to II.

II  II: arc from II to II.

II  CA: arc from II to CA.

CA  AP: arc from CA to AP.

AP  P: arc from AP to P.

P  N: arc from P to N.

N  CL: arc from N to CL.

But wait, the transition from RDS to DV is a separate arc. So, the code would add:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(source, execute_activity, net)

But in this case, the code would need to add arcs between places and transitions.

So, for example, for the arc from Start to DV:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(Start, DV, net)

Similarly, for the arc from DV to RDS:

petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV, RDS, net)

Arc from DV to FC: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(DV, FC, net)

Arc from RDS to DV: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(RDS, DV, net)

Arc from FC to II: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(FC, II, net)

Arc from II to II: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(II, II, net)

Arc from II to CA: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(II, CA, net)

Arc from CA to AP: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(CA, AP, net)

Arc from AP to P: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(AP, P, net)

Arc from P to N: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(P, N, net)

Arc from N to CL: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(N, CL, net)

But wait, the Petri net's places are the places, and the transitions are the transitions. So, the arcs are between places and transitions, or between transitions and places.

Wait, in the Petri net, the arcs are between places and transitions, or between transitions and places. So, for example, the arc from DV to RDS is from a place (DV) to a transition (RDS). So, the code would use petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(place, transition, net).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the code would add these arcs.

Now, the initial marking is im = Marking() with im[Start] = 1.

The final marking is fm = Marking() with fm[CL] = 1.

Now, putting it all together.

The code would be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim")

# Add places
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="Start"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="DV"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="RDS"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="FC"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="II"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CA"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="AP"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="P"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="N"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CL"))

# Add transitions
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Re-Document Submission (RDS)"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="Fraud Check"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"))

# Add arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("Start", "DV", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("DV", "RDS", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("DV", "FC", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("RDS", "DV", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("FC", "II", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("II", "II", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("II", "CA", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("CA", "AP", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("AP", "P", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("P", "N", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("N", "CL", net)

# Initial marking
im = Marking()
im["Start"] = 1

# Final marking
fm = Marking()
fm["CL"] = 1

# Now, the Petri net is built.

But wait, the code adds arcs between places and transitions. For example, the arc from Start to DV is from the Start place to the DV transition. But in the code, the arc is added as petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("Start", "DV", net). But the places are named as strings, and the transitions are also named as strings. So, this should work.

But in the Petri net, the places are objects, and the transitions are objects. So, the code adds the arcs between the place and the transition.

But in the code above, the places are added as PetriNet.Place objects. So, the code should be correct.

But there's a problem: in the code above, the transitions are added with names like "DV", "RDS", etc. But in the Petri net, the transitions are named as strings. So, this should be correct.

But the problem is that the code for the transitions is adding the transition's name as the same as the place name, which may not be correct. For example, the transition from DV to RDS is named "RDS", which is the same as the place name. But the label is "Re-Document Submission".

But according to the example, the transition's name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, in the code, the transition's name is "DV", and the label is "Claim Registration". But this is not matching the example. However, the example has the transition named "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name.

So, in this case, the code would have:

net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))

But this would mean that the transition's name is "DV", and the label is "Claim Registration", which is the activity name.

But in the example, the transition's name is "execute_activity", and the label is "Execute Activity". So, the name is the activity name, and the label is the activity name. So, the code is correct.

So, the code should work.

Now, testing this code would create a Petri net where:

- The Start place has a token, and the process proceeds through the transitions.

- The RDS is a place that can loop back to DV.

- The FC leads to II, which can loop to itself, leading to CA.

- The final marking is CL with a token.

Now, the code for the Petri net is written.

But there's a potential issue with the transition from DV to RDS being named "RDS" and labeled "Re-Document Submission". But in the code, the label is "Re-Document Submission".

But according to the example, the label is the activity name. So, the label should be "Re-Document Submission", which is the activity name.

So, the code should be correct.

Another thing to note: in the code, the places are added as PetriNet.Place objects, and the transitions as PetriNet.Transition objects. So, the code is correct.

Now, the final step is to write the Python code as per the user's request.

But the user wants the code to construct the Petri net, define the initial and final markings, and return the Petri net.

So, the final code would be:

from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim")

# Add places
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="Start"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="DV"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="RDS"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="FC"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="II"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CA"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="AP"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="P"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="N"))
net.places.add(PetriNet.Place(name="CL"))

# Add transitions
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Claim Registration"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="RDS", label="Re-Document Submission"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="DV", label="Re-Document Submission (RDS)"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="FC", label="Document Verification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="II", label="Fraud Check"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CA", label="Claim Assessment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="AP", label="Approval"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="P", label="Payment"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="N", label="Notification"))
net.transitions.add(PetriNet.Transition(name="CL", label="Closure"))

# Add arcs
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("Start", "DV", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("DV", "RDS", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("DV", "FC", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("RDS", "DV", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("FC", "II", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("II", "II", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("II", "CA", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("CA", "AP", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("AP", "P", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("P", "N", net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to("N", "CL", net)

# Initial marking
im = Marking()
im["Start"] = 1

# Final marking
fm = Marking()
fm["CL"] = 1

# Return the Petri net, initial and final markings
net, im, fm

But wait, the user requested to provide the Python code for constructing the Petri net using pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.PetriNet, pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj.Marking, and pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils.

So, the code as written should be correct.

But I need to check if the transitions are correctly named. For example, the transition from DV to RDS is named "RDS", and the label is "Re-Document Submission".

Yes, this should be correct.

Now, the initial marking is the Start place with a token, and the final marking is the CL place with a token.

This should meet the requirements.

Another thing to check: the Petri net is an accepting Petri net, which means that the final marking is the one that is reached when the process completes. So, the final marking is CL with a token.

Thus, the code should be correct.
</think>
To model the complex insurance claim management process as an **accepting Petri net**, we define the net to reflect the logical flow of the process, including possible **loops** such as re-submission after document verification and multiple investigations before claim assessment. The Petri net must represent the **start** and **end** states with tokens, and the **initial and final markings** must be explicitly defined.

```

---

###  **Key Features of the Petri Net**

- **Accepting Petri Net**: The final marking is `CL` with a token, indicating the process has completed successfully.
- **Initial Marking**: A single token is placed on the `Start` place to represent a new claim.
- **Loops**: The Petri net includes a loop between `DV` and `RDS`, and between `II` and itself, representing the possibility of re-submission and multiple investigations.
- **Activity Labels**: Each transition has a descriptive label, reflecting the actual step in the process.
- **Place Tokens**: Tokens in `Start` and `CL` represent the initial and final states of the system.

---

###  **Usage Notes**

- This Petri net can be used with `pm4py` tools for simulation, analysis, and validation.
- You can extend it further by adding more transitions or modifying the structure to fit specific business rules.

---

###  **Summary**

This Petri net models the entire insurance claim process, with appropriate loops and transitions to capture the complexity of the scenario. It ensures the process starts at the `Start` place and ends at the `CL` place with a token in the final state.
