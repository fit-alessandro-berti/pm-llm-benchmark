Here is an example of a DECLARE model for an hypothetic Purchase-to-Pay process:
```
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Send Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Receive Goods': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Create Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Pay Invoice': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'init': {
        'Create Purchase Order': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'response': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Create Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Create Invoice', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        ('Send Purchase Order', 'Create Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Receive Goods', 'Send Purchase Order'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Create Invoice', 'Receive Goods'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Pay Invoice', 'Create Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Create Purchase Order', 'Pay Invoice'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    }
}
```
This model specifies the following constraints:

* The activities `Create Purchase Order`, `Send Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods`, `Create Invoice`, and `Pay Invoice` must exist at least once in the process.
* The process must start with the activity `Create Purchase Order`.
* The activities must respond to each other in the following order: `Create Purchase Order` -> `Send Purchase Order` -> `Receive Goods` -> `Create Invoice` -> `Pay Invoice`.
* The activities must precede each other in the following order: `Send Purchase Order` -> `Create Purchase Order`, `Receive Goods` -> `Send Purchase Order`, `Create Invoice` -> `Receive Goods`, and `Pay Invoice` -> `Create Invoice`.
* The activities `Create Purchase Order` and `Pay Invoice` cannot co-exist in the process.

Note that the support and confidence values are set to 1.0 for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, these values would be calculated based on the actual process data.
