Unfortunately, without actual task nodes defined in the BPMN XML code provided, it's not possible to explicitly list out the individual tasks in this specific process model. However, I can explain how one might identify and extract tasks from a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram or XML definition.

A BPMN diagram is composed of several elements:

1. **Activities**: These represent actions that need to be executed as part of a process. Activities include but are not limited to:
   - Start Event, End Event: These mark the beginning and end of processes or subprocesses.
   - Task: This represents a work item that must be done by a person (human task), system, or software.
   - User Task: A specific type of task for user interaction where an individual needs to complete a process step manually.
   - Service Task: Represents service calls, typically used for integrating with external systems like databases, web services, etc.
   - Manual Task: Another human task but often emphasizing that the task might require physical handling.

2. **Gateways**: These are used to handle decision points and parallel branches:
   - Exclusive Gateway: Represents a choice where only one branch is followed.
   - Inclusive Gateway: Allows for multiple branches to be taken concurrently or in sequence (based on process definition).

3. **Flows**: They connect activities and gateways, defining the control flow of the process.

4. **Data Flows** : Represent data exchange between tasks or processes. Not mentioned in the BPMN XML you've provided.

To identify tasks:

- Look for elements within your BPMN diagram that are labeled as `task`, `userTask`, `manualTask`, etc.
- For a text-based XML, search for `<bpmn:task>` tags (or similar depending on the BPMN version being used), which contain details like name, id, and potentially other attributes to describe a task.

In your specific example, you could extract tasks by parsing through the `process` element contents, looking for any `bpmn:task` elements. However, in practice, this would typically be done with programming libraries designed to parse BPMN XML, such as those provided by Camunda's modeling tools or similar software.

As a simple Python-like pseudocode example of how you might extract tasks from this data:

```python
tasks = []
# Parse the BPMN XML document using an appropriate library like `lxml` in Python
# Here we are simulating parsing through the XML structure

for element in xml_tree.iter():
    if 'bpmn:task' in str(element.tag):
        task_id = element.get('id')
        task_name = element.find('{*}name').text if element.find('{*}name') else None
        # Other attributes like description, assignee could be accessed similarly
        
        tasks.append({
            'id': task_id,
            'name': task_name,
            # Add more attributes as needed for each task 
        })

# `tasks` list will now contain dictionaries describing the tasks in this process model.
```

Please note that this is a conceptual example and requires actual XML parsing capabilities, which cannot be demonstrated here due to text-based limitations. You would need to use an appropriate tool or library (such as Python's lxml) to actually parse the XML content from your source file.

If you have access to a diagram tool like Visio or a BPMN-specific editor that generates BPMN diagrams, it might also allow for exporting tasks in a more human-readable format if they do not require XML parsing directly.
