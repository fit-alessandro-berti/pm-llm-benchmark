Sure, let's construct a representative temporal profile for the global supply chain process. The process involves multiple steps, and we will estimate the average times and standard deviations for pairs of activities that might be separated by multiple steps.

Here is a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (3600, 1800),          # Supplier Selection to Order Placement
    ('SS', 'RC'): (86400, 14400),       # Supplier Selection to Receive Components
    ('SS', 'QI'): (97200, 16200),       # Supplier Selection to Quality Inspection
    ('SS', 'CA'): (115200, 18000),      # Supplier Selection to Component Assembly
    ('SS', 'PT'): (138240, 21600),      # Supplier Selection to Product Testing
    ('SS', 'PK'): (151200, 23400),      # Supplier Selection to Packaging
    ('SS', 'WS'): (162000, 25200),      # Supplier Selection to Warehouse Storage
    ('SS', 'DT'): (172800, 27000),      # Supplier Selection to Distribution
    ('SS', 'AS'): (183600, 28800),      # Supplier Selection to After-Sales Support
    ('OP', 'RC'): (72000, 10800),       # Order Placement to Receive Components
    ('OP', 'QI'): (82800, 12600),       # Order Placement to Quality Inspection
    ('OP', 'CA'): (100800, 14400),      # Order Placement to Component Assembly
    ('OP', 'PT'): (123840, 17280),      # Order Placement to Product Testing
    ('OP', 'PK'): (136800, 19440),      # Order Placement to Packaging
    ('OP', 'WS'): (147600, 21060),      # Order Placement to Warehouse Storage
    ('OP', 'DT'): (158400, 22860),      # Order Placement to Distribution
    ('OP', 'AS'): (169200, 24660),      # Order Placement to After-Sales Support
    ('RC', 'QI'): (10800, 3600),        # Receive Components to Quality Inspection
    ('RC', 'CA'): (28800, 5400),        # Receive Components to Component Assembly
    ('RC', 'PT'): (51840, 8640),        # Receive Components to Product Testing
    ('RC', 'PK'): (64800, 10800),       # Receive Components to Packaging
    ('RC', 'WS'): (75600, 12600),       # Receive Components to Warehouse Storage
    ('RC', 'DT'): (86400, 14400),       # Receive Components to Distribution
    ('RC', 'AS'): (97200, 16200),       # Receive Components to After-Sales Support
    ('QI', 'CA'): (18000, 4500),        # Quality Inspection to Component Assembly
    ('QI', 'PT'): (41040, 7740),        # Quality Inspection to Product Testing
    ('QI', 'PK'): (54000, 9720),        # Quality Inspection to Packaging
    ('QI', 'WS'): (64800, 11520),       # Quality Inspection to Warehouse Storage
    ('QI', 'DT'): (75600, 13320),       # Quality Inspection to Distribution
    ('QI', 'AS'): (86400, 15120),       # Quality Inspection to After-Sales Support
    ('CA', 'PT'): (23040, 5760),        # Component Assembly to Product Testing
    ('CA', 'PK'): (36000, 7200),        # Component Assembly to Packaging
    ('CA', 'WS'): (46800, 9000),        # Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage
    ('CA', 'DT'): (57600, 10800),       # Component Assembly to Distribution
    ('CA', 'AS'): (68400, 12600),       # Component Assembly to After-Sales Support
    ('PT', 'PK'): (12960, 3240),        # Product Testing to Packaging
    ('PT', 'WS'): (23760, 5940),        # Product Testing to Warehouse Storage
    ('PT', 'DT'): (34560, 7740),        # Product Testing to Distribution
    ('PT', 'AS'): (45360, 9540),        # Product Testing to After-Sales Support
    ('PK', 'WS'): (10800, 2700),        # Packaging to Warehouse Storage
    ('PK', 'DT'): (21600, 4500),        # Packaging to Distribution
    ('PK', 'AS'): (32400, 6480),        # Packaging to After-Sales Support
    ('WS', 'DT'): (10800, 2700),        # Warehouse Storage to Distribution
    ('WS', 'AS'): (21600, 4500),        # Warehouse Storage to After-Sales Support
    ('DT', 'AS'): (10800, 2700),        # Distribution to After-Sales Support
}
```

This dictionary provides an estimated temporal profile for the complex global supply chain process. The average times and standard deviations are given in seconds and are based on reasonable assumptions about the delays between activities.
