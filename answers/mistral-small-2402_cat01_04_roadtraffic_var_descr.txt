Based on the data you've provided, it appears to be a process related to the handling of fines. Here's a simplified description:

1. A fine is created.
2. The fine can be sent to the offender.
3. A fine notification can be inserted.
4. A penalty can be added to the fine.
5. The offender can make a payment or appeal the fine.
6. If the offender appeals to the prefecture, a date for the appeal can be inserted, and the appeal can be sent to the prefecture. The result of the appeal can be received, and the offender can be notified. If the appeal is rejected, the penalty can be added, and the process can continue from step 5. If the appeal is accepted, the fine may be cancelled or adjusted.
7. If the fine is not paid or appealed, it can be sent for credit collection.
8. In some cases, the appeal can be made to a judge instead of the prefecture. The process for handling this appeal is similar to the prefecture appeal.
9. There are also some variations where steps are repeated, skipped, or executed in a different order.

The frequencies and performances indicate how often each variant occurs and how long it takes on average. This information can be used for process optimization.
