Here are two **POWL models** based on the described hiring process at **GlobalTeq Solutions**, reflecting the key differences in how **cultural fit and community affiliation checks** are handled:

---

##  **POWL Model 1: With Potential Unfairness (XOR Branch for Community Affiliation)**

This model reflects the **unfair process** where applicants with local community affiliations or memberships in specific groups are given a **subjective advantage** in the cultural fit evaluation. The **XOR branch** introduces the potential for **unfair bias**.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# XOR branch for cultural fit or community check
xor_branch = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        CulturalFitCheck,
        CommunityAffiliationCheck
    ]
)

# Partial order: sequence of steps
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor_branch, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the execution order (partial order)
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_branch)
root.order.add_edge(xor_branch, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Optional: Add a skip transition to handle the XOR choice (not required but can be added)
skip = SilentTransition()
xor_branch = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[
        CulturalFitCheck,
        CommunityAffiliationCheck,
        skip
    ]
)

# Re-define the root with the updated xor branch
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, xor_branch, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_branch)
root.order.add_edge(xor_branch, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Output the model
print("POWL Model 1 (With Potential Unfairness):")
print(root)
```

###  Key Features:
- **XOR choice** after the **SkillAssessment** step.
- One branch is **CulturalFitCheck** (standard).
- The other is **CommunityAffiliationCheck** (gives a subtle advantage).
- This **XOR branch** introduces the **potential for bias** based on community affiliation or local residency.

---

##  **POWL Model 2: Without Unfairness (Uniform Cultural Fit Evaluation)**

This model removes the **XOR branch** and ensures **all applicants** go through the **same cultural fit evaluation** process. It maintains fairness by eliminating any **special treatment** based on community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities (same as before, without the CommunityAffiliationCheck)
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Partial order: sequence of steps
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Define the execution order (partial order)
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
root.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Output the model
print("POWL Model 2 (Without Unfairness):")
print(root)
```

###  Key Features:
- **No XOR branch** after the **SkillAssessment**.
- All applicants go through the **same CulturalFitCheck**.
- No **CommunityAffiliationCheck** activity is included.
- This ensures **fairness and transparency** in the cultural fit evaluation.

##  Summary

| Feature | Model 1 (With Unfairness) | Model 2 (Without Unfairness) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| XOR Branch |  Yes (CommunityAffiliationCheck) |  No |
| Fairness |  Potential for bias |  Equal treatment for all |
| Cultural Fit Evaluation |  Subjective uplift for some |  Standard, uniform |
| Data Completeness |  Loop with RequestMoreInfo |  Loop with RequestMoreInfo |
| Final Decision |  Based on Managerial Review |  Based on Managerial Review |
