1. Cases with significantly longer resolution times  
(Measure: from “Receive Ticket” to “Close Ticket”)

- **Case 101:** 2024-03-01 08:00  2024-03-01 10:15  
   **2h 15m**

- **Case 103:** 08:10  09:30 (same day)  
   **1h 20m**

- **Case 102:** 2024-03-01 08:05  2024-03-02 09:15  
   **25h 10m**

- **Case 104:** 2024-03-01 08:20  2024-03-02 08:30  
   **24h 10m**

- **Case 105:** 2024-03-01 08:25  2024-03-03 09:30  
   **49h 5m**

**Fast/“normal” cases:** 101, 103 (~1–2 hours)  
**Significantly delayed cases:** **102 (~25h), 104 (~24h), 105 (~49h)**

2. Likely root causes of performance issues

### a) Escalations to Level-2 (Cases 102 and 105)

- **Case 102**
  - Escalate: 2024-03-01 11:30  
  - Level-2 investigate: 2024-03-01 14:00  delay  **2.5 hours**
  - Investigate end  Resolve: 2024-03-01 14:00  2024-03-02 09:00  
     **19 hours** of waiting before resolution.
- **Case 105**
  - Escalate: 2024-03-01 10:00  
  - Level-2 investigate: 2024-03-02 14:00  delay  **28 hours**
  - Level-2 investigate  Resolve: 2024-03-02 14:00  2024-03-03 09:00  
     **19 hours** of waiting.

**Pattern:**  
Once a case is escalated, there are very long idle times before Level2 investigation starts and before resolution is executed. This strongly suggests:
- Limited Level2 capacity / queue backlog
- Possible workhours or handover delay (e.g., escalations near end of shift sitting until next day)
- Low prioritization of Level2 tickets

### b) Late start of initial investigation (Case 104)

- Receive  Investigate:
  - Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Investigate: 2024-03-01 13:00  **~4h 40m** delay.
- Investigate  Resolve:
  - Investigate: 13:00
  - Resolve: 2024-03-02 08:00  **~19 hours** delay.

**Pattern:**  
Even without escalation, Case 104 waits a long time before investigation and again between investigation and resolution, indicating:
- Level1 workload/scheduling issues, or
- Ticket parked (waiting for information, but process log shows no explicit “Wait for customer” activity).

### c) Large “investigate  resolve” gaps in slow cases

Compare:

- Fast cases:
  - Case 101: Investigate 09:00  Resolve 10:00  **1h**
  - Case 103: Investigate 08:45  Resolve 09:15  **30m**

- Slow cases:
  - Case 102: Investigate 14:00  Resolve next day 09:00  **~19h**
  - Case 104: Investigate 13:00  Resolve next day 08:00  **~19h**
  - Case 105: Level-2 Investigate 14:00  Resolve next day 09:00  **~19h**

The ~19hour delay appears repeatedly, which hints at:
- Workday boundaries: investigations done late in the day, but actual resolution (e.g., implementation, validation, communication) postponed to the next morning.
- Lack of clear SLA or rule to complete resolution once investigation is done.

3. How these factors drive cycle time, and recommendations

### Factor 1: Escalation to Level2 with long queues

**Impact:**  
Escalations add:
- Extra handoff steps.
- Queue time before Level2 starts work.
- Additional queue time between Level2 investigation and resolution.

**Recommendations:**
- **Separate SLA for Level2:** e.g., “Start Level2 investigation within 2 working hours of escalation.”
- **Capacity planning:** monitor volume of escalations vs. Level2 staffing; add capacity or reprioritize when queue exceeds threshold.
- **Prioritization rules:** escalated tickets should generally move to higher priority to avoid multiday delays.
- **Earlier escalation:** if Level1 cannot resolve within a short time window, escalate sooner to reduce overall time in Level1.

### Factor 2: Delayed start of investigation (particularly Level1)

**Impact:**  
Tickets like Case 104 sit in the queue for hours before investigation even begins, extending total cycle time without adding value.

**Recommendations:**
- **Queue monitoring & WIP limits:** cap the number of tickets an agent can hold “assigned” but not actively working on.
- **Triage-based prioritization:** after triage, high-impact or complex tickets should be investigated promptly (e.g., within 30–60 minutes).
- **Shift alignment:** ensure staffing matches intake peaks so tickets are not piling up waiting for available agents.

### Factor 3: Repeated next-day resolution after investigation

**Impact:**  
The systematic ~19hour gap suggests work is started, then paused until the next day. This causes:
- Artificial elongation of cycle times.
- Higher risk of context switching and rework when picking the ticket back up.

**Recommendations:**
- **“Finish what you start” policy:** if investigation is completed, try to finalize and resolve within the same shift, especially if the remaining work is communication or minor actions.
- **Clear process distinction:** if waiting is truly needed (e.g., “waiting for customer response,” “waiting for vendor fix”), introduce explicit activities so waiting time is visible and can be analyzed separately from internal delays.
- **Cutoff rules:** avoid starting investigations late in the day that cannot realistically be completed; or, if started, prioritize completing resolution before shift end.

Summary of main insights:

- **Significantly delayed cases are 102, 104, and 105.**
- Common root causes:
  - Long waits around **escalations to Level2**.
  - Slow start of **first investigation** in some cases (104).
  - Systematic nextday **delay between investigation and resolution** (~19 hours).
- Addressing these through better Level2 capacity and prioritization, stricter SLAs for investigation and resolution, and clearer handling of “waiting” states should noticeably reduce ticket resolution times.
