**Justification of Naming Choices:**

*   **Initiate Request:**  Distinguished by the initiation channel (Web or Branch) to clarify the origin of the request.
*   **Verify Documents:** Renamed to "Initial Document Verification" and "Secondary Document Verification" to differentiate between the first check and subsequent checks after additional documents were submitted or account adjustments were made.
*   **Call Customer:**  Renamed to reflect the purpose of the call: "Request Missing Documents," "Clarify Account Discrepancy," and "Request Customer Return," and "Confirm Account Adjustment."  This clarifies the different contexts of the calls.
*   **Adjust Account:** Renamed to "Adjust Account (Internal)" and "Adjust Account (Correction)" to distinguish between adjustments made after a customer call and those made due to internal errors.

By renaming the activities, the log now provides a much clearer picture of the process flow for each case, highlighting the different roles and contexts of repeated activities. This makes the log more useful for analysis and process improvement.
