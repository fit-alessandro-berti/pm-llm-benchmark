```python
temporal_profile = {
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 14400),  
    ('OP', 'RC'): (360000, 72000),  
    ('RC', 'QI'): (7200, 1800),   
    ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 3600),  
    ('CA', 'PT'): (43200, 10800), 
    ('PT', 'PK'): (7200, 1800),    
    ('PK', 'WS'): (21600, 5400),   
    ('WS', 'DT'): (360000, 72000)   
                     
}
```

**Explanation:**

This dictionary captures a subset of activity pairs within the supply chain process and their estimated temporal relationships. 

* **Pairs with Direct Connection:**  Some pairs, like (`RC`, `QI`) and (`PS`, `DT`),  reflect activities that immediately follow each other. 
* **Pairs with Indirect Connection:**  Others, like (`SS`, `OP`) or (`CA`, `PT`), represent activities that are separated by multiple steps but still occur in a typical process flow.         

**Remember:**

The numbers provided in this example are placeholders.  In a real-world scenario, you would need detailed process execution logs and statistical analysis to determine the actual average times and standard deviations for each activity pair.
