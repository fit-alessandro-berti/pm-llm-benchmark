This benchmark requires a multi-step SQL query involving window functions, string aggregation, and filtering based on the results of the aggregation.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query to achieve the desired result, with `K=3` assumed for the top variants (you can easily change this value).

```sql
-- Define a CTE to calculate the process variant (ordered activity sequence) for each case.
WITH CaseVariants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        -- 1. Determine the ordered sequence of activities for each case.
        -- We use LIST_AGG within a window function, ordered by timestamp.
        -- The separator '->' makes the sequence easy to read.
        list_agg(activity, ' -> ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp ASC) AS variant_sequence
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
),

-- Define a CTE to count the frequency of each unique variant sequence.
VariantFrequency AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence,
        count(case_id) AS variant_count,
        -- 2. Rank the variants by frequency (highest count first).
        row_number() OVER (ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC) AS rank_by_frequency
    FROM
        CaseVariants
    GROUP BY
        variant_sequence
),

-- Define a CTE to filter for the top K variants (e.g., K=3).
TopKVars AS (
    SELECT
        variant_sequence
    FROM
        VariantFrequency
    WHERE
        rank_by_frequency <= 3 -- Set K=3 here
)

-- 4. Final step: Return all events from the original log that belong ONLY to cases
-- whose variant sequence matches one of the top K variants.
SELECT
    t1.case_id,
    t1.activity,
    t1.timestamp
FROM
    event_log AS t1
INNER JOIN
    CaseVariants AS t2 ON t1.case_id = t2.case_id
INNER JOIN
    TopKVars AS t3 ON t2.variant_sequence = t3.variant_sequence
ORDER BY
    t1.case_id,
    t1.timestamp;
```
