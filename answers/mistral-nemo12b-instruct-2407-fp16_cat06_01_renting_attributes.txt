Based on the provided data and common fairness considerations in tenant screening processes, several attributes can be considered sensitive for ensuring fairness:

1. **Tenant Attributes:**
   - **Demographic Information (if available):**
     - Race or ethnicity: Directly comparing frequencies could lead to biased conclusions. For instance, if certain ethnic groups are frequently rejected or evicted, it might indicate discriminatory practices.
     - Gender: Similar to race/ethnicity, frequent differences based on gender could suggest unfairness.
   - **Income Level:** Tenants with lower incomes might face more rent-related issues (like late payments or evictions), which could indicate unfairness if the income distribution is significantly different from the broader population.
   - **Credit Score/History:** Lower credit scores can lead to rejections or extensive screenings, which might disproportionately affect certain groups.

2. **Tenant Actions:**
   - **Miss Rent Payment, Issue Warning, Accept Late Payment, Evict Tenant:** Frequent occurrences of these actions with specific tenants could suggest unfair treatment if the frequency is significantly higher than average and not justified by other factors (like tenant behavior or circumstances).

3. **Agent/Landlord Attributes:**
   - **Real Estate Agent/Landlord Identity (e.g., Real Estate Agent 1, Landlord 2):** If certain agents/landlords have much higher frequencies of rejecting tenants, evicting them, or giving warnings, it might indicate unfairness.

4. **Time-based Attributes:**
   - **Start_Timestamp and time/timestamps:** While the data spans a specific period, analyzing changes in tenant rejection, eviction, etc., over time could reveal patterns indicative of unfair practices (e.g., increased rejections during certain months or seasons).

To ensure fairness:
- Analyze these sensitive attributes independently and in combination with other factors.
- Compare results with relevant benchmarks or baselines to identify potential disparities.
- Consider other contextual information that might justify observed differences, but be cautious about overreliance on potentially biased explanations.
