Here are the two POWL models representing the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, differing in how they handle the cultural fit and affiliation check:

### 1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness
This model includes an XOR branch where applicants may receive preferential treatment based on community affiliations.

```python
# Define activities
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
standard_cultural_fit = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness check
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Create XOR for cultural fit evaluation
cultural_fit_xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[standard_cultural_fit, community_affiliation_check])

# Define the order
root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    data_loop,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_xor,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define precedence relationships
root_unfair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_xor)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_xor, managerial_review)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

### 2. POWL Model Without Unfairness
This model ensures all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process.

```python
# Define activities (same as above)
receive_application = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
data_completeness_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
request_more_info = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
cultural_fit_check = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
final_decision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Create loop for data completeness check
data_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[data_completeness_check, request_more_info])

# Define the order
root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    receive_application,
    data_loop,
    skill_assessment,
    cultural_fit_check,
    managerial_review,
    final_decision
])

# Define precedence relationships
root_fair.order.add_edge(receive_application, data_loop)
root_fair.order.add_edge(data_loop, skill_assessment)
root_fair.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_check)
root_fair.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_check, managerial_review)
root_fair.order.add_edge(managerial_review, final_decision)
```

Key differences:
1. The unfair model has an XOR operator (`cultural_fit_xor`) that branches to either standard cultural fit evaluation or community affiliation check, potentially introducing bias.
2. The fair model eliminates this XOR branch and subjects all candidates to the same `CulturalFitCheck`, ensuring fairness.

Both models maintain the same data completeness loop, skill assessment requirements, and final decision-making process, but the fair model removes the potential source of bias by not allowing differential treatment based on community affiliations.
