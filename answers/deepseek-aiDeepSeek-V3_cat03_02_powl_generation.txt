To construct the POWL model for the described scenario, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem statement. We will use the `pm4py` library to define the transitions, silent transitions, partial orders, and operator nodes for loops and exclusive choices. Below is the Python code that represents the entire scenario as a POWL model:

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Step 1: Define the initial transitions
SR = Transition(label="Service Request (SR)")
CS = Transition(label="Contract Setup (CS)")

# Step 2: Define the parallel tasks
DA = Transition(label="Datacenter Allocation (DA)")
ACI = Transition(label="Access Control Initialization (ACI)")

# Step 3: Define the looped configuration phase
BNC = Transition(label="Base Network Configuration (BNC)")
DR = Transition(label="Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)")

# Step 4: Define the exclusive choice for deployment
CD = Transition(label="Containerized Deployment (CD)")
MD = Transition(label="Monolithic Deployment (MD)")

# Step 5: Define the final tasks
QA = Transition(label="Quality Assurance (QA)")
SA = Transition(label="Security Audit (SA)")

# Step 6: Define the final approval
GLA = Transition(label="Go-Live Approval (GLA)")

# Step 7: Construct the loop between BNC and DR
loop_config = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Step 8: Construct the exclusive choice between CD and MD
deployment_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Step 9: Construct the partial order for the final tasks (QA and SA)
final_tasks = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])
final_tasks.order.add_edge(QA, GLA)
final_tasks.order.add_edge(SA, GLA)

# Step 10: Construct the partial order for the entire process
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop_config, deployment_choice, final_tasks, GLA])

# Step 11: Define the order constraints
root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
root.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
root.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_config)
root.order.add_edge(loop_config, deployment_choice)
root.order.add_edge(deployment_choice, final_tasks)
root.order.add_edge(final_tasks, GLA)

# The root POWL model now represents the entire scenario
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transitions**: We define transitions for each activity in the process, such as `Service Request (SR)`, `Contract Setup (CS)`, etc.

2. **Parallel Tasks**: `Datacenter Allocation (DA)` and `Access Control Initialization (ACI)` are defined as transitions that can be executed concurrently.

3. **Loop Configuration**: The loop between `Base Network Configuration (BNC)` and `Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)` is constructed using the `OperatorPOWL` with the `LOOP` operator.

4. **Exclusive Choice**: The choice between `Containerized Deployment (CD)` and `Monolithic Deployment (MD)` is constructed using the `OperatorPOWL` with the `XOR` operator.

5. **Final Tasks**: The partial order for `Quality Assurance (QA)` and `Security Audit (SA)` is constructed using `StrictPartialOrder`. Both tasks must complete before `Go-Live Approval (GLA)` can start.

6. **Root Partial Order**: The entire process is represented as a `StrictPartialOrder` that includes all the nodes and defines the order constraints between them.

This code faithfully represents the described scenario as a POWL model, including all the necessary transitions, silent transitions, partial orders, and operator nodes for loops and exclusive choices.
