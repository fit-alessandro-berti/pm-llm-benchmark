To identify bias in the process depicted in the event log, let’s analyze the data step-by-step, focusing on how attributes, adjustments, and decision outcomes correlate with specific applicant characteristics—namely, LocalResident status and CommunityGroup affiliation. Then, we’ll assess how these factors might influence fairness and equity, especially for individuals lacking certain affiliations or geographic traits.
Key Observations from the Event Log
Attributes and Adjustments:
LocalResident: A binary attribute (TRUE/FALSE) indicating whether the applicant is a local resident.
CommunityGroup: Indicates affiliation with a community group (e.g., "Highland Civic Darts Club" or "None").
PreliminaryScore: An initial score assigned to the applicant, presumably reflecting creditworthiness or eligibility.
ScoreAdjustment: An adjustment applied to the PreliminaryScore, with a +10 bonus explicitly tied to "Community" affiliation in some cases.
FinalDecision: The outcome (Approved/Rejected), determined after manual review and adjustments.
Patterns in Score Adjustments:
Applicants affiliated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" (Cases C001 and C004) receive a consistent +10 (Community) adjustment to their PreliminaryScore.
Applicants with no community affiliation (Cases C002, C003, C005) receive no adjustment (0), regardless of their PreliminaryScore or LocalResident status.
Decision Outcomes:
Approved Cases: C001 (720 adjusted), C002 (720), C004 (700 adjusted), C005 (740)
Rejected Case: C003 (715)
All approved cases have a final score ≥ 700, while the rejected case has a score of 715 (unadjusted).
Correlation with LocalResident and CommunityGroup:
LocalResident = TRUE: 4 cases (C001, C002, C004), all approved.
C001 and C004 (CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club) get +10 adjustments.
C002 (CommunityGroup = None) gets no adjustment but is approved with a high PreliminaryScore (720).
LocalResident = FALSE: 2 cases (C003, C005), mixed outcomes.
C003 (715, no adjustment) is rejected.
C005 (740, no adjustment) is approved.
Community affiliation only occurs among local residents and always results in a +10 boost.
Where and How Bias Manifests
Community Affiliation Adjustment (+10 Bonus):
Bias Manifestation: Applicants affiliated with the "Highland Civic Darts Club" systematically receive a +10 score boost, which is not available to those without community affiliation. This adjustment is applied during PreliminaryScoring and carried through to the final decision.
Favoritism: This favors individuals who are part of specific community groups, potentially reflecting a policy that rewards social or local engagement. For example:
C004’s PreliminaryScore of 690 becomes 700 (adjusted) and is approved.
Without the +10 adjustment, C004 would fall below the apparent approval threshold (likely around 700–715), suggesting the community bonus is decisive.
Implication: Applicants without community ties, even with similar underlying creditworthiness (e.g., PreliminaryScore close to 700), are disadvantaged. This introduces a structural bias toward those with access to or involvement in recognized groups.
LocalResident Status:
Bias Manifestation: All applicants with LocalResident = TRUE are approved (C001, C002, C004), while those with LocalResident = FALSE have mixed outcomes (C003 rejected, C005 approved). Community affiliation only appears among local residents, amplifying their advantage.
Favoritism: Local residents may benefit from both higher baseline approval rates and the potential for community adjustments. For instance:
C002 (LocalResident = TRUE, no community) is approved at 720 without adjustment.
C003 (LocalResident = FALSE, no community) is rejected at 715, despite a score only 5 points lower.
Implication: Non-residents face a higher risk of rejection unless their PreliminaryScore is exceptionally high (e.g., C005 at 740). This suggests a geographic bias that penalizes non-locals, even when their creditworthiness is comparable.
Approval Threshold Ambiguity:
Bias Manifestation: The rejection of C003 (715) and approval of C004 (700 adjusted) suggest an approval threshold between 700 and 715. However, the +10 community bonus allows some applicants (e.g., C004) to cross this threshold, while others with similar or higher PreliminaryScores (e.g., C003 at 715) do not.
Favoritism: The threshold appears inconsistently applied, favoring those who can leverage the community adjustment.
Implication: Applicants without community affiliation must rely solely on their PreliminaryScore, which may reflect creditworthiness but not additional "merit" factors like local ties. This creates an uneven playing field.
Influence on Fairness and Equity
Favoring Certain Groups:
The +10 community adjustment explicitly favors members of groups like the Highland Civic Darts Club, which may correlate with socioeconomic status, access to local networks, or cultural engagement. This rewards attributes unrelated to creditworthiness or need, skewing outcomes toward connected individuals.
Local residency also appears to confer an advantage, as all local residents are approved, potentially reflecting a policy prioritizing geographic insiders.
Disadvantage to Unaffiliated or Non-Local Applicants:
Individuals lacking community affiliation (e.g., C002, C003, C005) or local residency (e.g., C003, C005) must rely entirely on their PreliminaryScore. For example:
C003 (715, non-local, no community) is rejected, while C004 (700 adjusted, local, community) is approved, despite a lower initial score.
This suggests that a non-local, unaffiliated applicant with a score near the threshold (e.g., 690–715) is less likely to succeed than a local, affiliated peer with the same score.
Applicants without access to recognized community groups—due to location, time, or social barriers—are structurally disadvantaged, even if their underlying qualifications are strong.
Implications for Equity:
Creditworthiness Misalignment: The process introduces factors (community ties, residency) that may not align with the intended purpose (e.g., assessing financial risk). A PreliminaryScore of 715 (C003) is rejected, while 700 (C004, adjusted) is approved, suggesting bias overrides raw merit.
Systemic Exclusion: Non-locals or those outside community networks face higher hurdles, potentially exacerbating inequities for marginalized groups (e.g., newcomers, rural residents, or those unable to join clubs).
Fairness Erosion: The inconsistent application of adjustments undermines transparency and predictability, as outcomes depend on extrinsic traits rather than a uniform standard.
Conclusion
Bias manifests primarily through the +10 community adjustment and the apparent prioritization of LocalResident status, both of which favor applicants with specific affiliations or geographic ties. These mechanisms disproportionately benefit members of groups like the Highland Civic Darts Club and local residents, allowing them to overcome lower PreliminaryScores (e.g., C004 at 690 → 700) while penalizing unaffiliated or non-local applicants with similar or better scores (e.g., C003 at 715). This skews fairness by introducing non-merit-based criteria, undermining equity for individuals whose creditworthiness is comparable but lack the "right" social or geographic profile. To enhance fairness, the process could eliminate or standardize adjustments, ensuring decisions align more closely with objective measures like the PreliminaryScore.
