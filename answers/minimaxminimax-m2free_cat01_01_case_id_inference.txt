I need to identify patient cases based on events. I think about grouping events for patients with the same age and gender, like the 45-year-old male in ER, the 62-year-old female in ER, and the 28-year-old male in Surgery. 

Then, I trace specific paths. For the 28-year-old, there's a registration followed by surgery preparation and post-recovery steps, but I notice some departments and doctors are mismatched, so I must focus on consistent attributes for each patient.

For the 45-year-old male, I see the registration in the ER, followed by triage and X-ray imaging. After that, there's a consultation and discharge, so that sequence makes sense.

However, the 62-year-old female has a different path; she also registers in ER, gets triage, and a lab test is requested, but there’s a potential mismatch with Dr. Smith in the ER. It’s puzzling because earlier events for the 28-year-old male involved Dr. Lee in Surgery, indicating possible confusion in event matching. I'm trying to clarify these attributes!

I realize Dr. Lee being in both ER and Surgery might mean Dr. Lee is on call across departments, so that's plausible.

For the 62-year-old female, I see a path that includes lab testing, consultation, and discharge, which seems fine.

However, I'm questioning whether there could be any overlapping patients. Are there really three distinct cases?

I’m thinking about event 8, where Dr. Smith is in ER for the 62-year-old, but in event 7, Dr. Lee is with the 45-year-old. It looks like there are three separate cases based on unique combinations of age, gender, and department.

It seems that the surgery registration was for a scheduled knee surgery. The events show no direct triage for the surgery registration but include various activities related to that procedure.

I should group the events into three distinct cases:

- Case A: 45-year-old male ER (hairline fracture).

- Case B: 62-year-old female ER (minor infection).

- Case C: 28-year-old male Surgery (arthroscopy).

I wonder if I should label these cases based on patient characteristics, like using age and gender. Maybe something like “Case ID: 45M-ER” could work!

I need to determine how to group the events into cases based on their attributes and logical order. I should consider using a case ID like "Case 1" for clarity.

I can create three cases:

- **Case A (45M):** 45-year-old male with a hairline fracture.

- **Case B (62F):** 62-year-old female with a minor infection.

- **Case C (28M):** 28-year-old male with scheduled knee surgery.

I'll format them in a simple manner while including only the necessary details for easy grouping. This way, I can provide a clear and straightforward answer!

## Inferred case groupings

Use patient_age and patient_gender as the unique identifiers (there’s no other consistent distinguishing field), giving three distinct cases.

- Case A (45M): 1  4  7  12  15
- Case B (62F): 2  5  8  10  11  14  17
- Case C (28M): 3  6  9  13  16  18

Explanation:
- Each case starts with “Register patient” for a unique age/gender and proceeds through logically ordered activities within ER or Surgery, ending with “Patient discharged” or the surgery flow finishing with surgery/discharge.
- The timestamps support these sequences (no overlaps that require reassignment).
