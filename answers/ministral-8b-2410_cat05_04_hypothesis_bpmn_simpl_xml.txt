Explanation of Confidence Scores:
- **1-2:** Low confidence because the information is not explicitly stated or requires inference.
- **3:** Moderate confidence based on partial information or multiple possibilities.
- **4:** High confidence due to clear indications in the provided XML.
- **5:** Very high confidence as the information is explicitly stated or straightforward.
