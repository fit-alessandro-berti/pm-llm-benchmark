# DuckDB SQL Query for Filtering Event Log Based on Sequence and Timing

Here's a solution that identifies cases with the specific sequence of activities and timing condition, then excludes them from the final result:

```sql
WITH
-- First identify cases with the required sequence
sequence_cases AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        MIN(sequence_number) AS sequence_start_rowid
    FROM (
        SELECT
            case_id,
            timestamp,
            activity,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS row_num,
            LEAD(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)) OVER () AS next_row_num
        FROM (
            SELECT
                case_id,
                timestamp,
                activity,
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS sequence_number
            FROM event_log
        ) t
        WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order')
    ) t
    WHERE
        -- Check for sequence pattern
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM (
                SELECT
                    LAG(sequence_number) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY sequence_number) AS prev_seq_num,
                    sequence_number
                FROM (
                    SELECT
                        case_id,
                        activity,
                        sequence_number,
                        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY sequence_number) AS seq_index
                    FROM (
                        SELECT
                            case_id,
                            activity,
                            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS sequence_number
                        FROM event_log
                    ) t
                ) t
            ) t
            WHERE
                activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND
                LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY sequence_number) = 'Create Order' AND
                LAG(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY sequence_number) = 'Confirm Order'
        )
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Get the timing information for the second and third activities
timing_info AS (
    SELECT
        s.case_id,
        e1.timestamp AS create_order_time,
        e2.timestamp AS confirm_order_time,
        JULIANDAY(e1.timestamp) - JULIANDAY(e2.timestamp) AS days_between
    FROM sequence_cases s
    JOIN event_log e1 ON s.case_id = e1.case_id AND e1_activity = 'Create Order'
    JOIN event_log e2 ON s.case_id = e2.case_id AND e2_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    WHERE
        -- Ensure these are consecutive events in the case
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM event_log e
            WHERE
                e.case_id = s.case_id AND
                e.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND
                e.timestamp < e2.timestamp
        )
),

-- Identify cases to exclude (those with sequence and >5 days between events)
cases_to_exclude AS (
    SELECT case_id FROM timing_info
    WHERE days_between > 5
)

-- Final result: all events except those from excluded cases
SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM cases_to_exclude)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

## Explanation:

1. **Sequence Identification**:
   - First, we identify cases that contain the three required activities in order with no other events between them.
   - We use window functions to detect the pattern and ensure there are no intervening events.

2. **Timing Check**:
   - For cases with the correct sequence, we measure the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.
   - We calculate the difference in days using JULIANDAY (DuckDB's function for date arithmetic).

3. **Exclusion Logic**:
   - We create a list of cases to exclude (those with the sequence and >5 days between events).
   - The final query returns all events from cases not in this exclusion list.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The query uses window functions which are efficient in DuckDB.
   - The NOT EXISTS subquery ensures we only detect consecutive events in the sequence.
   - The final join is performed on the case_id to filter out unwanted cases.

This solution ensures we meet all requirements while maintaining good performance characteristics.
