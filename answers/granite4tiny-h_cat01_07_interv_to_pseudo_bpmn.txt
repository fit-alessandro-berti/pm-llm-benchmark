BPMN-like Process Model: Invoice Approval Workflow

StartEvent: "Invoice Received"
  -> Task: "Check for Purchase Order Number (PO)"
    - Decision: "Invoice has PO?"
      - Yes -> Task: "Log Invoice into Accounting System"
        -> Task: "Forward to Purchasing Department for Confirmation"
          - Task: "Confirm Receipt of Goods/Services"
            -> Gateways/Decision Points:
              - If confirmed, continue.
              - No confirmation (e.g., missing PO): 
                -> Sub-Process: "Resolve Missing PO"
                  Tasks: "Request Missing PO Details from Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary)"
                    -> Task: "Receive Confirmation or Escalation if Needed"
                      - Escalate to Supervisor if unresolved
      - No -> Send Invoice Back to Supplier for More Details
        -> Back to StartEvent

- Exception Paths:
  - Discrepancy in Invoice Details:
    -> Sub-Process: "Resolve Discrepancies"
      Tasks: "Clarify Pricing or Missing Items with Purchasing Team"
        - Escalate if issues persist to Supervisor
    -> Continue Normal Flow post-resolution

- Final Steps:
  - After resolution and manager approval, Task: "Schedule for Payment"
    -> Accounts Payable for payment processing.
    -> Notification of Completion sent back through workflow.

EndEvent: "Invoice Paid"

Roles/Participants:
- Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk): Initial check, logging, escalation to Purchasing or Supervisor.
- Dan (Purchasing Officer): Confirms goods/services receipt, verifies PO completeness.
- Carlos (Department Manager): Approves after confirmation from Accounts Payable/Purchasing.
- Rita (Accounts Payable Supervisor): Handles exceptions and escalations not resolved by earlier steps.
- Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager): Resolves issues between AP/APC and Suppliers regarding invoicing.

Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs:
- Invoice: Document received, checked against PO.
- Purchase Order (PO): Reference for validating invoice details.
- Accounting System: Where invoices are logged and tracked.
- Notification System: Triggers approvals/managers’ reviews.

Exceptions/Variations:
- Missing or mismatched information can cause rework loops back to Accounts Payable Clerk or Purchasing Officer.
- Escalation paths include Supervisor involvement in unresolved discrepancies.
