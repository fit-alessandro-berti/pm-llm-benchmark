**Opposite Concepts:**

* Sink Place: A place where tokens are removed from the net.
* Delayed Transition: A transition that is not immediately executable but must be triggered by an event or condition.
* Deadlock: A situation where no tokens can flow through the net due to insufficient tokens in the source places.

**General Concept:**

* Petri Net Model: A formal language for modeling and analyzing discrete-event systems. It consists of places, transitions, and arcs connecting them. Places represent storage locations for tokens, and transitions represent events that consume or produce tokens.

**Explanation:**

* **Source Place:** A place where new tokens are added to the net.
* **Immediate Transition:** A transition that can be executed immediately upon its occurrence.
* **Live Transition:** A transition that is currently executable because it has sufficient tokens in the source places.
* **Bounded Net:** A Petri net where the number of tokens in each place is bounded by a predefined limit.
* **Free Choice Net:** A Petri net where transitions can be executed in any order, without any specific constraints.

**Additional Concepts:**

* Marking: The state of a Petri net, represented by the number of tokens in each place.
* Petri Net Simulator: Software that simulates the behavior of Petri nets.
* Petri Net Analyzer: Software that analyzes the properties of Petri nets.
