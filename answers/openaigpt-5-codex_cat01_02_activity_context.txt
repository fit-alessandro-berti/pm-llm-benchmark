### 4. Justification of Renaming Choices

- **Verify Documents**  
  - *Initial Remote Review*: Used when back-office staff first assessed documents submitted digitally (C001, C002).  
  - *Supplemental Submission Review*: Reflects the second verification in C001 after the customer supplied additional documentation.  
  - *Initial In-Person Review*: Indicates a face-to-face document check at a branch (C003).  
  - *Post-Adjustment Check*: Highlights the re-verification after internal account corrections (C003).

- **Call Customer**  
  - *Request Missing Documents*: Specifies the purpose of the call in C001—collecting outstanding identification.  
  - *Clarify Account Discrepancy*: Captures the first call in C002, focused on understanding an account issue.  
  - *Confirm Account Adjustments*: Marks the second call in C002, confirming resolutions with the customer.  
  - *Resume Walk-In Process*: Describes the branch officer’s call in C003 to bring the customer back to continue the face-to-face process.

These tailored names make each repeated activity’s intent explicit, eliminating ambiguity in the process flow.
