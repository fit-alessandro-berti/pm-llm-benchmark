 Certainly! Below is a sample DECLARE model for a hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process. This model includes constraints that describe the relationships between various activities in the process.

```python
declare_model = {
    'existence': {
        'Purchase Order Creation': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Purchase Order Approval': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Goods Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Invoice Receipt': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        'Payment Processing': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'absence': {
        # No activities should be absent as they are part of the core process
    },
    'exactly_one': {
        # Each activity should occur exactly once in an ideal trace
    },
    'init': {
        'Purchase Order Creation': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'responded_existence': {
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Purchase Order Approval'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Processing'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'coexistence': {
        # No co-existence constraints defined for this example
    },
    'response': {
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Purchase Order Approval'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Processing'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'precedence': {
        # No precedence constraints defined for this example
    },
    'succession': {
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Purchase Order Approval'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Goods Receipt', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Invoice Receipt', 'Payment Processing'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'altresponse': {
        # No alternate response constraints defined for this example
    },
    'altprecedence': {
        # No alternate precedence constraints defined for this example
    },
    'altsuccession': {
        # No alternate succession constraints defined for this example
    },
    'chainresponse': {
        # No chain response constraints defined for this example
    },
    'chainprecedence': {
        # No chain precedence constraints defined for this example
    },
    'chainsuccession': {
        # No chain succession constraints defined for this example
    },
    'noncoexistence': {
        ('Purchase Order Creation', 'Goods Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0},
        ('Purchase Order Approval', 'Invoice Receipt'): {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}
    },
    'nonsuccession': {
        # No non-succession constraints defined for this example
    },
    'nonchainsuccession': {
        # No non chain succession constraints defined for this example
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Existence:** Every activity must occur at least once in the trace.
2. **Init:** The process starts with the creation of a purchase order.
3. **Response:** Certain activities must be followed by other specified activities in the future.
    - Purchase Order Creation  Purchase Order Approval
    - Goods Receipt  Invoice Receipt
    - Invoice Receipt  Payment Processing
4. **Succession:** Activities that both respond to and precede each other.
5. **Non-coexistence:** Certain pairs of activities should not occur together in the same trace.
    - Purchase Order Creation and Goods Receipt
    - Purchase Order Approval and Invoice Receipt

You can adjust this model to fit the specific needs and constraints of your actual purchase-to-pay process.
