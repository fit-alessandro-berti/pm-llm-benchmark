Let's analyze each case against the normative process description and identify any deviations.

---

## Normative summary for reference:

- Process always starts with **Receive order**.
- Then **Check inventory** must happen **before** authorizing payment or any fulfillment steps.
- If inventory **sufficient**:
  - Order flow: Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order
- If inventory **insufficient**:
  - Order flow: Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order
- Key constraints:
  - "Authorize payment" only after "Check inventory" and before "Package items".
  - "Package items" only after "Authorize payment" and before "Ship order".
  - "Ship order" only after "Package items" and **never after cancellation**.
  - "Close order" is always last.
- Deviations include:
  - Authorize payment before checking inventory.
  - Package before authorization.
  - Ship after cancellation.
  - Any fulfillment steps (Authorize, Package, Ship) after cancellation.
  - Incorrect final activity order.

# Case-by-case analysis:

### Case 1

| Activity           | Order Validity                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Receive order      | Correct start                         |
| Check inventory    | Correct after receive                 |
| Authorize payment  | Correct, after check inventory        |
| Package items      | Correct, after authorization          |
| Ship order         | Correct, after packaging              |
| Close order        | Correct final step                    |

**Conclusion**: Case 1 follows the full fulfillment sequence exactly as expected. No violations.

### Case 2

| Activity           | Order Validity                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Receive order      | Correct start                         |
| Check inventory    | Correct after receive                 |
| Package items      | **Violation:** Packaging before authorization |
| Authorize payment  | Payment authorized after packaging, violating expected ordering |
| Ship order         | Occurs after package, correct positioning |
| Close order        | Correct final step                    |

**Violation**: "Package items" occurs before "Authorize payment". According to the normative description, payment authorization must come before packaging because packaging depends on payment confirmation.

### Case 3

| Activity           | Order Validity                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Receive order      | Correct start                         |
| Check inventory    | Correct after receive                 |
| Authorize payment  | Correct after check inventory         |
| Cancel order       | **Violation:** Cancel order after payment authorization in an inventory sufficient scenario |
| Ship order         | **Violation:** Shipping after cancellation |
| Close order        | Correct final step                    |

**Violation**: 
- The normative description implies two separate branches after checking inventory: either authorize payment (inventory sufficient) OR cancel order (inventory insufficient).
- Here, after authorizing payment, the process cancels order. This breaks the assumption that cancel means insufficient inventory—canceling after payment authorization is unusual and contradictory.
- Shipping occurs after cancellation, which is explicitly forbidden ("Ship order" should never occur after cancellation).

### Case 4

| Activity           | Order Validity                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Receive order      | Correct start                         |
| Check inventory    | Correct after receive                 |
| Cancel order       | Correct cancellation branch           |
| Close order        | Correct final step                    |

**Conclusion**: Case 4 follows the cancellation scenario exactly—no violations.

---

### Case 5

| Activity           | Order Validity                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Receive order      | Correct start                         |
| Check inventory    | Correct after receive                 |
| Authorize payment  | Correct after inventory check         |
| Ship order         | **Violation:** Shipped before packaging |
| Close order        | Correct final step                    |

**Violation**:
- Missing "Package items" activity before shipping.
- "Ship order" must come after "Package items", but no packaging was done.
- Packaging is not optional before shipping.

# Summary of violations:

| Case ID | Violations Summary                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | None                                                               |
| 2       | Packaging before payment authorization (wrong order of steps)     |
| 3       | Cancel order after payment authorization (contradicts branch logic)<br> Shipping after cancellation (explicitly forbidden) |
| 4       | None                                                               |
| 5       | Shipping before packaging (missing required packaging step)       |

# Final Answer:

**Violating Cases:**

- **Case 2**: Violates process ordering by performing "Package items" before "Authorize payment". According to the rules, payment must be authorized before packaging.

- **Case 3**: Violates the normative process in two ways:
  - Cancels order after authorizing payment, which contradicts the branch logic where cancellation follows insufficient inventory detection (before any fulfillment steps).
  - Ships order after cancellation, which is explicitly disallowed.

- **Case 5**: Violates the required sequence by skipping "Package items" before shipping. Shipping without packaging goes against the defined process flow.

**Cases 1 and 4** follow the normative process and thus do not contain any violations.
