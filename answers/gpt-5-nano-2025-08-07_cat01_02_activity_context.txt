Here is a revised event log where recurring activities are renamed to reflect their specific context within each case. Non-recurring activities are kept as-is.

Brief justification of naming choices

- Verify Documents
  - Initial vs Recheck vs Physical: The same activity name occurs multiple times, but its meaning changes based on the moment in the process.
  - C001 09:20 is an initial identity check by the back office.
  - C001 10:30 is a recheck after the ID scan was submitted.
  - C002 08:15 is an initial identity verification (pre-ID scan context).
  - C003 11:25 is a physical ID verification conducted in-branch.
  - C003 12:20 is a re-verification after an internal adjustment.
  - Renaming to “Verify Documents - [Context]” makes the purpose and timing explicit.
- Call Customer
  - The purpose of each call differs (requesting missing docs, clarifying discrepancies, confirming changes, requesting return).
  - Renamed to reflect the call’s goal: “Request Missing Documents,” “Clarify Account Discrepancy,” “Confirm Adjustments,” “Request Return.”
- Adjust Account
  - Occurrences occur in different contexts (post-call corrections vs. corrections after missing information).
  - Renamed to reflect the reason for correction: “Internal Correction after Call” (discrepancy context) and “Internal Correction for Missing Information” (missing data context).
- Submit Additional
  - This entry is specifically about uploading the requested ID scan; renamed to clarify it is “Upload ID Scan” as part of submitting additional documentation.
- Approve Request
  - Final approvals occur in all cases; clarified with “Final Approval” to emphasize its role as the conclusive step.
