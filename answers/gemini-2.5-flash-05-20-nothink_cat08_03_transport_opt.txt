As a Process Mining Consultant, I would approach Speedy Parcels' challenges with a comprehensive strategy, leveraging their rich event data to drive significant improvements in delivery punctuality and operational efficiency.

## Speedy Parcels: Process Mining for Last-Mile Delivery Optimization

### 1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking

**Data Preprocessing and Integration:**

The diverse data sources (GPS, scanner, dispatch, maintenance) offer a powerful, holistic view but require careful integration.

*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Heterogeneous Granularity:** GPS data is very granular (frequent timestamps), while scanner data is event-driven (discrete milestones). Dispatch data is static planning. Maintenance logs are sporadic.
    *   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Ensuring all timestamps refer to the same timezone and are consistent across systems is crucial.
    *   **Case ID Definition:** The proposed `Vehicle-Day` (e.g., `V12-20241205`) is an excellent choice for a case ID, representing a full delivery shift. For package-level analysis, a `Package-DeliveryAttempt` case ID could also be defined.
    *   **Activity/Event Abstraction:** Raw GPS data (e.g., location coordinates, speed) needs to be abstracted into meaningful activities like "Traveling," "Idle (Traffic)," "Idle (Service Stop)," "Unplanned Stop." This could involve geo-fencing (e.g., around depots, customer locations) and speed thresholds.
    *   **Missing Data/Inconsistencies:** Gaps in GPS signal, scanner battery issues, or manual data entry errors in maintenance logs need to be handled (e.g., imputation, flag for review).

*   **Integration Steps:**
    1.  **Standardize Timestamps:** Convert all timestamps to a common format and timezone.
    2.  **Define Case IDs:** Primarily `Vehicle-Day` for overall route analysis. For specific delivery issues, `Package-ID` could be a secondary case ID.
    3.  **Map Event Types & Activities:** Create a master list of activities.
        *   **Vehicle GPS:** `Depart Depot`, `Traveling`, `Low Speed Detected (Traffic/Congestion)`, `Arrive Location (Inferred from GPS/Speed)`, `Idle (Unplanned)`, `Arrive Depot`.
        *   **Driver Handheld Scanners:** `Scan at Depot`, `Arrive Customer`, `Delivery Success`, `Delivery Failed (Attempted)`, `Depart Customer`.
        *   **Dispatch System:** `Route Assigned`, `Planned Stop (Customer)`, `Planned Delivery Window`. These are *attributes* of the case or *reference data* for conformance, rather than discrete events, but can be translated into "planned" events for conformance.
        *   **Maintenance Logs:** `Maintenance Start (Scheduled)`, `Maintenance End (Scheduled)`, `Repair Start (Unscheduled)`, `Repair End (Unscheduled)`.
    4.  **Enrich Events:** Merge data based on `Vehicle ID`, `Timestamp`, and `Package ID`. For instance, GPS data showing `Arrive Customer` can be linked to the scanner's `Arrive Customer` event, potentially adding precise location or speed at arrival. Dispatch data (planned route, capacity) can be attached as case attributes.
    5.  **Create Event Log:** A flat file (CSV) or database table with columns like `Case ID`, `Activity`, `Timestamp`, `Resource (Driver ID, Vehicle ID)`, and relevant attributes (`Package ID`, `Location`, `Speed`, `Notes`, `Planned Stop Order`, `Customer Delivery Window`).

**Process Discovery:**

Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., Alpha Miner, Heuristic Miner, Inductive Miner) on the integrated event log would visualize the *actual* end-to-end delivery process.

*   **Visualization:** The models would show the typical sequence of activities: `Start Shift` -> `Route Assigned` -> `Depart Depot` -> `Traveling` -> `Arrive Customer` -> (`Delivery Success` / `Delivery Failed`) -> `Depart Customer` -> ... -> `Arrive Depot` -> `End Shift`.
*   **Key Insights:**
    *   **Frequent Paths:** Identify the most common sequences of activities, highlighting the standard flow.
    *   **Deviations:** Reveal less frequent but significant paths, such as `Unscheduled Stop` (e.g., for ad-hoc breaks, vehicle issues), `Delivery Failed` leading to `Re-attempt` later, or `Maintenance During Shift`.
    *   **Loops:** Show activities that repeat, like `Traveling` between customer stops or multiple `Delivery Failed` attempts on the same package.
    *   **Bottleneck Visualizations:** Depending on the tool, thicker arrows might indicate higher frequency, and longer arrows/nodes might represent longer durations, hinting at potential bottlenecks.

**Conformance Checking:**

This involves comparing the discovered process model against the *planned* routes from the dispatch system. The dispatch data effectively defines the "normative" or "ideal" process for each vehicle's day.

*   **Planned Process Model:** Create a reference model from the dispatch system, outlining the planned sequence of customer stops for each route. This requires mapping "planned stop sequence" from dispatch to "actual arrival at customer" events.
*   **Deviations to Look For:**
    *   **Sequence Deviations:**
        *   **Skipped Stops:** A planned stop was never visited.
        *   **Reordered Stops:** The actual sequence of deliveries differs significantly from the planned sequence (e.g., driver improvising).
        *   **Unplanned Stops:** `Unscheduled Stop` events (identified from GPS data showing prolonged idleness not at a customer or depot) that are not part of the dispatch plan.
    *   **Timing Differences:**
        *   **Early/Late Arrivals at Customer:** Comparison of `Arrive Customer` timestamp vs. `Customer Requested Delivery Time Window`.
        *   **Excessive Travel Time:** Actual `Depart Customer` to `Arrive Customer` travel time compared to planned travel time between stops.
        *   **Extended Service Time:** `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` duration exceeding a defined threshold or planned service time.
    *   **Resource Deviations:** Cases where a different driver or vehicle than planned handled a route (less common but possible).
    *   **Frequency Discrepancies:** Number of `Delivery Failed` attempts vs. planned single attempts.

### 2. Performance Analysis and Bottleneck Identification

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

*   **On-Time Delivery Rate:** `(Number of deliveries within customer requested time window) / (Total deliveries)`. Derived from `Delivery Success` events and linked dispatch `Customer Delivery Window`.
*   **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Service Time):** `Avg(Timestamp 'Depart Customer' - Timestamp 'Arrive Customer')`. Calculated per stop from scanner data.
*   **Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** `Total Travel Time / Total Service Time` per vehicle-day. `Travel Time` is `Timestamp 'Arrive Customer'` - `Timestamp 'Depart Customer'` for inter-stop travel, or `Timestamp 'Arrive Depot'` - `Timestamp 'Depart Customer'` for final leg. `Service Time` is defined above.
*   **Fuel Consumption per km/package:** (Requires integration with actual fuel purchase data or estimates from vehicle telematics not in the log, but can be approximated by `Distance Traveled` from GPS).
*   **Vehicle Utilization Rate:** `(Total active driving/service time) / (Total shift duration)`. Active time excludes idle time at depot, long breaks, or maintenance.
*   **Frequency/Duration of Traffic Delays:** Number/duration of `Low Speed Detected` events (when not at a stop) during peak traffic hours.
*   **Rate of Failed Deliveries:** `(Number of 'Delivery Failed' events) / (Total attempted deliveries)`.
*   **Time at Depot (Pre-route / Post-route):** `Timestamp 'Depart Depot' - Timestamp 'Start Shift'` and `Timestamp 'End Shift' - Timestamp 'Arrive Depot'`.

**Bottleneck Identification Techniques:**

*   **Process Performance Dashboards:** Visualize KPIs over time, by driver, by route, by vehicle, and by time of day. This immediately highlights where performance deviates.
*   **Activity Duration Analysis:**
    *   **Bottlenecks:** Examine the distribution of durations for specific activities. Long-tail distributions or high average durations for activities like `Traveling`, `Arrive Customer` to `Delivery Success` (service time), or `Unscheduled Stop` indicate bottlenecks.
    *   **Example:** Analyzing `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` durations for different drivers or areas can pinpoint where service time is excessive.
*   **Resource Analysis (Driver/Vehicle Performance):**
    *   **Comparison:** Compare KPIs across different drivers and vehicles. Are certain drivers consistently late? Do specific vehicles experience more `Unscheduled Stop` events?
    *   **Example:** If Driver A has an average service time of 5 minutes, but Driver B has 10 minutes, Driver B's process might be a bottleneck.
*   **Variant Analysis:**
    *   **Inefficient Paths:** Identify process variants that are associated with poor performance (e.g., routes with frequent `Delivery Failed` attempts, routes with multiple `Unscheduled Stop` events).
    *   **Example:** A variant including `Low Speed Detected` followed by `Delivery Failed` indicates a potential issue with congestion impacting delivery attempts.
*   **Throughput Time Analysis:** Analyze the total time from `Depart Depot` to `Arrive Depot`. Decompose this into value-adding (travel, service) and non-value-adding (idle, unplanned stops, maintenance) time.
*   **Root Cause Linkage:** Use the analysis results to hypothesize on causes. For instance, if `Low Speed Detected` is a frequent bottleneck before `Late Delivery`, traffic is a strong candidate. If `Service Time` is highly variable, driver efficiency or customer interaction might be the cause.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis for Inefficiencies

Beyond `where` delays and high costs occur, process mining helps infer `why`.

*   **Suboptimal Route Planning (Static vs. Dynamic):**
    *   **Analysis:** Conformance checking reveals deviations from the planned route. If drivers consistently reorder stops or take significantly different paths, it suggests the static plan isn't optimal for real-world conditions (e.g., traffic, parking, dynamic customer availability).
    *   **Validation:** Compare "actual travel distance" (from GPS) to "planned travel distance" for the same route. Higher deviations indicate poor planning.
*   **Inaccurate Travel Time Estimations:**
    *   **Analysis:** Compare `Actual Travel Time` between stops (derived from GPS `Depart Customer` to `Arrive Customer`) with `Planned Travel Time` from the dispatch system. Significant, systematic discrepancies (e.g., always longer than planned in certain areas/times) point to outdated or inaccurate estimations.
    *   **Validation:** Correlate `Actual Travel Time` with `Time of Day` and `Location` (urban density, specific road segments).
*   **Impact of Traffic Congestion Patterns:**
    *   **Analysis:** Correlate `Low Speed Detected` events and their durations with GPS coordinates and `Time of Day`. Overlays on a map will show traffic hotspots.
    *   **Validation:** Examine the sequence of events: `Traveling` -> `Low Speed Detected` (prolonged) -> `Arrive Customer` (late). This directly links congestion to lateness.
*   **High Variability in Service Time at Customer Locations:**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the variance of `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` duration. High variance suggests inconsistency.
    *   **Validation:** Drill down by driver, by customer type (residential vs. commercial), or by package type. Are drivers spending more time on certain types of deliveries (e.g., requiring signature, multiple packages, complex building access)?
*   **Frequency and Impact of Vehicle Breakdowns or Maintenance Needs During Shifts:**
    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the frequency and duration of `Unscheduled Stop` events, especially those followed or preceded by maintenance log entries (`Repair Start (Unscheduled)`). Map these occurrences to vehicle ID.
    *   **Validation:** Correlate vehicle age/mileage from maintenance logs with frequency of in-shift unscheduled stops.
*   **Driver Behavior or Skill Differences:**
    *   **Analysis:** Compare KPIs (On-Time Rate, Service Time, Travel Speed) across different drivers. Use variant analysis to see if specific drivers follow "inefficient" paths or frequently deviate.
    *   **Validation:** Identify drivers with consistently higher `Idle (Unplanned)` times or more frequent `Delivery Failed` events.
*   **Issues Related to Failed Delivery Attempts (Requiring Re-delivery):**
    *   **Analysis:** Trace paths involving `Delivery Failed`. What was the subsequent activity? `Re-attempt on Same Day`? `Return to Depot`? `Scheduled for Next Day`?
    *   **Validation:** Analyze the `Notes` field for `Delivery Failed` events (e.g., `Customer Not Home`, `Incorrect Address`, `Access Issues`). Quantify the financial and time cost of re-delivery.

### 4. Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Here are three concrete, data-driven optimization strategies:

**Strategy 1: Dynamic Route Optimization with Real-time Traffic and Service Time Insights**

*   **Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** Suboptimal route planning, inaccurate travel time estimations, and the impact of traffic congestion.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Static route plans fail to adapt to real-time conditions (traffic, unexpected delays, customer availability).
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   **Actual Travel Times:** Process mining provides highly accurate, historical travel times between any two points, segmented by time of day and day of week, based on `Traveling` and `Low Speed Detected` events. This is superior to generic map APIs.
    *   **Traffic Hotspots:** Identification of specific road segments and times of day where `Low Speed Detected` events are frequent and prolonged.
    *   **Service Time Variability:** Insights into the typical duration of `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` for different customer types/locations, allowing for more realistic scheduling buffers.
    *   **Conformance Violations:** Quantifies the frequency of planned route deviations by drivers, indicating areas where dynamic adjustments are already being made manually (and could be automated).
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **Improved On-Time Delivery Rate:** By avoiding congestion and leveraging accurate travel/service times.
    *   **Reduced Fuel Consumption:** Shorter, more efficient routes mean less distance traveled and less idling in traffic.
    *   **Lower Travel Time vs. Service Time Ratio:** More efficient movement between stops.
    *   **Increased Vehicle Utilization:** Less time wasted in traffic, more time for actual deliveries.

**Strategy 2: Proactive Predictive Maintenance based on Vehicle Usage Patterns**

*   **Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** Unscheduled vehicle stops/breakdowns during shifts, leading to significant delays and re-delivery costs.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Reactive maintenance; lack of foresight into vehicle wear and tear patterns.
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   **Unscheduled Stop Analysis:** Identify specific vehicles and conditions (e.g., after X hours of continuous driving, or Y total km) that frequently lead to `Unscheduled Stop` events (especially those with `Engine Warning Light` notes or linked to `Repair Start (Unscheduled)`).
    *   **Correlation with Usage:** Correlate `Vehicle ID` with its `Total Distance Traveled` (from GPS), `Total Engine On Time`, and frequency of `Unscheduled Stop` events or `Maintenance Log` entries.
    *   **Preventative vs. Reactive:** Contrast the process flows for vehicles undergoing `Scheduled Maintenance` vs. those experiencing `Unscheduled Repair`.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **Improved On-Time Delivery Rate:** Fewer in-shift breakdowns mean fewer disrupted routes.
    *   **Reduced Operational Costs:** Proactive maintenance is generally cheaper than emergency repairs, and avoids the costs associated with delayed/failed deliveries.
    *   **Increased Vehicle Utilization:** Less downtime for unscheduled repairs.
    *   **Improved Driver Morale:** Drivers aren't stranded or dealing with vehicle issues.

**Strategy 3: Targeted Driver Training and Feedback System for Service Time Optimization & Failed Delivery Reduction**

*   **Inefficiency/Bottleneck Targeted:** High variability in service time at customer locations, and a high rate of failed deliveries.
*   **Underlying Root Cause:** Inconsistent driver behavior, lack of optimal customer interaction strategies, or insufficient preparation for delivery challenges (e.g., access, parking).
*   **Process Mining Support:**
    *   **Driver-Specific KPIs:** Identify drivers with consistently higher `Average Time per Delivery Stop` or `Rate of Failed Deliveries`.
    *   **Service Time Breakdown:** Further analyze the `Arrive Customer` to `Depart Customer` interval by observing GPS movements (e.g., prolonged idle time after arrival, suggesting time spent looking for parking or dealing with customer issues).
    *   **Failed Delivery Root Causes:** Analyze `Notes` field for `Delivery Failed` events to categorize reasons (e.g., `Customer Not Home`, `Access Issues`, `No Parking`). Correlate these with specific drivers or areas.
    *   **Best Practice Identification:** Identify "exemplar" drivers whose performance metrics are consistently high. Analyze their typical process variants to uncover efficient practices.
*   **Expected Impacts on KPIs:**
    *   **Reduced Average Time per Delivery Stop:** Faster, more efficient interactions.
    *   **Lower Rate of Failed Deliveries:** Improved strategies for customer contact, access, and alternative delivery options.
    *   **Improved On-Time Delivery Rate:** By reducing variability and failed attempts.
    *   **Increased Deliveries per Shift:** More efficiency allows for more successful deliveries.

### 5. Considering Operational Constraints and Monitoring

**Accounting for Operational Constraints:**

Any optimization strategy must consider the real-world limitations:

*   **Driver Working Hours & Breaks:** Ensure optimized routes and schedules respect legal driving limits and required break times. Process mining can highlight if current practices already violate these or if optimizations create new pressures.
*   **Vehicle Capacities:** Route optimization algorithms must be fed with vehicle capacity data and package dimensions/weights from the dispatch system. The process analysis can confirm if vehicles are consistently under- or over-utilized.
*   **Customer Time Windows:** This is a primary constraint. The goal of optimization is to *meet* these, not bypass them. Conformance checking will highlight failures here. Dynamic routing must prioritize deliveries within narrow time windows.
*   **Traffic Laws & Local Regulations:** Routes must be legal and safe. GPS data showing speed violations could be flagged.
*   **Depot Operating Hours:** Drivers must return within depot hours.

**Continuous Monitoring using Process Mining Dashboards:**

After implementing changes, continuous monitoring is critical to assess effectiveness and identify new issues. A real-time or near real-time process mining dashboard would be invaluable.

*   **Key Metrics to Track:**
    *   **Daily/Weekly On-Time Delivery Rate:** Overall and drill-down by driver/route. Immediate indicator of success.
    *   **Average Time per Delivery Stop (Trend):** Monitor if service times are consistently reducing as desired.
    *   **Travel Time Variance:** Observe if travel times are becoming more predictable and closer to planned.
    *   **Fuel Consumption per Package/Km:** Track cost efficiency.
    *   **Frequency of Unplanned Stops:** Monitor if proactive maintenance reduces in-shift breakdowns.
    *   **Rate of Failed Deliveries & Reasons:** Track if training and improved processes reduce these.
    *   **Conformance Deviations:** Percentage of routes following the planned sequence and meeting time expectations. Any significant increase in deviations could signal new problems or a need for re-optimization.
*   **Process Views to Track:**
    *   **Live Process Map Overlay:** A simplified process map showing the current flow of activities, perhaps highlighting active cases (vehicles) and their current state (e.g., "Traveling to Stop X," "At Customer Y").
    *   **Bottleneck Hotspots:** Heatmaps on a geographical representation showing areas of frequent `Low Speed Detected` or `Unscheduled Stop` events.
    *   **Performance Funnels:** Visualize the flow of packages through different stages (e.g., `Depart Depot` -> `Arrive Customer` -> `Delivery Success`) and identify where drop-offs occur.
    *   **Driver/Vehicle Performance Leaderboards:** Compare key KPIs across resources to identify top performers and those needing support.

This structured approach, driven by detailed event data and the analytical power of process mining, will enable Speedy Parcels to transform its last-mile delivery operations, moving from reactive problem-solving to proactive, data-driven optimization.
