<think>We are asked: "Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log` with at least the following columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. We need to write a DuckDB SQL query that identifies any case (case_id) that contains three activities in direct succession:
- 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
- 'Create Order'
- 'Confirm Order'

These events must appear in this exact order, with no other event from the same case in between them.

2. Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine selection to only those where time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. After identifying such cases, exclude them from final result. Return events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and timing condition.

We need a query that returns all events from event_log except events whose case_id meets above criteria.

So idea: Write a query which uses window functions maybe to detect these sequences or join with itself.
Plan:
- Identify cases that match the pattern. But we have two conditions: a) The three events in order, and b) time between "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" is > 5 days. Then exclude those case_ids from final result.

We need to find sequence of three consecutive rows per case sorted by timestamp (or maybe not timestamp but if they are sequential events then ordering by event id or simply use row_number with partitioning by case_id and sorting by timestamp). But we must check "direct succession", i.e. no other event in between them from the same case, meaning that the sequence should be contiguous.

Approach: We can compute lag and lead functions for each event. Then if activity is 'Create Order', then we want next event to have activity 'Confirm Order' after previous events? But careful condition: "Approve Purchase Requisition" must come immediately before "Create Order", which in turn must be immediately followed by "Confirm Order". So it's a chain of three rows.

Thus, one way is: for each row that has "Create Order", check if the previous event (lag) equals 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the next event (lead) equals 'Confirm Order'. But wait careful: We want "Approve Purchase Requisition" immediately preceding "Create Order". And then "Confirm Order" immediately following "Create Order". So we can use lag over partition by case_id order by timestamp to check if previous event is "Approve Purchase Requisition", and lead for next event equals 'Confirm Order'. But then we must consider the timing difference between "Create Order" event's timestamp and its "Confirm Order" event. And condition: The time difference should be > 5 days, i.e. confirm_date - create_order_timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'? However, note that if using DuckDB, date arithmetic is supported.

We can compute lead as well. But careful: We have to check ordering by case_id and timestamp ascending.

Let's consider a query subquery like:
WITH sequence AS (
   SELECT
       case_id,
       activity,
       timestamp,
       LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
       LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
       timestamp AS create_timestamp,
       LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_timestamp
   FROM event_log
)

But then we want to filter only rows where activity = 'Create Order' and prev_activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', and next_activity is 'Confirm Order'. But note: The sequence must be contiguous in the entire table. But if a row has "Create Order", then its previous row's timestamp is automatically computed as lag (if it exists). That is valid only if they are consecutive.

We need to check that the time difference between create_timestamp and confirm_timestamp is more than 5 days.
Then we want to compute a distinct list of case_ids that meet this condition. But careful: The specification said "Identify any case that contains sequence." And then among those, further refine selection to only those where time elapsed > 5 days. So if the same case has multiple sequences? Possibly more than one occurrence in same case maybe we consider them as separate events? But likely the question is simply "if a given case ever shows this pattern (which might happen repeatedly) and the event difference condition holds, then exclude that entire case's events."

So final query: Exclude any rows whose case_id appears in the list of problematic cases.

Thus steps:
Step 1: Identify all problematic cases. We can do with subquery:

SELECT DISTINCT
   case_id
FROM (
   SELECT
       case_id,
       activity,
       LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
       LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
       timestamp as create_time,
       LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time
   FROM event_log
)
WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
AND (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

But careful: We must check that lead timestamp exists. But if not exist, then next_event is null, so condition won't be satisfied.

Then exclude those case_ids from event_log.
So final query:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM ( ... ) subquery...
)

But note: There might be a need for explicit type conversions if necessary. But we assume standard SQL.

In DuckDB, the syntax is similar to standard SQL and supports "INTERVAL '5 days'" or "interval '5' day"? Let me check: I think it's likely that interval literal in DuckDB is supported with double quotes? However, since this is a query prompt, we can use it as "INTERVAL '5 days'" because the original specification said more than 5 days. But I must check the correct syntax for intervals in duckdb. According to docs: In DuckDB, you can do "timestamp + interval '5 days'" or similar. Alternatively, if using PostgreSQL style? Well, we assume standard SQL.

We might need a subquery that computes lag and lead values with window functions. So final query:

WITH sequence AS (
    SELECT
         case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp as create_time,
         LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time,
         LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
         LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity
    FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT case_id
    FROM sequence
    WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
      AND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

Alternatively, we can do it in one query if needed.

But careful: We have to ensure that the "LAG" and "LEAD" functions are applied with proper ordering. Also note that if an event is not part of any valid sequence then it's safe to show them. But what about events within cases where some sequences might match but not all events? Actually, specification says: "Your final query should return all events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and timing condition." So if a case has one instance of such triple event with > 5 days difference then exclude whole case. So indeed the logic is correct.

Double-check ordering: Partition by case_id, order by timestamp ascending. That means that events occur in natural chronological order. Then for each row with activity 'Create Order', we check previous row's activity and next row's activity. But wait what if event log might not be strictly ordered? We assume that it is sorted by timestamp.

Alternate approach: Using self-joins.
We can also use three separate joins between event_log events, but then require contiguous ordering. However, using window functions is simpler.

Now let me check details:
For each "Create Order" row (activity = 'Create Order'), the previous row in the same case with timestamp less than current's timestamp must be exactly the one immediately preceding in order: if there is any gap between events? But if the sequence is direct, then the next event's id will be immediately after. The window function with lag and lead is appropriate.

Edge cases: What if a case has the following pattern but not contiguous? e.g., if there are some events between "Approve Purchase Requisition" and "Create Order"? Then they won't match because then previous event to "Create Order" wouldn't be exactly 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. So that's fine.

We need condition: (confirm_time - create_time) > 5 days. Use interval comparison in duckdb, i.e., we can do something like:
WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5' DAY maybe? But the prompt says "more than 5 days", so it should be > 5 days.

We need to check: (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'. I'm not sure if in duckdb we use interval syntax like that. There is a possibility that duckdb supports "INTERVAL '5' DAY" or "INTERVAL '5 days'"? Let me check: In DuckDB, you can do arithmetic on timestamps and intervals with addition operator maybe. But likely it's similar to PostgreSQL syntax.

Alternatively, if not sure, we could cast the difference in days as numeric and compare > 5:
WHERE extract(day from confirm_time - create_time) > 5
But that might be simpler: using extract function on interval type. However, I think duckdb supports subtraction of timestamps which yields an interval. But then maybe we need to do interval arithmetic? Let me check: In DuckDB, you can subtract two TIMESTAMP values and get a TIME interval.

I check: in PostgreSQL, timestamp difference returns an interval type, but sometimes comparison operators work with intervals if the other side is an interval literal. But in duckdb documentation, I think it supports "timestamp - timestamp" returns a interval. Let me assume that works fine.

Alternatively, we can use:
WHERE (confirm_time - create_time).days > 5.
But I'm not sure if DuckDB supports property extraction from intervals. There is a function extract(day FROM interval). Possibly yes. But the prompt says "more than 5 days", so likely it's simpler to do: WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL '5' DAY or something.

I can check in the DuckDB documentation: In Postgres, you can use "interval '5 days'" but in duckdb maybe it's similar. Alternatively, I can compute difference as:
CASE WHEN timestamp(date) is not required because the column is already datetime? But we might assume that if necessary, then using extract(day FROM (confirm_time - create_time)) > 5.

I need to check: In DuckDB documentation: "select now() - interval '1 day'" works. It's not 100% sure but I'll go with it as a query.
Maybe I'll use:
WHERE (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
But I worry about syntax differences: I recall that in DuckDB, the interval literal might be "interval('5') day"? Let me check. The prompt is not specific but likely they want the standard SQL.

I can also use: WHERE date_diff(confirm_time, create_time, 'day') > 5 if duckdb supports that. But I think it's simpler to do arithmetic on timestamps directly.

Alternatively, we may compute difference in days using extract(day from (confirm_time - create_time)). For example:
WHERE EXTRACT(DAY FROM confirm_time - create_time) > 5.
I need to check syntax: In Postgres, you use "EXTRACT(DAY FROM interval)" but I think duckdb might also support that. But the prompt says "SQL query" so likely the simplest is to do:

WHERE (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'.

Yes.

Alternatively, if not, then we can do:
WHERE date('timestamp') difference.

But I'll assume it's okay.

I must check grouping: The final result is simply all events from event_log where case_id is not in the subquery. That means use "NOT IN", but sometimes it's better to use a left join that is null. But I'll keep it simple.

Thus answer:
WITH valid_sequences AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT case_id,
    timestamp as create_order_time,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_order_time
  FROM event_log
  WHERE activity = 'Create Order'
)
, sequences AS (
   SELECT DISTINCT
     s.case_id
   FROM valid_sequences s
   JOIN event_log el_prev ON el_prev.case_id = s.case_id AND el_prev.timestamp < s.create_order_time
      -- But then we need to check contiguous? This is tricky with join.
)

Wait, no: I'll just use window functions as originally planned.

We want to compute for each row in the log:
- prev_activity = LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)
- next_activity = LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)
- create_time = timestamp if activity = 'Create Order'
- confirm_time = LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp)

Then filter rows where:
activity = 'Create Order', prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next_activity = 'Confirm Order' AND (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'

That gives us problematic cases. But careful: What if the "next_activity" is not exactly next row? Because maybe the sequence is broken up by a null event because of no following activity. But we assume that if there's no following event then lead returns null, and condition will fail.

I must check using window function ordering: The order by timestamp in partition by case_id ensures contiguous events are ordered by their occurrence time. So it is the correct method.

Thus code:

WITH sequences AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp as event_time,
    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,
    LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_timestamp, -- might be optional
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp
  FROM event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
   SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
   FROM sequences s
   WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
     AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
     AND (s.next_timestamp - s.event_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

That seems to be correct.

I need to check syntax: "INTERVAL '5 days'" might not be supported in duckdb. Possibly we use "interval '5' day" but I'll assume the prompt is using standard SQL with intervals.

Alternatively, if duckdb does not support that, then one can do:
WHERE extract(day from (s.next_timestamp - s.event_time)) > 5

I can check: In DuckDB, there's a function called date_diff maybe. But I think it's best to use the interval literal.

We need proper grouping and ordering: The final result set is all events that are not in problematic case_ids.
Alternatively, we could do:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
LEFT JOIN (
   SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
   FROM (
       SELECT
           case_id,
           activity,
           timestamp as create_time,
           LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time,
           LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,
           LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity
       FROM event_log
   ) s
   WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
     AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
     AND (s.confirm_time - s.create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
) seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id
WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL

This join approach may be better because it avoids using NOT IN which might cause problems if there are null values.

I'll check: In some databases, using NOT IN can lead to issues with null values. But here we want to exclude those cases.

Using left join and then filtering by "seq.case_id is null" is standard method.

So final query:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
LEFT JOIN (
   SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
   FROM (
       SELECT 
         case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp as create_time,
         LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time,
         LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
         LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
       FROM event_log
   ) s
   WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
     AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
     AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
     AND (s.confirm_time - s.create_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
) seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id
WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL

That is a valid query.

I need to check the syntax for "INTERVAL" in duckdb: Possibly it's written as "INTERVAL '5' DAY" but I'm not 100% sure. But prompt says more than 5 days, so I'll assume that is correct.

Alternatively, if there are any issues with that, we can use extract(day from (s.confirm_time - s.create_time)) > 5.

Thus final answer:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp as create_order_time,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,
            LAG(activity, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
        FROM event_log
    ) s
    WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
) AS seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id
WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL

Yes.

I'll produce final query with explanation. I must also include a detailed explanation, if needed.

I need to note that the inner subquery is used to identify problematic cases, and then we exclude them using left join filtering by seq.case_id is null. Also mention window functions are used.

Let's now produce answer in plain text as response message. I'll not use markdown formatting since instructions said "by default, do not reply with Markdown unless requested"? Actually the prompt is formatted with double asterisks? But instruction says: By default, do not use markdown formatting unless requested? Wait re-read instructions: "By default, do not reply with Markdown formatting ...". Actually instructions say: "By default, do not include Markdown unless requested" but our conversation has markdown formatting in original query. It is ambiguous.

I have to produce final answer. I'll produce the SQL code block inside triple backticks if needed? The assistant said to use plain text unless requested. But note the conversation says "Please ensure proper grouping, ordering." So I must produce code with explanation and then code.

I'll produce answer as a plain text answer with no markdown formatting but I'll include code blocks. But instructions say "by default do not output markdown formatting", so I can produce plain text SQL query.

I'll produce the query using left join version. Or maybe use NOT IN version is simpler. Let me check: Using NOT IN might be simpler:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
  FROM (
     SELECT 
         case_id,
         activity,
         timestamp as create_order_time,
         LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,
         LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
         LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
     FROM event_log
  ) s
  WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

This is simpler.

I must note that the ordering of window functions: I must use ORDER BY timestamp because events in the same case are ordered by time. This query should be correct. But I need to check if the "INTERVAL '5 days'" part is valid syntax in duckdb. If not, then alternative method: WHERE extract(day from (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time)) > 5 might be used.

Let me consider potential pitfalls:
- What if there are multiple sequences within same case? Then we want to exclude the entire case.
- The query uses DISTINCT on subquery to ensure one row per case. That is correct.

I'll produce answer with explanation and then code.

I must also mention ordering: It orders by timestamp in partition of each case id. And then filter for activity "Create Order" such that previous event equals 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND next event equals 'Confirm Order'. Then condition on time difference > 5 days.

Yes.

I'll produce final answer accordingly.

I'll produce answer as plain text:

Answer:

The following query uses a subquery with window functions to identify cases that meet the specified criteria and then excludes them from the final result set. The inner query computes lag and lead for each event, then filters rows where the current row is "Create Order" that immediately follows an "Approve Purchase Requisition" and precedes a "Confirm Order", with time difference greater than 5 days. Then using NOT IN operator, we filter out events from those cases.

SQL Query:

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            activity,
            timestamp AS create_order_time,
            LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,
            LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
            LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
        FROM event_log
    ) s
    WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

That is the final answer.

I must now produce final result. I'll produce final output accordingly.</think>Below is one acceptable solution. The idea is to first “mark” any case that contains a contiguous threeevent sequence where:

•the activity immediately before "Create Order" is "Approve Purchase Requisition",  
•the event immediately after "Create Order" is "Confirm Order", and  
•the time difference between the "Create Order" and "Confirm Order" events is greater than 5 days.

Once those cases are identified (using window functions to “look behind” and “ahead”), we then exclude any events from those case_ids in our final result. One way to do this is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 1. In the inner subquery, compute for each event:
--   • the previous activity (using LAG) and next activity (using LEAD)
--   • the timestamp of the current "Create Order" event and its following "Confirm Order"
--
-- Then filter on rows where:
--   • activity = 'Create Order'
--   • previous activity equals 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
--   • next activity equals 'Confirm Order'
--   • the time difference between create_order_time and confirm_order_time is > 5 days.
------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      timestamp AS create_order_time,
      LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,
      LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,
      LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
    FROM event_log
  ) s
  WHERE s.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND s.prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND s.next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL '5 days'
);

------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation:

1. The inner subquery (aliased as “s”) partitions the events by case_id and orders them chronologically.
   • It uses LAG to get the activity immediately before the current event and LEAD to get the next event.
   • It also “labels” the current row’s timestamp when its activity is "Create Order" and gets the following event’s timestamp (which should be for "Confirm Order").

2. In the WHERE clause of that subquery, we filter so that only rows where:
   – The current event is "Create Order",
   – Its previous event was "Approve Purchase Requisition",
   – Its next event was "Confirm Order", and
   – The time difference between create_order_time and confirm_order_time exceeds 5 days.
   
3. Finally, we select all events from the original table except those whose case_id is in this “bad” list.

This query meets the requirements by returning only events from cases that do not contain a contiguous sequence of 
"Approve Purchase Requisition"  "Create Order"  "Confirm Order" where the interval between Create and Confirm exceeds 5 days.
