Here are the main anomalies by case, relative to a typical P2P sequence (Requisition  Approval  PO  Goods Receipt  Invoice  3way match  Payment  Close). I also explain why each is problematic.

Case 1001 (mostly standard)
- Flow is standard: requisition  approval  PO  goods receipt  invoice  match  payment  close.
- No anomalies.

Case 1002 (multiple control and sequencing issues)
1) PO issued before requisition approval
   - Sequence: Create PR (08:30)  Issue PO (08:40)  Approve PR later (2024-02-03 08:00).
   - Why problematic: Bypasses approval controls; committing spend before authorization increases compliance and fraud risk.

2) Invoice received and payment released before goods receipt and before matching
   - Invoice received (02-03 07:00) and payment released (02-03 07:15) occur before goods receipt (02-04 09:00) and before 3way match (02-05 08:00).
   - Why problematic: Paying before verifying receipt and before matching exposes the company to overbilling, non-delivery, duplicates, and audit findings.

3) Payment released before PR approval
   - Payment released (02-03 07:15) occurs before PR approval (02-03 08:00).
   - Why problematic: Clear breach of segregation of duties and spend authorization policy.

Overall: Case 1002 shows serious control violations: out-of-order approval, payment-before-receipt, payment-before-match, and payment-before-approval.

Case 1003 (payment before invoice and goods receipt)
1) Payment released before invoice receipt and before goods receipt
   - Payment (02-08 11:00) precedes invoice receipt (02-09 12:00) and goods receipt (02-10 13:00).
   - Why problematic: Paying without an invoice and without evidence of receipt undermines 3way matching, risks erroneous or fraudulent payment, and creates reconciliation issues.

2) Match performed after payment
   - Match (02-11 14:00) occurs after payment.
   - Why problematic: The 3way match is intended as a pre-payment control; doing it afterward defeats its purpose and can lead to recovery efforts if discrepancies are found.

Case 1004 (goods receipt before PO)
1) Goods received before PO issuance
   - Goods receipt (02-06 09:00) precedes issuing PO (02-06 09:15).
   - Why problematic: Receiving without a PO indicates off-contract/unapproved ordering, weakens price and terms enforcement, and complicates matching.

2) Compressed cycle with early payment but still after match
   - Although payment (02-07 09:00) follows match (02-07 08:30), the overall sequence is rushed after a late PO and may indicate backdated/retroactive PO creation to fit the receipt.
   - Risk: Control circumvention and poor spend discipline; however, less severe than paying before match.

Summary of key red flags across cases
- Payment before goods receipt and/or before 3way match (Cases 1002, 1003).
- Payment before invoice receipt (Case 1003).
- PO issued before requisition approval (Case 1002).
- Goods received before PO issuance (Case 1004).
These patterns indicate control weaknesses and potential policy violations that elevate financial, compliance, and audit risks. Recommended actions include enforcing approval gates, blocking payment until 3way match passes, disallowing retroactive POs, and monitoring for events occurring out of sequence.
