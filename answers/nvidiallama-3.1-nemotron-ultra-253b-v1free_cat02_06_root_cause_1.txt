Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, first, I need to figure out which cases took longer than average to resolve. Then, dig into why that happened. Alright, let's start by understanding the data given.

Looking at the event log, each case has a series of events with timestamps. The total resolution time for each case would be from the first event (Receive Ticket) to the last event (Close Ticket). I think I should calculate the total time for each case first.

Case 101: Starts at 8:00 on 3/1 and closes at 10:15 the same day. That's about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Quick.

Case 102: Received at 8:05 on 3/1, closed at 9:15 on 3/2. So from day 1 8:05 to day 2 9:15. That's roughly 25 hours and 10 minutes. That's way longer.

Case 103: 8:10 to 9:30 same day. 1 hour 20 minutes. Fast.

Case 104: 8:20 on 3/1 to 8:30 on 3/2. So about 24 hours and 10 minutes. Also a day.

Case 105: 8:25 on 3/1 to 9:30 on 3/3. That's two days and about 1 hour. So over 48 hours. Wow, that's really long.

So the average resolution time... Let's calculate each case's duration.

Case 101: 2.25 hours
Case 102: 25.17 hours (from 8:05 to next day 9:15 is 25h10m)
Case 103: 1.33 hours
Case 104: 24.17 hours (from 8:20 to next day 8:30 is 24h10m)
Case 105: 49.08 hours (from 8:25 to 3/3 9:30 is 49h5m)

Average would be (2.25 +25.17 +1.33 +24.17 +49.08)/5 = (101)/5 = 20.2 hours. So cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average. But 105 is way higher. So these three are the ones with longer times.

Now, why are these taking longer? Let's look at their activities.

Case 102: Had an escalation to Level-2 Agent. The timeline shows that after Assign to Level-1, it escalated at 11:30, then Investigate at 14:00 same day, but Resolve was next day at 9:00. So the time from Escalate to Investigate is 2.5 hours, but then from Investigate to Resolve is overnight. Wait, the Investigate happened on 3/1 at 14:00, but Resolve was 3/2 at 9:00. So that's 19 hours. Maybe the Level-2 team took a long time.

Case 104: No escalation. Let's see. Received at 8:20, Triage at 9:00 (40 min), Assign at 9:30 (30 min), then Investigate at 13:00 (3.5 hours later). Then Resolve at next day 8:00, so Investigate to Resolve is 19 hours. Then Close at 8:30. So the long wait between Assign and Investigate (3.5h), and between Investigate and Resolve (19h). Why the delay after investigation?

Case 105: Escalated to Level-2. Let's see. Received to Triage: 10 min, Triage to Assign: 25 min. Assign to Investigate: 10 min. Then Escalate at 10:00. Then next Investigate is 3/2 at 14:00. So from Escalate to next Investigate is 1 day and 4 hours. Then Resolve at 3/3 9:00, so Investigate to Resolve is 19 hours. Then Close at 9:30. So the escalation caused a huge delay. The Level-2 team took a long time to pick up the investigation, and then another day to resolve.

So common factors in delayed cases: Escalations (cases 102 and 105), and long waits between certain steps, especially after investigation (cases 102, 104, 105).

Possible root causes:

1. Escalation to Level-2 Agent leads to significant delays. Maybe the Level-2 team is understaffed or has a backlog, causing long waiting times.

2. Long waiting times between activities. For example, in case 104, after assigning to Level-1, it took 3.5 hours to start investigation, and then 19 hours to resolve. Maybe the Level-1 agents are overloaded, or there's a handoff delay.

3. Investigation to Resolve step takes a long time, especially when escalated. Could be that complex issues require more time, but maybe there's a lack of collaboration or resources for the Level-2 team.

4. Overnight delays: Some steps are left until the next day, suggesting that work is not being continued beyond certain hours, leading to idle time.

Recommendations:

- Analyze the workload and capacity of Level-2 teams. Maybe they need more resources or better prioritization.

- Implement escalation protocols that include SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to ensure timely handling of escalated tickets.

- Investigate why investigation steps are taking so long. Maybe agents need more training, better tools, or access to information.

- Identify bottlenecks in the handoff between activities, especially after assignment or escalation. Streamline the process or automate notifications to ensure timely action.

- Consider extending support hours or having an on-call system to handle critical issues outside regular working hours, reducing idle time.

**1. Cases with Significantly Longer Resolution Times:**

| Case ID | Total Resolution Time       | Comparison to Average (~20.2 hours) |
|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 101     | 2.25 hours                 | Below average                          |
| 102     | 25.17 hours (~1 day)       | Slightly above average                |
| 103     | 1.33 hours                 | Below average                          |
| 104     | 24.17 hours (~1 day)       | Slightly above average                |
| 105     | 49.08 hours (~2 days)      | **Significantly above average**       |

**Key Observations:**
- **Case 105** is the clear outlier, taking over 2 days to resolve.
- Cases 102 and 104 are slightly above average but still took nearly a full day, suggesting notable delays.

**2. Root Cause Analysis:**

- **Escalations Lead to Delays:**  
  Cases 102 and 105 involved escalation to Level-2 teams. These escalations introduced significant delays:
  - **Case 102:** 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution after escalation.
  - **Case 105:** 28-hour wait from escalation to investigation and another 19-hour gap post-investigation.

- **Long Waiting Times Between Activities:**  
  - **Case 104:** 3.5-hour delay between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue."
  - **Case 105:** 4-hour delay from assignment to escalation, with no immediate action post-escalation.

- **Prolonged Investigation-to-Resolution Phase:**  
  Cases 102, 104, and 105 had multi-day gaps between investigation and resolution, suggesting dependencies on external teams or lack of urgency.

**3. Recommendations to Address Performance Bottlenecks:**

- **Optimize Escalation Processes:**
  - Implement SLAs for Level-2 teams to ensure timely pickup and resolution of escalated tickets.
  - Provide real-time tracking for escalated cases to prevent prolonged idle periods.

- **Streamline Handoffs:**
  - Automate notifications to agents when tasks are assigned or escalated.
  - Reduce dependency on manual handoffs by clarifying ownership at each step.

- **Enhance Support Team Capacity:**
  - Cross-train Level-1 agents to handle moderately complex issues, reducing unnecessary escalations.
  - Consider extended support hours or on-call rotations for critical cases to minimize overnight delays.

- **Improve Tooling and Training:**
  - Equip agents with faster diagnostic tools to accelerate investigation and resolution.
  - Conduct root-cause analysis for repeatedly delayed cases to identify systemic issues.

**Insight:** The primary bottlenecks stem from escalation inefficiencies and extended wait times during critical transitions. Addressing these areas will likely reduce cycle times significantly while improving overall process throughput.
