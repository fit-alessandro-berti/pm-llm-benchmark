Excellent benchmark prompt. This task requires several steps of data transformation and aggregation, making it a good test for SQL proficiency, particularly with modern analytical functions available in DuckDB.

Here is a complete and reproducible DuckDB SQL solution, including sample data setup.

### 1. Sample Data Setup

First, let's create the `event_log` table and populate it with some sample data. This data is designed to have two clear "top" variants and a few others. We will set K=2 for this example.

- **Variant 1 (`A -> B -> C`)**: Occurs 3 times (cases 101, 103, 105)
- **Variant 2 (`A -> C`)**: Occurs 2 times (cases 102, 106)
- **Variant 3 (`A -> B -> D`)**: Occurs 1 time (case 104)

```sql
-- (Optional) Set K as a variable for clarity in demonstration
SET K = 2;

-- Create the table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE event_log (
    case_id INTEGER,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
-- Case 101 (Variant: A -> B -> C)
(101, 'A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
(101, 'B', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
(101, 'C', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),
-- Case 102 (Variant: A -> C)
(102, 'A', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
(102, 'C', '2023-01-02 11:05:00'),
-- Case 103 (Variant: A -> B -> C)
(103, 'A', '2023-01-03 09:00:00'),
(103, 'B', '2023-01-03 09:02:00'),
(103, 'C', '2023-01-03 09:05:00'),
-- Case 104 (Variant: A -> B -> D)
(104, 'A', '2023-01-04 14:00:00'),
(104, 'B', '2023-01-04 14:10:00'),
(104, 'D', '2023-01-04 14:12:00'),
-- Case 105 (Variant: A -> B -> C)
(105, 'A', '2023-01-05 10:00:00'),
(105, 'B', '2023-01-05 10:05:00'),
(105, 'C', '2023-01-05 10:09:00'),
-- Case 106 (Variant: A -> C)
(106, 'A', '2023-01-06 12:00:00'),
(106, 'C', '2023-01-06 12:04:00');
```

### 2. DuckDB SQL Query

The solution uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break down the problem into logical, readable steps, directly corresponding to the prompt's requirements.

```sql
-- Set the value for K
USING (SELECT 2 AS K_value)
-- Final SELECT to get all events from the original log for the identified cases
SELECT
    log.case_id,
    log.activity,
    log.timestamp
FROM
    event_log AS log
WHERE
    log.case_id IN (
        -- Subquery to get a flat list of all case_ids belonging to the top K variants
        SELECT UNNEST(top_cases.case_ids)
        FROM (
            -- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency
            SELECT
                variant_counts.case_ids
            FROM (
                -- Step 2: Group by variant to get frequency and list of associated cases
                SELECT
                    variant,
                    COUNT(case_id) AS frequency,
                    LIST(case_id) AS case_ids -- Keep track of which cases have this variant
                FROM (
                    -- Step 1: Determine the activity sequence (variant) for each case
                    SELECT
                        case_id,
                        LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
                    FROM event_log
                    GROUP BY case_id
                ) AS case_variants
                GROUP BY variant
            ) AS variant_counts
            ORDER BY frequency DESC
            LIMIT (SELECT K_value FROM K_value)
        ) AS top_cases
    )
ORDER BY
    log.case_id,
    log.timestamp;
```

### 3. Explanation of the Query

The query is structured as a series of nested subqueries (which can be rewritten with CTEs for better readability, see alternate version below). Let's break it down from the inside out, following the prompt's steps.

1.  **`case_variants` (Inner-most Subquery): Determine the activity sequence.**
    -   `GROUP BY case_id`: This operates on each case individually.
    -   `LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`: This is the core function. For each group (`case_id`), it gathers all `activity` values into a list (an array). The `ORDER BY timestamp` clause inside the function is crucial, as it ensures the activities are sorted chronologically, correctly forming the process variant.
    -   **Result**: A temporary table with `case_id` and its corresponding variant (e.g., `101, ['A', 'B', 'C']`).

2.  **`variant_counts` (Middle Subquery): Group cases by variant and count them.**
    -   `GROUP BY variant`: This groups all cases that have the exact same activity sequence.
    -   `COUNT(case_id) AS frequency`: This counts how many cases fall into each variant group.
    -   `LIST(case_id) AS case_ids`: This is a key step for the final filtering. We collect all `case_id`s that belong to a specific variant. This avoids needing a second join later.
    -   **Result**: A temporary table with `variant`, `frequency`, and the `case_ids` for that variant (e.g., `['A', 'B', 'C'], 3, [101, 103, 105]`).

3.  **`top_cases` (Outer Subquery): Find the Top K variants.**
    -   `ORDER BY frequency DESC`: Sorts the variants from most to least common.
    -   `LIMIT (SELECT K_value FROM K_value)`: This filters the result to keep only the top K rows. We use a `USING` clause at the top to set K=2.
    -   `SELECT top_cases.case_ids`: We only need the list of case IDs from these top variants for the final step.
    -   **Result**: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the `case_id`s for one of the top K variants (e.g., `[[101, 103, 105], [102, 106]]`).

4.  **Final Filtering and Selection:**
    -   `SELECT UNNEST(...)`: The `UNNEST` function is used to flatten the list of lists of `case_id`s into a single, flat list of all `case_id`s belonging to the top K variants (e.g., `[101, 103, 105, 102, 106]`).
    -   `WHERE log.case_id IN (...)`: The main query filters the original `event_log` table, keeping only the rows where the `case_id` is present in the list generated by the subquery.
    -   `ORDER BY log.case_id, log.timestamp`: The final result is ordered for readability, showing all events for a case together and in chronological order.

### 4. Alternative Query using CTEs (Often More Readable)

For complex queries, using `WITH` clauses (CTEs) is highly recommended for readability and maintainability. This query is functionally identical to the one above.

```sql
-- Set the value for K
SET K = 2;

WITH CaseVariants AS (
    -- Step 1: Determine the activity sequence (variant) for each case
    SELECT
        case_id,
        LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
VariantCounts AS (
    -- Step 2: Group by variant to get frequency and list of associated cases
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS frequency,
        LIST(case_id) AS case_ids -- Keep track of which cases have this variant
    FROM CaseVariants
    GROUP BY variant
),
TopKVariantCases AS (
    -- Step 3: Identify the case_ids belonging to the top K variants
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(case_ids) AS case_id
    FROM VariantCounts
    ORDER BY frequency DESC
    LIMIT ? -- Use the K variable set above
)
-- Step 4: Return all original events for cases belonging to the top K variants
SELECT
    log.case_id,
    log.activity,
    log.timestamp
FROM
    event_log AS log
JOIN
    TopKVariantCases ON log.case_id = TopKVariantCases.case_id
ORDER BY
    log.case_id,
    log.timestamp;
```

This version uses a `JOIN` instead of `WHERE ... IN`, which the DuckDB optimizer can handle very efficiently. Both approaches are valid and produce the same correct result.
