Excellent. This is a classic and highly practical process mining task. DuckDB's powerful SQL extensions, especially its aggregate functions, make it exceptionally well-suited for this kind of analysis.

Here is a complete, well-structured solution that includes sample data setup and a detailed explanation of the query.

### 1. Setup: Create and Populate the `event_log` Table

First, let's create a sample `event_log` table in DuckDB to demonstrate the query. This data includes several cases, resulting in three unique process variants with different frequencies.

```sql
-- Create a table to hold the event log data
CREATE TABLE event_log (
    case_id VARCHAR,
    activity VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert sample data
-- Variant 1 (A -> B -> D): Occurs 3 times (cases 1, 4, 5)
-- Variant 2 (A -> C -> D): Occurs 2 times (cases 2, 6)
-- Variant 3 (A -> B -> C -> D): Occurs 1 time (case 3)
INSERT INTO event_log (case_id, activity, timestamp) VALUES
    ('case_1', 'Activity A', '2023-01-01 10:00:00'),
    ('case_1', 'Activity B', '2023-01-01 10:05:00'),
    ('case_1', 'Activity D', '2023-01-01 10:10:00'),

    ('case_2', 'Activity A', '2023-01-02 11:00:00'),
    ('case_2', 'Activity C', '2023-01-02 11:05:00'),
    ('case_2', 'Activity D', '2023-01-02 11:10:00'),

    ('case_3', 'Activity A', '2023-01-03 09:00:00'),
    ('case_3', 'Activity B', '2023-01-03 09:05:00'),
    ('case_3', 'Activity C', '2023-01-03 09:10:00'),
    ('case_3', 'Activity D', '2023-01-03 09:15:00'),

    ('case_4', 'Activity A', '2023-01-04 12:00:00'),
    ('case_4', 'Activity B', '2023-01-04 12:02:00'),
    ('case_4', 'Activity D', '2023-01-04 12:08:00'),

    ('case_5', 'Activity A', '2023-01-05 15:00:00'),
    ('case_5', 'Activity B', '2023-01-05 15:04:00'),
    ('case_5', 'Activity D', '2023-01-05 15:09:00'),

    ('case_6', 'Activity A', '2023-01-06 13:00:00'),
    ('case_6', 'Activity C', '2023-01-06 13:05:00'),
    ('case_6', 'Activity D', '2023-01-06 13:11:00');
```

### 2. DuckDB SQL Query to Find Events of Top K Variants

This query uses Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to break the problem down into logical, readable steps, fulfilling all requirements of the prompt. We will set **K = 2** for this example.

```sql
-- Set the value of K for the top variants
-- Note: DuckDB doesn't have native variables like T-SQL.
-- The LIMIT value is hardcoded here but could be parameterized in a client application.
DEFINE K = 2;

WITH
-- Step 1 & 2: Determine the activity sequence (variant) for each case.
-- The list() function is key here, creating an ordered array of activities.
case_variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        list(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),

-- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency.
-- We group by the 'variant' array, count the cases, order by frequency, and take the top K.
top_k_variants AS (
    SELECT
        variant
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count(*) DESC
    LIMIT K -- Use the defined K value (e.g., 2)
),

-- Step 4 (helper): Get the list of all case_ids that match the top K variants.
top_k_cases AS (
    SELECT
        cv.case_id
    FROM case_variants AS cv
    -- We use an INNER JOIN to filter only for cases whose variant is in our top_k_variants list.
    JOIN top_k_variants AS tkv ON cv.variant = tkv.variant
)

-- Final Step: Return all original events from the event_log for the filtered cases.
-- We join the original log with our list of top cases to get the final result.
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log AS el
JOIN top_k_cases AS tkc ON el.case_id = tkc.case_id
ORDER BY
    el.case_id,
    el.timestamp;
```

### 3. Explanation of the Query

The query is structured to be highly readable and maintainable.

1.  **`case_variants` CTE**:
    *   **Purpose**: To determine the exact sequence of activities for every single `case_id`.
    *   **Mechanism**: It groups the `event_log` by `case_id`. The magic happens with `list(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`. This DuckDB aggregate function collects all `activity` strings for a case into a list (an array), crucially ensuring the order is correct based on the `timestamp`. The result is one row per `case_id`, with a corresponding list representing its process variant.

2.  **`top_k_variants` CTE**:
    *   **Purpose**: To identify the K most frequent process variants.
    *   **Mechanism**: It takes the output from `case_variants` and groups by the `variant` list itself. This allows us to `count(*)` how many cases share the exact same sequence. We then `ORDER BY` this count in descending order and use `LIMIT K` to select only the most common ones. For our sample data with `K=2`, this will select `['Activity A', 'Activity B', 'Activity D']` and `['Activity A', 'Activity C', 'Activity D']`.

3.  **`top_k_cases` CTE**:
    *   **Purpose**: To create a definitive list of all `case_id`s that follow one of the top K variants.
    *   **Mechanism**: It joins `case_variants` (which links `case_id` to its `variant`) with `top_k_variants` (the list of top variant sequences). The `JOIN` condition `cv.variant = tkv.variant` effectively filters the cases, keeping only those whose activity sequence is one of the top K. The result is a simple list of `case_id`s: `'case_1'`, `'case_4'`, `'case_5'`, `'case_2'`, and `'case_6'`.

4.  **Final `SELECT` Statement**:
    *   **Purpose**: To retrieve the original, complete event data for the identified cases.
    *   **Mechanism**: It performs a simple `JOIN` between the original `event_log` table and the `top_k_cases` list. This acts as a filter, returning all rows from `event_log` where the `case_id` is present in `top_k_cases`. The final `ORDER BY` is added for a clean, predictable output.

### 4. Expected Output (for K=2)

Running the query on the sample data will produce the following result, which includes all events for the 3 cases of the most frequent variant and the 2 cases of the second-most frequent variant. `case_3` is correctly excluded.

| case_id | activity | timestamp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| case_1 | Activity A | 2023-01-01 10:00:00 |
| case_1 | Activity B | 2023-01-01 10:05:00 |
| case_1 | Activity D | 2023-01-01 10:10:00 |
| case_2 | Activity A | 2023-01-02 11:00:00 |
| case_2 | Activity C | 2023-01-02 11:05:00 |
| case_2 | Activity D | 2023-01-02 11:10:00 |
| case_4 | Activity A | 2023-01-04 12:00:00 |
| case_4 | Activity B | 2023-01-04 12:02:00 |
| case_4 | Activity D | 2023-01-04 12:08:00 |
| case_5 | Activity A | 2023-01-05 15:00:00 |
| case_5 | Activity B | 2023-01-05 15:04:00 |
| case_5 | Activity D | 2023-01-05 15:09:00 |
| case_6 | Activity A | 2023-01-06 13:00:00 |
| case_6 | Activity C | 2023-01-06 13:05:00 |
| case_6 | Activity D | 2023-01-06 13:11:00 |
