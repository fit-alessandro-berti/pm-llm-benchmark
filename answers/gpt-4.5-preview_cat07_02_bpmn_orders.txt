The provided visualization shows a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) process flow involving four vertical swimlanes: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. The visualization explains the interactions and sequence of tasks between these departments to handle customer orders from their initiation to completion.

Here's a detailed summary of the processes:

Sales:
- The process starts every Monday morning.
- "Check order for completeness" activity occurs followed by "Check if customer is already in database".
- If the customer is not already in the database, a task "Add customer to the database" is executed.
- Subsequently, the system sends order details and drafts an invoice.

Production:
- Initiated by arrival of order details, production plans are formed and executed in a loop represented by "Plan production" and "Manufacture product" tasks.
- Completion of manufacturing triggers the "Product complete" event.
- If material issues arise ("Material faulty"), this information triggers activities in the procurement department.

Procurement:
- Initiated by the arrival of order details, it enters a subprocess called "Material Compensation Subprocess".
- Within this subprocess, materials are ordered. If materials are faulty or improper, a "Return material" subprocess is also considered.
- The material check occurs separately; if there is an issue (faulty materials or order cancellation), it triggers order cancellation processing.

Warehouse:
- Receives notification when the product is completed.
- Executes the shipment of the final product indicated by the activity "Send product" followed by the "Product sent" event.

Various BPMN symbols like events (start, intermediate, end), tasks, subprocesses, gateways (decision points), connecting arrows (solid and dashed lines showing task sequence and communications respectively), and data stores (database interactions) are utilized for clarity. Such diagrams are helpful for understanding and improving cross-functional business operations.
