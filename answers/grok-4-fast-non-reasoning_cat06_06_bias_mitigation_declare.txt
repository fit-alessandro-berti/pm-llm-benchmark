### Explanation of Added Constraints and Bias Reduction

To mitigate bias in the loan application process, I introduced new activities (`CheckSensitiveAttributes`, `ManualReview`, `BiasMitigationCheck`) representing steps where sensitive attributes (e.g., ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace) are reviewed, followed by fairness checks. These additions ensure decisions like `Reject` or `Approve` are not made impulsively based on sensitive info without oversight. Here's a brief rationale for each addition:

- **existence["ManualReview"]** and **existence["BiasMitigationCheck"]**: Ensures these fairness-enforcing activities must occur in every trace, mandating structured reviews to prevent unchecked bias in decisions influenced by sensitive attributes.
  
- **coexistence["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["ManualReview"]**: Requires that whenever sensitive attributes are checked (e.g., revealing minority status), a manual review must also occur in the trace, promoting consistent scrutiny for potentially vulnerable applicants and reducing disparate treatment.

- **coexistence["Reject"]["ManualReview"]**: Forces any rejection to be accompanied by a manual review somewhere in the process, preventing biased rejections (e.g., based on race) without human oversight or justification.

- **response["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["BiasMitigationCheck"]**: Mandates that checking sensitive attributes must be followed (not necessarily immediately) by a bias mitigation check, ensuring decisions aren't rushed after seeing demographic data that could trigger prejudice.

- **precedence["BiasMitigationCheck"]["FinalDecision"]**: Requires a bias check before any final decision, blocking outcomes like quick rejections for sensitive groups without prior fairness validation.

- **succession["BiasMitigationCheck"]["ManualReview"]**: Enforces that a bias check is immediately followed by manual review, creating a tight sequence to audit and correct potential biases in real-time.

- **nonsuccession["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["Reject"]** and **nonchainsuccession["CheckSensitiveAttributes"]["Reject"]**: Prevents direct or indirect immediate succession from checking sensitive attributes to a rejection, avoiding snap biased decisions (e.g., rejecting minority applicants right after race check) and forcing intermediary fairness steps.

These constraints collectively reduce bias by inserting mandatory fairness gates after sensitive attribute exposure, ensuring equitable treatment across demographics (e.g., no faster rejections for minorities) while preserving the original process flow. This promotes consistency and accountability in loan reviews.
