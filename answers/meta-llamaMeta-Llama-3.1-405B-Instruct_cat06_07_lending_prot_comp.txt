I'll do my best to identify the main differences in the process variants between the protected and unprotected groups.

**Differences in Process Variants:**

1. **Loan Approval Rate:** The unprotected group has a higher loan approval rate (1656 out of 5613, ~29.5%) compared to the protected group (31 + 17 + 26 + 13 out of 1895, ~4.4%). This suggests that the unprotected group may be receiving more favorable treatment.
2. **Rejection Reasons:** The protected group has a higher frequency of "Application Rejected" (960 out of 1895, ~50.7%) compared to the unprotected group (664 out of 5613, ~11.8%). This may indicate that the protected group is facing stricter rejection criteria.
3. **Additional Steps:** The unprotected group has more instances of process variants with fewer additional steps, such as "Request Co-Signer On Loan" or "Make Visit to Assess Colateral". This could imply that the unprotected group is facing fewer hurdles in the loan application process.
4. **Skipped Examination:** The unprotected group has a unique process variant that includes "skipped_examination" (332 out of 5613, ~5.9%), which is not present in the protected group. This may indicate that the unprotected group is receiving more lenient treatment in terms of creditworthiness evaluation.
5. **Collateral Assessment:** While both groups have process variants that involve "Make Visit to Assess Colateral", the unprotected group has more instances of this step (e.g., 297 out of 5613, ~5.3% vs. 84 out of 1895, ~4.4% in the protected group). This may suggest that the unprotected group is facing more opportunities for collateral-based loan consideration.

**Performance Metrics:**

1. **Processing Time:** The average processing time for the unprotected group (340-440 seconds) is generally faster than that of the protected group (310-390 seconds). This could indicate that the unprotected group is receiving faster service.
2. **Frequency:** The unprotected group has a higher overall frequency of process variants (5613 vs. 1895), which may suggest that they are applying for loans more frequently.

**Inference:**

While there are differences in process variants between the two groups, it's essential to consider the context and potential reasons behind these disparities. These findings may indicate biases in the loan application process or differences in the demographic characteristics of the two groups
