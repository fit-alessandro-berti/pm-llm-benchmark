To construct a Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the given order fulfillment process, we need to carefully analyze the activities and their relationships based on the declarative constraints provided. Here's how we can reason through each constraint:

---

### **1. Equivalence**
This constraint ensures that if one activity occurs, the other must occur the same number of times. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** and **Invoice Customer (IC)** are equivalent because every order received must eventually be invoiced.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** and **Dispatch (D)** are equivalent because every shipping label generated must correspond to a dispatched package.

```python
'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC'), ('GSL', 'D')}
```

---

### **2. Always Before**
This constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must have occurred previously. In this scenario:
- **Check Availability (CA)** must always occur before **Reserve Items (RI)**.
- **Reserve Items (RI)** must always occur before **Pick Items (PI)**.
- **Pick Items (PI)** must always occur before **Quality Check (QC)**.
- **Quality Check (QC)** must always occur before **Pack Order (PO)**.
- **Pack Order (PO)** must always occur before **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** must always occur before **Dispatch (D)**.

```python
'always_before': {('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')}
```

---

### **3. Always After**
This constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must occur in one of the following events. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** must always be followed by **Check Availability (CA)**.
- **Check Availability (CA)** must always be followed by **Reserve Items (RI)**.
- **Reserve Items (RI)** must always be followed by **Pick Items (PI)**.
- **Pick Items (PI)** must always be followed by **Quality Check (QC)**.
- **Quality Check (QC)** must always be followed by **Pack Order (PO)**.
- **Pack Order (PO)** must always be followed by **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** must always be followed by **Dispatch (D)**.

```python
'always_after': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')}
```

---

### **4. Never Together**
This constraint ensures that two activities cannot coexist in the same case. In this scenario:
- **Record Payment (RP)** and **Dispatch (D)** cannot coexist because payment is typically recorded after the order is shipped.

```python
'never_together': {('RP', 'D')}
```

---

### **5. Activity Occurrences**
This constraint bounds the number of occurrences for each activity in a case. Based on the scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Check Availability (CA)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Reserve Items (RI)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Pick Items (PI)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Quality Check (QC)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Pack Order (PO)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Dispatch (D)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Invoice Customer (IC)**: Must occur exactly once.
- **Record Payment (RP)**: Can occur 0 or 1 time (optional).

```python
'activ_freq': {
    'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {1},
    'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
}
```

---

### **6. Directly-Follows Constraints**
This constraint ensures that if the first activity occurs, the second activity must occur immediately after. In this scenario:
- **Receive Order (RO)** must be directly followed by **Check Availability (CA)**.
- **Check Availability (CA)** must be directly followed by **Reserve Items (RI)**.
- **Reserve Items (RI)** must be directly followed by **Pick Items (PI)**.
- **Pick Items (PI)** must be directly followed by **Quality Check (QC)**.
- **Quality Check (QC)** must be directly followed by **Pack Order (PO)**.
- **Pack Order (PO)** must be directly followed by **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)**.
- **Generate Shipping Label (GSL)** must be directly followed by **Dispatch (D)**.

```python
'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')}
```

### **Final Log Skeleton Dictionary**

Combining all the above components, the final Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton is:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC'), ('GSL', 'D')},
    'always_before': {('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')},
    'always_after': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')},
    'never_together': {('RP', 'D')},
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1}, 'CA': {1}, 'RI': {1}, 'PI': {1}, 'QC': {1},
        'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1}, 'D': {1}, 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {0, 1}
    },
    'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D')}
}
```

### **Explanation**
This Log Skeleton captures the essential constraints of the order fulfillment process, ensuring that the activities follow logical and operational rules while adhering to the declarative constraints provided.
