# 20 Open-Ended Questions on the Smartphone Supply Chain Process

## Process Flow Rationale

1. **Why was the decision made to source components from four distinct geographic regions (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany/USA), and what trade-offs were considered between geographic diversification and supply chain complexity?**

2. **What factors influenced the selection of Malaysia as the central assembly location, and how does this choice balance labor costs, logistics efficiency, and proximity to component suppliers?**

3. **Why does the process utilize parallel gateways for component sourcing rather than a sequential approach, and what synchronization challenges arise when one supplier experiences delays?**

## Risk Management

4. **How does the organization mitigate geopolitical risks (e.g., trade wars, sanctions, regional conflicts) that could disrupt the flow of components from politically sensitive regions like Taiwan or South Korea?**

5. **What contingency plans exist if a critical single-source component (such as OLED screens from South Korea) becomes unavailable due to natural disasters or supplier bankruptcy?**

6. **How does the quality check gateway handle systemic defects that originate from a specific component supplier, and at what threshold does a batch failure trigger an investigation upstream?**

7. **What risks are associated with operating a 24/7 assembly operation, and how are worker fatigue-related errors monitored and prevented?**

## Decision-Making

8. **What specific criteria determine whether finished products are routed via air freight versus cargo ship, and how do fluctuating fuel costs and carbon emission targets influence this decision?**

9. **How is the "pass/fail" threshold established for quality checks, and who has the authority to adjust these standards based on market demands or competitive pressures?**

10. **When the exclusive gateway for demand changes triggers order adjustments to suppliers, what data inputs and forecasting models inform these decisions, and how quickly can suppliers respond?**

## Potential Improvements

11. **Could the process benefit from implementing a regional dual-sourcing strategy for critical components to reduce dependency on single countries, and what cost implications would this introduce?**

12. **How might the integration of real-time IoT tracking across all parallel shipping and distribution paths improve visibility and reduce bottlenecks?**

13. **What opportunities exist to consolidate the customs clearance and regulatory compliance task across regions through standardized documentation or trade agreements?**

14. **How could predictive analytics enhance the "Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast" task to shift from reactive adjustments to proactive supply chain orchestration?**

## Stakeholder Communication

15. **How is information shared between the parallel component suppliers to ensure synchronized delivery timelines, and what collaborative platforms or protocols are employed?**

16. **What communication mechanisms exist between the assembly plant in Malaysia and regional distribution centers to ensure production output aligns with localized demand forecasts?**

17. **How are retailers, e-commerce fulfillment centers, and VIP/pre-order customers kept informed about potential delays arising from rework loops or shipping disruptions?**

## Performance Measurement

18. **What key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to measure the efficiency of each parallel distribution channel (retailers, e-commerce, VIP shipments), and how are underperforming channels identified and improved?**

19. **How is the cost-effectiveness of the rework process measured against scrapping defective units, and at what point does rework become economically unjustifiable?**

20. **What end-to-end cycle time benchmarks exist from "Conduct Market Research" to "End Event," and how does the organization continuously measure and optimize total throughput time across this global process?**
