The diagram is a Sankey diagram that visualizes the process of fines over time, specifically from the issuance of a fine to its potential escalation to credit collection. The diagram is divided into three horizontal sections, each representing a different stage in the process: "Send Fine," 'Insert Fine Notification,' and 'Send for Credit Collection.' The vertical lines and connecting flows illustrate the transition of fines between these stages. The top section, 'Send Fine,' shows the initial issuance of fines, with each vertical line representing individual fines. The middle section, 'Insert Fine Notification,' indicates the notification stage, where fines are either processed or delayed, as shown by the varying lengths and connections of the lines. The bottom section, 'Send for Credit Collection,' represents the final stage where unpaid fines are sent for credit collection. The flows between sections highlight the progression and delays in the fine process, with some fines taking longer to move through the stages. The overall concept of the diagram is to illustrate the lifecycle of fines and the time taken for each stage, emphasizing the delays and transitions that occur from issuance to credit collection.
