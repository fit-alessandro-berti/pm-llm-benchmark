To construct a temporal profile for the global supply chain process described in the scenario, I'll estimate the average times and standard deviations for pairs of activities based on realistic assumptions about a high-tech electronics manufacturing process. Since the prompt specifies that explicit numerical temporal information isn’t provided, I’ll use domain knowledge to infer plausible time durations in seconds, reflecting factors like supplier lead times, inspection thoroughness, assembly complexity, and distribution logistics.

The process involves 10 activities: **SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS**. The temporal profile must include pairs that follow each other in at least one execution, not just adjacent activities. For a trace like `<SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS>`, I’ll consider both consecutive pairs (e.g., `(SS, OP)`, `(OP, RC)`) and non-consecutive pairs (e.g., `(SS, RC)`, `(OP, DT)`), as they "eventually follow each other." I’ll provide a representative subset of these pairs to keep the output manageable yet complex, as requested.

Here’s the reasoning behind the estimates:
- **Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP)**: A quick transition (e.g., 1 day), with low variation.
- **Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC)**: Supplier lead time could be weeks (e.g., 2 weeks), with high variability due to shipping delays.
- **Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI)**: Inspection follows soon after receipt (e.g., 1 day), with moderate variation.
- **Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA)**: Assembly starts shortly after (e.g., 12 hours), with low variation.
- **Component Assembly (CA) to Product Testing (PT)**: Testing follows assembly (e.g., 1 day), with some variation.
- **Product Testing (PT) to Packaging (PK)**: Packaging is quick (e.g., 6 hours), with low variation.
- **Packaging (PK) to Warehouse Storage (WS)**: Storage happens soon after (e.g., 4 hours), with minimal variation.
- **Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT)**: Shipping could take days (e.g., 3 days), with moderate variation.
- **Distribution (DT) to After-Sales Support (AS)**: Support begins after delivery to customers (e.g., 1 week), with high variation.
- **Non-consecutive pairs** (e.g., `(SS, QI)`, `(OP, DT)`): These span multiple steps, so times are sums of intermediate averages with accumulated variability.

Below is the Python dictionary representing the temporal profile:

```python
temporal_profile = {
    # Consecutive pairs
    ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 7200),      # 1 day ± 2 hours
    ('OP', 'RC'): (1209600, 259200),  # 14 days ± 3 days
    ('RC', 'QI'): (86400, 14400),     # 1 day ± 4 hours
    ('QI', 'CA'): (43200, 7200),      # 12 hours ± 2 hours
    ('CA', 'PT'): (86400, 14400),     # 1 day ± 4 hours
    ('PT', 'PK'): (21600, 3600),      # 6 hours ± 1 hour
    ('PK', 'WS'): (14400, 1800),      # 4 hours ± 30 minutes
    ('WS', 'DT'): (259200, 43200),    # 3 days ± 12 hours
    ('DT', 'AS'): (604800, 172800),   # 7 days ± 2 days
    
    # Non-consecutive pairs (examples spanning multiple steps)
    ('SS', 'RC'): (1296000, 259200),  # 15 days ± 3 days (SS -> OP -> RC)
    ('SS', 'QI'): (1382400, 266400),  # 16 days ± ~3.1 days (SS -> OP -> RC -> QI)
    ('OP', 'PT'): (1382400, 273600),  # 16 days ± ~3.2 days (OP -> RC -> QI -> CA -> PT)
    ('RC', 'DT'): (518400, 64800),    # 6 days ± 18 hours (RC -> QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT)
    ('QI', 'AS'): (1036800, 194400),  # 12 days ± ~2.25 days (QI -> CA -> PT -> PK -> WS -> DT -> AS)
    ('CA', 'WS'): (122400, 18000)     # ~1.4 days ± 5 hours (CA -> PT -> PK -> WS)
}
```

### Explanation of Values
- Times are in seconds (e.g., 1 day = 86,400 seconds, 1 hour = 3,600 seconds).
- **Consecutive pairs**: Estimated based on typical supply chain durations. For example, `(OP, RC)` reflects a 14-day lead time with a 3-day standard deviation due to shipping variability.
- **Non-consecutive pairs**: Averages are approximated by summing intermediate steps, and standard deviations are increased to reflect cumulative uncertainty (e.g., `(SS, RC)` combines `(SS, OP)` and `(OP, RC)`).
- Variability (standard deviation) is higher for steps involving external factors (e.g., shipping in `(OP, RC)`, `(DT, AS)`) and lower for controlled internal steps (e.g., `(PK, WS)`).

This dictionary provides a realistic temporal profile for the supply chain process, capturing both adjacent and non-adjacent activity pairs with plausible time estimates. You can use this with a `ZETA` value to detect deviations as described in the prompt (e.g., times outside `AVG ± ZETA * STDEV`). Let me know if you'd like adjustments or additional pairs!
