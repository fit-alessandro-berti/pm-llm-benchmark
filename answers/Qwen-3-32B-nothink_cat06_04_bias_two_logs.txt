### **Analysis of Bias Between Group A and Group B**

After comparing the two event logs, **Group A (Protected Group)** exhibits **systematic bias** in the decision-making process. This bias is primarily driven by the **lack of score adjustments** for applicants in Group A, even though the **CommunityGroup** and **LocalResident** attributes are present and could be used to improve fairness in the process.

---

## **1. Key Observations**

### **Group A (Protected Group)**
- All applicants are **not local residents** (`LocalResident = FALSE`).
- **No community group** is associated with any applicant (`CommunityGroup = None`).
- **No score adjustments** are made (`ScoreAdjustment = 0`).
- **Decisions are based solely on the preliminary score**.
  - **P001 (720)**: Approved
  - **P002 (710)**: Rejected
  - **P003 (740)**: Approved

### **Group B (Unprotected Group)**
- Applicants are **local residents** (`LocalResident = TRUE`).
- Some applicants are associated with a **community group** (`CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club`).
- **Score adjustments are applied** to applicants who are part of a community group (`ScoreAdjustment = +10`).
- **Decisions are influenced by the adjusted score**.
  - **U001 (720  730 after adjustment)**: Approved
  - **U002 (710, no adjustment)**: Rejected
  - **U003 (695  705 after adjustment)**: Approved

---

## **2. Bias Manifestation**

### **A. Disparate Treatment Based on Group Membership**
- **Group B** receives **positive score adjustments** for being part of a community group (`+10`), which is **not applied to Group A**.
- This suggests that **only the unprotected group benefits from a fairness-enhancing mechanism**, while the **protected group is treated as a baseline without any consideration for contextual factors**.

### **B. LocalResident Attribute and Score Adjustment**
- **Group B** is composed of **local residents**, and the system **adjusts their score based on this attribute** when combined with community group participation.
- **Group A** is composed of **non-local residents**, and **no adjustments are made**, even though the system has the capability to apply score adjustments.

### **C. Threshold and Decision Outcomes**
- A **710 score** in Group A leads to **rejection** (P002).
- A **695 score** in Group B leads to **approval** after a **+10 score adjustment** (U003).
- This implies that **Group B has a lower threshold for approval** due to the score adjustment, while **Group A is held to a higher standard**.

---

## **3. How the Bias Operates**

1. **Score Adjustments Are Not Equitably Applied**:
   - The **CommunityGroup** and **LocalResident** attributes are **only used to benefit Group B**, not Group A.
   - This creates a **disproportionate advantage** for the **unprotected group**, which is **systematically denied to the protected group**.

2. **Lack of Contextual Evaluation for Group A**:
   - Even though **Group A applicants** may have **unique contextual factors** (e.g., being non-local residents), these are **not considered** in the decision process.
   - The system applies **a rigid, static scoring model** to Group A, which may not reflect the **real-world conditions or potential of these applicants**.

3. **Manual Review Does Not Mitigate the Bias**:
   - The **ManualReview** activity is conducted for both groups, but **no adjustments are made for Group A**.
   - This implies that **manual reviewers also follow the same biased logic** as the automated system.

---

## **4. Implications of the Bias**

- **Group A is disadvantaged** in the decision-making process because it **lacks the benefit of score adjustments** that are available to Group B.
- This could lead to **higher rejection rates** for Group A, even if their **preliminary scores are comparable** to Group B.
- The **lack of fairness in the algorithm** undermines trust in the system and **violates principles of equal treatment**.

---

## **5. Recommendations to Address the Bias**

1. **Apply Score Adjustments Equitably**:
   - If Group B is receiving a **+10 adjustment** for being a local resident or part of a community group, **Group A should also receive similar adjustments** if they meet analogous criteria.
   - For example, if a Group A applicant is **not a local resident**, a **differentiated adjustment** could be applied to reflect this.

2. **Review the Use of LocalResident and CommunityGroup**:
   - Evaluate whether these attributes are **being used in a way that reinforces bias**.
   - Consider **normalizing the impact** of these attributes across both groups to **avoid favoring one group over another**.

3. **Audit the ManualReview Process**:
   - Ensure that **manual reviewers are not applying the same biased logic** as the automated system.
   - Provide **training or guidelines** to ensure fairness in human decision-making.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   - **Document the criteria** for score adjustments and make them **transparent** to all stakeholders.
   - Conduct **regular audits** to detect and correct **systemic disparities** in decision outcomes.

## **Conclusion**

**Group A (Protected Group)** is **systematically disadvantaged** due to the **absence of score adjustments** that are applied to **Group B (Unprotected Group)**. The **LocalResident** and **CommunityGroup** attributes are **used to benefit Group B**, but **not Group A**, which results in **biased decision outcomes**. This form of **disparate treatment** is a clear **manifestation of algorithmic bias** in the system. To ensure fairness, the **score adjustment logic must be applied equitably** across all groups, and **contextual factors must be considered** in a balanced and transparent manner.
