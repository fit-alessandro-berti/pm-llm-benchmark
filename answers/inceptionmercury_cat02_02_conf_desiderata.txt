Okay, I understand the task. I need to analyze the event log and identify cases that violate the strict normative rules and those that fail to meet the recommended desiderata.

**Part 1: Normative Process Behavior (Strict Rules)**

*   **Case 1:**  **No Violations.** This case follows the required sequence perfectly.
*   **Case 2:**  **Violates Normative Rules.**
    *   **Reason:** Risk Assessment was performed *before* the Credit Check. This directly violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
    *   **Reason:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection. This directly violates the rule that documentation should not be finalized if the loan is rejected.
*   **Case 3:**  **No Violations.** Despite the timing issues, the sequence of activities is correct.

**Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict)**

*   **Case 1:**  **Meets all Desiderata.** No timing or follow-up call issues.
*   **Case 2:**  **Meets all Desiderata.** No timing or follow-up call issues.
*   **Case 3:**  **Fails to meet Desiderata.**
    *   **Credit Check Timing:** The credit check was performed more than 24 hours after the application was received. This is a desideratum violation.
    *   **Inform Applicant Timing:** The applicant was informed later than the recommended 48 hours after the loan decision. This is another desideratum violation.
    *   **Follow-up Call:** There was no follow-up call recorded for this case. This is a desideratum violation.

**Summary Table:**

| Case ID | Normative Violation | Desiderata Violation(s) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1       | No                   | None                     |
| 2       | Yes                  | None                     |
| 3       | No                   | Credit Check Timing, Inform Applicant Timing, Follow-up Call |

**Interpretations/Justifications (where possible):**

*   **Case 2 (Normative Violation):**
    *   **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:** This could be due to a data entry error or a misunderstanding of the process by the employee handling the case.  Perhaps they started the risk assessment based on initial information and then realized they needed to do a credit check.
    *   **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** This might be a simple oversight or a miscommunication. The employee might have thought the loan was approved initially and started finalizing documentation before realizing the rejection.
*   **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations):**
    *   **Credit Check Timing:** The delay in the credit check could be due to external factors, such as a slow response from the credit reporting agency.
    *   **Inform Applicant Timing:** The delay in informing the applicant could be due to internal factors, such as a backlog in the communication team or a need to gather additional information before informing the applicant.
    *   **Follow-up Call:** The absence of a follow-up call could be due to resource constraints or a prioritization issue within the organization.

This analysis identifies the cases that violate the strict rules and those that deviate from best practices, along with potential explanations for the observed behaviors.
