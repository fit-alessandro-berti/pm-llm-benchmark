What you are looking at is a time-line “spaghetti” (or time-arc) diagram that shows how the same set of cases moves through three successive activities of a fines-collection process over a period of more than 13 years.

1. Axes and frame  
   • The horizontal axis is calendar time, running from 25 Jan 2000 on the left to 24 Apr 2013 on the right.  
   • The three horizontal black rules mark the positions of three discrete process activities, each labelled at the far right:  
     – Send Fine (top line)  
     – Insert Fine Notification (middle line)  
     – Send for Credit Collection (bottom line)

2. What each line means  
   • Every straight line segment belongs to a single case (i.e., to one individual fine).  
   • A segment connects the timestamp of one activity to the timestamp of the next activity for the same case.  
   • Colour encodes which pair of activities is being connected:  
     – Grey: from Send Fine  Insert Fine Notification  
     – Light-red/pink: from Insert Fine Notification  Send for Credit Collection

3. How to read the geometry  
   • Most grey segments are almost perfectly vertical.  That tells us that, for the vast majority of fines, the “Insert Fine Notification” event follows the “Send Fine” event almost immediately (the time difference is so small that it is visually zero at this scale).  
   • The pink segments slope downwards, and their slopes vary widely:  
     – Steep, short pink lines represent fines that are escalated to credit collection quickly.  
     – Shallow, long pink lines represent fines that remain open—sometimes for years—before they are finally sent to credit collection.  
   • Because many cases start on the same day, the pink lines fan out into repeated triangular “combs”, making the latency distribution easy to see.

4. Density and workload clues  
   • The top barcode-like block of grey lines is extremely dense—almost solid—indicating that new fines were issued (and notifications inserted) in very high volume and on an almost continuous basis throughout the whole period.  
   • The lower region is much sparser and more diffuse, which tells us that only a fraction of those fines ever reach the credit-collection stage, and those that do follow very different timing patterns.

5. Overall story the picture tells  
   • Issuing the fine and recording its notification is effectively an automatic or same-day step.  
   • Escalation to credit collection is the bottleneck: some cases are escalated within days, others take months or even several years, and many never reach that stage during the observation window.  
   • The triangular fans of pink lines repeat because batches of fines are created together and then disperse over time depending on debtor behaviour and collection policies.

In short, the diagram gives a compact visual summary of both the volume of fines handled and the wide dispersion of throughput times between “Insert Fine Notification” and “Send for Credit Collection”.
