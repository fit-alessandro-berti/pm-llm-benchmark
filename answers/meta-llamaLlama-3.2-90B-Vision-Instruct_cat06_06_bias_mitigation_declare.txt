**Rationale for Added Constraints:**

1.  **Coexistence Constraints for Manual Reviews:** The constraints `"Approve_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"Reject_Minority": {"ManualReview": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` ensure that for decisions involving minority applicants (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`), a `ManualReview` activity must coexist in the process trace. This is essential for introducing an additional layer of fairness and human oversight in decision-making processes that could be influenced by biases against applicants from minority backgrounds.
2.  **Response Constraints for Bias Mitigation Checks:** The constraint `"CheckApplicantRace": {"BiasMitigationCheck": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` ensures that after checking an applicant's race, the process must perform a `BiasMitigationCheck` before proceeding. This check is crucial for detecting and possibly mitigating biases that might arise from the consideration of sensitive attributes like race during the decision-making process.
3.  **Succession Constraints for Ensuring Mitigation Before Decisions:** Constraints like `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Approve": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"BiasMitigationCheck": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` guarantee that after performing a bias mitigation check, the process can proceed to either approve or reject an application. This ensures that decisions made by the process have considered and addressed potential biases, enhancing fairness and equity.
4.  **Non-Succession Constraints to Prevent Direct Biased Outcomes:** Constraints such as `"CheckApplicantRace": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` and `"CheckApplicantGender": {"Reject": {"support": 1.0, "confidence": 1.0}}` prevent the direct succession from checking sensitive attributes (race or gender) to a rejection decision without appropriate checks in place. This prevents immediate and potentially biased decisions based on sensitive information.

By incorporating these additional constraints, the DECLARE model is enhanced to promote fairness and reduce the risk of biased decision-making in the loan application review process, especially when considering sensitive attributes such as race or gender.
