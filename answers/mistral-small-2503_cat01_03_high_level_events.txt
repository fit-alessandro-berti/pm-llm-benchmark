To group the low-level events into meaningful, higher-level process steps, we need to analyze the sequence of events and identify logical groupings based on the activities, resources, and temporal proximity. Below is the proposed set of high-level activities, along with the rationale for each grouping and the names assigned to these high-level steps.

### High-Level Activities and Groupings

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Events Included:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet
   - **Rationale:** These events are all preparatory steps that set up the raw material for further processing. They involve obtaining the material, verifying its identity, positioning it correctly, and preparing it for the next stage.

2. **Assembly**
   - **Events Included:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
   - **Rationale:** These events involve the actual assembly of the product, specifically the welding process. They are performed by the same operator and are logically grouped as part of the assembly phase.

3. **Quality Inspection**
   - **Events Included:**
     - Measure weld integrity
     - Visual check
   - **Rationale:** These events are quality assurance checks to ensure the integrity and correctness of the assembly. They are performed by different resources (a quality sensor and an operator) but are logically grouped as part of the quality inspection phase.

4. **Finishing**
   - **Events Included:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
   - **Rationale:** These events involve applying a protective layer to the assembled product and drying it. They are performed by different units but are logically grouped as part of the finishing phase.

### Conclusion

By grouping the low-level events into these high-level activities, we can better understand the manufacturing process at a glance. Each high-level step represents a coherent stage of the manufacturing process, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and optimize the workflow.
