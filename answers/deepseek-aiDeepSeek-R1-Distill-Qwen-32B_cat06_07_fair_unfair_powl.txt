Okay, so I need to create two POWL models based on the hiring process described for GlobalTeq Solutions. The first model should show potential unfairness, and the second should eliminate that unfairness by removing the biased branch. Let me break down the process step by step.

First, I'll outline the process as described:

1. **ReceiveApplication**: The company receives job applications.
2. **DataCompletenessCheck**: An automated system checks if the resume is complete. If not, the applicant is asked to provide more information via **RequestMoreInfo**.
3. **SkillAssessment**: Applicants take an online test. Those below a certain score are disqualified.
4. **CulturalFitCheck** or **CommunityAffiliationCheck**: This is where the bias creeps in. If the applicant has local affiliations, they get a slight advantage.
5. **ManagerialReview**: Borderline candidates are reviewed by a hiring manager.
6. **FinalDecision**: The candidate is either approved or rejected.

For the first model (with potential unfairness), after the skill assessment, there's an XOR choice. One branch goes to a standard cultural fit check, and the other to a community affiliation check that gives an unfair advantage. So, the workflow has a choice here, introducing bias.

For the second model (without unfairness), there's no such XOR branch. All applicants go through the same cultural fit check after the skill assessment.

Now, I need to translate this into POWL models using the given structure. POWL allows for activities, choices (XOR), loops, and partial orders.

Starting with the first model:

- **ReceiveApplication** starts the process.
- **DataCompletenessCheck** is next. If incomplete, it loops back to **RequestMoreInfo**.
- After data is complete, **SkillAssessment** is conducted.
- Then, an XOR choice between **CulturalFitCheck** and **CommunityAffiliationCheck**.
- After the cultural fit check (either standard or community), it goes to **ManagerialReview**.
- Finally, **FinalDecision**.

So, the structure would be a partial order where after **SkillAssessment**, there's an XOR operator with two branches: **CulturalFitCheck** and **CommunityAffiliationCheck**. Both branches then lead to **ManagerialReview** and then **FinalDecision**.

For the second model, the XOR is removed. After **SkillAssessment**, all applicants go through the same **CulturalFitCheck**. Then, **ManagerialReview** and **FinalDecision** follow.

I need to structure each model as a StrictPartialOrder with the necessary transitions and operators. The first model includes an XOR operator after the skill assessment, while the second doesn't.

Let me try to define the activities first:

- A = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
- B = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
- C = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
- D = Transition("SkillAssessment")
- E = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
- F = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
- G = Transition("ManagerialReview")
- H = Transition("FinalDecision")

For the first model (unfair):

- There's a loop between B and C: if data is incomplete, loop back.
- After D, an XOR choice between E and F.
- Both E and F lead to G, then H.

So, the structure is:

- A  B
- If B finds incomplete data, it loops to C, which feeds back to B.
- Once data is complete, B  D.
- After D, choose between E or F.
- E  G  H
- F  G  H

In POWL terms, this would involve a loop between B and C, then a sequence from B to D, then an XOR choice between E and F, followed by G and H.

For the second model (fair):

- Same initial steps: A  B, then loop if needed.
- After D, all go to E, then G  H.

No XOR here; everyone goes through E.

Now, to structure the POWL models:

First model (unfair):

1. The loop is between B and C: OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP, children B and C.
2. After the loop, the sequence is B  D.
3. After D, an XOR choice between E and F: OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR, children E and F.
4. Then, sequence E  G  H and F  G  H.

Wait, but in POWL, the structure is built with partial orders and operators. So, the main structure is a partial order where A is first, then the loop (B and C), then D, then the XOR (E and F), then G, then H.

But I need to represent the loop properly. The loop is between B and C, so after B, if incomplete, it goes to C, which loops back to B. So, the loop is B  C  B.

Then, once data is complete, B proceeds to D.

So, in the first model, the loop is part of the process before the skill assessment.

The structure would be:

- A is the start.
- A is followed by the loop (B and C).
- After the loop completes (i.e., data is complete), proceed to D.
- After D, an XOR between E and F.
- E and F both lead to G, then H.

So, the StrictPartialOrder includes:

Nodes are A, the loop, D, the XOR, G, H.

Order:

A  loop

loop  D

D  XOR

XOR  G

G  H

Additionally, within the XOR, the children are E and F, which are both followed by G.

Wait, but in POWL, the XOR operator is a choice between its children. So, after D, the XOR is applied, choosing either E or F. Each of these is followed by G and H.

So, the model would look like:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop, D, xor, G, H])

Order edges:

A  loop

loop  D

D  xor

xor  G

G  H

Where xor is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children E and F.

E and F are Transitions, each leading to G.

Wait, but in POWL, the transitions are activities, and the operators define the control flow. So, the XOR is a node in the partial order, and its children are the two possible paths: E followed by G followed by H, and F followed by G followed by H.

Wait, perhaps I need to structure it as:

After D, the XOR is applied, which branches into E or F. Each of these branches then goes to G, then H.

So, the XOR node's children are two paths: one is E  G  H, the other is F  G  H.

But in POWL, each child of the XOR is a POWL model. So, each branch is a sequence: E followed by G followed by H, and F followed by G followed by H.

Wait, but that might not be necessary because G and H are common after both E and F. So, perhaps the XOR is followed by G and H in sequence.

Alternatively, the XOR node has two children: E and F. Then, after the XOR, G and H are executed.

But in the process, after E or F, G and H follow. So, the structure is:

A  loop  D  XOR(E, F)  G  H.

So, in POWL, the XOR is a node with children E and F, and the order is that after XOR, G and H follow.

Similarly, in the second model, after D, it's a direct path to E  G  H, without any XOR.

So, putting it all together, here's how I can define the first model:

- A is the start.
- A is followed by a loop between B and C.
- After the loop, D is executed.
- After D, an XOR choice between E and F.
- Both E and F are followed by G and H.

In POWL terms:

First model (unfair):

1. Define the loop: OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP, children B and C.
2. Define the XOR: OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR, children E and F.
3. The partial order includes A, the loop, D, the XOR, G, H.
4. Order edges: A  loop; loop  D; D  XOR; XOR  G; G  H.

Wait, but the XOR node is a choice between E and F, but in the process, after E or F, G and H follow. So, perhaps the XOR node's children are E and F, and then after the XOR, G and H are in sequence.

Alternatively, the XOR is part of a partial order where after D, you choose E or F, and then proceed to G and H.

I think the correct way is to have the XOR node as a choice between two paths: one is E followed by G followed by H, and the other is F followed by G followed by H.

But in POWL, the XOR operator's children are the two possible sub-models. So, each child is a sequence of activities.

So, for the XOR, the children would be:

- One path: E  G  H
- Another path: F  G  H

But in POWL, each child is a POWL model. So, each path is a StrictPartialOrder with the sequence E, G, H and F, G, H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to have the XOR node followed by G and H in sequence, since both E and F lead to G and H.

Wait, but in the process, after E or F, G and H are executed. So, the structure is:

D  XOR(E, F)  G  H.

So, the XOR is between E and F, and then G and H follow.

Therefore, the XOR node's children are E and F, and after the XOR, G and H are in sequence.

So, in POWL terms:

- The main partial order includes A, loop, D, XOR, G, H.
- Order edges: A  loop; loop  D; D  XOR; XOR  G; G  H.
- The XOR node is an OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR, children E and F.

But wait, in POWL, the XOR operator is a node with two children, which are the two possible paths. So, each child is a POWL model. Therefore, the XOR's children are two paths: E followed by G followed by H, and F followed by G followed by H.

But that would mean that each child of the XOR is a sequence of E, G, H and F, G, H. However, G and H are common after both E and F, so it's more efficient to have the XOR node followed by G and H in sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the XOR node is part of a larger partial order where after D, the XOR is applied, and then G and H follow regardless of the choice.

I think the correct approach is to model the XOR node as a choice between E and F, and then after the XOR, G and H are executed. So, the order is D  XOR  G  H.

Thus, the XOR node's children are E and F, and after the XOR, G and H are added to the partial order.

So, the first model's structure would be:

- A  loop (B and C)  D  XOR(E, F)  G  H.

Now, for the second model (without unfairness), the structure is similar, but without the XOR. After D, all applicants go through E, then G and H.

So, the second model's structure is:

- A  loop  D  E  G  H.

Now, implementing this in POWL code.

First, define all the transitions:

A = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
B = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
C = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
D = Transition("SkillAssessment")
E = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
F = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
G = Transition("ManagerialReview")
H = Transition("FinalDecision")

For the first model (unfair):

- The loop is between B and C.
loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])

- The XOR is between E and F.
xor1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[E, F])

- The main partial order includes A, loop1, D, xor1, G, H.
- Order edges: A  loop1; loop1  D; D  xor1; xor1  G; G  H.

Wait, but in POWL, the partial order's nodes must include all the necessary elements. So, the root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes A, loop1, D, xor1, G, H.

Then, the order is added as A  loop1, loop1  D, D  xor1, xor1  G, G  H.

Additionally, within the loop1, B and C are connected as a loop.

Wait, but in the loop operator, the children are B and C, and the loop is structured as B followed by C, which can loop back to B.

So, the loop operator is correctly defined as OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP, children [B, C].

Similarly, the XOR operator is correctly defined as OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR, children [E, F].

Thus, the first model is structured as:

root_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop1, D, xor1, G, H])
root_unfair.order.add_edge(A, loop1)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(loop1, D)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(D, xor1)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(xor1, G)
root_unfair.order.add_edge(G, H)

For the second model (fair):

- The loop is the same: loop1 = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[B, C])
- After loop1, D is executed.
- Then, E is executed, followed by G and H.

So, the main partial order includes A, loop1, D, E, G, H.

Order edges: A  loop1; loop1  D; D  E; E  G; G  H.

Thus, the second model is:

root_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[A, loop1, D, E, G, H])
root_fair.order.add_edge(A, loop1)
root_fair.order.add_edge(loop1, D)
root_fair.order.add_edge(D, E)
root_fair.order.add_edge(E, G)
root_fair.order.add_edge(G, H)

I think this captures the two models correctly. The first model introduces an XOR after the skill assessment, leading to potential unfairness, while the second model removes that XOR, ensuring all applicants go through the same cultural fit check.

I should double-check to ensure that in the first model, after the XOR, G and H are correctly placed. Since the XOR is followed by G and H, it means that regardless of whether E or F is chosen, the process proceeds to G and H. This correctly models the process where both paths lead to managerial review and final decision.

In the second model, the path is straightforward without any branching after the skill assessment, ensuring fairness.

I think this should be the correct approach.

To address the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions, we have created two POWL models: one that demonstrates potential unfairness and another that eliminates it by ensuring all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation.

### **POWL Model with Potential Unfairness**

This model includes an XOR choice after the skill assessment, leading to either a standard cultural fit check or a community affiliation check, which introduces subtle bias.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define the activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition("ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition("DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition("RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition("SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition("CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition("CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition("ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition("FinalDecision")

# Create the loop for data completeness
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Create the XOR choice between cultural fit and community affiliation checks
xor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order for the unfair model
unfair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add order edges
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)
unfair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

### **POWL Model Without Unfairness**

This model ensures all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation, eliminating any unfair advantage based on community affiliations.

```python
# Define the loop for data completeness (same as before)
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order for the fair model
fair_model = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
])

# Add order edges
fair_model.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop)
fair_model.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)
fair_model.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
fair_model.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
fair_model.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)
```

These models effectively capture the hiring process, with the first highlighting potential bias and the second ensuring a fair evaluation for all applicants.
