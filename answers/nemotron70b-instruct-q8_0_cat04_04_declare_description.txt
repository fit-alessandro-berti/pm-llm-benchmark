Based on the provided DECLARE declarative process model constraints, I'll attempt to reconstruct and describe the underlying process. Please note that the accuracy of this interpretation relies on the completeness and consistency of the given constraints.

**Process Overview**

The process appears to be related to handling employee declarations (possibly expense reports or similar) with associated payment requests. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process, inferred from the constraints:

1. **Initialization**:
	* The process starts with **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**.
2. **Declaration Approval and Payment Request**:
	* **Exactly 1**: Each of the following activities occurs only once per process instance:
		+ Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
		+ Request Payment
		+ Payment Handled
		+ (Already initialized) Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE
	* **Chain Precedence & Response**:
		1. **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**
		2.  **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR** (must occur after submission, through **Alternate Response/Precedence**)
		3.  **Request Payment** (directly follows approval, via **Chain Precedence & Response**)
3. **Payment Handling**:
	* **Request Payment** must be followed by **Payment Handled** (via **Chain Succession & Response**)
4. **Constraints Ensuring Logical Flow**:
	* **Alternate Succession/Response/Precedence**: Ensure that the activities related to submission, approval, payment request, and handling occur in an alternating pattern without repetitions, maintaining a logical flow.
	* **Co-Existence**: All main activities (**Request Payment**, **Payment Handled**, **Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR**, and **Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE**) must occur together in some configuration to mark a complete process instance, reinforcing the integral relationship between declaration approval and payment processing.
5. **Absence**:
	* A list of absent activities indicates that they are not part of this specific process flow. These include various rejection statuses, savings, missing approvals, etc., suggesting that if any of these occur, they either initiate a different process or represent an escalation/notification outside this model's scope.

**Process Diagram (Simplified)**
Given the text-based constraints, a simplified visual representation could look like this:

```
                                  +-------------------+
                                  |  Declaration     |

                                  |  EMPLOYEE (Start)|
                                  +-------------------+

                                             | Alternate Response

                                  | FINAL_APPROVED   |
                                  | by SUPERVISOR    |
                                  +-------------------+
                                             |
                                             | Chain Precedence
                                             v
                                  +-------------------+
                                  |     Request      |
                                  |     Payment       |
                                  +-------------------+
                                             |
                                             | Chain Response
                                             v
                                  +-------------------+
                                  |   Payment        |
                                  |   Handled        |
                                  +-------------------+
```

**Note**: This diagram simplifies the relationships for clarity. The actual process flow is more tightly constrained by the combination of all the DECLARE constraints listed, ensuring a stricter sequence and co-occurrence of activities.
