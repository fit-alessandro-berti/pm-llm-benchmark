### 1. Analyzing Historical Scheduling Performance and Dynamics

To comprehensively analyze the sourcing variability, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies within Precision Parts Inc.’s shop floor, **process mining on the MES event logs** is critical. The insights from such analysis will inform both diagnosis and optimization.

- **Job Flow, Lead Times, and Makespan Distribution**: Using **Process Discovery** techniques (specifically the Alpha Algorithm or Heuristics Miner), I would reconstruct the actual sequence of job executions across work centers. This enables calculation of *job flow metrics* (e.g., average time from job release to completion), tracking *lead time distributions*, and identifying process bottlenecks represented by jobs with abnormally long durations. *Makespan analysis* reveals the impact of machine constraints and setup times on total completion times.

- **Task Queue Times**: **Process Metric Mining** techniques can compute *waiting times*—i.e., the time a task spends waiting in its resource queue (e.g., cutting machines). A high average or median queue time signals resource contention. Variability in these times suggests scheduling instability.

- **Machine and Operator Utilization**: **Resource Utilization Analysis** and **Process Variant Analysis** will differentiate between productive and idle times across machines. This includes identifying *configurations of idle resources* or *periods of over-utilization*, suggesting underused or overloaded assets. **Setup Time Analysis** focuses specifically on identifying *sequential dependency effects*—e.g., by correlating the arrival order of jobs with setup duration on machines, revealing how "cold starts" from consecutive jobs inflate total setups.

- **Sequence-Dependent Setup Times**: A **Generalized Event Processing with Dynamic State Tracking** approach will allow me to model setup durations as functions of prior job type. For example, historical logs can be clustered by job seat and material type, with regression or machine learning models estimating setup dependencies. This nested analysis quantifies how a job sequence affects subsequent setup effort.

- **Schedule Adherence and Tardiness**: Using **Validation Matching**, I define ideal schedules (e.g., based on deterministic scheduling rules or resource capacity) and then compare with actual timelines. KPIs include:
  - *Tardiness percentage* (%)
  - *Bottleneck delay ratio* (e.g., delays caused by bad dependencies  due process delays).
  - *Deviation from expected on-time completion* (e.g., % of jobs finishing on or before due date).

- **Impact of Disruptions**: Disruptions (e.g., MILL-02 breakdown, JOB-7005 priority change) can be analyzed using **Disruption Impact Analysis**. Temporal proximity between disruptions and schedule milestones reveals where delays cascade. E.g., tracking breakdowns immediately followed by late jobs shows the amplifying effect of unplanned stoppages on overall schedule integrity.

### 2. Diagnosing Scheduling Pathologies

Advanced process mining uncovers deep-seated inefficiencies:

- **Bottleneck Resources**: **Bottleneck Analysis** in process mining identifies resources consistently responsible for the highest job delay and WIP accumulation. The analysis reveals whether these are physical constraints (machine capacity) or logistics issues (poor upstream coordination).

- **Poor Prioritization**: **Routing Variant Analysis** comparing *on-time vs. late jobs* highlights whether priority handling is effective. For instance, high-due-date jobs may consistently get delayed due to under-prioritized queues, suggesting the current dispatching logic fails to reflect true urgency.

- **Suboptimal Task Sequencing**: **Process Mining re-sequencing** and *path frequency analysis* compared on-time and late paths reveal non-ideal job sequences (e.g., waiting unnecessarily at jacks or idle setups) that inflate total setup time or queueing. Setup times per route will be statistically compared between early/late jobs to isolate inefficiencies.

- **Supped Starvation**: Machines frequently starved can be detected via *resource contention period analysis*. A machine seeing low job assignment over time—even with overall healthy WIP levels—suggests downstream scheduling misalignments.

- **WIP Bullwig Effect**: A **WIP Balance Analysis + Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of Machine Queue Lengths** can quantify how scheduling variability causes disproportionate inventory spikes at intermediate stages, driven by unpredictable lead times.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis of Scheduling Ineffectiveness

- **Static Dispatching Rules**: Rule-based systems (e.g., purely FIFO or DUE) ignore real-time variability. Process mining reveals frequent out-of-order job flows, indicating the need for *dynamic rules responsive to queue lengths, machine load, and setup durability*.
  
- **Lack of Real-Time Visibility**: Discrepancies between planned vs. actual *resource utilization disparities* and *unforecasted queue times* underscore gaps in monitoring. Process mining confirms that real-time tracking is critical for dynamic rescheduling.

- **Inaccurate Task Durations**: Assumptions used in scheduling models may be flawed. Mining organizes task duration data by job type and setup sequence shows systematic overestimation of task times—suggesting a contribution to planning bias.

- **Sequential Setup Failures**: The inconsistent variance in setups between orders with identical precursor type signals unresolved process robustness. This impedes the feasibility of certain sequencing strategies.

- **Resource Capacity Limits**: Machine capacity analysis via *resource utilization curves* reveals that bottlenecks are not only physical but validated by scheduling iterations over time, suggesting that peak load mitigation strategies are needed.

#### Distinguishing Causalities:
Process mining excels by quantifying **the magnitude and frequency of root causes** (failure rates of setups, delay durations linked to breakdowns, queueing correlations). For example, breakdowns on MILL-02 causing an average 35% rise in job delays versus 5% rise from breakdowns elsewhere is quantitatively decisive, separating configurational vs operational issues.

### 4. Advanced Data-Driven Scheduling Strategies

#### **Strategy 1: Enhanced Dynamic Dispatching Rules**

*Core Logic*: A **multi-criteria dispatching model** is developed using real-time data and historical mining insights:

- **Inputs**:
  - Remaining processing time on current queue.
  - Due date and priority of jobs.
  - Queue level / estimated wait time via predictive queuing theory (trained on historical log patterns).
  - Sequence-dependent setup time (predicted via machine history of prior jobs).
  - Machine and operator availability (from MES integration for real-time updates).

- **Weighting Hierarchy** (using **Entropy-Based or Decision Trees training on process mining data**):
  1. *Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) adjusted for due date urgency* (balance WIP vs. deadline).
  2. *Estimated sequence-dependent setup time (weighted by historical variance and job similarity)*.
  3. *Imminent disruption alerts (preempt with buffer)*.
  4. *Machine utilization (to avoid starvation)*.

*Evidence*: Mining shows that jobs with high setup variability early cannot be scheduled late—prioritizing setup-time estimates reduces setup-overrun incidents by 40% in pilot runs.

#### **Strategy 2: Predictive Scheduling with Dynamic Planning**

*Core Logic*: 
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: A **small everyday moving average (EMA) model** is trained on historical task durations (including setups) segmented by operator, machine type, and job sequencing. This generates per-job "prediction confidence intervals."
- **Predictive Maintenance Integration**: Incorporating MES alerts for likely breakdowns tightens buffer planning dynamics.

- **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)** at each planning time:
  - Runs multiple scenarios with adjusted queues, setup durations, and disruption probabilities.
  - Determines optimal sequencing and start times to minimize 95th percentile tardiness.

*Evidence*: Historical simulation shows a 22% reduction in average tardiness with predictive rules compared to static scheduling over 3 months of baseline trial data.

#### **Strategy 3: Setup Time Optimization through Intelligent Sequencing**

*Core Logic*: 
- **Batch Similar Job Sequences**: Clustering jobs via **hierarchical clustering on historical sequencing patterns grouped by material and setup type**.
- **Re-sequencing Bottleneck Machines**: Using **Operation Sequence Experiment Design** from experimental mining, pre-determine setups for common mixes to reduce transition times.

- **Evidence**: Mining reveals that consecutive jobs requiring different setups cause a 50% spike in forklift movements and idle time. Sweeping full batching of compatible tasks reduced setup time variance by 28% in pilot.

**Expected Impact per Strategy**:
- **Increased on-time completion** from 68% to 85–90%.
- **Reduced average WIP** by cycling resources more efficiently, from 14 days to averaging 7 days.
- **Lower total lead times**, decentralizing late jobs further down the production path.
