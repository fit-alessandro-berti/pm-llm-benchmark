1) How should the company balance just-in-time replenishment with adequate safety stock across regions with varying demand patterns and long supplier lead times, to minimize stockouts and obsolescence?

2) Which bottlenecks or single points of failure in the multi-country supplier network (Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Germany, US, Malaysia) pose the greatest disruption risk, and how can they be mitigated?

3) What end-to-end visibility capabilities are needed to track materials and components from source to end consumer, and how can data quality and timeliness be ensured across borders?

4) How can the organization effectively manage geopolitical, regulatory, currency, and tariff risks to maintain cost competitiveness and delivery reliability?

5) What is the optimal mix of supplier diversification versus dual-sourcing versus single-sourcing for critical components, considering cost, quality, and risk?

6) How do supplier quality metrics translate into final product quality, warranty costs, recalls, and after-sales support, and what proactive measures can reduce failures?

7) In what ways do environmental and labor regulations across supplier regions influence supplier selection, lead times, and total landed cost, and how can compliance be future-proofed?

8) How can digital twins and scenario planning be leveraged to simulate disruptions (e.g., port congestion, factory outage, shipping delays) and test alternative sourcing, routing, and inventory strategies?

9) What factors should drive decisions between air and sea transport for different product volumes and regions, considering time, cost, reliability, and emissions?

10) What strategies and technologies can meaningfully reduce the supply chain’s carbon footprint without compromising service levels or quality?

11) How can machine learning improve demand forecasting across multiple regions with diverse consumer behaviors, promotions, and seasonality, and how should forecasts be reconciled with manufacturing and logistics constraints?

12) How should currency and input cost volatility be managed across global purchases and settlements to stabilize margins and cash flow?

13) What data governance, interoperability, and integration challenges must be addressed to harmonize POs, invoices, customs declarations, production schedules, and demand plans in a multinational setup?

14) How can the organization protect sensitive design and production data from supplier risk or cyber threats while maintaining collaboration and efficiency with suppliers?

15) What approaches will optimize reverse logistics, warranty processing, returns, and e-waste recycling for smartphones at scale, including reuse and refurbishment opportunities?

16) How should supplier contracts be structured to incentivize quality, on-time delivery, sustainability, and continuous improvement while preserving flexibility during disruptions?

17) Which resilience and performance metrics (e.g., fill rate, cycle time, OTD, forecast accuracy, disruption recovery time) best indicate supply chain health, and how should they be tracked and acted upon?

18) How might evolving trade policies, sanctions, or regional agreements alter the network design, total landed cost, and supplier viability in the next 3–5 years?

19) How can recalls or safety incidents propagate through the global network, what containment playbooks are needed, and how can brand reputation and customer trust be protected?

20) What organizational capabilities, governance structures, and culture shifts are required to sustain continuous improvement, cross-functional collaboration, and rapid decision-making in such a distributed supply chain?
