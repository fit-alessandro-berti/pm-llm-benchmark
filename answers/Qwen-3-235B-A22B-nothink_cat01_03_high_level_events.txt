# High-Level Process Step Grouping for Manufacturing Event Log

After analyzing the provided event log, I've identified clear patterns in the sequence of activities that correspond to meaningful manufacturing stages. The grouping considers temporal proximity, resource types, and logical workflow progression.

## High-Level Process Steps

### 1. Material Preparation
**Low-level events:**
- Retrieve raw metal sheet
- Scan barcode
- Place metal sheet on table

**Rationale:**
These activities represent the initial setup phase where raw materials are retrieved, identified (via barcode), and positioned for processing. They are performed at the beginning of each case and involve the same resource (Operator A). These steps ensure proper material identification and placement for subsequent operations.

---

### 2. Material Alignment and Preheating
**Low-level events:**
- Align metal sheet
- Preheat metal sheet

**Rationale:**
This stage involves preparing the material for the welding process. The alignment is performed by a robot arm, followed by preheating using a heating unit. These events are temporally close and represent a transition from manual setup to automated preparation for assembly.

---

### 3. Welding Assembly
**Low-level events:**
- Pick up welding tool
- Weld corner A
- Weld corner B

**Rationale:**
These activities constitute the core assembly phase where the product is physically constructed. They are performed sequentially by the same resource (Operator B) and represent the actual manufacturing of the product's structure after preparation is complete.

---

### 4. Quality Inspection
**Low-level events:**
- Measure weld integrity

**Rationale:**
This single activity represents a dedicated quality assurance phase. It uses a specialized quality sensor to verify the integrity of the welding work completed in the previous step, providing an objective measurement of workmanship quality.

---

### 5. Surface Treatment
**Low-level events:**
- Apply protective coating
- Dry coating

**Rationale:**
These consecutive activities involve applying and curing a protective coating on the manufactured item. They are performed by different automated units (coating and heating units) and represent a distinct finishing phase of the manufacturing process.

---

### 6. Final Visual Check
**Low-level events:**
- Visual check

**Rationale:**
This final manual inspection by a different operator (Operator C) serves as a last quality gate before completion. It represents a distinct quality verification stage that occurs after all manufacturing and finishing operations are complete.
