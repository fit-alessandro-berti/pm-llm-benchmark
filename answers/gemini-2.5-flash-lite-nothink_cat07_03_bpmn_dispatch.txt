The visualization provided is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that illustrates the process of shipping goods. The diagram is divided into three horizontal pools, representing different roles or departments: "Dispatch of goods Computer Hardware Shop Secretary", "Logistics", and "Warehouse".

The process begins with the event "Ship goods" in the "Dispatch of goods" pool. This is followed by a parallel gateway (indicated by a '+' sign) which suggests that multiple tasks can be performed concurrently or in a specific order.

One path leads to "Clarify shipment method". From here, a decision gateway (indicated by an 'X' sign) asks "Special handling?".
* If the answer is "no", the process flows to the "Logistics" pool to "Check if insurance is required". This check is based on "Customer information" and "Order details". If insurance is necessary, it leads to "Insure parcel". Regardless of whether insurance is taken or not, it proceeds to "Write package label".
* If the answer to "Special handling?" is "yes", it directly leads to "Get 3 offers from logistic companies". Following this, the process moves to "Select logistic company and place order".

After "Write package label" (from the "no" path of special handling) and "Select logistic company and place order" (from the "yes" path), both paths converge at another parallel gateway.

Meanwhile, from the initial "Ship goods" event, another path leads to the "Warehouse" pool, where "Package goods" is performed. This task has a time constraint of "48 hours". If this time is exceeded, the customer is "Notify customer about delay".

The process then converges again at a parallel gateway, combining the activities from both the "Dispatch of goods/Logistics" and "Warehouse" pools. From this point, the process moves to "Fill out Shipment paperwork" and then "Move package to pickup area".

The process concludes with the end event "Shipment prepared" in the "Warehouse" pool.

The diagram uses standard BPMN symbols:
* **Circles:** Start and end events.
* **Rounded Rectangles:** Tasks or activities.
* **Diamond Shapes:** Gateways for decisions or parallel processing.
* **Cylinders:** Data stores (e.g., "Customer information").
* **Document Icons:** Documents (e.g., "Order details").
* **Clock Icons:** Timers or time constraints (e.g., "48 hours").
* **Arrows:** Sequence flows and message flows.
* **Horizontal Lines:** Separating pools.
