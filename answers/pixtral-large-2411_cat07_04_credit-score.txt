The provided visualization is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagram that illustrates the process of handling credit scoring requests. The diagram is divided into two main pools: "credit scoring (bank)" and "scoring engine."

### Credit Scoring (Bank) Pool:
1. **Start Event**: The process begins when a "scoring request received" event occurs.
2. **Request Credit Score Task**: The bank requests a credit score.
3. **Exclusive Gateway**: The process checks if the credit score is available.
   - If the credit score is available, it proceeds to the "send credit score" task.
   - If the credit score is not available, it proceeds to the "report delay" task.
4. **Report Delay Task**: The bank reports a delay.
5. **Intermediate Catch Event**: The bank waits for delay information to be received.
6. **Intermediate Catch Event**: The bank waits for the credit score to be received.
7. **Send Credit Score Task**: The bank sends the credit score.
8. **End Event**: The process concludes with the "scoring request handled" event.

### Scoring Engine Pool:
1. **Start Event**: The process begins when a "scoring request received" event occurs.
2. **Compute Credit Score (Level 1) Task**: The scoring engine computes the credit score at level 1.
3. **Exclusive Gateway**: The process checks if the credit score is available.
   - If the credit score is available, it proceeds to the "send credit score" task.
   - If the credit score is not available, it proceeds to the "report delay" task.
4. **Report Delay Task**: The scoring engine reports a delay.
5. **Compute Credit Score (Level 2) Task**: The scoring engine computes the credit score at level 2.
6. **Send Credit Score Task**: The scoring engine sends the credit score.
7. **End Event**: The process concludes with the "scoring request handled" event.

### Interactions Between Pools:
- The "request credit score" task in the bank pool sends a message to the "scoring request received" event in the scoring engine pool.
- The "send credit score" task in the scoring engine pool sends a message to the "credit score received" event in the bank pool.
- The "report delay" task in the scoring engine pool sends a message to the "delay information received" event in the bank pool.
- The "send credit score" task in the bank pool sends a message to the "credit score received" event in the scoring engine pool.

### Summary:
The diagram outlines the interaction between a bank and a scoring engine for handling credit scoring requests. The process involves requesting a credit score, checking its availability, reporting delays if necessary, and sending the credit score once it is available. The diagram uses BPMN elements such as tasks, events, gateways, and message flows to represent the workflow and interactions between the bank and the scoring engine.
