### **Event Log Analysis and Activity Renaming**

#### **1. Initial Analysis** 
The provided event log includes multiple cases (C001, C002, C003), each with various activities performed at different timestamps. Some activities, such as: 
- **"Verify Documents"**, 
- **"Call Customer"**, 
- **"Approve Request"**, 
appear multiple times across different cases or within the same case but with potentially different contextual meanings. 

These recurring activities need to be renamed to reflect their specific contextual role in the process.

#### **2. Activity Renaming**

##### **Verify Documents**
- **First occurrence**: Initial verification of customer documents. 
- **Second occurrence (if re-verification)**: Re-check of documents after additional information is provided.

##### **Call Customer**
- **First occurrence**: Initial call to request or clarify information. 
- **Second occurrence**: Follow-up call after a resolution or action has been taken.

##### **Approve Request**
- A consistent activity but can be contextualized based on its position (e.g., "Final Approval").

#### **4. Justification for Naming Changes**
- **Verify Documents** was renamed to: 
 - **Verify Customer Docs** (initial verification), 
 - **Re-verify Customer Docs** (after new information is provided).

- **Call Customer** was renamed to: 
 - **Call Customer for Docs** (requesting additional documents), 
 - **Follow-up Customer Call** (after adjustments).

- **Approve Request** remains consistent as it implies final approval in all cases.

#### **5. Key Observations**
- The activity **"Verify Documents"** changes context based on its sequence: 
 - First verification vs. re-verification after new information is submitted. 

- **"Call Customer"** varies in purpose: 
 - Initial call for missing documents vs. follow-up after adjustments.

- **"Approve Request"** remains consistent as it indicates final approval but could be further clarified as **"Finalize Request Approval"**. 

### **Conclusion**
The renaming clarifies the contextual role of each activity, making it easier to understand the process flow and reducing ambiguity in activity names. This revised log can improve process analysis and modeling.
