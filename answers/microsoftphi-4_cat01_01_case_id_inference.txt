To group the events into separate cases, we need to follow the logical sequence of hospital activities, considering factors such as department, patient attributes (age, gender), and the logical flow of activities for each patient. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to infer the case groupings:

### Case 1: Patient Age 45, Gender M
- **Registration:**
  - Event 1: Registered in ER.
- **Initial Triage:**
  - Event 4: Initial triage in ER.
- **Further Assessments:**
  - Event 7: X-ray imaging in Radiology.
- **Consultation:**
  - Event 12: Doctor consultation in ER, diagnosed with a hairline fracture.
- **Discharge:**
  - Event 15: Discharged from ER with follow-up at outpatient clinic.

### Case 2: Patient Age 62, Gender F
- **Registration:**
  - Event 2: Registered in ER.
- **Initial Triage:**
  - Event 5: Initial triage in ER.
- **Lab Tests:**
  - Event 8: Lab test requested in ER.
  - Event 10: Lab test completed in Laboratory.
- **Consultation:**
  - Event 11: Doctor consultation in ER, diagnosed with a minor infection.
- **Prescription:**
  - Event 14: Prescription created in ER for antibiotics.
- **Discharge:**
  - Event 17: Discharged from ER with follow-up at pharmacy pickup.

### Case 3: Patient Age 28, Gender M
- **Registration:**
  - Event 3: Registered in Surgery.
- **Consultation:**
  - Event 6: Doctor consultation in Surgery for scheduled knee surgery.
- **Preparation:**
  - Event 9: Surgery preparation in Surgery.

- **Recovery:**
  - Event 16: Recovery room in Surgery, condition stable.
- **Discharge:**
  - Event 18: Discharged from Surgery with follow-up for physiotherapy sessions.

### Summary of Case Groupings:
- **Case 1:** Events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15.
- **Case 2:** Events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17.
- **Case 3:** Events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18.

By examining the timestamps and progression of activities, we matched each patient to their respective journey, ensuring that all activities align logically and chronologically. Each set respects the typical patient pathway from entry to discharge, based on department involvement, patient demographics, and medical activities.
