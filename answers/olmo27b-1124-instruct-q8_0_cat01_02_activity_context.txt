To solve this task, I'll systematically analyze each occurrence of an activity within a case and rename them according to their specific context or role. The goal is to create names that clearly distinguish the variations in meaning for each repeated activity.

**Initial Log:**

| Case ID | Activity          | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C001    | Initiate Request  | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents.                           |
| C001    | Call Customer     | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. |
| C001    | Submit Additional | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer uploads the requested ID scan.                    |
| C001    | Verify Documents  | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided.    |
| C001    | Approve Request   | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Final approval given.                                      |

**Renamed Log:**

| Case ID | **Contextual Activity Name**        | Timestamp            | Resource         | Additional Context                                         |
|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| C001    | **Original Initiation**          | 2024-05-01 09:15:00 | WebPortal        | Customer submitted a request via online portal.            |
| C001    | **Initial Verification**         | 2024-05-01 09:20:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent checks identity documents for the first time.     |
| C001    | **Follow-up Call Request**      | 2024-05-01 09:45:00 | FrontlineAgent   | Contacting customer for missing documents.                |
| C001    | **Customer Submission**         | 2024-05-01 10:10:00 | CustomerSelfServe| Customer provides requested documents via online portal.|
| C001    | **Secondary Verification**     | 2024-05-01 10:30:00 | BackOfficeAgent  | Agent confirms documents after receiving ID scan.         |
| C001    | **Final Approval**               | 2024-05-01 10:45:00 | Supervisor       | Authorizing request completion.                           |

**Justifications for Renamed Activities:**

1. **Initiate Request**: Renamed to **Original Initiation**. The first occurrence where a customer submits a request via the web portal does not require contextual modification; it sets the stage for all subsequent actions.

2. **Verify Documents**: Modified to **Initial Verification** on the second occurrence. The first time this activity appears, it's the agent checking identity documents after the customer's submission. This distinguishes it from later verifications which occur post-submission of additional documents.

3. **Call Customer**: Changed to **Follow-up Call Request** for the third instance. This reflects that this call is prompted by the need to obtain missing documents after the initial verification was not complete.

4. **Submit Additional**: Changed to **Customer Submission** for the fourth occurrence. This reflects the customer's self-service action of uploading the requested ID scan.

5. **Verify Documents**: Renamed to **Secondary Verification** on the fifth occurrence. Here, the agent re-verifies documents after receiving the new information (the ID scan), making it distinct from both the original and subsequent verifications.

6. **Approve Request**: Retained as is for the final action in each case as it represents the conclusive step of granting approval.

**Justification Summary:**

Each renaming choice emphasizes the context-specific nature of the activity. The names reflect the order in which activities occur, who performs them (customer or agent), and the reason for their execution (e.g., seeking additional information or finalizing the process). This approach helps in clearly visualizing the flow of a customer support ticket from initiation to approval, highlighting key steps that differentiate this process log from others where similar activity names may carry different meanings.
