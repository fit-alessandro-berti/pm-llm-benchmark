Based on the analysis of the provided event log, the following POWL model represents the global manufacturing and distribution process.

### **Process Analysis**

1.  **Initial Phase:** Every case starts with the strict sequence: `Order Received (OR)` -> `Material Sourcing (MS)` -> `Quality Screening (QS)`.
2.  **Assembly Loop:** After `QS`, the assembly process begins.
    *   The core activity is `Assembly (AS)`.
    *   After an `AS` step, an `In-line Quality Check (IQC)` may be performed. If `IQC` happens, it is followed by another `AS` step. This indicates a loop where assembly is performed, then optionally checked and reworked.
    *   This is modeled as a loop `*(AS, IQC)`, meaning: execute `AS`, then either exit the loop or execute `IQC` and repeat `AS`. Cases where `IQC` is skipped (like Case 4) are handled by exiting the loop after the first `AS`.
3.  **Testing Loop:** After the assembly phase is complete, the product undergoes testing.
    *   The core activity is `Testing (TST)`.
    *   If a product fails the test, `Re-Testing (RT)` is performed, which leads back to another `TST`. This is a classic test-fail-retest cycle.
    *   This is modeled as a loop `*(TST, RT)`, meaning: execute `TST`, then either exit the loop (test passed) or execute `RT` and repeat `TST`. Cases where `RT` is skipped (like Cases 2 and 4) are handled by exiting the loop after the first `TST`.
4.  **Packaging and Labeling:** After testing, packaging and labeling occur.
    *   `Packaging (PK)` always follows the testing phase.
    *   `Labeling (LB)` is optional; it is skipped in Case 2. This represents an exclusive choice between performing `LB` or skipping it.
    *   This is modeled as a choice `X(LB, skip)`, where `skip` is a silent transition (`tau`).
5.  **Final Phase:** The process concludes with a fixed sequence.
    *   `Distribution Planning (DP)` occurs after the packaging/labeling choice.
    *   `Dispatch (D)` is the final activity.
6.  **Overall Structure:** The entire process is a sequence of these phases. A `StrictPartialOrder` is used to connect these individual activities and sub-models, enforcing the discovered sequential dependencies.

### **POWL Model Structure**

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# 1. Define all transitions for the activities
OR = Transition(label="OR")
MS = Transition(label="MS")
QS = Transition(label="QS")
AS = Transition(label="AS")
IQC = Transition(label="IQC")
TST = Transition(label="TST")
RT = Transition(label="RT")
PK = Transition(label="PK")
LB = Transition(label="LB")
DP = Transition(label="DP")
D = Transition(label="D")
skip = SilentTransition()

# 2. Define the complex structures (loops and choices)

# Assembly Loop: *(AS, IQC)
# Execute AS, then either exit or execute IQC and loop back to AS.
assembly_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[AS, IQC])

# Testing Loop: *(TST, RT)
# Execute TST, then either exit (pass) or execute RT and loop back to TST (re-test).
testing_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[TST, RT])

# Labeling Choice: X(LB, skip)
# After packaging, either perform Labeling (LB) or skip it.
labeling_choice = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[LB, skip])

# 3. Define the main process flow using a StrictPartialOrder

# The nodes are the individual transitions and the complex operator-based sub-models.
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[
    OR,
    MS,
    QS,
    assembly_loop,
    testing_loop,
    PK,
    labeling_choice,
    DP,
    D
])

# Add the partial order relations (edges) to define the sequence of execution.
root.order.add_edge(OR, MS)
root.order.add_edge(MS, QS)
root.order.add_edge(QS, assembly_loop)
root.order.add_edge(assembly_loop, testing_loop)
root.order.add_edge(testing_loop, PK)
root.order.add_edge(PK, labeling_choice)
root.order.add_edge(labeling_choice, DP)
root.order.add_edge(DP, D)

# The 'root' object now represents the complete POWL model for the process.
