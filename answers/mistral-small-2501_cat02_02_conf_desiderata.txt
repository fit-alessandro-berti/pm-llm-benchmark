### Normative Violation Analysis

#### Case 1:
**Normative Rules Compliance:**
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Compliance:** Fully compliant with normative rules.

#### Case 2:
**Normative Rules Violations:**
1. **Ordering Violations:**
   - Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check.
   - Finalize Documentation occurred after Loan Decision (Rejected).
2. **Actions Not Allowed:**
   - Finalizing Documentation after loan rejection.
**Reasons:**
   - Sequence of activities was out of order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check).
   - Finalizing Documentation should not occur after a rejection.

#### Case 3:
**Normative Rules Compliance:**
- Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case
- **Compliance:** Fully compliant with normative rules.

### Desiderata Analysis

#### Case 1:
**Desiderata Compliance:**
- Credit Check within 24 hours: Yes (09:30 - 09:00 = 30 minutes)
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision: Yes (13:00 - 11:00 = 2 hours)
- Follow-up Call: Not evident in the log.
**Interpretation:** Case 1 complies with all normative rules and mostly adheres to the desiderata. The lack of a follow-up call is noted but does not violate any strict rule.

#### Case 2:
**Desiderata Compliance:**
- Credit Check within 24 hours: Not applicable (Rule violation prevents this check)
- Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision: Not applicable (Rule violation prevents this check)
- Follow-up Call: Not evident in the log.
**Interpretation:** Case 2 cannot be evaluated on desiderata due to normative violations. However, if the follow-up call were present, it would not mitigate the normative violations.

#### Case 3:
**Desiderata Violations:**
1. **Credit Check Delayed:**
   - Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after Application Received (09:00 - 09:00 = 3 days).
2. **Inform Applicant Delayed:**
   - Inform Applicant occurred more than 48 hours after Loan Decision (15:00 - 12:00 = 3 days and 3 hours).
3. **No Follow-up Call:**
   - There is no record of a follow-up call.
**Interpretation:** While Case 3 adheres to normative rules, it fails to meet desiderata. The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant, as well as the absence of a follow-up call, indicate suboptimal process execution but do not constitute severe violations.

### Summary

#### Normative Violations:
- **Case 2:** Multiple normative violations.
  - Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
  - Finalizing Documentation after loan rejection.

#### Desiderata Violations:
- **Case 3:** Fails to meet several desiderata.
  - Credit Check performed late (more than 24 hours).
  - Inform Applicant delayed (more than 48 hours).
  - No follow-up call recorded.

### Justifications for Observed Behaviors

- **Case 2 Violations:** These could be due to a miscommunication or error in the process execution. The sequence was clearly out of order, and the attempt to finalize documentation after a rejection suggests either a procedural mistake or a lack of understanding of the rules.

- **Case 3 Violations (Desiderata):** The delays in Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be due to operational inefficiencies or unexpected workloads. The absence of a follow-up call might indicate a lack of emphasis on best practices or a misunderstanding of their importance.

Overall, while Case 1 is exemplary, Cases 2 and 3 indicate areas for improvement in adherence to both normative constraints and desiderata.
