Process cubes, also known as event cubes or data cubes, play a significant role in multi-dimensional process mining by providing a comprehensive and aggregated view of process data along multiple dimensions. They are particularly useful for analyzing complex processes with large amounts of data and for identifying patterns, bottlenecks, and performance issues.

In traditional process mining approaches, such as process discovery, conformance checking, and process enhancement, the focus is primarily on the control flow perspective, i.e., the sequence of activities in a process. While these techniques provide valuable insights into how processes are executed, they often lack the ability to consider other important aspects like resources, time, data, and organizational structures.

Process cubes address this limitation by integrating multiple dimensions into the analysis. Here's how they differ from traditional process mining approaches:

1. **Multi-dimensional perspective**: Traditional process mining focuses mainly on the control flow dimension. In contrast, process cubes incorporate additional dimensions such as:
   - *Case*: Individual instances of a process.
   - *Activity*: The tasks or steps within a process.
   - *Resource*: The actors or resources involved in executing activities.
   - *Time*: The timestamps associated with each event.
   - *Data*: Attributes and data elements related to the process, such as costs, durations, or other relevant metrics.

2. **Aggregation and summarization**: Process cubes aggregate and summarize process data along these dimensions, allowing analysts to zoom in and out of the data to gain insights at different levels of granularity. This enables better understanding of complex processes and easier identification of trends, patterns, and outliers.

3. **OLAP-like navigation**: Similar to Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems, process cubes allow users to navigate through the data using operations like roll-up, drill-down, slice-and-dice, and pivoting. This enables interactive exploration and analysis of process data from various angles.

4. **Support for advanced analytics**: By providing a multi-dimensional view of process data, process cubes facilitate the application of advanced analytical techniques such as clustering, classification, and regression. These techniques can help uncover hidden patterns, predict outcomes, or identify factors influencing process performance.

5. **Better support for data-driven decision-making**: Process cubes enable stakeholders to analyze processes based on real data, rather than relying solely on subjective knowledge or assumptions. This helps in making more informed decisions about process improvement, resource allocation, and strategic planning.

In summary, while traditional process mining approaches focus primarily on the control flow perspective, process cubes offer a multi-dimensional view of process data, enabling better analysis, visualization, and understanding of complex processes. They provide a powerful tool for supporting data-driven decision-making in process management and improvement efforts.
