Upon reviewing the event log for the "Procure-to-Pay" (P2P) process, several anomalies emerge across different process instances (cases). The standard P2P workflow typically follows this order:

1. **Create Purchase Requisition**
2. **Approve Purchase Requisition**
3. **Issue Purchase Order**
4. **Receive Goods**
5. **Vendor Invoice Received**
6. **Match Invoice to PO**
7. **Release Payment**
8. **Close Case**

Let’s analyze each case and highlight irregularities or anomalies in the process flow:

---

###  **Case 1001** – **No Anomalies**
- **Observation:** This case follows the typical P2P sequence with correctly ordered and appropriately timed steps.
- **Conclusion:** **No issues identified.** This case adheres well to the expected business process.

---

###  **Case 1002** – **Multiple Anomalies**
- **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Issue Purchase Order before Approval**
   - **Activity Order:**
     - *Create Requisition:* 2024-02-01 08:30  
     - *Issue Purchase Order:* 2024-02-01 08:40  
     - *Approve Requisition:* 2024-02-03 08:00 (**after PO**)
   - **Explanation:** A purchase order should never be issued before the requisition is formally approved, as this may lead to unauthorized or non-compliant purchases. This undermines control mechanisms.

2. **Invoice and Payment occurred before Approval and Goods Receipt**
   - *Vendor Invoice Received:* 2024-02-03 07:00  
   - *Release Payment:* 2024-02-03 07:15  
   - *Approval of Requisition:* 2024-02-03 08:00 (still after payment)  
   - *Receive Goods:* 2024-02-04 09:00  
   - **Explanation:** Payment was processed **before** the requisition was approved and **before** the goods were received. This poses significant financial risk as it may involve payment for unapproved or undelivered items.

- **Conclusion:** This sequence contains **multiple violations** of standard business controls, raising **compliance and audit concerns**.

---

###  **Case 1003** – **Delayed and Illogical Ordering**
- **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Payment released before Invoice Received or Goods Receipt**
   - *Release Payment:* 2024-02-08 11:00  
   - *Vendor Invoice Received:* 2024-02-09 12:00  
   - *Receive Goods:* 2024-02-10 13:00  
   - **Explanation:** Payment was issued a full day **before the invoice was even received**, and **two days before** the goods were confirmed to be received. This contradicts financial control principles meant to prevent pre-payment risks.
   
- **Conclusion:** The process flow is inconsistent with standard practices — especially the **early payment** — which can result in payment for goods not yet validated or delivered. This case shows **poor financial control**.

---

###  **Case 1004** – **Goods Received Before Purchase Order Issued**
- **Anomalies Identified:**

1. **Goods Receipt before Purchase Order issued**
   - *Receive Goods:* 2024-02-06 09:00  
   - *Issue Purchase Order:* 2024-02-06 09:15  
   - **Explanation:** Goods should not be accepted or received before a purchase order has been formally issued. This may suggest the transaction bypassed procurement controls or the PO was backdated.
   - This may result in **unauthorized purchases** and complications in supplier invoicing and auditing.

- **Conclusion:** This reflects a **control lapse** in the procurement process; receiving goods without a documented commitment can create **procurement and accounting discrepancies**.

###  **Summary of Anomalies:**

| Case ID | Anomaly Description                                                                                       | Problematic Because…                                                                                     |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1002    | PO issued before approval; Payment before invoice/goods; Approval after payment                           | Violates approval hierarchy and exposes company to payment fraud/risk                                     |
| 1003    | Payment before invoice and goods received                                                                 | Violates financial control principles; early payment without obligation confirmation                      |
| 1004    | Goods received before the purchase order                                                                  | Indicates purchase outside procurement policy; unauthorized goods receipt                                 |

###  **Best Practice Reminder:**
For strong internal controls and compliance, the P2P process must enforce the following:

- **Approvals must precede execution** (no PO before approval).
- **No goods should be accepted nor invoices paid until a PO exists and is matched to the goods/services delivered.**
- **Payment should occur only after successful 3-way match between PO, Goods Receipt, and Invoice.**

---

###  **Final Conclusion:**
Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 show notable deviations from standard P2P protocol, all of which indicate potential process weaknesses that could lead to **compliance violations, financial risk, or audit failure**. These should be investigated further and appropriately remediated.
