This query:

1. **`target_sequence` CTE**: Finds cases with the exact sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition'  'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' where each pair of consecutive activities has no intervening events (direct succession).

2. **`timed_cases` CTE**: Among those sequence cases, identifies cases where the specific 'Create Order'  'Confirm Order' pair in the sequence has >5 days elapsed, again ensuring direct succession.

3. **Final SELECT**: Returns **all events** from cases that do **NOT** meet both criteria (no exact sequence OR 5 days between Create/Confirm).

The result contains all events from "good" cases only, properly ordered by `case_id` and `timestamp`.
