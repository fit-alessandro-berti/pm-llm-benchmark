This dictionary represents the temporal profile for the global supply chain process:

- **Directly connected activities**: Pairs like `('SS', 'OP')` where one activity directly follows another.
- **Pairs separated by multiple steps**: Pairs like `('SS', 'RC')` where activities are connected through intermediate steps.

**Notes:**

- Times are in seconds.
- The average times (`average_time`) are computed based on the sum of average times of intermediate steps.
- The standard deviations (`standard_deviation`) are calculated using the square root of the sum of the variances (squared standard deviations) of the intermediate steps, assuming independence.

**Example Interpretations:**

- `('SS', 'OP')`:  
  - **Average time**: 86,400 seconds (1 day) between Supplier Selection and Order Placement.
  - **Standard deviation**: 43,200 seconds (0.5 day).
  
- `('SS', 'RC')`:  
  - **Average time**: 1,296,000 seconds (15 days) from Supplier Selection to Receive Components.
  - **Standard deviation**: 262,709 seconds (approximately 3.04 days).
  
- `('CA', 'WS')`:  
  - **Average time**: 103,680 seconds (1.2 days) from Component Assembly to Warehouse Storage.
  - **Standard deviation**: 25,920 seconds (0.3 day).

This temporal profile provides insights into the typical delays and variability between various steps in the supply chain process, helping identify areas where deviations may occur.
