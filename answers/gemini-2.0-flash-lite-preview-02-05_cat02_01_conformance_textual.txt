Here's an analysis of the provided event log cases, identifying and explaining potential process violations.

**Case 1:** This case follows the expected flow: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. There are no apparent violations in this case.

**Case 2:** This case has a violation. "Package items" occurs *before* "Authorize payment." According to the normative description, payment authorization should come before packaging. This violates the rule: "Package items" should only occur after authorization.

**Case 3:** This case has a violation. The process flow is Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order. The violation is that "Ship order" is performed *after* "Cancel order." The normative description explicitly states that shipping should never occur after a cancellation. The sequence "Authorize payment" also seems out of order for a cancellation scenario, since payment authorization should only happen if the inventory check is positive.

**Case 4:** This case adheres to the expected flow: Receive order, Check inventory, Cancel order, Close order. There are no apparent violations in this case.

**Case 5:** This case has a violation. "Ship order" occurs before "Package items."  According to the normative description, packaging must happen before shipping.
