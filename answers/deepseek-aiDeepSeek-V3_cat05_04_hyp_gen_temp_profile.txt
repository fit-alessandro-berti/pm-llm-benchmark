### Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - **Anomaly:** The average time is ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour.  
   - **Reason:** This could indicate an artificially rigid approval schedule, possibly due to automated systems enforcing fixed timelines without considering the complexity of individual claims.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - **Anomaly:** The average delay is 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days.  
   - **Reason:** This inconsistency might be due to resource bottlenecks, backlog in the notification process, or manual interventions causing delays.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - **Anomaly:** Claims are closed on average within 2 hours of assignment, with a standard deviation of 1 hour.  
   - **Reason:** This suggests some claims might be prematurely closed without proper evaluation or approval, possibly due to system errors or shortcuts in the process.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - **Anomaly:** The average time is only 5 minutes with a standard deviation of 1 minute.  
   - **Reason:** This rapid transition might indicate skipped steps or automated notifications being triggered too quickly, potentially bypassing necessary checks.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**  
   - Automated approval systems might be enforcing fixed timelines, ignoring the variability in claim complexity or required manual reviews.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**  
   - Resource constraints or manual processes in the notification step could lead to inconsistent delays, with some claims being prioritized over others.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**  
   - Claims might be automatically closed if they meet certain criteria, but the criteria could be too lenient, leading to premature closures without proper evaluation.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**  
   - Automated notifications might be triggered immediately after evaluation, without allowing time for additional reviews or approvals.

### Verification Approaches Using SQL Queries

1. **Identify Claims with Suspicious R to P Times:**
   ```sql
   WITH claim_times AS (
       SELECT 
           ce1.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'R' AND ce2.activity = 'P'
   )
   SELECT 
       claim_id,
       time_diff
   FROM claim_times
   WHERE time_diff NOT BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600; -- Outside 24-26 hours
   ```

2. **Analyze P to N Delays by Adjuster:**
   ```sql
   WITH notify_delays AS (
       SELECT 
           ce1.claim_id,
           ce1.resource AS adjuster_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS delay
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'P' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   )
   SELECT 
       adjuster_id,
       AVG(delay) AS avg_delay,
       STDDEV(delay) AS stdev_delay
   FROM notify_delays
   GROUP BY adjuster_id
   HAVING AVG(delay) > 604800 OR STDDEV(delay) > 172800; -- Delays > 7 days or high variability
   ```

3. **Check Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment:**
   ```sql
   WITH assign_close AS (
       SELECT 
           ce1.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'A' AND ce2.activity = 'C'
   )
   SELECT 
       claim_id,
       time_diff
   FROM assign_close
   WHERE time_diff < 7200; -- Closed within 2 hours of assignment
   ```

4. **Investigate Rapid E to N Transitions:**
   ```sql
   WITH evaluate_notify AS (
       SELECT 
           ce1.claim_id,
           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ce2.timestamp - ce1.timestamp)) AS time_diff
       FROM claim_events ce1
       JOIN claim_events ce2 ON ce1.claim_id = ce2.claim_id
       WHERE ce1.activity = 'E' AND ce2.activity = 'N'
   )
   SELECT 
       claim_id,
       time_diff
   FROM evaluate_notify
   WHERE time_diff < 300; -- Notified within 5 minutes of evaluation
   ```

These queries can help pinpoint specific claims, adjusters, or patterns that contribute to the anomalies, enabling further investigation and process improvement.
