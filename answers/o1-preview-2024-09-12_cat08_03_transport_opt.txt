**1. Process Discovery and Conformance Checking**

**a. Data Preprocessing and Integration**

To analyze Speedy Parcels' operations using process mining, it is essential to integrate data from the various sources into a unified event log. The steps involved are:

- **Data Extraction and Cleaning**: Extract data from Vehicle GPS Trackers, Driver Handheld Scanners, Dispatch System, and Maintenance Logs. Clean the data to remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle missing values.

- **Event Standardization**: Standardize event formats across data sources. Create a consistent schema with attributes such as Timestamp, Event Type, Case ID, Activity, Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Package ID, Location, Speed, and Notes.

- **Case Identification**: Define cases for analysis. In this context, a case could be a **Vehicle-Day** (e.g., V12-20241205), representing all activities of a vehicle on a particular day. For package-level analysis, cases could also be individual **Package IDs**.

- **Timestamp Alignment**: Ensure that all timestamps are in a uniform time zone and format. Order events chronologically within each case.

- **Activity Labeling**: Normalize activity names for consistency. Map similar events from different sources to unified activity labels (e.g., 'Depart Depot' from GPS data and 'Start Shift' from Driver data).

- **Data Enrichment**: Augment the event log with additional attributes:
  - **Planned vs. Actual**: Integrate planned routes and schedules from the Dispatch System to compare with actual events.
  - **Geospatial Data**: Include location data (latitudes, longitudes) and map them to geographic areas or zones.
  - **Traffic Information**: Incorporate historical traffic data if available, to correlate with delays.

**Challenges Encountered:**

- **Data Inconsistencies**: Different systems may record events at varying levels of granularity and with different nomenclatures.

- **Synchronization Issues**: Aligning events from disparate systems that may have slight time discrepancies due to clock differences.

- **Data Volume and Complexity**: Handling large volumes of data over six months requires robust data processing capabilities.

- **Privacy and Security**: Ensuring that sensitive data (e.g., driver identities, customer locations) are handled in compliance with data protection regulations.

**b. Process Discovery using Process Mining Algorithms**

- **Visualization of End-to-End Delivery Process**:

  - Use process mining tools (e.g., Disco, Celonis, ProM) to apply discovery algorithms such as the **Alpha Miner**, **Heuristic Miner**, or **Fuzzy Miner**.

  - Generate **process models** that represent the actual flows of activities, including sequences, loops, and parallelisms.

  - Visualize the **control-flow** from 'Start Shift' to 'End Shift', capturing all intermediate activities like 'Depart Depot', 'Travel', 'Arrive Customer', 'Delivery Attempt', 'Delivery Success/Failed', 'Unscheduled Stops', 'Maintenance Events', and 'Return to Depot'.

  - Incorporate **timestamps** to analyze the duration of activities and transitions.

- **Incorporating Additional Perspectives**:

  - **Performance Perspective**: Annotate the process model with performance metrics like average times between activities.
