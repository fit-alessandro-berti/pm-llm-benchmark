# Visualization Description

This is a **Sankey-style flow diagram** showing the progression of traffic violations through different enforcement stages over time (from 2000 to 2013).

## Structure

The diagram has **three horizontal levels**:

1. **Top level**: "Send Fine" - represented by dense gray vertical bars
2. **Middle level**: "Insert Fine Notification" - shown in light pink/salmon color
3. **Bottom level**: "Send for Credit Collection" - also in pink/salmon tones

## Flow Patterns

- **Gray flows** connect the top level (Send Fine) to the middle level (Insert Fine Notification), showing which fines received notifications
- **Pink/red flows** connect the middle level to the bottom level (Send for Credit Collection), indicating which notified fines escalated to collections

## Key Observations

1. **Volume concentration**: The gray bars at the top are very dense and concentrated, suggesting high volumes of fines being issued
2. **Filtering effect**: Not all fines flow to notifications, and not all notifications flow to collections - there's significant drop-off at each stage
3. **Temporal span**: The visualization covers approximately 13 years (2000-2013)
4. **Color coding**: 
   - Gray = initial fine issuance
   - Light pink/salmon = intermediate and final collection stages
5. **Opacity variations**: Some flows are more transparent (lighter) while others are more opaque (darker red), possibly indicating different volumes or statuses

This type of visualization effectively shows the attrition and escalation of enforcement actions over time.
