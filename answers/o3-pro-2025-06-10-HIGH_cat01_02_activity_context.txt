Why the new names?  

1. Verify Documents  
   • “Initial Document Verification” – first check performed immediately after the ticket is opened.  
   • “Initial Physical Document Verification (Walk-in)” – same step but explicitly physical because the customer is in a branch.  
   • “Document Re-verification …” – second occurrence within a case; context field or a preceding “Submit Additional” / “Adjust Account” indicates that the same documents must be reviewed again.

2. Call Customer  
   • “Call Customer – Request Missing Documents” – purpose taken from comment “agent calls to request missing docs.”  
   • “Call Customer – Clarify Account Discrepancy” – first call in C002, comment says “clarify account discrepancy.”  
   • “Follow-up Call – Confirm Adjustments” – second call in C002, comment “confirm adjustments made.”  
   • “Call Customer – Ask to Return to Branch” – branch officer calls a walk-in customer to come back.

3. Submit Additional  
   • Clarified as “Customer Uploads Additional Documents” to make it action-oriented and symmetrical with the two verification steps it bridges.

4. Adjust Account  
   • “Internal Account Adjustment” added word “Internal” for clarity; no duplicate within a case, but now clearly marked as a back-office corrective step.

These renamings make each repeated action semantically unique, allowing analysts or miners to distinguish “same-named” events that actually play different roles in the workflow.
