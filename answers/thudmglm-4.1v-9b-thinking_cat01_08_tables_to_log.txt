### Key Assumptions and Notes:
1. **Multiple Events per Order**: For orders with multiple line items (e.g., 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005), an "Item Picked" event is created for each line item with its respective `item_picking_date`.  
2. **Missing Data for Order 1004**: Order 1004 has no entries in the `Order Lines`, `Delivery`, `Invoice`, or `Payments` tables. Thus, no events (e.g., item picking, dispatch, invoice, payment) are included for this order.  
3. **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered chronologically by timestamp for each case, reflecting the real process flow from order creation to payment.  
4. **Resource/Actor Inference**: Resources (e.g., salesperson, warehouse staff, carrier) are inferred from the respective tables (e.g., `sales_person_id` maps to `SP-001` via the `Resources` table).  
5. **Lack of Attributes**: When attributes are missing (e.g., some delivery notes), those fields are left blank or noted (e.g., `| | | | <blank> |`).  


This event log integrates all tables, maintains chronological correctness, and includes all required columns, making it suitable for process mining. Studies fields where data was missing (e.g., dead of order 1004) are noted to transparency.
