**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the event log data for each case (ticket) to determine their total resolution time. We will then compare these times to identify which cases have longer resolutions than average. Next, we will explore potential root causes and propose solutions based on those insights.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Resolution Time for Each Case

First, let's calculate the total time taken for each case to go from receiving the ticket to closing it:

- **Case 101:**
  - Received at: 2024-03-01 08:00
  - Closed at: 2024-03-01 10:15
  - Total time: 2 hours and 15 minutes = 135 minutes

- **Case 102:**
  - Received at: 2024-03-01 08:05
  - Closed at: 2024-03-02 09:15
  - Total time: 1 day, 1 hour and 10 minutes = 870 minutes

- **Case 103:**
  - Received at: 2024-03-01 08:10
  - Closed at: 2024-03-01 09:30
  - Total time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes

- **Case 104:**
  - Received at: 2024-03-01 08:20
  - Closed at: 2024-03-02 08:30
  - Total time: 1 day, 1 hour and 10 minutes = 870 minutes

- **Case 105:**
  - Received at: 2024-03-01 08:25
  - Closed at: 2024-03-03 09:30
  - Total time: 2 days, 11 hours and 5 minutes = 1765 minutes

### Step 2: Identify Cases with Longer Resolution Times

From the calculations, we can see that cases 102, 104, and 105 have significantly longer resolution times compared to others. Specifically:
- Case 102: 870 minutes
- Case 104: 870 minutes
- Case 105: 1765 minutes

### Step 3: Analyze Potential Root Causes and Propose Solutions

#### Case 102
- **Escalation to Level-2 Agent:** The ticket was escalated after receiving an initial response, possibly due to complex issues or lack of clear resolution paths at Level-1. This adds significant time.
- **Investigation Delay:** Investigation took a considerable amount of time without immediate resolution.

#### Case 104
- **Long Waiting Times:** Multiple escalations and delays occurred after the initial investigation, leading to prolonged waiting times.
- **Complexity of Issues:** The issues might have been intricate, requiring thorough analysis before resolution.

#### Case 105
- **Escalation Before Resolution:** Escalation happened even before resolving the issue at Level-1, adding additional time.
- **Extended Investigation:** The investigation process itself was lengthy, possibly due to lack of clear directives or insufficient data.

### Potential Solutions and Recommendations:

1. **Streamline Escalation Processes:** Implement a more efficient escalation protocol where escalations are justified with clear criteria and communicated promptly to the receiving team.
2. **Improve Initial Assessment and Triage:** Enhance training for support agents on effective triage, reducing unnecessary delays in determining ticket priority.
3. **Reduce Investigation Times:** Encourage faster resolution paths at Level-1 by improving tools and methodologies for quicker issue identification and addressing common problems directly.
4. **Enhance Communication:** Foster better communication channels between levels of support teams to ensure timely coordination and reduce bottlenecks.
5. **Prioritize Complex Cases:** Develop a system where complex cases are flagged immediately for escalation but with clear guidelines on the expected timeline for each step.

By addressing these root causes, the overall efficiency of the customer support ticket resolution process can be improved, leading to reduced cycle times and enhanced service quality.
