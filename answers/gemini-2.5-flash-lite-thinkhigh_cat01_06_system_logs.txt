### Explanation of Logic

The transformation from the raw system log to the process mining event log was guided by identifying distinct work sessions or tasks performed by the user.

**1. Case Identification Logic:**
A "case" was defined as a coherent sequence of user activities focused on a specific artifact (like a document) or a primary work context (like email or a general application window). The primary drivers for identifying new cases were:
*   **Context Switching (`SWITCH` events):** When a user switches from one application or document to another, it generally signifies the end of one work session and the potential start of another.
*   **Focus on a New Artifact (`FOCUS` on a new document title):** Starting to interact with a document that hasn't been the primary focus for a while also indicates a new work session, especially after significant interruptions or work on other items.
*   **Sequential Focus on Different Artifacts:** Events were grouped into cases based on the `Window` title. For example, all activities within `Document1.docx` formed one case, activities within `Email - Inbox` formed another, and so on.
*   **Resumption of Work:** The log shows a return to `Document1.docx` (Case 5) and `Quarterly_Report.docx` (Case 6) after significant periods of work on other applications. These are treated as new sessions or instances of working on those artifacts, hence assigned new `Case ID`s. The initial `FOCUS` on `Quarterly_Report.docx` at `08:59:50` is grouped with the later interaction with the same document (Case 6) as representing the overall work related to that report, despite the intervening activities.

Based on this, six distinct cases were identified:
*   **Case 1:** Work on `Document1.docx` (initial session).
*   **Case 2:** Handling an email in Google Chrome.
*   **Case 3:** Reviewing a PDF document (`Report_Draft.pdf`) in Adobe Acrobat.
*   **Case 4:** Updating a budget in Microsoft Excel (`Budget_2024.xlsx`).
*   **Case 5:** A second session of work on `Document1.docx`.
*   **Case 6:** Work on `Quarterly_Report.docx` (including an initial focus and a later active work session).

**2. Activity Naming Logic:**
Raw system actions were mapped to more descriptive and standardized process activities:
*   `FOCUS`: Transformed into `Focus Document` to indicate the start of user attention on a specific artifact.
*   `TYPING`: Generalized to `Type Content` for any text input activity, whether in a document, email, or other field.
*   `SAVE`: Kept as `Save Document` as it clearly represents saving work.
*   `SWITCH`: Standardized to `Switch Context` to signify a change in the user's primary application or document focus.
*   `CLICK` events with specific `Action` attributes were mapped to more specific activities like `Open Email`, `Reply Email`, and `Send Email`.
*   `SCROLL`: Mapped to `Scroll Document` to describe page navigation.
*   `HIGHLIGHT`: Mapped to `Highlight Text`, indicating user annotation.
*   `CLOSE`: Mapped to `Close Document` to signify the termination of interaction with a specific artifact.

**3. Event Attributes:**
*   **`Case ID`**: A sequential integer assigned to each identified work session.
*   **`Activity Name`**: The standardized name derived from the original system action.
*   **`Timestamp`**: The original timestamp of the event, crucial for ordering within cases and across the log.
*   **`Application`**: The name of the application where the activity occurred.
*   **`Window Title`**: The specific document or window being interacted with, which was key for case identification.
*   **`Original Action`**: The raw action type from the system log, kept for traceability.
