Certainly! The provided visualization is a flowchart that outlines various processes related to order management in a business context. Here's a detailed explanation of each part of the flowchart:
General Structure:
Start and End: Each process begins with a "Start" node and ends with an "End" node.
Processes: Each box represents a specific process or task.
Connections: Arrows indicate the flow of processes, with associated times indicating the duration in milliseconds (ms).
Objects: The number of objects processed is mentioned at the top of each initial node.
Breakdown of Processes:
VendorInvoiceItem (1.2M objects)
Start -> Send Order (Overall: 5.2M) -> End
This process starts with handling vendor invoices and culminates in sending an order. It takes 600ms to initiate and 150ms to complete.
ReturnOrderItem (0.8M objects)
Start -> Check Stock (Overall: 1.1M) -> End
This process deals with return orders, starting with checking the stock. It takes 450ms to start and 250ms to complete.
PurchaseRequisitionItem (2.0M objects)
Start -> Create Requisition (Overall: 3.0M) -> Approve Requisition (Overall: 5.7M) -> Approve Payment (Overall: 1.5M) -> Create Invoice (Overall: 2.0M) -> End
This process involves creating a purchase requisition, which then needs approval, followed by payment approval, and finally creating an invoice. Each step has its own duration: 300ms for starting, 250ms for creating the requisition, 500ms for approval, 800ms for payment approval, and 100ms for creating the invoice.
SalesOrderItem (3.9M objects)
Start -> Create Order (Overall: 8.5M) -> Pack Goods (Overall: 2.0M) -> Ship Goods (Overall: 1.8M) -> Confirm Delivery (Overall: 1.7M) -> Close Order (Overall: 1.7M) -> End
This process starts with creating a sales order, followed by packing the goods, shipping them, confirming delivery, and finally closing the order. The durations are 400ms for starting, 300ms for creating the order, 200ms for packing, 220ms for shipping, 300ms for confirming delivery, and 180ms for closing the order.
PurchaseOrderItem (5.0M objects)
Start -> Create Order (Overall: 8.5M) -> Pack Goods (Overall: 2.0M) -> Ship Goods (Overall: 1.8M) -> Confirm Delivery (Overall: 1.7M) -> Close Order (Overall: 1.7M) -> End
This process is similar to the SalesOrderItem process, starting with creating a purchase order and following the same steps as sales orders. The durations are 350ms for starting, 300ms for creating the order, 200ms for packing, 220ms for shipping, 300ms for confirming delivery, and 180ms for closing the order.
Summary:
The flowchart illustrates the lifecycle of different types of orders and requisitions within a business, from initiation to completion.
Each process has specific steps with associated times, indicating how long each step takes in the workflow.
The "Overall" figures might represent cumulative metrics or total processing times across multiple instances or scenarios.
This visualization helps in understanding the sequence, duration, and complexity of each process in the order management system.
