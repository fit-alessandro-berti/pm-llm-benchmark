Below is one possible answer. In this example we assume that the orderfulfillment process is strictly sequential, so that each activity must appear exactly once and in the following order:

RO  CA  RI  PI  QC  PO  GSL  D  IC  RP

That is:

• Every case begins when a customer order is received (RO) and then proceeds with checking availability (CA); after availability is confirmed, the items are reserved (RI); next the items are picked (PI); then a quality check (QC) is performed; after which the order is packed (PO); then a shipping label is generated (GSL) and the package is dispatched (D); finally, an invoice is generated (IC) and payment is recorded (RP).

We use the following declarative constraints:

1. Equivalence – For example, we assume that the activities Invoice Customer (IC) and Record Payment (RP) occur the same number of times (i.e. if one occurs then so does the other).  
Equivalence: {('IC', 'RP')}

2. Always Before – Every time an activity (other than RO) occurs, its predecessor in the sequence must have already occurred. For instance, every time Check Availability (CA) occurs, Receive Order (RO) must have already occurred. This yields the following pairs:  
Always Before:  
{('CA', 'RO'),
 ('RI', 'CA'),
 ('PI', 'RI'),
 ('QC', 'PI'),
 ('PO', 'QC'),
 ('GSL', 'PO'),
 ('D', 'GSL'),
 ('IC', 'D'),
 ('RP', 'IC')}

3. Always After – Every time an activity occurs, one of the subsequent events must eventually be executed. For example, every time RO occurs, CA must eventually follow; every time CA occurs, RI will eventually be executed; and so on. That is:  
Always After:  
{('RO', 'CA'),
 ('CA', 'RI'),
 ('RI', 'PI'),
 ('PI', 'QC'),
 ('QC', 'PO'),
 ('PO', 'GSL'),
 ('GSL', 'D'),
 ('D', 'IC'),
 ('IC', 'RP')}

4. Never Together – In this strict sequential process every valid case follows the complete sequence so no two activities are completely incompatible (i.e. never occurring together). In our example we leave this set empty:  
Never Together: set()

5. Activity Occurrences – We assume that each activity must appear exactly once per case. That is:  
activ_freq: {  
'RO': {1},  
'CA': {1},  
'RI': {1},  
'PI': {1},  
'QC': {1},  
'PO': {1},  
'GSL': {1},  
'D' : {1},  
'IC': {1},  
'RP': {1}  
}

6. Directly-Follows Constraints – Because the process is strict, one activity is immediately followed by the next one in the order. Thus, if an activity occurs, the following activity occurs immediately after. For example, RO is always immediately followed by CA, CA by RI, and so on. That gives:  
Directly Follows:  
{('RO', 'CA'),
 ('CA', 'RI'),
 ('RI', 'PI'),
 ('PI', 'QC'),
 ('QC', 'PO'),
 ('PO', 'GSL'),
 ('GSL', 'D'),
 ('D', 'IC'),
 ('IC', 'RP')}

Putting it all together, one correct answer is:

Keep in mind that depending on the actual process and observed variations, you might relax some of these constraints (for example, allowing multiple occurrences or optional/non-immediate follow-ups). This solution, however, illustrates the full usage of the provided keys in the log skeleton.
