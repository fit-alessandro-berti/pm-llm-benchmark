Okay, let's tackle this BPMN-like textual model creation based on the five interviews provided. First, I need to parse each interviewer's account and extract key elements: activities, sequence flows, decision points (gateways), participants/roles, artifacts, inputs/outputs, exceptions, etc.

Starting with Mary's Account from Interview 1. She describes a step-by-step process when an invoice arrives. The first thing is checking for a valid PO number. If missing, send back to supplier; if present, log into the accounting system. Then forward to purchasing dept for confirmation of receipt. After that, match line items against PO. If discrepancies, escalate to her team or supervisor. Once resolved and approved by manager, schedule payment.

Dan's Interview 2 adds his perspective: he checks invoice from AP, compares with PO (opened in browser?), contacts Mary if issues like missing PO, then confirms back. Assumes movement to manager after his confirmation.

Carlos mentions being the last step, receiving a notification after PO match and Dan's approval. He approves or investigates discrepancies. After approval, it goes back to AP for payment scheduling.

Rita talks about handling exceptions when Mary can't reconcile invoices or there are missing POs. She contacts suppliers, coordinates between departments. Sometimes handles informal contracts by creating retrospective PO or rejecting.

Karen inquires if involved: loops her in when there's issues like missing PO or discrepancies. She helps resolve by checking contracts and informing AP/Purchasing.

Now, integrating these perspectives. Let's outline the process steps:

1. Invoice receipt (Mary's step).
2. Check for valid PO.
   - If no PO: send back to supplier (Mary's action). But Dan mentions if invoice has a missing PO, he contacts Mary. Wait, Mary's first step is checking and sending back if no PO. Then after logging into the system, forwarding to purchasing dept for confirmation of receipt. So maybe:

Activity 1: Receive Invoice
   - Check PO number.
     - Gateway A (Mary's Account): If valid PO?
       -> Proceed to Activity 2: Log into Accounting System & Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation.
         Then after Purchase confirms:
           -> Match invoice line items with PO (Mary's Action).
             Decision point B: Discrepancy?
               Yes: Escalate to Supervisor or contact purchasing team. This might involve Rita if exceptions occur.
               No: Proceed to Activity 3: Forward to Manager for Approval.

Purchasing dept (Dan) steps in here. So after Mary logs and forwards, Purchase confirms receipt. Then Dan checks invoice against PO. If discrepancy like extra units or missing info, contacts Mary. Once confirmed, sends approval trigger to manager.

Then Carlos's role as the final approver. After Mary's confirmation from purchasing and any exceptions resolved (possibly involving Rita), Carlos approves or investigates further.

Karen steps in when there's a loop between AP and suppliers for issues not resolvable by others.

Now, mapping out dependencies and gateways:

- The main flow splits at Gateway A: valid PO? If yes, proceed to Purchase Confirmation. If no, send back to supplier (but sender here is Mary). But Mary's initial step sends it back if no PO. So perhaps the first decision point after receiving invoice determines path.

Wait, in Mary's description, when she receives an invoice by email, checks for a valid PO. Then:

If invalid: send back to supplier.
If valid: log into system and forward to purchasing dept.

So maybe Activity 1 is Receive Invoice  Check PO (Gateway A) splits into two paths:
a) No PO  Send Back to Supplier (Activity 2A)
b) Yes PO  Proceed to Log & Forward to Purchasing (Activity 2B)

In Activity 2B, after Purchase confirms receipt, then match line items. If discrepancy, escalate via Gateway C: Escalate Discrepancy? Then perhaps loop back for resolution.

Dan's part comes into play here. Once the invoice is in Mary's system and forwarded to purchasing dept (Activity 2B), Dan would check against PO. If all correct, send confirmation to Mary/AP clerk. So maybe after Purchase confirms receipt (Activity 3?), then Decision point B: Check Invoice Details?

Wait, perhaps Activity 3 is "Purchase Dept Confirms Receipt". Then Gateway D: All details match? Proceed to Manager Approval. Else, escalate discrepancy.

But Mary's account mentions that if there's a discrepancy like incorrect pricing or missing items, she emails purchasing team to clarify. So after Purchase dept confirms receipt (Activity 3), then check invoice against PO. If all good, send email trigger for manager approval (Mary's Action). But Dan says he might contact Mary if the PO is missing.

Wait, perhaps there's a loop here. Let me re-express:

After Invoice Received  Check PO  Valid PO path:
   - Log into system & Forward to Purchasing dept.
     Purchase confirms receipt  Match invoice line items with PO.
       If match  Send email trigger for Manager Approval (Mary's Action).
       If discrepancy  Escalate via Gateway E: Escalate Discrepancy. This could involve Rita if it's an exception beyond Mary's control.

But in Dan's account, he might contact Mary if there's a missing PO or other issues that Purchase can't resolve on their own. So perhaps after purchasing dept confirms receipt (Activity 3), but before matching line items, there is another check by Dan? Or maybe the purchase confirmation and invoice checking are part of his role.

Alternatively, Activity 2B: Forward to Purchasing Dept for Confirmation. Then in Purchasing's process:

- Purchase checks details  If discrepancy (like extra units) or missing PO  Contact Mary (Dan contacting Mary).
   - So perhaps after purchasing dept receives invoice from AP, they check against the original order.
     Decision point D: All correct?
       Yes  Send confirmation to AP clerk. Then Activity 4: Forward to Manager for Approval.
       No  Either contact Mary if discrepancy in details or escalate via Rita if needed.

But Mary's account mentions that after logging into system and forwarding, purchasing dept confirms receipt. So perhaps that's a given once Purchase checks and agrees with the invoice received from AP. But Dan's role is part of this check: he might find discrepancies not caught by Mary initially (like missing PO) which then requires him to contact her.

This seems conflicting between Mary's and Dan's accounts. Need to reconcile:

Mary says that after logging into system, she forwards it to purchasing dept for confirmation. Then Purchase confirms receipt. So perhaps once AP logs the invoice and sends to Purchasing, that's a step where purchase dept can confirm or reject based on info from PO and their own records.

But if there's an issue like missing PO (as Dan mentions), then he would contact Mary because the system doesn't have that information yet—it's still in Mary's hands. So perhaps Purchase's confirmation is only possible once AP has logged it, but discrepancies found by purchasing dept might trigger different actions.

So maybe after Activity 2B: Forward to Purchasing for Confirmation:

- Purchase checks invoice against PO and other details.
   - If any issues (like missing info), escalate via Gateway D1: Contact Mary if issue is with information (PO missing) or escalate exception through Rita otherwise.
     For example, if the PO number is missing in Dan's check, he contacts Mary. Else, maybe handle discrepancy internally.

But this seems complicated. Let's try to structure it step by step:

Main Flow:

1. Receive Invoice (by email)
   - Check for valid Purchase Order (Gateway A: Valid PO?)
     a) Yes  Proceed
        Activity 2: Log into Accounting System & Forward to Purchasing Dept.
           -> Purchase Dept confirms receipt (Activity 3)
             Decision point B: All details match?
               Yes  Send email trigger to Manager (Mary's Action, Activity 4)
               No  Escalate discrepancy. Depending on type:
                 - If minor issues resolved by Mary: Escalate via Gateway C
                 - If major or missing info: Escalated to Supervisor Rita for resolution.

     b) No  Send back to Supplier (Activity 2A)

In Activity 3, Purchase dept confirms receipt. Then in Decision point B:

If all details match:
   Activity 4: Forward to Manager (Carlos's Approval)
      -> After approval, return to AP for payment scheduling.
   
Else if discrepancy exists after purchase confirmation:
   Gateway C: Can Mary resolve?
       Yes  Mary resolves and returns to Purchase dept check
       No  Escalated via Rita to handle exceptions.

But wait, Mary's Action here is sending back escalated invoice? Or perhaps in the case of discrepancies found by purchasing dept (Dan's role), if it's something like extra units, Dan contacts Mary. Then after resolution, AP sends for payment scheduling.

Alternatively, Activity 3: Purchase confirms receipt  Check Invoice against PO and other details.
   Decision point D: All correct?
       Yes  Send to Manager
       No  If discrepancy is minor (handled by Mary), she resolves it then return to purchase dept check. Else escalate via Rita.

But Mary's account mentions that after logging, she forwards to purchasing dept for confirmation of receipt. So Purchase's confirmation might be automatic once AP logs the invoice into their system and sends a signal to Dan? Or perhaps when PA receives email from AP (Mary), they can confirm in their own records if it matches PO details stored.

This is getting complicated. Let's try another approach: map each stakeholder's role as per the interviews:

- Mary handles initial receipt, checks for valid PO, logs invoices, forwards to purchasing dept.
- Dan (Purchasing Officer) reviews invoice against purchase order once received by PA, contacts DA if discrepancies or missing info, confirms details which trigger manager approval.
- Carlos is the final approver in his department after all prior steps are done. He approves or investigates further based on information from earlier steps and any exceptions resolved.
- Rita handles exceptional cases where invoices can't be reconciled (like informal services without a PO) by creating retrospective POs or rejecting them with departmental head approval.
- Karen loops her into issues like missing PO numbers, pricing discrepancies to ensure suppliers correct their submissions.

So the process model should include:

1. Receive Invoice  Check Validity of Purchase Order  
   - If valid: Proceed to log and forward to purchasing dept for receipt confirmation.
     -> Once confirmed by purchase dept (Dan's step), check invoice details against PO.
       Decision point B:
         a) All correct? Then trigger Manager Approval (Carlos).
         b) Discrepancy exists. Depending on type:
             i) Minor: Escalate to Mary or Rita as per rules mentioned in interviews?
             ii) Major/Informal service/Purchase missing info: Escalated to Dan if purchase dept can't handle, else to Rita for exceptions.
   - If invalid PO  Send back to supplier.

2. Manager's approval (Carlos) leads into payment scheduling by AP.

3. Exceptions handled by Rita:
   - When Mary or purchasing dept cannot reconcile invoices due to missing data, pricing issues not resolvable without RITA's intervention: create retrospective PO with department head or reject invoice.
   - Karen steps in when there's a need for supplier involvement beyond what Rita can handle (like providing corrected info).

Now, constructing the BPMN-like textual model:

Start Event  Receive Invoice.

Gateway 1: Check Purchase Order?
Yes:
   Activity: Log and Forward to Purchasing Dept.
       -> Purchase Receipt Confirmation by Dan.
           Gateway 2: Validate Invoice Details against PO?
             Yes:
               Send Email Trigger for Manager Approval (Carlos).
                 After approval, proceed to Payment Scheduling.
             No:
               Escalate Discrepancy. Depending on discrepancy type:
                   - If handled internally (Mary's involvement):
                     Escalation via Mary  Return to Purchase dept confirmation loop.
                   - Else (handled by Rita or Karen):
                     Escalation through Rita  Resolve exception and return.

No at Gateway 1: Send Back to Supplier.

Purchase Dept Confirmation is done by Dan. So after PA logs invoice, they confirm receipt which triggers DA's involvement if needed.

Wait, Mary's process mentions that once logged into the system (by AP), she forwards it to purchasing dept for confirmation of received goods/services. Then purchase dept confirms this and proceeds with checking details against PO.

So Purchase Dept Confirmation is a step where Dan checks everything matches PO from their records? Or perhaps when PA receives invoice via email from AP, they can confirm receipt based on existing data.

But in Mary's case, after logging the invoice into her system (which would include the original info), she sends it to purchasing dept. Then purchase dept confirms whether they received the goods/services as per the PO linked with this invoice.

So Purchase Dept's confirmation is a step that might involve Dan verifying details against their records or existing data in AP's logs, which Mary already processed.

But according to Mary's account, after logging into system and forwarding to purchasing dept for receipt confirmation. So perhaps "Purchase Receipt Confirmation" by PA (Dan) occurs automatically once the invoice reaches them? Or maybe it's a manual step where Dan confirms that they received what was ordered based on purchase order data in his system.

If that's automated upon receiving from AP, then Purchase dept's confirmation is part of their process and doesn't require intervention. But according to Mary, she forwards it after logging into her system for purchasing department to confirm receipt. So maybe this "forwarding" includes a step where PA checks if the invoice matches what they received based on PO details.

Alternatively, once AP logs the invoice (Mary's action), it's sent to Purchase dept which then confirms or rejects acceptance of payment obligation by matching with their own records.

In any case, after Mary's forwarding to purchasing dept and receipt confirmation by Dan, next step is verifying line items against PO. If all matches, proceed for manager approval; else escalate discrepancy.

Now, integrating Karen's role: when discrepancies exist beyond what Mary can handle (like missing PO), then PA (Dan) might contact her if the issue isn't resolvable without supplier intervention. Otherwise, Rita handles exceptions requiring retrospective PO or rejection with department head approval.

So after Purchase dept confirms receipt and checks invoice details:

Decision point B: All correct?
Yes  Send to Manager for Approval.
No:
   Escalate via two possible paths based on discrepancy type (as per Mary and Dan's accounts):
      i) If the issue is about missing information or minor discrepancies, escalate through Mary. But Mary's role here might involve her resolving it before returning to Purchase dept confirmation loop?
      ii) Else, escalated to Rita for exception handling.
   After resolution by either route, return to Purchase dept to confirm again?

This seems a bit unclear. Let's try to outline the possible paths:

Main Flow:
1. Receive Invoice  Check PO
   - Valid: Proceed to Log & Forward to Purchasing Dept (Mary's Activity)
      -> Purchase Dept Confirmation (Dan's Role)  Verify Details against PO
         • All Correct?  Send Email Trigger for Manager Approval (Carlos's Action)
         • Discrepancy Exists:
             – If discrepancy is minor or can be resolved by Mary: Escalate to Mary. After resolution, loop back to Purchase dept confirmation.
             – Else, escalate through Rita to resolve exception. Then return to Purchase dept confirmation.

   - Invalid PO  Send Back to Supplier (Activity)

2. Manager Approval  Schedule Payment with AP

Exceptions:
- When discrepancies are not resolvable without supplier intervention or require department head approval: Escalated via Rita's path.
  • After resolution by Rita, invoice returns to Purchase dept for final check and proceeds.

Karen's involvement occurs when there's a need to contact the supplier beyond what's handled by Mary (e.g., missing PO)  loop her in. So perhaps under some discrepancy types, after Dan contacts Karen if it's something like pricing issues which she can verify against contracts.

This is quite complex with multiple decision points and possible loops for exceptions. The textual model needs to capture these flows while noting ambiguities where necessary.

Finalizing the BPMN-like structure:

Start  Receive Invoice
   • Gateway 1: Check Purchase Order?
      Yes:
         Activity: Log & Forward to Purchasing Dept (Mary)
             • Next, Purchase Receipt Confirmation by Dan.
               • Decision point B: Validate Invoice Details?
                 Yes:
                   Send Email Trigger for Manager Approval (Carlos)
                     After approval  Schedule Payment with AP
                 No:
                   Escalate Discrepancy. Depending on type:
                       - If minor and resolvable internally  Escalate to Mary. Upon resolution, loop back to Purchase dept confirmation.
                       - Else  Escalated via Rita for exception handling. Post-resolution, return to Purchase dept confirmation.

      No:
         Send Back to Supplier

Exceptions handled by Rita involve cases where invoices can't be reconciled (informal services without PO) requiring retrospective PO creation or rejection with department head approval.

Karen's role is looped in when discrepancies like missing info require supplier intervention beyond Mary/Rita. So under some discrepancy types, escalate through Karen after initial escalation fails.
</think>

**BPMN-like Textual Process Model:**

**Start Event  Receive Invoice  
Gateway 1 (Check Purchase Order [Valid/Invalid]):**
- **Yes (Valid PO):**
  - **Activity:** Log & Forward to Purchasing Dept. (Mary's Role)
    - **Purchase Receipt Confirmation by Dan (Purchasing Officer).**
      - **Decision Point B (Validate Invoice Details vs. PO?):**
        - **Yes  Send Email Trigger for Manager Approval (Carlos’s Action).**  
          *Sequence Flow:* After validation, send approval request to Carlos; post-approval, schedule payment with Accounts Payable.
        - **No  Escalate Discrepancy:**  
          - **Gateway C (Discrepancy Type):**
            - **Minor/Resolvable by Mary:** Escalate internally. On resolution, loop back for Purchase dept confirmation.  
              *Artifact:* Resolution email/document; participants: Mary & Dan.
            - **Major/Informal Service/Purchase Missing Info:** Escalate to Rita (Exceptions Supervisor) for retrospective PO creation/rejection with department head approval.  
              *Artifact:* Exception report; participant: Rita.
          - **Escalation via Karen (Supplier Liaison):** If pricing discrepancy requires supplier verification beyond Mary/Rita’s scope, loop Karen into resolve and re-submit invoice after correction.  
              *Artifact:* Supplier correction document; participants: Karen & Dan.
  - **Activity:** Send Back to Supplier (Mary’s Action).  
    *Artifact:* Request for details email/PO.

- **No (Invalid PO):** Directly send back to supplier with request for valid PO.  
  *Gateway 2.*

**Post-Manager Approval  Schedule Payment with AP.**

**Exception Handling by Rita:**
- **Case A:** Informal services without formal PO  Create retrospective PO with department head approval or reject invoice after consultation.
- **Case B:** Critical discrepancies (e.g., budget mismatches)  Escalate to senior management for resolution.

**Karen’s Involvement:**
- Loop in Karen only when supplier corrections exceed Mary/Rita’s capacity, such as repeated missing/incorrect PO details. After correction, return to Purchase dept approval loop.

**Notes on Ambiguities:**  
1. **Discrepancy Escalation Paths:** Minor issues resolved by Mary; major/external cases escalated via Rita/Karen based on contextual severity (e.g., budget vs. supplier communication).  
2. **Purchase Dept Confirmation:** Assumed automated post-AP logging, but Dan may intervene for missing data or pricing mismatches.  
3. **Manager’s Approval Trigger:** System-generated email ensures Carlos receives the invoice; rejection requires investigation before re-submission.

**Summary Flow:**

1. Invoice Received  Valid PO?  
   - Yes: Log/Forward to Purchase Dept  Confirm Receipt by Dan  Validate Details?  
     - All Correct: Manager Approval (Carlos)  Schedule Payment.  
     - Discrepancy: Escalate via Mary/Rita/Karen  Post-Resolution  Reconfirm with Purchase Dept.  
   - No: Send Back to Supplier.  

2. Exceptions handled collaboratively by Rita and Karen based on discrepancy nature, ensuring no invoice stagnates indefinitely.

This model balances stakeholder perspectives while noting areas requiring further clarification (e.g., exact criteria for escalation paths).
