Here is a well-crafted prompt suitable for use in a benchmark evaluating SQL generation capabilities (particularly for process mining-related tasks with DuckDB):

```
You are an expert in SQL and DuckDB. You have access to a table named `event_log` that contains process event data. Each row represents a single event with at least the following columns:
- `case_id`: a unique identifier for the process instance (also called a "case" or "trace")
- `activity`: the name of the activity performed in the event
- `timestamp`: the time when the event occurred

Your task is to write a single DuckDB-compatible SQL query that returns ONLY the events belonging to cases that have six or fewer events in total.

In other words:
1. Compute the total number of events for each `case_id`.
2. Exclude any `case_id` that has more than 6 events.
3. Return all columns (or at minimum `case_id`, `activity`, `timestamp`) for every event from the remaining cases (those with 6 or fewer events).

The query must be efficient, correct, and use proper grouping and filtering techniques (e.g., window functions, subqueries, CTEs, or JOINs as appropriate for DuckDB).

Provide only the SQL query — no explanations, no markdown formatting, no additional text.
```

This prompt is clear, precise, and self-contained. It:
- Sets the context (DuckDB, event log, process mining terminology)
- Clearly defines the required output
- Specifies the constraints (≤6 events per case, return full events for qualifying cases)
- Encourages efficient and correct SQL patterns
- Requests only the query (ideal for automated benchmarking/evaluation)

You can optionally add constraints like "Do not use temporary tables" or "Use a CTE" if you want to test specific patterns, but the version above is neutral and allows multiple correct solutions (CTE with COUNT, window function, or self-join).
