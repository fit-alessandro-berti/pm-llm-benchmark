Here’s the comprehensive event log derived from the given tables, structured for process mining. Each event is organized by `order_id` (Case ID), with activities derived from the lifecycle of each order. Timestamps are preserved chronologically, and resources/actors are included where available.

### Assumptions Made:
1. **Item Picking Events**: Each line item with a distinct `item_picking_date` and `picker_id` generates a separate event, even if part of the same order.
2. **Delivery Events**: Each delivery record (even if split for the same order) results in two events: "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived."
3. **Payment Events**: Payments are linked to invoices, and their timestamps are preserved as-is.
4. **Missing Data**: For payments, the `Resource/Actor` is marked as (N/A) since no billing clerk is explicitly tied to payments in the given tables.
5. **Optional Tables**: The Products and Resources tables were used only for descriptive context; no additional attributes were derived from them for the event log.

This event log is now suitable for process mining analysis, capturing the full lifecycle of each order with chronological accuracy.
