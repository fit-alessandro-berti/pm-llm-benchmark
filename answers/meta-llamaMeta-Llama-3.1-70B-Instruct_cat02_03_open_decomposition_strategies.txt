Applying decomposition strategies in large-scale process mining projects has both benefits and challenges. Here are the main advantages and disadvantages:

**Benefits:**

1. **Improved performance**: Decomposition techniques can handle large data sets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces, leading to improved performance and faster analysis times.
2. **Simplified analysis**: Decomposition helps to reduce the complexity of large process logs, making it easier to analyze and understand the underlying process behavior.
3. **Enhanced scalability**: By applying decomposition techniques, process mining projects can handle increasing volumes of data, making them more scalable and suitable for large-scale applications.
4. **Reduced noise and error**: Decomposition can help to identify and filter out noise and errors in the data, resulting in more accurate process models and insights.
5. **Better understanding of subprocesses**: Decomposition allows for a more detailed understanding of subprocesses and their relationships, which can lead to identification of areas for process improvement.

**Challenges:**

1. **Data fragmentation**: Decomposition can result in fragmented data, making it challenging to maintain data consistency and ensure that the decomposed data is representative of the overall process.
2. **Loss of contextual information**: By breaking down the data into smaller pieces, some contextual information may be lost, which can make it difficult to understand the relationships between subprocesses.
3. **Selection of suitable decomposition techniques**: Choosing the right decomposition technique for a specific process mining project can be challenging, as different techniques may be more suitable for different types of data and processes.
4. **Balancing level of detail and abstraction**: Decomposition requires finding the right balance between level of detail and abstraction, as too much detail may lead to data overload, while too much abstraction may result in loss of meaningful information.
5. **Integrating decomposed results**: Combining the results of decomposed analysis can be challenging, requiring careful consideration of how to integrate the insights gained from multiple subprocesses.

**Common decomposition techniques used in process mining:**

1. **Event-based decomposition**: Decomposes the event log based on specific event types or event attributes.
2. **Case-based decomposition**: Decomposes the event log based on specific case IDs or case attributes.
3. **Time-based decomposition**: Decomposes the event log based on specific time intervals or time windows.
4. **Activity-based decomposition**: Decomposes the event log based on specific activities or process tasks.
5. **Role-based decomposition**: Decomposes the event log based on specific roles or organizational units.
