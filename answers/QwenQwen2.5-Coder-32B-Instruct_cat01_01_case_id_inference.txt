To group these events into separate cases based on the shared attributes (mostly `patient_age` and `patient_gender`), we can logically link them according to their sequence of activities and timestamps. A set of events belong to the same case if their sequence of activities and timing suggest they represent the journey of a single patient through the hospital system. Here is the inferred case grouping:

### Case Analysis:

     5. 2024-03-15T08:22:54Z, Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Smith, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: diagnosis=minor_infection

     7. 2024-03-15T08:35:29Z, Patient discharged, resource: Ward Clerk, department: ER, patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup

3. **Case 3: Patient Age 28, Male**
   - **Events:**
     1. 2024-03-15T08:07:15Z, Register patient, resource: Admin Clerk, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: insurance=private
     2. 2024-03-15T08:13:00Z, Doctor consultation, resource: Dr. Lee, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: reason=scheduled_knee_surgery
     3. 2024-03-15T08:16:45Z, Surgery preparation, resource: Surgical Nurse, department: Surgery, patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, additional_info: prep_type=general_anesthesia

Each case sequence is inferred by the logical flow of activities and shared attributes such as `patient_age` and `patient_gender`. The timing and the sequence of events also help confirm these groupings.
