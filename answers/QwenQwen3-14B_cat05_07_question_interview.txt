Okay, I need to come up with a list of open-ended questions to ask the interviewee about their property onboarding process. Let me start by breaking down the process they described. 

First, the process starts with a landlord contacting the regional office. Then a property coordinator checks documents. If there are missing documents, they request updates. Once verified, the property details are recorded into the database. Then a property manager is assigned based on factors like workload, geography, experience, etc. There's an intro call between the manager and landlord. Then a photographer and inspector are scheduled. If the inspection has issues, they work with the landlord to fix them. Then marketing is done, the property is activated, tenant screening happens, lease finalized, and then quality checks and audits.

Now, the user wants me to ask questions that uncover missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, and exception handling. Let me think about each part of the process and where there might be gaps or unclear aspects.

Starting with the initial documentation review. The coordinator checks deeds, compliance certs, and inspection reports. What if the documents are incomplete? The coordinator requests updates, but how is that process handled? Are there specific procedures or timelines? Also, who is responsible for verifying the documents? Is it the coordinator, or is there another role?

Next, assigning the property manager. The factors mentioned are workload, geography, experience, track record. How are these factors weighted? Is there a specific tool or system used to assign managers? What if there's no manager available who fits all criteria? How is that resolved?

The introductory call between manager and landlord—what's the purpose of that call? Are there any specific topics that are always discussed? How is the outcome of that meeting documented? What if there are disagreements or unresolved issues after the meeting?

The photographer and inspector scheduling. How are these professionals selected? Are they external contractors or in-house? How is the scheduling done? What if the photographer or inspector can't make it? What's the backup plan?

Inspection report issues: if problems are found, the manager works with the landlord. How is this collaboration structured? Are there timelines for resolving these issues? What if the landlord is uncooperative or the issues are significant? How is that escalated?

Marketing phase: the digital team creates listings, brochures, updates pricing models. How are market trends analyzed? Who is responsible for this? What if the initial pricing is not competitive? How is the pricing adjusted?

Activating the property in the rental portal: what steps are involved in activation? Is there a checklist or specific person responsible for this? How is the activation verified?

Tenant screening: the manager or leasing agent reviews applications, runs credit checks, verifies employment, contacts previous landlords. What are the criteria for a suitable tenant? How are credit checks handled? Are there any automated systems or manual processes? What if a tenant has a poor credit history but other strengths? How is that evaluated?

Handling multiple interested tenants: the manager might negotiate lease terms, offer discounts, or prioritize longer leases. What factors influence these decisions? How are promotional discounts decided? Is there a policy or is it at the manager's discretion?

Finalizing the lease: the manager collects the security deposit, schedules move-in. What's the process for collecting the deposit? Are there any legal requirements or procedures that need to be followed? How is the move-in date determined?

Quality checks and audits: compliance officer checks the lease for fair housing, financial analyst checks pricing, IT checks system integration. How often are these audits done? Are they done after every onboarding, or only randomly? What if discrepancies are found during the audit? How are they resolved?

Communication tracking: they use email, CRM, project management tools. What specific tools are used? How is the communication tracked and documented? What if there's a communication breakdown or delay?

Now, considering exceptions: properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses. How are these exceptions handled? Are there specific procedures or approvals needed? Who is responsible for handling such cases?

Also, timing and sequencing: how long does each step take on average? Are there any dependencies between steps that could cause delays? How is the overall timeline managed?

Roles and responsibilities: who is the main point of contact for the landlord throughout the process? Are there any overlapping roles or responsibilities that could cause confusion?

Decision points: what are the key decision points in the process? How are decisions made at these points? Are there any approval hierarchies?

I need to structure these thoughts into targeted questions. Let me list them out in categories.

Documentation Review:
- How are missing documents handled? Are there specific procedures or timelines?
- Who is responsible for verifying the documents?

Property Manager Assignment:
- How are the factors (workload, geography, etc.) weighted in assigning managers?
- What happens if there's no suitable manager available?

Introductory Call:
- What are the key topics discussed during the call?
- How is the outcome documented?

Photographer and Inspector:
- How are these professionals selected and scheduled?
- What's the backup plan if they can't make it?

Inspection Issues:
- How is collaboration with the landlord structured for resolving issues?
- What if the landlord is uncooperative?

Marketing:
- How are market trends analyzed for pricing?
- How are pricing adjustments handled?

Property Activation:
- What steps are involved in activation?
- Who is responsible for verifying it?

Tenant Screening:
- What criteria define a suitable tenant?
- How are credit checks and employment verification handled?

Multiple Tenants:
- What factors influence lease negotiations and discounts?
- How are promotional discounts decided?

Lease Finalization:
- What's the process for collecting the security deposit?
- How is the move-in date determined?

Quality Checks:
- How often are audits conducted?
- What happens if discrepancies are found?

Communication Tracking:
- What specific tools are used for tracking communication?
- How is communication breakdown handled?

Exceptions:
- How are special insurance or custom clauses handled?

Timing and Dependencies:
- What is the average timeline for each step?
- How are dependencies managed to avoid delays?

Roles and Responsibilities:
- Who is the main contact for the landlord?
- Are there overlapping responsibilities?

Decision Points:
- What are the key decision points?
- How are decisions made?

This seems comprehensive. Now, phrasing these into open-ended questions without being too technical.
