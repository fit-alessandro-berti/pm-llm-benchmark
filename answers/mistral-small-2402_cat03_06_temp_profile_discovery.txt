To generate a temporal profile for the process, we need to calculate the average and standard deviation of the time between each pair of activities. However, the data provided does not include the time between each activity. It only includes the frequency of each process variant and the performance (which is not clearly defined).

To create a temporal profile, we would need data in the following format:

- The start time and end time for each activity in each process execution.

With this data, we could calculate the time difference between each pair of activities and then calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair.

Unfortunately, I cannot generate a temporal profile based on the data you have provided.
