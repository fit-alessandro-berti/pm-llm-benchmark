Based on the provided process variants, I've created a list of 20 relevant questions to help understand and improve the process. I've also assigned a confidence score (out of 10) based on how well each question addresses the given process variants.

1. **What is the average time taken for a declaration to be approved by the administration?**

2. **How many declarations are typically rejected at the employee level before final approval?**
   - Confidence score: 8/10

3. **What percentage of declarations require additional approval from the budget owner?**
   - Confidence score: 7/10

4. **Why do some declarations have a higher performance value compared to others with similar process variants?**
   - Confidence score: 6/10 (requires further investigation)

5. **How often does the pre-approver reject declarations, and what are the common reasons?**
   - Confidence score: 7/10
