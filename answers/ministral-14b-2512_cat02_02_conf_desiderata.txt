### **Analysis of the Event Log**

#### **1. Violations of Normative (Strict) Rules**
Normative rules are **hard constraints** that must be followed. Any deviation is a **serious violation**.

| **Case ID** | **Violation** | **Reason** |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Case 2**  | **Ordering Violation (Credit Check before Risk Assessment)** | The **Risk Assessment** occurred before the **Credit Check** (Risk Assessment at 08:20, Credit Check at 09:00). This violates the strict sequence: *Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  ...*. |
| **Case 2**  | **Contradictory Action (Finalize Documentation after Rejection)** | After the **Loan Decision (Rejected)**, the process incorrectly performed **Finalize Documentation** before closing the case. This violates the rule: *"If loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing."* |

**No other cases violate normative rules.**

---

#### **2. Failures to Meet Desiderata (Soft Recommendations)**
Desiderata are **best practices** that, if violated, indicate suboptimal behavior but do not break the process.

| **Case ID** | **Desideratum Violation** | **Reason** |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Case 3**  | **Delayed Credit Check** | The **Credit Check** occurred **4 days** after **Application Received** (2024-01-10  2024-01-14), exceeding the recommended **24-hour window**. |
| **Case 3**  | **Delayed Applicant Notification** | The **Inform Applicant** activity happened **2 days** after the **Loan Decision** (2024-01-14  2024-01-16), exceeding the recommended **48-hour window**. |
| **Case 3**  | **Missing Follow-up Call** | No **Follow-up Call** was recorded before **Close Case**, even though it was encouraged. |

**No other cases violate desiderata.**

#### **3. Possible Interpretations & Justifications**

##### **Case 1 (Compliant)**
- **No violations**—follows the normative sequence perfectly.
- **No desiderata violations**—all steps are timely and complete.
- **Interpretation:** This is the **ideal execution** of the process.

##### **Case 2 (Normative Violations)**
- **Risk Assessment before Credit Check:**
  - **Possible Justification:** A **human error** (e.g., a clerk mistakenly started risk assessment without a credit check).
  - **Process Fix:** Implement **automated checks** to enforce the sequence (e.g., a system lock preventing Risk Assessment until Credit Check is done).
- **Finalizing Documentation after Rejection:**
  - **Possible Justification:** A **clerical mistake** (e.g., an employee accidentally triggered documentation finalization).
  - **Process Fix:** Add **validation rules** in the system to prevent this action when the loan is rejected.

##### **Case 3 (Desiderata Violations Only)**
- **Delayed Credit Check (4 days):**
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - **Backlog issues** (e.g., high workload causing delays).
    - **External dependency** (e.g., credit bureau delays).
  - **Process Improvement:**
    - Set **clear SLAs (Service Level Agreements)** for credit checks.
    - Use **automated reminders** for pending checks.
- **Delayed Applicant Notification (2 days):**
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - **Manual processing delays** (e.g., an employee took longer to inform the applicant).
    - **Applicant unresponsiveness** (e.g., no contact details updated).
  - **Process Improvement:**
    - **Automate notifications** (e.g., email/SMS alerts).
    - **Track response times** and escalate if delays exceed thresholds.
- **Missing Follow-up Call:**
  - **Possible Justification:**
    - **Low priority** (e.g., considered optional).
    - **Resource constraints** (e.g., no dedicated follow-up team).
  - **Process Improvement:**
    - **Make it mandatory** for high-value loans.
    - **Assign follow-ups to a separate team** to ensure consistency.

### **Summary of Findings**
| **Case** | **Normative Violations** | **Desiderata Violations** | **Severity** |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **1**    | None                    | None                     | **Optimal**  |
| **2**    |  Risk Assessment before Credit Check <br>  Finalized Docs after Rejection | None | **Critical** |
| **3**    | None                    |  Delayed Credit Check <br>  Delayed Notification <br>  Missing Follow-up | **Suboptimal** |

### **Recommendations for Process Improvement**
1. **Enforce Normative Rules Strictly:**
   - Implement **automated workflow checks** to prevent:
     - Risk Assessment before Credit Check.
     - Finalizing documentation after rejection.
   - Use **role-based access controls** to restrict actions based on prior steps.
2. **Improve Desiderata Compliance:**
   - Set **clear SLAs** for Credit Checks (e.g., max 24h) and Applicant Notifications (e.g., max 48h).
   - **Automate follow-ups** (e.g., scheduled calls before case closure).
   - **Monitor and report** on desiderata compliance to identify bottlenecks.
3. **Training & Awareness:**
   - Educate staff on **why** desiderata matter (e.g., faster processing improves customer satisfaction).
   - Provide **decision support tools** to guide employees through the correct sequence.

### **Final Answer**
- **Case 2** violates **normative rules** (wrong order + contradictory action).
- **Case 3** violates **desiderata** (timing delays + missing follow-up).
- **Case 1** is **fully compliant**.
- **Suggested fixes** include **automation, SLAs, and staff training** to prevent violations.
