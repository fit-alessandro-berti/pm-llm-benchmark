# Comprehensive Queue Mining Analysis for Multi-Specialty Outpatient Clinic

## Preamble: Framing the Analytical Approach

Before diving into the five sections, it is important to establish the conceptual foundation. Queue mining is a specialized branch of process mining that focuses not merely on *what* activities occur in a process, but on the *waiting time between* those activities — the invisible, uncaptured time that patients experience but that often escapes traditional operational reporting. The event log, with its dual timestamps (START and COMPLETE), gives us the raw material to reconstruct the complete temporal experience of every patient visit, making invisible queues visible and measurable at scale.

The fundamental insight is this: **waiting time (queue time) for activity B is the gap between the COMPLETE timestamp of activity A and the START timestamp of activity B, for the same patient visit (Case ID).** This transforms what is usually anecdotal complaint data into a quantifiable, analyzable dataset.

---

## Section 1: Queue Identification and Characterization

### 1.1 Defining and Computing Waiting Times

**Definition of Waiting Time in This Context:**

For any patient visit (Case ID), the *waiting time* (queue time) preceding a given activity is formally defined as:

```
Waiting_Time(Activity_B) = START_Timestamp(Activity_B) - COMPLETE_Timestamp(Activity_A)
```

Where Activity A is the directly preceding activity in that patient's visit sequence.

This definition captures the time a patient spends in a state of *not being actively served* — the time they spend sitting in a waiting room, waiting for a room to become free, or waiting for a clinician to become available. It is critically distinct from *service time* (COMPLETE - START of the same activity), which represents the time during which value-adding work is being done.

**Operationalizing the Calculation from the Event Log:**

From the raw event log, the process involves several data engineering steps:

1. **Case-Level Sequencing:** For each Case ID, sort all events chronologically and pair START/COMPLETE timestamps to construct an activity timeline per visit. Each activity generates two records; these are pivoted into a single row with `Activity_Start` and `Activity_Complete` columns.

2. **Transition Identification:** For each pair of consecutive activities (A  B) in a case, compute the queue time. For example, for Visit V1001:
   - Registration COMPLETE: 09:08:45
   - Nurse Assessment START: 09:15:20
   - **Queue time before Nurse Assessment = 6 minutes and 35 seconds**

3. **Handling Non-Linear Paths:** Real patient flows are not always linear. A patient may have activities run in parallel (e.g., blood draw and X-ray ordered simultaneously) or may loop back. The process model — discoverable through process mining algorithms like the Inductive Miner — must be established first to correctly identify which activity precedes which in each specific variant. Waiting time is only computed for *directed transitions*, not for activities that overlap.

4. **Handling Missing Data:** Cases where a patient's START timestamp for the next activity is missing (e.g., they left before being seen, or data capture failed) must be flagged and excluded from queue time calculations or analyzed separately as a potential quality or abandonment signal.

5. **Queue Assignment:** Every computed queue time is tagged with:
   - The upstream activity (activity just completed)
   - The downstream activity (activity about to start)
   - The patient's attributes (Type: New/Follow-up, Urgency, Specialty, Time of Day, Day of Week)
   - The resource that served the preceding activity and the resource that will serve the next activity

This creates a rich, multi-dimensional dataset of transitions and their associated waiting times.

### 1.2 Key Metrics for Queue Characterization

For each identified transition (queue point) in the process, the following metrics should be computed. Together, they provide a comprehensive picture that no single statistic can offer:

| Metric | Formula / Method | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Mean Waiting Time** | Arithmetic average of all queue times at that transition | Reflects overall burden; sensitive to outliers |
| **Median Waiting Time** | 50th percentile | Robust central tendency; less distorted by extreme waits |
| **Standard Deviation** | SD of queue times | Measures variability/predictability — high SD means erratic service |
| **90th Percentile Wait** | P90 of queue times | Reflects the experience of patients having a "bad day"; better target for SLA setting |
| **95th / 99th Percentile** | P95, P99 | Captures extreme outliers that cause severe dissatisfaction |
| **Maximum Wait** | Worst-case observed wait | Identifies system failures |
| **Queue Frequency** | Number of cases passing through this transition | High-frequency queues impact more patients, even if individually short |
| **% Cases Exceeding Threshold** | Proportion with wait > defined threshold (e.g., >15 min) | Directly actionable for patient satisfaction benchmarking |
| **Queue Length Over Time** | Average number of patients waiting at a given time, reconstructable from overlapping waits | Identifies capacity mismatches at specific hours |
| **Time-of-Day / Day-of-Week Patterns** | Means broken down by hour and weekday | Reveals scheduling and arrival pattern mismatches |
| **Patient-Segment Breakdowns** | Mean wait by New vs. Follow-up, by urgency level | Reveals differential impacts and potential equity issues |

These metrics are organized into a **Queue Characterization Matrix** — a dashboard that displays all active transitions in the clinic's process alongside their associated metrics, giving management an at-a-glance view of the full queuing landscape.

### 1.3 Identifying the Most Critical Queues

Not all queues are equally deserving of attention. Prioritization must be systematic and multi-dimensional. I propose a **Composite Criticality Score** based on three weighted dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Impact Magnitude**
- Primary measure: Average and P90 waiting time at the transition
- A queue where the average wait is 35 minutes is categorically more urgent than one averaging 3 minutes

**Dimension 2: Impact Breadth**
- Primary measure: Queue frequency — how many patient visits per day/week pass through this transition
- A 20-minute average wait affecting 150 patients per day creates 50 patient-hours of lost time per day; a 45-minute wait affecting only 5 patients creates 3.75 hours — the former is still more critical in aggregate

**Dimension 3: Differential Patient Impact**
- Does the queue disproportionately affect urgent patients (a safety concern, not merely a satisfaction concern)?
- Does it disproportionately affect New patients (who have higher lifetime value and form stronger first impressions)?
- Is there evidence of inequitable waiting (certain patient demographics waiting systematically longer)?

**Composite Criticality Score Example:**

```
Criticality_Score = (w1 × Normalized_Mean_Wait) 
                  + (w2 × Normalized_P90_Wait) 
                  + (w3 × Normalized_Frequency) 
                  + (w4 × Urgency_Differential_Penalty)
```

Where weights (w1 through w4) can be calibrated based on clinic priorities. For a clinic where patient safety is paramount, w4 would be elevated.

**Practical Application:**

After ranking all transitions by Criticality Score, the top 20% of queues by this score typically represent the majority of total patient waiting time — an application of the Pareto principle. These become the immediate focus of root cause analysis and optimization.

A reasonable operational threshold for "critical queue" in an outpatient setting:
- Average wait > 15 minutes AND/OR
- P90 wait > 30 minutes AND/OR
- Urgency patients waiting longer than non-urgency patients at the same transition

## Section 2: Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Taxonomy of Root Causes

Identifying *where* queues occur is necessary but insufficient. To design effective interventions, we must understand *why* they form. The following taxonomy organizes potential root causes, each of which is empirically investigable through the event log:

#### 2.1.1 Resource Bottlenecks

**Staff Availability:**
The most classic cause. If a single physician (e.g., Dr. Smith in Cardiology) handles all cardiology consultations and their service time is 25 minutes per patient, the theoretical throughput is approximately 2.4 patients/hour. If the scheduling system books 3 patients/hour, a growing queue is mathematically inevitable.

From the event log, this is detected by computing **resource utilization rates**:
```
Resource_Utilization = (Total_Service_Time_of_Resource) / (Available_Capacity)
```
Resources consistently above 85–90% utilization are operating with no buffer for variability and will generate queues.

**Room/Equipment Constraints:**
Diagnostic activities (ECG, X-ray, blood draw) are often constrained by the number of available rooms or pieces of equipment. If only two ECG machines exist and all referrals for ECG arrive in the morning, a queue forms even if technician staffing is adequate.

**Skill Mismatch:**
Some activities may be bottlenecked not because of total staff numbers, but because only specific staff members (e.g., a senior nurse for complex assessments) can perform them. The event log's Resource attribute allows us to identify whether bottlenecks are linked to specific named individuals.

#### 2.1.2 Activity Dependencies and Handovers

Many outpatient processes require sequential completion — a doctor cannot consult until the nurse has completed the assessment; a pharmacist cannot dispense until the doctor has written the prescription. These hard dependencies mean that any delay in an upstream activity propagates downstream.

More subtly, **handover delays** occur even when the next resource is available — the time lost to physically transferring a patient, communicating information between staff, or a clinician not being notified that their next patient is ready. These are often "invisible delays" that don't appear as resource unavailability but accumulate significantly across a busy day.

#### 2.1.3 Variability in Service Times

High variability in how long activities take is a powerful, often underappreciated driver of queuing. Even when average utilization appears manageable, high variance causes intermittent overload. Queuing theory (specifically the Kingman equation) formalizes this relationship:

```
Expected_Wait  (/(1-)) × (CV_a² + CV_s²)/2 × Mean_Service_Time
```

Where  is utilization, CV_a is the coefficient of variation in arrivals, and CV_s is the coefficient of variation in service times.

From the event log, we compute CV_s for each activity:
```
CV_s = Standard_Deviation(Service_Time) / Mean(Service_Time)
```
Activities with CV_s > 1 (high variability) are particularly prone to generating queues even at moderate utilization.

Sources of high service time variability in a clinic include:
- New vs. follow-up patients being treated identically in scheduling despite having very different typical consultation lengths
- Complex cases randomly distributed throughout the day rather than managed separately
- Individual physician practice variation

#### 2.1.4 Appointment Scheduling Policies

A poorly calibrated scheduling system is one of the most common root causes of outpatient queuing:

- **Overbooking:** Scheduling more patients than capacity allows, anticipating no-shows, but creating acute capacity crises when attendance is higher than expected
- **Block Scheduling:** Scheduling multiple patients at the same time (e.g., all told to arrive at 9:00 AM) creates an initial surge that the system cannot absorb, generating long queues that cascade throughout the day
- **Ignoring Case Mix:** Allocating uniform appointment slots (e.g., 20 minutes) regardless of whether the patient is new (likely requiring 30–40 minutes) or a follow-up (likely 10–15 minutes) guarantees schedule drift and queuing

The event log enables **schedule adherence analysis**: comparing scheduled appointment times (if available) to actual activity start times, quantifying how much drift accumulates through the day.

#### 2.1.5 Patient Arrival Patterns

Even with a theoretically well-designed schedule, patients don't always arrive as planned:
- **Early arrivals** ahead of scheduled slots compete with patients who are currently being served
- **Late arrivals** disrupt the rhythm of the schedule and cause idle time followed by catch-up rushes
- **Walk-in patients** (common in multi-specialty clinics with some urgent care capacity) create unplanned demand spikes

From the event log, comparing Registration START timestamps to scheduled appointment times (if captured) or analyzing the distribution of Registration events throughout the day reveals the true arrival pattern, which can be compared against the theoretical scheduling model.

#### 2.1.6 Patient Type and Urgency Differences

The event log's Patient Type and Urgency attributes allow for stratified analysis that often reveals important differential patterns:

- New patients may systematically require more nursing time (fuller history taking) and more physician time (establishing the care relationship, more comprehensive examination), yet if scheduled in the same slots as follow-ups, they create bottlenecks
- Urgent patients may be inserted into already-full schedules, displacing and extending the waits for scheduled patients
- Certain specialty combinations (e.g., patients requiring both cardiology and rheumatology consultations in a single visit) may create exceptionally long visits that are difficult to predict

---

### 2.2 Process Mining Techniques for Root Cause Pinpointing

Beyond basic queue time calculation, a suite of process mining analytical techniques can be applied to the event log to diagnose root causes:

#### Resource Analysis and Social Network Mining

By analyzing which resources serve which activities, at what times, and for how long, we can compute:
- **Resource utilization profiles** (heatmaps of utilization by hour of day and day of week)
- **Resource contention patterns** (cases where two patients need the same resource simultaneously)
- **Handover networks** (which staff members pass work to which other staff members, and with what delays)

These analyses can reveal, for example, that the post-doctor-consultation queue is driven not by physician capacity, but by delays in nursing staff being available to escort patients to diagnostic areas.

#### Process Variant Analysis

Using process discovery algorithms (e.g., Inductive Miner, Heuristics Miner), we can discover the actual variety of patient journey patterns (process variants) in the data. In a multi-specialty clinic, there may be dozens of distinct variants:
- Patient  Registration  Nurse  GP Consultation  Checkout (simple)
- Patient  Registration  Nurse  Cardiology Consultation  ECG  Cardiology Review  Checkout (complex)
- Patient  Registration  Urgent Triage  Direct Specialist  Multiple diagnostics  Checkout (urgent)

**Variant analysis** can then answer: which variants generate the longest waits? Are certain "variant paths" disproportionately bottlenecked? This helps focus interventions on specific patient journey types rather than trying to optimize all paths simultaneously.

#### Performance Spectrum Analysis

This technique visualizes the distribution of case durations and waiting times across the full six-month dataset, allowing identification of:
- **Structural shifts** in performance (e.g., queues getting worse after a staff departure, or improving after a process change)
- **Cyclical patterns** (Monday mornings consistently worse than Wednesday afternoons)
- **Outlier detection** (cases that took 4 hours when the norm is 90 minutes — what happened in those cases?)

#### Correlation and Regression Analysis on Queue Drivers

Using the rich event log attributes, we can build statistical models that explain queue time variance:
- Does waiting time for Doctor Consultation correlate with the number of patients in the system at that time? (A proxy for real-time load)
- Does the service time of the preceding Nurse Assessment predict the waiting time before Doctor Consultation? (Testing whether longer nurse assessments coincide with available doctor time)
- Do queue times for ECG differ significantly by day of week, after controlling for volume? (Testing scheduling or staffing effects)

These analyses produce **evidence-based hypotheses** rather than intuitive guesses, and they directly inform the optimization strategies in the next section.

## Section 3: Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

Based on the analytical framework above, the following three strategies are proposed. Each is grounded in what the data typically reveals in multi-specialty outpatient settings and is designed to address specific, identified root causes.

---

### Strategy 1: Dynamic, Complexity-Adjusted Appointment Scheduling with Predictive Slot Allocation

**Target Queues:**
- Queue before Nurse Assessment (if driven by patient volume mismatches)
- Queue before Doctor Consultation (typically one of the longest queues in outpatient settings)
- Overall visit duration (total cycle time)

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Uniform appointment slot allocation that ignores patient-level complexity and case mix variability, combined with scheduling patterns that create morning surges.

**Data-Driven Support:**

The event log enables us to build **empirical service time distributions** for each activity, stratified by patient type, specialty, and urgency. For example, analysis of six months of data might reveal:

| Patient Type | Specialty | Mean Consultation Time | SD | CV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| New | Cardiology | 28.4 min | 8.2 min | 0.29 |
| Follow-up | Cardiology | 14.1 min | 5.8 min | 0.41 |
| New | General Medicine | 22.3 min | 7.1 min | 0.32 |
| Follow-up | General Medicine | 11.8 min | 4.4 min | 0.37 |

Armed with these distributions, a **predictive slot allocation model** can be built:
1. When a patient is scheduled, their appointment slot length is set to the predicted service time + buffer (e.g., mean + 0.5 SD based on patient type and specialty)
2. The total number of appointments per session is capped at a level that keeps utilization in the 80–85% range for the key resource (physician), providing buffer for variability
3. Complex cases (New patients, multi-specialty referrals, known high-complexity diagnoses) are distributed throughout the day rather than concentrated at session start

Additionally, **staggered arrival times** replace block scheduling. Rather than scheduling four patients at 9:00 AM, they are scheduled at 9:00, 9:20, 9:40, and 10:00 based on their predicted upstream processing times.

**Expected Positive Impact:**
- Based on queuing theory, reducing utilization from 95% to 85% while also reducing CV_s through better case-mix management can reduce waiting time by 40–60% for the physician queue
- Modeling studies in comparable outpatient settings have demonstrated 20–35% reductions in average patient visit duration through complexity-adjusted scheduling
- Reduced schedule drift means the afternoon sessions are less impacted by morning overruns, improving predictability throughout the entire clinic day

---

### Strategy 2: Parallel Activity Enablement and Proactive Diagnostic Pre-Ordering

**Target Queues:**
- Queue before diagnostic tests (Blood Test, X-Ray, ECG) following Doctor Consultation
- Queue before Specialist Review (when a secondary specialist must review diagnostic results)
- Total visit duration for complex patients

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Rigid sequential activity dependencies that force unnecessary serialization of activities that could be performed concurrently, combined with handover delays between physician ordering and diagnostic department execution.

**Data-Driven Support:**

Process variant analysis of the event log identifies cases where a specific sequence of activities is reliably predictable. For example, an analysis might reveal that:
- 78% of New Cardiology patients receive an ECG ordered during their consultation
- 65% of patients referred to the Cardiology department by their GP have blood work ordered

This high predictability means that for certain patient types, diagnostic tests can be **pre-ordered** at the time of appointment booking or at least at the time of nurse assessment, without waiting for the physician's explicit order during the consultation.

Furthermore, timestamps reveal that for Visit V1001, the ECG started at 10:22 and the consultation ended at 10:10 — a 12-minute gap. Across all ECG-ordered visits, the average gap might be 18 minutes, representing handover and preparation time. If ECG preparation could begin during the final minutes of consultation or immediately upon consultation completion without requiring a manual paper order, this gap shrinks.

**Concrete Implementation:**

1. **Protocol-Based Pre-Authorization:** For well-defined patient types (e.g., "New Cardiology patient with known hypertension"), a nurse standing order allows certain diagnostic tests to be initiated during Nurse Assessment, before the physician consultation. The physician can then review results during the consultation rather than ordering and waiting post-consultation.

2. **Electronic Order Sets Triggered at Appointment Booking:** When a complex visit is scheduled, an electronic clinical decision support system generates a probable order set. The physician reviews and approves (or modifies) this set at the start of the consultation, and the order is transmitted electronically to the diagnostic department, allowing them to begin preparation while the consultation is still ongoing.

3. **Physical/Operational Parallelism:** For tests that do not require physician supervision, the patient can be sent to the diagnostic area while remaining in parallel contact with the physician for result review (e.g., the physician documents notes while the ECG is being run and the patient returns for result discussion rather than re-consultation).

**Expected Positive Impact:**
- Eliminating or reducing the pre-diagnostic queue (currently averaging, hypothetically, 18 minutes) can reduce total visit duration by 15–20 minutes for the 40–50% of patients who require diagnostics
- For complex multi-diagnostic patients, parallelizing two concurrent tests (e.g., blood draw while X-ray is being processed) could save an additional 15–25 minutes
- Cumulative impact on a typical complex patient's visit: 30–45 minute reduction in total visit duration

---

### Strategy 3: Intelligent Real-Time Queue Monitoring with Dynamic Staff Reallocation

**Target Queues:**
- Whichever queue is acutely overwhelmed at any given point in the operational day — a dynamic, real-time strategy

**Root Cause Addressed:**
Static staffing and resource allocation that cannot respond to the inherent variability in patient arrivals, service times, and no-shows — leading to predictable overloads at certain times and underutilization at others.

**Data-Driven Support:**

The six months of historical data enables construction of **predictive load models** that estimate, for each 30-minute interval of each day of the week, the expected queue length and waiting time at each transition point in the clinic. For example:

- Monday 9:00–10:30 AM: Registration queue expected to peak at 8 patients (based on historical Monday arrival patterns)
- Wednesday 11:00 AM–12:30 PM: Nurse Assessment queue typically spikes due to late morning appointment clustering
- Friday afternoons: ECG queue is longest due to reduced technician staffing and high referral volume

This historical modeling, combined with **real-time event streaming** from the clinic's information systems (each START/COMPLETE event captured in near real-time), enables:

1. **Real-Time Queue Dashboard:** A live visualization (accessible to a clinic operations coordinator or charge nurse) that shows current queue lengths and estimated wait times at each transition point, updated every 5–10 minutes based on actual event data.

2. **Threshold-Based Alerts:** When the real-time queue at a critical transition (e.g., Nurse Assessment wait) exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 5 patients waiting, estimated wait > 20 minutes), the system alerts the operations coordinator.

3. **Cross-Trained Staff Redeployment:** The coordinator then activates a pre-planned **flexible staffing protocol** — a roster of cross-trained staff (e.g., nurses who can also perform registration, or administrative staff trained for check-out) who can be temporarily deployed to the bottleneck area. This works particularly well when one area is overloaded while another is temporarily underloaded (a common phenomenon when early-morning registration surges have passed but nurse assessment hasn't yet peaked).

4. **Feedback into Scheduling:** Over time, the real-time data feeds back into the historical model, continuously refining predictions. If a new pattern emerges (e.g., a new referral pathway creating unexpected Tuesday afternoon ECG demand), the system learns and adjusts alerts accordingly.

**Expected Positive Impact:**
- Studies in comparable ambulatory care settings have demonstrated 15–25% reductions in peak queue times through real-time operational management
- The cross-trained staff protocol reduces dependence on expensive agency staffing for demand spikes, as it uses existing staff more fluidly
- Improved operational visibility increases staff confidence and reduces the stress associated with unpredictable demand spikes, with secondary benefits for staff retention and morale

## Section 4: Consideration of Trade-offs and Constraints

Every optimization strategy introduces new tensions. A rigorous approach requires proactively identifying these trade-offs and planning for them.

### 4.1 Trade-offs by Strategy

**Strategy 1 (Complexity-Adjusted Scheduling):**

*Risk — Reduced Daily Capacity:* If appointment slots are extended to properly accommodate new patients' longer consultation needs, and utilization is deliberately capped at 85%, the total number of patients seen per day may decrease by 5–10% initially. This creates a trade-off between per-patient quality of care and total access to care.

*Mitigation:* The capacity reduction can often be offset by the elimination of "wasted" scheduling capacity — the physician idle time between overrunning appointments — and by the reduction in extended consultations caused by untreated prior complaints (patients who couldn't get timely appointments and accumulate problems). Model the *effective* throughput before and after, not just the nominal scheduled capacity.

*Risk — Scheduling System Complexity:* More sophisticated slot allocation requires either manual effort by schedulers or investment in scheduling software that can accommodate variable slot lengths and case-mix constraints. This is a technology and training cost.

**Strategy 2 (Parallel Activity / Pre-Ordering):**

*Risk — Over-Investigation:* Pre-authorizing diagnostics based on patient type and historical patterns may lead to tests being ordered that the physician would not have ordered after assessment. This is not merely a cost concern but a clinical appropriateness and patient safety concern — unnecessary tests carry risk (radiation exposure, false positives, patient anxiety).

*Mitigation:* Pre-authorization protocols must be developed collaboratively with clinical leadership, limited to tests with very high predictive accuracy (e.g., only pre-authorize ECG for new cardiology patients, not a full diagnostic panel). The physician must always retain authority to cancel pre-authorized tests before they are executed, and the protocol should be reviewed regularly using the event log to measure actual cancellation rates (a high cancellation rate signals the protocol is too aggressive).

*Risk — Workflow Disruption:* Changing established ordering workflows requires significant change management. Clinical staff accustomed to a specific sequential workflow may resist or struggle with parallel-activity protocols.

*Mitigation:* Pilot the strategy with one specialty (ideally one whose leadership is willing to champion the change), measure results rigorously, and use those results to build the case for broader rollout.

**Strategy 3 (Real-Time Queue Monitoring and Dynamic Staffing):**

*Risk — Shifting the Bottleneck:* If staff are dynamically pulled from Area A to address a bottleneck in Area B, Area A may then develop a queue. This is a classic systems dynamics phenomenon — the bottleneck moves rather than being eliminated.

*Mitigation:* The real-time dashboard must monitor all transition points simultaneously, not just the currently bottlenecked one. Redeployment decisions must factor in the state of the "donor" area, not just the "recipient." The queuing model should simulate the effect of redeployment before it is enacted, not just react.

*Risk — Cross-Training Costs and Quality:* Cross-trained staff may be less efficient or less accurate in secondary roles, potentially reducing throughput at the area they've been redeployed to or introducing quality concerns if clinical tasks are involved.

*Mitigation:* Cross-training for redeployment should be limited to administrative and non-clinical activities (registration, check-out, patient transport/escort) where substitution is safe and learning curves are short. Clinical tasks should never be reassigned to unqualified staff regardless of queue pressure.

### 4.2 Balancing Conflicting Objectives

The fundamental tension in healthcare process optimization is: **efficiency vs. thoroughness of care**. Unlike manufacturing, where processing a product faster is almost always desirable, processing a patient faster *is not always better* — a rushed consultation has real clinical consequences.

The balancing framework should follow these principles:

1. **Never optimize a clinical activity's *service time* directly.** Optimization targets should be *waiting times* (non-value-adding time) and logistics efficiency, never the time spent in actual clinical interaction. A physician spending 30 minutes with a complex patient is appropriate service time, not waste.

2. **Clinical leadership must co-own optimization decisions.** Every proposed change to workflow that touches clinical activities must be reviewed and approved by relevant clinical leads (chief of medicine, nursing director) — not implemented by operations or IT unilaterally.

3. **Use the data to separate clinical time from administrative/logistical time.** The event log can distinguish consultation time from documentation time from waiting time. Interventions that reduce administrative burden on clinicians (e.g., better-prepared patient records arriving before consultation) can reduce total time without reducing clinical time — this is the "sweet spot" of optimization.

4. **Cost constraint management:** Not all improvements require new resources. Many of the most impactful interventions (better scheduling, parallel workflows, real-time coordination) are primarily process redesign measures with low marginal cost. Investment in technology (real-time dashboard, scheduling software) should be evaluated against projected improvements in patient satisfaction scores (which drive referrals and volume) and potential reductions in overtime costs and agency staffing.

## Section 5: Measuring Success

### 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPI framework is organized into three tiers — Tier 1 (Primary Outcomes), Tier 2 (Process Drivers), and Tier 3 (Operational Health Indicators) — reflecting the hierarchy from patient-facing outcomes down to operational mechanisms.

**Tier 1: Primary Outcome KPIs (Patient Experience and Clinical)**

| KPI | Definition | Target (Example) | Measurement Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Patient Visit Duration | Total time from Registration START to Check-out COMPLETE | Reduce by 20% from baseline within 6 months | Event Log |
| Average Total Waiting Time per Visit | Sum of all queue times within a visit | Reduce by 30% from baseline | Event Log |
| Patient Satisfaction Score (Wait-Related) | Proportion rating wait times as "acceptable" or better | Increase from baseline to 80% | Post-visit survey |
| P90 Total Visit Duration | 90th percentile of total visit duration | Reduce by 25% | Event Log |
| % Visits Exceeding Target Duration | Proportion of visits longer than agreed threshold (e.g., 2.5 hours) | Reduce from baseline to <15% | Event Log |

**Tier 2: Process Driver KPIs (Queue-Level)**

| KPI | Definition | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average Waiting Time per Critical Queue | Mean queue time at each previously identified critical transition | Reduce by 30–50% at each critical queue | Event Log |
| P90 Waiting Time per Critical Queue | 90th percentile at each critical transition | Below defined threshold (e.g., 25 min) | Event Log |
| Queue Frequency at Critical Transitions | Number of cases experiencing >threshold wait | Reduce by 40% | Event Log |
| Urgent Patient Wait Differential | Difference in average wait between urgent and non-urgent patients | Urgent patients wait  non-urgent at every transition | Event Log |

**Tier 3: Operational Health KPIs**

| KPI | Definition | Target | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource Utilization Rate (Key Resources) | Percentage of available capacity used per session | Maintain 80–87% (not >90%) | Event Log + Staff Schedule |
| Schedule Adherence | % of consultations starting within 10 minutes of scheduled time | 75% | Event Log + Scheduling System |
| Pre-ordered Test Cancellation Rate | % of pre-authorized tests cancelled by physician | <5% (quality safety indicator) | Clinical Information System |
| Cross-Training Activation Frequency | Number of times flexible staffing protocol activated per week | Monitor for trend; target stable or declining over time as scheduling improves | Operational Log |
| Staff Overtime Hours | Total overtime per department per week | No increase from baseline; target reduction | HR System |

---

### 5.2 Ongoing Process Monitoring Framework

**Phase 1: Pre-Implementation Baseline (Months 1–2)**

Before any interventions are deployed, establish rigorous baseline values for all KPIs using the six months of historical data already available. This establishes the "before" state with statistical confidence, including natural variation ranges, so that post-intervention changes can be distinguished from noise.

**Phase 2: Controlled Rollout with A/B Monitoring (Months 3–5)**

Deploy interventions in a staged manner — ideally starting with one specialty or one clinical day — while maintaining the unchanged process in other areas as a control condition. This allows within-clinic comparison that controls for seasonal and organizational confounders.

During this phase, the event log continues to be generated in exactly the same format, enabling direct comparison using the same analytical pipeline. KPIs are computed weekly at this stage, with statistical significance testing applied to determine whether observed changes exceed natural variation.

**Phase 3: Full Deployment and Monthly Monitoring (Month 6 Onward)**

Following successful controlled rollout, full deployment is followed by a shift to **continuous process monitoring**:

1. **Automated KPI Dashboard:** The same queue mining pipeline that performed the initial analysis is automated to run weekly (or daily for real-time operational needs), ingesting new event log data and updating all KPI metrics. Trend charts show 4-week rolling averages alongside baseline comparisons.

2. **Control Charts for Statistical Process Control:** For each critical KPI, a statistical control chart (e.g., XmR chart) is maintained, with control limits derived from the baseline variability. Any data point falling outside control limits, or any trend of consecutive points in one direction, triggers an investigation — preventing management from reacting to random noise while ensuring genuine deteriorations are caught promptly.

3. **Quarterly Deep-Dive Process Mining Reviews:** Every quarter, a full process mining analysis is conducted on the preceding quarter's event log, equivalent to the initial six-month study. This serves two purposes:
   - **Confirming sustained improvement:** Ensuring that initial gains have been maintained and not eroded by process drift
   - **Discovering new opportunities:** As initial bottlenecks are resolved, secondary bottlenecks (previously hidden) become visible. The quarterly review identifies the next tier of improvement opportunities, creating a **continuous improvement cycle**

4. **Annual Process Model Refresh:** The process discovery step is re-run annually to detect structural changes in patient pathways (new services added, referral patterns changed, regulatory changes affecting protocols) that would make the original process model obsolete.

5. **Closing the Loop with Patient Feedback:** Post-visit patient surveys are integrated with the event log data by matching survey responses to visit Case IDs. This enables correlation analysis between objective queue time metrics and subjective satisfaction scores — answering critical questions like "at what average wait time does satisfaction begin to decline significantly?" This empirically calibrates the clinic's target-setting rather than relying on arbitrary benchmarks.

The power of this approach lies not in any single technique but in the integration: using objective, high-resolution temporal data to make visible what was previously invisible, applying analytical rigor to prioritize where effort will have the greatest impact, and embedding measurement into operations so that improvement is sustained and continuously refined rather than a one-time project.

For the multi-specialty outpatient clinic, the expected net result — if interventions are implemented thoughtfully with clinical co-ownership and monitored rigorously — is a 20–35% reduction in average patient visit duration, a 30–50% reduction in waiting time at the most critical queue points, measurable improvements in patient satisfaction scores, and, over time, a more predictable and sustainable operational environment for both patients and staff.
