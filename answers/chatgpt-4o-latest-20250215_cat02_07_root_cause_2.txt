### **Analysis of Performance Issues in Insurance Claims Processing**  

#### **Step 1: Identifying Cases with Longer Durations**  
We determine case duration by calculating the time difference between **Submit Claim** and **Close Claim**. Here are the durations for each case:  

| Case ID | Start Time (Submit Claim) | End Time (Close Claim) | Total Duration |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00          | 2024-04-01 10:30       | **1.5 hours**  |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05          | 2024-04-02 11:00       | **1 day, 2 hours** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10          | 2024-04-03 09:30       | **2 days, 30 min** |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20          | 2024-04-01 10:45       | **1 hour, 25 min** |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25          | 2024-04-04 14:30       | **3 days, 5 hours** |

From this, **cases 2003 and 2005** stand out as taking significantly longer than the others.

#### **Step 2: Identifying Root Causes**  

Let's analyze attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) that correlate with long durations:

1. **Complexity Level**  
   - **Low & Medium Complexity Cases (2001, 2002, 2004)** finish within **1-26 hours**.  
   - **High Complexity Cases (2003, 2005)** take **2-3 days**, suggesting complexity strongly impacts duration.  
   - These cases require multiple **Request Additional Documents** steps, delaying approval.

2. **Region Influence**  
   - Region A (Case 2003) and Region B (Case 2005) both experience delays.  
   - However, **Region B (Case 2005) is the slowest**, indicating **a possible bottleneck in Region B for high-complexity claims**.

3. **Resource-Specific Delays**  
   - **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B, Case 2005) requested documents three times over 3 days**, whereas **Adjuster_Mike (Region A, Case 2003) only requested twice over 1 day**.  
   - **Finance_Carl (Region B) took 4 hours to pay out in case 2005**, while **Finance_Alan (Region A) paid within 30 minutes for case 2003**.  
   - **Manager_Bill (who approved both delayed cases) might be a bottleneck**, as his approvals occur later than Manager_Annâ€™s.

#### **Step 3: Explaining Root Causes & Mitigation Strategies**  

| Root Cause | Evidence | Proposed Solution |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **High Complexity Cases Take Longer** | Extra **Request Additional Documents** steps in cases 2003 & 2005. | Automate document requests and create clearer guidelines for complex claims. |
| **Region B is Slower** | Case 2005 took 3 days, significantly longer than Case 2003. | Increase staffing or redistribute high-complexity claims more evenly. |
| **Adjuster_Lisa Requests Excessive Documents** | 3 requests over 3 days in Case 2005. | Improve training or implement stricter review policies to minimize unnecessary document requests. |
| **Manager_Bill is Slower at Approvals** | Both delayed cases (2003 & 2005) were approved by Manager_Bill. | Assign approvals based on workload balancing or streamline approval decision-making. |
| **Finance Delays in Region B (Finance_Carl)** | 4-hour payout in Case 2005 vs. 30 minutes in Case 2003. | Investigate workload distribution for Finance_Carl and consider automation of payments. |

### **Conclusion & Recommendations**  
- **High-complexity claims require additional document requests, delaying approvals**â€”reducing unnecessary requests and streamlining document handling is key.  
- **Region B (especially Adjuster_Lisa and Finance_Carl) experiences slowdowns**â€”staffing adjustments and workload balancing can help.  
- **Manager_Billâ€™s approvals are slower than Manager_Annâ€™s**â€”redistributing approvals could improve efficiency.  

By addressing these bottlenecks, overall case durations can be significantly reduced. ðŸš€
