### **Anomaly Detection and Hypothesis Analysis in Order Event Logs**

After analyzing the provided event log data and cross-referencing it with the `orders` and `resources` tables, several **anomalies and undesirable behaviors** emerge that deviate from the assumed normal process flow. Below, I identify these anomalies, hypothesize their root causes, and propose **relevant SQL queries** to investigate each hypothesis further using only the available schema.

---

##  **Anomaly 1: Missing Critical Process Steps (Missing Credit Check or Stock Validation)**

### **Observation:**
- In **case_id = 1004**, the events are:
  - Register Order  Receive Payment  Issue Invoice  Confirm Shipment  Ship Goods  
  - **Missing: Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock**

### **Hypothesis:**
The order was processed without a credit check or stock validation, which violates the assumed process flow. This could indicate:
- A **system error** (e.g., automated step skipped due to misconfiguration),
- A **policy violation** (e.g., bypassing due to high-value orders),
- Or **insufficient training** of staff on compliance procedures.

> This is especially concerning because the order value is $3000.00 — a large amount — and no credit score was recorded.

###  **Proposed SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol.case_id,
    ol.activity,
    ol.timestamp,
    ol.resource,
    o.order_value,
    r.role,
    r.department
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN orders o ON ol.case_id = o.case_id
JOIN resources r ON ol.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE ol.activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
  AND ol.case_id NOT IN (
    SELECT case_id 
    FROM order_event_log 
    WHERE activity = 'Perform Credit Check' OR activity = 'Validate Stock'
  )
ORDER BY ol.case_id, ol.timestamp;
```

> **Purpose:** Identifies all cases where essential pre-shipment steps are missing, enabling detection of potential compliance or procedural breaches.

---

##  **Anomaly 2: Out-of-Order Events (Non-Sequential Process Flow)**

### **Observation:**
- In **case_id = 1002**, the events occur out of sequence:
  - `Confirm Shipment` (event_id 9) happens **before** `Perform Credit Check` (event_id 11).
  - `Ship Goods` (event_id 10) happens **before** `Validate Stock` (event_id 12).

### **Hypothesis:**
The process is being executed out of sequence, which may suggest:
- A **human error** in task execution,
- A **system misrouting** of workflow (e.g., manual override or incorrect routing),
- Or **lack of process controls** allowing out-of-order steps.

This violates the assumed flow and poses operational and compliance risks.

###  **Proposed SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol1.case_id,
    ol1.activity AS first_activity,
    ol1.timestamp AS first_timestamp,
    ol2.activity AS second_activity,
    ol2.timestamp AS second_timestamp,
    ol2.case_id AS case_id
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
WHERE ol1.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment')
  AND ol2.activity IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
  AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp
  AND ol1.activity NOT IN ('Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock')
ORDER BY ol1.case_id, ol1.timestamp;
```

> **Purpose:** Finds instances where downstream events precede upstream validation steps — a clear violation of the expected process order.

---

##  **Anomaly 3: Inconsistent Resource Assignments (Role Mismatch or Unauthorized Access)**

### **Observation:**
- In **case_id = 1003**, "Confirm Shipment" is performed by **LogisticsMgr_2**, but **"Ship Goods"** is done by **WarehouseClerk_3** — a role mismatch.
- In **case_id = 1004**, "Receive Payment" is done by **FinanceTeam_02**, which is a **Cashier**, not a role typically authorized to receive payments directly — unless under supervision.

### **Hypothesis:**
There may be **role misassignments** or **lack of role-based access controls**. This could lead to:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive operations,
- Errors due to lack of expertise,
- Or potential fraud or data integrity issues.

> For example, a warehouse clerk performing shipment confirmation may not have visibility into logistics scheduling.

###  **Proposed SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol.case_id,
    ol.activity,
    ol.resource,
    r.role,
    r.department,
    CASE 
        WHEN ol.activity IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Validate Stock') THEN r.role 
        ELSE NULL 
    END AS expected_role
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN resources r ON ol.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE r.role NOT IN (
    CASE 
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' THEN 'Credit Analyst'
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Validate Stock' THEN 'Warehouse Staff'
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' THEN 'Logistics Manager'
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Ship Goods' THEN 'Warehouse Staff'
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Issue Invoice' THEN 'Billing Officer'
        WHEN ol.activity = 'Receive Payment' THEN 'Cashier'
    END
)
ORDER BY ol.case_id, ol.activity;
```

> **Purpose:** Identifies resource assignments that do not align with expected roles per activity — highlighting potential access control or training issues.

---

##  **Anomaly 4: Early Payment Receipt Without Invoice Issuance**

### **Observation:**
- In **case_id = 1004**, "Receive Payment" occurs at **09:05:00**, while "Issue Invoice" occurs at **09:20:00** — **after** payment.
- This is **not** in line with standard financial processes: payments should typically be received **after** invoicing.

### **Hypothesis:**
This suggests **a procedural or system error** — possibly:
- A payment was received before the invoice was issued (e.g., a prepayment or advance),
- Or a **data entry error** where the invoice was delayed or misrecorded.

> This could lead to revenue leakage or accounting discrepancies.

###  **Proposed SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol1.case_id,
    ol1.activity AS payment_activity,
    ol1.timestamp AS payment_time,
    ol2.activity AS invoice_activity,
    ol2.timestamp AS invoice_time,
    o.order_value
FROM order_event_log ol1
JOIN order_event_log ol2 ON ol1.case_id = ol2.case_id
JOIN orders o ON ol1.case_id = o.case_id
WHERE ol1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND ol2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
  AND ol1.timestamp < ol2.timestamp
ORDER BY ol1.case_id;
```

> **Purpose:** Detects any case where payment is received **before** the invoice is issued — a red flag for financial irregularities.

---

##  **Anomaly 5: Incomplete Shipment Confirmation or Late Confirmation**

### **Observation:**
- In **case_id = 1003**, "Confirm Shipment" is marked as `"late_confirmation=Y"` — indicating a delay.
- In **case_id = 1002**, "shipment_scheduled=Y" is recorded, but the actual "Ship Goods" happens early (08:40), which is inconsistent.

### **Hypothesis:**
- Late confirmations may reflect **poor coordination** or **system delays**.
- Early shipping without confirmation may indicate **over-optimism** or **lack of oversight**.

> This could lead to delivery issues, customer dissatisfaction, or logistics inefficiencies.

###  **Proposed SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ol.case_id,
    ol.activity,
    ol.timestamp,
    ol.additional_info,
    r.role,
    r.department
FROM order_event_log ol
JOIN resources r ON ol.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE ol.additional_info ILIKE '%late_confirmation%' 
   OR ol.additional_info ILIKE '%attempted_early%'
ORDER BY ol.case_id, ol.timestamp;
```

> **Purpose:** Extracts all records with explicit notes about timing anomalies in shipment confirmation or scheduling.

##  Summary Table: Anomalies and Recommendations

| Anomaly | Risk Level | Root Cause Hypothesis | Key Query |
|--------|------------|------------------------|----------|
| Missing Credit/Stock Checks | High | Process bypass, policy violation | Query 1 |
| Out-of-Order Events | High | Human error or system misrouting | Query 2 |
| Role Mismatch | Medium | Access control or training issues | Query 3 |
| Early Payment Before Invoice | High | Financial irregularity or data error | Query 4 |
| Late/Early Shipment Confirmation | Medium | Coordination failure or system lag | Query 5 |

##  Final Recommendation:
To ensure process integrity and regulatory compliance, the organization should:
1. Implement **automated workflow validation** to enforce step-ordering.
2. Enforce **role-based access controls (RBAC)** with audit logging.
3. Add **pre-shipment validation checks** (credit, stock) as mandatory steps.
4. Perform **periodic audits** of event logs to detect deviations.
5. Train staff on process compliance and escalation procedures.

These SQL queries provide a foundation for proactive monitoring and anomaly detection in the operational process — without requiring external tools or assumptions.
