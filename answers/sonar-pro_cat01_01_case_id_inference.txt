Based on the event attributes and their logical order, I can infer three distinct cases from this interleaved sequence:

Case 1 (ER Patient, Male, 45 years old):
1. Register patient (08:05:13)
4. Initial triage (08:10:50)
7. X-ray imaging (08:15:42)
12. Doctor consultation (08:23:10)
15. Patient discharged (08:30:05)

Case 2 (ER Patient, Female, 62 years old):
2. Register patient (08:07:02)
5. Initial triage (08:12:29)
8. Lab test requested (08:16:10)
10. Lab test completed (08:20:27)
11. Doctor consultation (08:22:54)
14. Prescription created (08:27:00)
17. Patient discharged (08:35:29)

Case 3 (Surgery Patient, Male, 28 years old):
3. Register patient (08:07:15)
6. Doctor consultation (08:13:00)
9. Surgery preparation (08:16:45)
13. Surgery performed (08:25:19)
16. Recovery room (08:31:37)
18. Patient discharged (08:40:13)

These groupings are inferred based on the consistent patient attributes (age and gender) across events, the logical sequence of activities for each patient journey, and the timestamps that show a coherent progression for each case.
