The attributes that can be considered sensitive for fairness are:

1. `case:citizen`: This attribute indicates whether the patient is a citizen or not. This could be a sensitive attribute as it may influence the treatment decisions and outcomes.
2. `case:gender`: This attribute indicates the gender of the patient. Gender can be a sensitive attribute as it may influence the treatment decisions and outcomes.
3. `case:german speaking`: This attribute indicates whether the patient speaks German. While this attribute may not seem sensitive at first glance, it could be relevant in a hospital setting where not speaking the local language might affect communication with healthcare staff and, consequently, treatment outcomes.
4. `case:private_insurance`: This attribute indicates whether the patient has private insurance. Insurance status can be sensitive as it may influence the treatment decisions and outcomes, especially in cases where the patient is uninsured or underinsured.
5. `case:underlying_condition`: This attribute indicates whether the patient has an underlying condition. This attribute may be sensitive as it can affect treatment decisions and outcomes.

These attributes can be considered sensitive because they may:

* Influence treatment decisions or outcomes
* Be protected by laws or regulations (e.g., anti-discrimination laws)
* Be considered personal or private information
* Have a disproportionate impact on certain groups (e.g., marginalized or vulnerable populations)

When analyzing fairness in this context, you may want to consider how these sensitive attributes affect the treatment decisions, outcomes, and access to care. You can use fairness metrics, such as discrimination discovery and disparity detection, to identify potential biases and disparities in the data.
