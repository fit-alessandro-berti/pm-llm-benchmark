### **Analysis of the Customer Support Ticket Resolution Process**

---

## **1. Identify Cases with Significantly Longer Total Resolution Times**

We will calculate the **total time** each ticket took to go from "Receive Ticket" to "Close Ticket."

### **Case 101:**
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:00  
- Close: 2024-03-01 10:15  
- **Total Time: 2h 15m**

### **Case 102:**
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:05  
- Close: 2024-03-02 09:15  
- **Total Time: 25h 10m**  
  - **Note:** This is significantly longer due to **escalation to Level-2 Agent** and **long waiting time before investigation.**

### **Case 103:**
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:10  
- Close: 2024-03-01 09:30  
- **Total Time: 1h 20m**

### **Case 104:**
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:20  
- Close: 2024-03-02 08:30  
- **Total Time: 24h 10m**  
  - **Note:** Long time between "Assign to Level-1 Agent" and "Investigate Issue" (3h 30m).

### **Case 105:**
- Receive: 2024-03-01 08:25  
- Close: 2024-03-03 09:30  
- **Total Time: 49h 5m**  
  - **Note:** Multiple delays, including **escalation to Level-2**, **long waiting time before investigation**, and **extended investigation time.**

### **Summary of Total Times:**

| Case ID | Total Time     | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| 101    | 2h 15m         | Normal |
| 102    | 25h 10m        | **Long due to escalation and delays** |
| 103    | 1h 20m         | Normal |
| 104    | 24h 10m        | **Long due to waiting time before investigation** |
| 105    | 49h 5m         | **Very long due to multiple delays and escalations** |

## **2. Potential Root Causes of Performance Issues**

### **A. Escalations to Level-2 Agents**
- **Case 102 and 105** both involved **escalations to Level-2 Agents**, which increased the time to resolution.
- **Impact**: Escalations often require additional coordination, communication, and time, leading to **delays in investigation and resolution**.

### **B. Long Waiting Times Between Activities**
- **Case 102**: From "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (08:30) to "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30) = **3h**.
- **Case 102**: From "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (11:30) to "Investigate Issue" (09:00 next day) = **19h 30m**.
- **Case 104**: From "Assign to Level-1 Agent" (09:30) to "Investigate Issue" (13:00) = **3h 30m**.
- **Case 105**: From "Investigate Issue" (09:10) to "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (14:00) = **4h 50m**.
- **Case 105**: From "Escalate to Level-2 Agent" (14:00) to "Investigate Issue" (14:00 next day) = **24h**.

- **Impact**: These waiting times **increase the overall cycle time** and **reduce efficiency**.

### **C. Delayed Investigation and Resolution**
- **Case 105** had **multiple delays** and **long investigation time** (from 14:00 to 09:00 next day).
- **Case 102** had a **long gap between escalation and investigation**, which is not ideal for timely resolution.

## **3. Insights and Recommendations**

### **Insight 1: Escalations Increase Cycle Time**
- Escalations to Level-2 agents introduce **additional steps and delays**.
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Implement **pre-escalation triage** to determine whether an escalation is necessary.
  - Provide **Level-1 agents with more resources or training** to handle complex issues before escalation.
  - Use **automated escalation rules** to ensure only critical issues are escalated.

### **Insight 2: Delays Between Activities Reduce Efficiency**
- Long waiting times between activities (e.g., from "Assign to Agent" to "Investigate") indicate **inefficient workflow**.
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Monitor **time between activities** using **process mining tools**.
  - Set **SLA (Service Level Agreement) thresholds** for each step to prevent excessive delays.
  - Improve **resource allocation** and **task prioritization** to reduce idle time.

### **Insight 3: Investigative Delays Are a Major Bottleneck**
- Investigation is a key step, and delays here significantly impact resolution time.
- **Recommendation**:  
  - Provide **training and tools** to Level-1 agents to handle more complex investigations.
  - Implement **standardized investigation protocols** to ensure consistency and speed.
  - Consider **automating data gathering** or providing **knowledge bases** to support faster resolution.

## **Conclusion**

The **longest resolution times** were observed in **Case 102 (25h 10m)** and **Case 105 (49h 5m)**. The **main contributing factors** were **escalations to Level-2 agents**, **long waiting times between activities**, and **extended investigation periods**.

To improve performance, the support team should focus on:
- Reducing unnecessary escalations.
- Minimizing idle time between process steps.
- Enhancing the efficiency and capacity of Level-1 agents.

By addressing these bottlenecks, the **average resolution time** can be significantly reduced, leading to **higher customer satisfaction** and **more efficient operations**.
