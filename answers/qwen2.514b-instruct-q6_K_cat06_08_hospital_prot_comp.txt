To identify the unfair differences between the treatment of the 'protected' group and the 'unprotected' group, we need to analyze both the process variants and their execution times for each group.

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequency Distribution**:
   - The protected group has a more diverse set of process variants with many low-frequency paths.
   - The unprotected group tends to have fewer but higher frequency paths, especially involving expert examinations and thorough examinations.

2. **Performance (Execution Time)**:
   - For the protected group, there is a significant variance in performance times across different process variants, including several high-performance (longer) process variants.
   - For the unprotected group, performance seems more consistent with fewer extremely long processes.

3. **Critical Path Variations**:
   - The protected group often has shorter critical paths where patients are discharged without thorough examinations or expert consultations.
   - In contrast, the unprotected group frequently includes thorough examinations and expert consultations even in successful treatments, which can extend treatment times but might indicate a higher standard of care.

### Identified Differences:

1. **Frequency of Thorough Examinations**:
   - The protected group has fewer instances of thorough examinations compared to the unprotected group.
     - Example: 
       Protected Group: Only 20% of cases (e.g., Register at FD -> Expert Examination -> Diagnosis... vs. total variants)
       Unprotected Group: A significant portion of successful treatments involve thorough examinations.

2. **Expert Consultations**:
   - The protected group has a lower frequency of expert consultations.
     - Example: 
       Protected Group: Only specific high-risk cases or higher complexity instances (frequency ranges from 174 to 50).
       Unprotected Group: Higher frequency and more routine inclusion in successful treatment paths.

3. **Execution Time Variance**:
   - The protected group has longer average times due to some critical variants involving multiple steps and unsuccessful treatments that are reattempted.
     - Example: 
       Protected Group: High variance including prolonged processes such as Register at FD -> Examination -> Thorough Examination... with performance = 320,003.346 (hours).
       Unprotected Group: Performance times for similar paths tend to be more consistent and lower.

4. **Critical Path Efficiency**:
   - The protected group's critical path is often shorter but can involve higher risks due to fewer thorough checks.
     - Example: 
       Protected Group: Register at ER -> Diagnosis -> Treatment (performance = 160,001.627 hours).
       Unprotected Group: Involves thorough examinations even in successful treatments.

### Conclusion:

The main differences suggest that the protected group might receive less comprehensive initial evaluations and expert consultations compared to the unprotected group. This could potentially lead to higher risks of re-treatment due to initially missed or undiagnosed issues, thereby increasing overall treatment duration despite shorter critical paths.

For fairer treatment:
- Ensure consistent evaluation standards across groups.
- Consider adding thorough examinations for all patients in both groups if deemed necessary by medical guidelines.
- Monitor and address any disparities in the availability of expert consultations based on group affiliation.
