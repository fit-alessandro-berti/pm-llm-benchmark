<think>
Alright, so I have this SQL problem to solve, and I'm going to walk through my thought process step by step. I'm a bit new to handling such queries, especially with process mining aspects, but I'll try my best.

First, let me understand the problem. We have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. The table has at least three columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The task is to write a SQL query that identifies cases which have a specific sequence of activities and a timing condition, then exclude those cases from the final result.

The specific sequence is three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'. So, these must occur one after the other without any other events from the same case in between. Additionally, among these cases, we need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, we exclude these cases from our result, so the output should include all events except those from the excluded cases.

Okay, breaking it down into steps:

1. Identify cases with the exact sequence of three activities.
2. From these, filter out cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.
3. Exclude these cases from the final result, so return all other events.

I think I need to approach this by first identifying the cases that meet the sequence and timing condition, then exclude them from the entire event log.

Let me think about how to identify the sequence. Since the activities must occur in direct succession, I need to find consecutive events in the same case that follow the exact order.

One approach is to use window functions or lead/lag functions to check the next events. Alternatively, I can group events by `case_id` and look for the sequence within each group.

Hmm, another approach is to use a self-join where each event is matched with the next event. For example, for each event, check if the next event is the required activity. But with three activities, I might need two joins or multiple steps.

Wait, maybe using the `LEAD` function could help. For each row, I can look ahead to the next two rows to see if the activities match the sequence. But I have to ensure that the timestamps are in order and that there are no other events in between.

Alternatively, I can assign a sequence number to each event within a case and then check for the required sequence.

Let me outline the steps more concretely.

Step 1: Identify cases where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' occurs consecutively.

I can do this by checking for each occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' whether the immediately next event is 'Create Order', and then the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

Using the `LEAD` function, for each event, I can get the next activity and the one after that. Then, I can filter where the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

But wait, using `LEAD` might not capture all possible sequences because a case might have multiple sequences. For example, a case might have the sequence starting at event 1, 3, etc. So, I need to find any occurrence of this triplet in the case's event list.

Alternatively, I can use a subquery to find all `case_id`s that have this sequence.

Let me think about how to structure this.

I can write a query that for each `case_id`, checks if there exists a triplet of events where the activities are in the required order and consecutive in time.

So, for each `case_id`, I can look for three consecutive events with the activities in the specified order.

This can be done by using a window function to get the next activities, but I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.

Another approach is to use a CTE (Common Table Expression) to find the triplets.

Let me try to structure this.

First, for each event, I can get the next two events in the same case, ordered by timestamp.

So, for each event where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', I can check if the next event is 'Create Order' and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'.

So, using the `LEAD` function twice:

SELECT case_id, activity, 
       LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
       LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity
FROM event_log;

Then, I can filter where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', next_activity is 'Create Order', and next_next_activity is 'Confirm Order'.

This would give me the starting points of the triplet. But since each triplet is identified by the first event, I can collect all `case_id`s that have at least one such occurrence.

So, the first part is to find all `case_id`s where this triplet exists.

Once I have these `case_id`s, I need to further check the timing between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that triplet.

Wait, but how do I get the timestamps for these events? Because in the above query, I only have the activities, not the timestamps.

So, perhaps I need to include the timestamps in the window functions.

Alternatively, for each triplet, I can calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

But this might complicate things. Maybe a better approach is to, for each `case_id`, find all possible triplets and then check the timing condition.

Alternatively, perhaps using a self-join approach.

Wait, another idea: for each `case_id`, find all sequences where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in consecutive events, and then check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

So, let's structure this:

1. Find all triplets in the same `case_id` where the activities are 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in consecutive events.

2. For each such triplet, calculate the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order'.

3. If the time difference is more than 5 days, mark the `case_id` to be excluded.

Then, in the final query, exclude all events from these `case_id`s.

So, the plan is:

- Identify `case_id`s that have the triplet and the time condition.

- Exclude all events from these `case_id`s.

So, first, let me write a query to find such `case_id`s.

I can use a CTE to find the triplets and then check the timing.

Alternatively, using window functions to get the next events and their timestamps.

Let me try this:

WITH Triplet AS (
  SELECT 
    el1.case_id,
    el1.activity AS a1,
    el1.timestamp AS t1,
    el2.activity AS a2,
    el2.timestamp AS t2,
    el3.activity AS a3,
    el3.timestamp AS t3
  FROM event_log el1
  JOIN event_log el2 ON el1.case_id = el2.case_id AND el2.timestamp > el1.timestamp
  JOIN event_log el3 ON el2.case_id = el3.case_id AND el3.timestamp > el2.timestamp
  WHERE 
    el1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND el2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND el3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
),
TimingCheck AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    (t3 - t2) AS duration
  FROM Triplet
)
SELECT DISTINCT case_id
FROM TimingCheck
WHERE duration > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60;  -- Assuming timestamp is in seconds since epoch, adjust if necessary

Wait, but this approach might not capture all possible triplets because the join could miss some cases where the triplet is not the first possible one. Also, the join might not efficiently capture all triplets, especially if there are multiple triplets in a case.

Alternatively, using window functions to get the next events:

WITH Triplet AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
  FROM event_log
)
SELECT 
  case_id
FROM Triplet
WHERE 
  activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
  AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
  AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60;

But wait, this would give me all `case_id`s where the triplet exists and the timing condition is met. Then, I can collect these `case_id`s and exclude them from the final result.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
  -- Subquery to find case_id's to exclude
  WITH Triplet AS (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      timestamp,
      LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp,
      LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,
      LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_timestamp
    FROM event_log
  )
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM Triplet
  WHERE 
    activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND next_activity = 'Create Order'
    AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'
    AND (next_next_timestamp - next_timestamp) > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60
);

But I'm not sure if this captures all possible triplets correctly. For example, what if a case has multiple triplets? The `DISTINCT` will handle that.

Wait, but the `LEAD` function in the Triplet CTE will only look at the next two events. So, if a case has more than three events, and the triplet occurs later, this approach might miss it because the `LEAD` only looks at the immediate next events.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the triplet could be anywhere in the sequence, not necessarily the first three events.

So, perhaps a better approach is to assign a sequence number to each event within a case and then look for triplets where the sequence numbers are consecutive.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, let's try that approach.

WITH NumberedEvents AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
  FROM event_log
),
Triplet AS (
  SELECT 
    ne1.case_id,
    ne1.activity AS a1,
    ne1.timestamp AS t1,
    ne2.activity AS a2,
    ne2.timestamp AS t2,
    ne3.activity AS a3,
    ne3.timestamp AS t3
  FROM NumberedEvents ne1
  JOIN NumberedEvents ne2 ON ne1.case_id = ne2.case_id AND ne2.seq_num = ne1.seq_num + 1
  JOIN NumberedEvents ne3 ON ne2.case_id = ne3.case_id AND ne3.seq_num = ne2.seq_num + 1
  WHERE 
    ne1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
    AND ne2.activity = 'Create Order'
    AND ne3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)
SELECT 
  case_id,
  (t3 - t2) AS duration
FROM Triplet
WHERE duration > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60;

This way, we're ensuring that the triplet is exactly three consecutive events in the sequence, regardless of where they occur in the case.

Then, collect the `case_id`s where this condition is met.

So, the final query would be:

SELECT * FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (
  WITH NumberedEvents AS (
    SELECT 
      case_id,
      activity,
      timestamp,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM event_log
  ),
  Triplet AS (
    SELECT 
      ne1.case_id,
      ne1.activity AS a1,
      ne1.timestamp AS t1,
      ne2.activity AS a2,
      ne2.timestamp AS t2,
      ne3.activity AS a3,
      ne3.timestamp AS t3
    FROM NumberedEvents ne1
    JOIN NumberedEvents ne2 ON ne1.case_id = ne2.case_id AND ne2.seq_num = ne1.seq_num + 1
    JOIN NumberedEvents ne3 ON ne2.case_id = ne3.case_id AND ne3.seq_num = ne2.seq_num + 1
    WHERE 
      ne1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND ne2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND ne3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
  )
  SELECT DISTINCT case_id
  FROM Triplet
  WHERE (t3 - t2) > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60
);

But wait, what about cases where the same triplet occurs multiple times? For example, a case could have the triplet starting at seq_num 1 and again at seq_num 4. The `DISTINCT` ensures we only count each case once, which is correct.

Another thing to consider: the timestamp difference. The calculation (t3 - t2) assumes that the timestamps are in a format that can be subtracted to get the difference in seconds. If the timestamps are in a different format, like datetime, we might need to cast them or use a different approach to calculate the difference.

In DuckDB, subtracting two timestamps (which are stored as integers representing seconds since the epoch) gives the difference in seconds. So, 5 days is 5*24*60*60 = 432000 seconds.

So, the condition (t3 - t2) > 432000 would correctly identify cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.

Putting it all together, the query seems solid. It first numbers the events in each case, then looks for triplets of consecutive events matching the required sequence, checks the timing, and collects the `case_id`s to exclude.

Finally, the main query selects all events except those from these excluded `case_id`s.

I think this approach covers all the requirements:

1. Identifies cases with the exact sequence.

2. Checks the timing between the second and third activities.

3. Excludes these cases from the final result.

I should also consider performance. Using CTEs and joins might have performance implications, but given that DuckDB is optimized for such operations, especially with the window functions and row numbering, it should handle it efficiently.

Testing this with sample data would be helpful to ensure it works as expected. For example, a case with the triplet and timing over 5 days should be excluded, while another case with the triplet but timing under 5 days should remain, and a case without the triplet should also remain.

Yes, this should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to identify cases in an event log that contain a specific sequence of activities and meet a timing condition, then exclude these cases from the final result. The sequence of activities is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, with the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeding 5 days.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Sequence**: Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to number events within each case and then look for consecutive events that match the required sequence.
2. **Check Timing Condition**: For cases identified with the sequence, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days.
3. **Exclude Cases**: Exclude events from cases that meet both the sequence and timing condition.

### Solution Code

```sql
WITH NumberedEvents AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS seq_num
    FROM 
        event_log
),
Triplet AS (
    SELECT 
        ne1.case_id,
        ne1.activity AS a1,
        ne1.timestamp AS t1,
        ne2.activity AS a2,
        ne2.timestamp AS t2,
        ne3.activity AS a3,
        ne3.timestamp AS t3
    FROM 
        NumberedEvents ne1
    JOIN 
        NumberedEvents ne2 ON ne1.case_id = ne2.case_id AND ne2.seq_num = ne1.seq_num + 1
    JOIN 
        NumberedEvents ne3 ON ne2.case_id = ne3.case_id AND ne3.seq_num = ne2.seq_num + 1
    WHERE 
        ne1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
        AND ne2.activity = 'Create Order'
        AND ne3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
)
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
    event_log
WHERE 
    case_id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT case_id
        FROM Triplet
        WHERE (t3 - t2) > 5 * 24 * 60 * 60
    );
```

### Explanation
1. **NumberedEvents CTE**: This CTE assigns a sequence number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This helps in identifying consecutive events.
2. **Triplet CTE**: This CTE identifies triplets of consecutive events where the activities are 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order' in that order. It joins the numbered events to check for the exact sequence.
3. **Final Selection**: The main query selects all events except those from cases where the triplet sequence exists and the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' exceeds 5 days. This is done by excluding `case_id`s identified in the Triplet CTE that meet the timing condition.

This approach ensures that we efficiently identify and exclude the required cases while maintaining clarity and performance.
