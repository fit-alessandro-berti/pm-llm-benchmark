Based on the provided data, it appears that there is a complex system for transporting and managing goods using various types of vehicles such as fork trucks and containers. The system involves various steps such as "Book Vehicles," "Order Empty Containers," and "Depart."

The data shows that the process starts with customers placing orders, which are then registered and a transport document is created. From there, the transport document is used to book vehicles, which are then loaded with goods and taken to various locations. At these locations, the containers are unloaded from the vehicles and placed in stock or rescheduled for a later pick-up.

The system also involves various events such as "Bring to Loading Bay" and "Weigh" that occur during the loading and unloading of goods. These events appear to be related to the specific object type being moved, whether it's a fork truck or a container.

Overall, the data suggests that this is a highly organized and efficient system for managing and transporting goods using various types of vehicles.
