### Explanation of Added Constraints:

1. **Existence of `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Ensures that activities `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck` are part of the process, which are crucial for fairness checks.

2. **Coexistence of `ManualReview` with `Approve_Minority` and `Reject_Minority`:**
   - Ensures that whenever a decision (`Approve_Minority` or `Reject_Minority`) is made for a sensitive applicant, a `ManualReview` must also occur. This helps in ensuring that decisions are not made without proper review.

3. **Response from `CheckApplicantRace` to `BiasMitigationCheck`:**
   - Ensures that after checking the applicant's race, a `BiasMitigationCheck` must be performed before any decision is made. This prevents immediate biased decisions based on sensitive attributes.

4. **Succession from `BiasMitigationCheck` to `FinalDecision`:**
   - Ensures that a `FinalDecision` can only follow a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring that all decisions are made after considering bias mitigation.

5. **Non-succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`:**
   - Prevents a direct succession from `CheckApplicantRace` to `Reject`, ensuring that a rejection decision is not made immediately after checking the applicant's race without proper checks.

These constraints collectively help in reducing bias by ensuring that sensitive attributes are not the sole basis for decisions and that proper reviews and checks are in place.
