 In the given event log, the following attributes could potentially be considered sensitive for fairness:

1. `case:citizen` - This attribute indicates whether a case is related to a citizen or not. If this information is used in decision-making processes such as job applications, it could potentially lead to biases if the process treats citizens and non-citizens differently.

2. `case:gender` - This attribute represents the gender of the individual associated with each case. If this information is used in decision-making processes and leads to disparities between genders, it could be a potential source of bias.

3. `case:german speaking` - This attribute suggests that German language proficiency may play a role in the process. If non-German speakers are disadvantaged in some way due to this attribute, it could lead to unfair treatment based on nationality or language.

4. `resource` - Although not directly related to sensitive personal attributes, certain resources like 'Senior Partner' might have decision-making power and potentially exhibit biases if they treat cases differently based on factors like race, ethnicity, or other protected characteristics. It's important to monitor the behavior of these resources to ensure fairness.

5. The absence of explicit attributes related to race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, religion, and other protected characteristics does not necessarily mean that biases do not exist in this data. For example, patterns could emerge between certain job application outcomes and implicit attributes derived from names, or time-related factors like the day of the week when an application was submitted. It's essential to consider such implications when evaluating fairness in the process described by the event log.
