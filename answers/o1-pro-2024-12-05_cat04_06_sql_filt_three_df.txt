Below is one possible DuckDB SQL query that meets the requirements. It first finds the cases that contain the exact three-event sequence (`Approve Purchase Requisition` → `Create Order` → `Confirm Order`) with no intervening events and where the time between `Create Order` and `Confirm Order` is more than 5 days. It then excludes those cases from the final result set.

```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        activity,
        timestamp,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn
    FROM event_log
),
matching_cases AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT o1.case_id
    FROM ordered_events o1
    JOIN ordered_events o2 ON o2.case_id = o1.case_id AND o2.rn = o1.rn + 1
    JOIN ordered_events o3 ON o3.case_id = o1.case_id AND o3.rn = o1.rn + 2
    WHERE o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'
      AND o2.activity = 'Create Order'
      AND o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'
      AND o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'
)

SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id NOT IN (SELECT case_id FROM matching_cases)
ORDER BY case_id, timestamp;
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ordered_events` CTE:**  
   - We assign a row number (`rn`) to each event within each case, ordered chronologically. This allows us to refer to consecutive events easily.

2. **`matching_cases` CTE:**  
   - We join the `ordered_events` CTE to itself twice to look at consecutive triplets of events (o1, o2, o3).
   - We look for the pattern: `o1.activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'`, `o2.activity = 'Create Order'`, and `o3.activity = 'Confirm Order'`, ensuring that they are consecutive (rn, rn+1, rn+2).
   - We add the time constraint `o3.timestamp - o2.timestamp > INTERVAL '5 days'`.
   - Any case_id that meets all these criteria is selected as a "matching case" to be excluded.

3. **Final Selection:**  
   - We return all events from `event_log` that do not belong to the identified `matching_cases`.
   - The final result will include every event from cases that do not have the problematic sequence.

The final output will thus exclude all events from cases that have this exact triplet in direct succession where the time between the second and third events is more than 5 days.
