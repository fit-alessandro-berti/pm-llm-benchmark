Here is a Python implementation of the Log Skeleton Process Model for the hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {
        'Purchase and Payment': {'Order', 'Invoice'},
        'Payment and Order': {'Payment', 'Order'},
    },
    'always_before': {
        'Process Order': ['Payment'],  # must have been executed before making payment
        'Order received by Payee': ['Process Payment'],
        'Pay Invoice': []  # never together with Process Order, as there's no way to reconcile Purchase-to-Pay flow
    },
    'always_after': {
        # Directly-Follows constraints: if one activity occurs, so does the next
        # This assumes a simple payment sequence, where Payment is processed after receiving an invoice
        'Payment after Invoice receipt by Payee': ['Process Payment'],
        'Order status updated after Process Order completion'
    },
    'never_together': {
        # Never Together constraints: cannot execute a single activity together with the same case constraint in the same case
        'Never two payments to be executed at once inside the same case': [],  # Always allows making payment before starting Process Purchase
    },
    'activ_freq': {
        'Order': {1},  # Limited to one Order occurrence per case
        'Invoice': {0, 1},  # Can occur up to two times in cases (Payment process may occur multiple invoices), can't overlap with order as single
        'Payment': {},  # None allowed for payments as they happen outside the Order frequency constraint
        'Process Purchase': {}  # No specified frequency constraint as it's an activity that only appears after Order is processed.
    }
}
```

In here, we've modelled a simple Purchase-to-Pay process using Python dictionaries.
