## 20 Open-Ended Questions about the Smartphone Supply Chain Process:

1. Why was a 24/7 operation chosen for the assembly stage, and what are the trade-offs considered regarding labor costs, maintenance, and potential burnout?
2. What criteria are used to define "high-demand markets" for air freight versus "other markets" for cargo ship transport, and how often are these criteria reviewed?
3. What specific quality checks and diagnostic tests are performed, and what constitutes a "pass" or "fail" for each test?
4. How is the decision made between "rework" and "scrap" during the quality check failure scenario, considering cost, time, and potential impact on brand reputation?
5. What contingency plans are in place if a key component supplier (e.g., in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea) experiences a disruption (natural disaster, political instability, etc.)?
6. How are relationships managed with multiple suppliers across different countries, and what mechanisms are in place to ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery?
7. What level of inventory is maintained at each stage of the supply chain (component suppliers, assembly plant, regional distribution centers), and how is this level determined?
8. How is the "stability" of demand assessed before proceeding to the next sales cycle, and what metrics are used to define "stable"?
9. What communication protocols are in place to ensure seamless information flow between all stakeholders (suppliers, assembly plant, distribution centers, retailers, e-commerce platforms)?
10. How are regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., safety standards, import/export regulations) managed across different regions (Europe, North America, Asia, LatAm)?
11. What key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked to measure the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain?
12. How is the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates managed across the multinational supply chain?
13. What role does technology (e.g., blockchain, IoT, AI) play, or could play, in optimizing this supply chain process?
14. How are ethical sourcing and sustainability considerations integrated into the supplier selection and management process?
15. What is the process for handling customer returns and reverse logistics within this supply chain?
16. How are potential risks related to intellectual property protection managed across different countries and suppliers?
17. What is the decision-making process for introducing new smartphone models or features, and how does this impact the supply chain?
18. How is the process adapted to handle unexpected surges in demand (e.g., due to a viral marketing campaign)?
19. What mechanisms are in place to gather feedback from retailers and e-commerce platforms regarding product performance and customer satisfaction?
20. How is the supply chain designed to be resilient to geopolitical risks and potential trade wars or tariffs?
