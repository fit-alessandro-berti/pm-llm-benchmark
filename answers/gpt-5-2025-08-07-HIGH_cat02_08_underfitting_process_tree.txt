Example of an admitted-but-invalid trace:
Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Ship_Order, Package_Items, Authorize_Payment, Close_Order

Why this is problematic:
- The model uses a PARALLEL (AND) for Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, and Ship_Order, so it accepts any permutation of these three activities before Close_Order. Hence the above trace fits the model.
- Domain logic requires strict precedence: after sufficient inventory, first Authorize_Payment, then Package_Items, then Ship_Order, and only then Close_Order. Shipping before payment authorization (and before packaging) violates core business and operational constraints.

Note: The model also permits another invalid behavior on the cancel path: Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order (double close), due to Close_Order appearing both inside the cancel branch and again at the root.
