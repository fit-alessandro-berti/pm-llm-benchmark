# Process Anomaly Detection in Order Event Logs

## Identified Anomalies

### 1. Out-of-Sequence Activities
Multiple cases show activities occurring out of the expected process flow:
- Case 1002: Confirm Shipment occurs before Credit Check and Stock Validation
- Case 1003: Ship Goods occurs before Confirm Shipment
- Case 1004: Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice, and Confirm Shipment occurs after Ship Goods

### 2. Missing Activities
Some cases appear to be missing expected activities:
- Case 1004: No record of Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock

### 3. Inconsistent Department Involvement
Some activities are performed by resources from unexpected departments:
- Case 1004: Ship Goods is performed by WarehouseClerk_4 (Logistics) which is expected, but this occurs without prior Credit Check or Stock Validation

## Hypothesized Causes

### 1. Process Bypass/Shortcuts
Employees might be taking shortcuts through the process, potentially due to:
- System errors preventing proper workflow
- Pressure to complete orders quickly
- Lack of training on proper process adherence
- Exception handling not being properly recorded

### 2. System Integration Issues
Missing events could indicate:
- System failures where events weren't recorded
- Manual processes being used instead of the formal system
- Data integration problems between different systems

### 3. Role/Permission Misconfigurations
Resources might be performing activities outside their intended roles:
- Logistics managers performing shipping activities before validation
- Warehouse staff shipping goods without confirmation

### 4. Payment Processing Anomalies
Early payment receipt could indicate:
- Different payment terms for certain customers
- System errors causing misordered events
- Manual process overrides

## Investigative SQL Queries

### 1. Find all cases with out-of-sequence activities
```sql
WITH activity_sequence AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT *
FROM activity_sequence
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Register Order' AND next_activity != 'Perform Credit Check') OR
  (activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND next_activity != 'Validate Stock') OR
  (activity = 'Validate Stock' AND next_activity NOT IN ('Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods')) OR
  (activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND next_activity != 'Ship Goods') OR
  (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND next_activity != 'Issue Invoice') OR
  (activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND next_activity != 'Receive Payment')
  AND next_activity IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Identify cases with missing required activities
```sql
SELECT 
  o.case_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT oel.activity) AS actual_activities,
  ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment'] AS expected_activities
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel ON o.case_id = oel.case_id
GROUP BY o.case_id
HAVING 
  NOT (ARRAY['Register Order', 'Perform Credit Check', 'Validate Stock', 'Confirm Shipment', 'Ship Goods', 'Issue Invoice', 'Receive Payment']::text[])
  <@ ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT oel.activity);
```

### 3. Check for activity/department mismatches
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.case_id,
  oel.activity,
  oel.resource,
  r.department,
  r.role
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
WHERE 
  (activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales') OR
  (activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
  (activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
  (activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
  (activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
  (activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
  (activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.department != 'Finance');
```

### 4. Analyze timing anomalies for potential process violations
```sql
WITH ordered_events AS (
  SELECT 
    case_id,
    activity,
    timestamp,
    LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_event_time,
    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity
  FROM order_event_log
)
SELECT 
  case_id,
  activity,
  timestamp,
  next_activity,
  next_event_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (next_event_time - timestamp)) AS seconds_between
FROM ordered_events
WHERE next_event_time IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (next_event_time - timestamp)) < 0;
```

### 5. Find cases where payment was received before invoice issued
```sql
SELECT 
  oel1.case_id,
  oel1.activity AS payment_activity,
  oel1.timestamp AS payment_time,
  oel2.activity AS invoice_activity,
  oel2.timestamp AS invoice_time
FROM order_event_log oel1
LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel2 
  ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id 
  AND oel2.activity = 'Issue Invoice'
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Receive Payment'
  AND (oel2.timestamp IS NULL OR oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp);
```

### 6. Identify orders that shipped without confirmation
```sql
SELECT 
  oel1.case_id,
  oel1.timestamp AS ship_time,
  oel2.timestamp AS confirm_time
FROM order_event_log oel1
LEFT JOIN order_event_log oel2 
  ON oel1.case_id = oel2.case_id 
  AND oel2.activity = 'Confirm Shipment'
WHERE oel1.activity = 'Ship Goods'
  AND (oel2.timestamp IS NULL OR oel1.timestamp < oel2.timestamp);
```

### 7. Analyze resource behavior patterns to identify potential training needs
```sql
SELECT 
  oel.resource,
  r.role,
  r.department,
  COUNT(*) AS total_activities,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN 
    (oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.department != 'Finance')
    THEN 1 END) AS role_violations
FROM order_event_log oel
JOIN resources r ON oel.resource = r.resource_id
GROUP BY oel.resource, r.role, r.department
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN 
    (oel.activity = 'Register Order' AND r.department != 'Sales') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Perform Credit Check' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Validate Stock' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Confirm Shipment' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Ship Goods' AND r.department != 'Logistics') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Issue Invoice' AND r.department != 'Finance') OR
    (oel.activity = 'Receive Payment' AND r.department != 'Finance')
    THEN 1 END) > 0;
```

These queries will help analyze the event log data to identify where processes are not being followed, where system improvements might be needed, and where training interventions could be beneficial. The results would provide insights into process compliance issues and their potential root causes.
