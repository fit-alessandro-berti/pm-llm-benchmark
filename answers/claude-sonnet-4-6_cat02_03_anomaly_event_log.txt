# Procure-to-Pay Event Log Anomaly Analysis

## Standard P2P Reference Flow

Before identifying anomalies, the expected sequence in a well-controlled P2P process is:

```
Create Purchase Requisition
        
Approve Purchase Requisition
        
Issue Purchase Order
        
Receive Goods
        
Vendor Invoice Received
        
Match Invoice to PO (3-way match: PO + Goods Receipt + Invoice)
        
Release Payment
        
Close Case
```

## Case-by-Case Analysis

###  Case 1001 — **Normal**

| Step | Activity | Assessment |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Create Purchase Requisition |  |
| 2 | Approve Purchase Requisition |  |
| 3 | Issue Purchase Order |  |
| 4 | Receive Goods |  |
| 5 | Vendor Invoice Received |  |
| 6 | Match Invoice to PO |  |
| 7 | Release Payment |  |
| 8 | Close Case |  |

**Assessment:** This case follows the standard P2P sequence exactly and serves as the **baseline reference**. No anomalies detected.

###  Case 1002 — **Multiple Critical Anomalies**

**Reconstructed sequence:**
```
Create Purchase Requisition (08:30)
Issue Purchase Order (08:40)           Skipped approval
Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 3, 07:00)
Release Payment (Feb 3, 07:15)         Payment before approval, goods receipt, and matching
Approve Purchase Requisition (Feb 3, 08:00)  Approval AFTER PO, payment
Receive Goods (Feb 4, 09:00)           Goods received AFTER payment
Match Invoice to PO (Feb 5, 08:00)     Matching AFTER payment
Close Case
```

#### Anomaly 1: Purchase Order Issued Without Prior Requisition Approval
- **What happened:** The PO was issued just 10 minutes after requisition creation, bypassing the approval step entirely. Approval only occurred *two days later*.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - Circumvents the authorization control designed to validate business need and budget availability.
  - Creates **unauthorized financial commitments** to vendors.
  - Violates segregation of duties — the same flow that initiates the request should not also commit the organization to purchasing without oversight.

#### Anomaly 2: Payment Released Before Goods Were Received
- **What happened:** Payment was released on Feb 3 at 07:15, but goods were not received until Feb 4 at 09:00.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - The organization **pays for goods it has not yet confirmed receiving**, creating significant financial risk.
  - If goods are never delivered, defective, or incorrect, recovering funds from the vendor is far more difficult after payment.
  - This bypasses a core internal control in P2P — payment should only follow confirmed receipt.

#### Anomaly 3: Payment Released Before Invoice-to-PO Matching
- **What happened:** Payment was released on Feb 3, but the invoice-to-PO match didn't occur until Feb 5.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - The **3-way match** (PO + Goods Receipt + Invoice) is the primary financial control to ensure the organization is paying the correct amount for the correct goods.
  - Paying before matching means there is no verification that the invoice amount aligns with what was ordered or received, creating exposure to **overpayment, duplicate payment, or fraud**.

#### Anomaly 4: Requisition Approved After Payment Was Already Made
- **What happened:** Approval of the purchase requisition occurred *after* the PO was issued and *after* payment was released.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - Approval becomes a **meaningless rubber stamp** — no actual control is exercised if the entire transaction has already occurred.
  - This pattern is a hallmark of **retroactive approvals**, which are a major red flag in audits and may indicate deliberate control circumvention.

###  Case 1003 — **Critical Anomaly: Payment Before Invoice and Goods Receipt**

**Reconstructed sequence:**
```
Create Purchase Requisition (Feb 2, 09:00)
Approve Purchase Requisition (Feb 2, 09:10)
Issue Purchase Order (Feb 2, 10:00)
Release Payment (Feb 8, 11:00)         Payment before invoice and goods receipt
Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 9, 12:00) Invoice arrives AFTER payment
Receive Goods (Feb 10, 13:00)          Goods arrive AFTER payment
Match Invoice to PO (Feb 11, 14:00)    Matching AFTER payment
Close Case
```

#### Anomaly 1: Payment Released Before Vendor Invoice Was Received
- **What happened:** Payment was made on Feb 8, but the vendor invoice wasn't received until Feb 9.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - Payment without an invoice means there is **no formal billing document** to validate what is being paid, the amount due, or the payment terms.
  - This could result in paying an **incorrect amount** with no basis for dispute resolution.
  - Represents a **missing audit trail** — invoices are legal documents that justify disbursements.

#### Anomaly 2: Payment Released Before Goods Were Received
- **What happened:** Payment was made on Feb 8, but goods were not received until Feb 10.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - Identical risk to Case 1002 — the organization has **no confirmation of delivery** before disbursing funds.
  - Particularly severe here because payment preceded *both* the invoice *and* the goods receipt, meaning payment was made with virtually no supporting documentation.

#### Anomaly 3: Invoice-to-PO Matching Performed After Payment
- **What happened:** The 3-way match occurred on Feb 11, three days after payment.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - The matching control is rendered completely ineffective — **any discrepancies discovered post-payment** cannot prevent the erroneous or fraudulent payment from occurring.
  - This sequence suggests either a **process breakdown or deliberate circumvention** of financial controls.

###  Case 1004 — **Anomaly: Goods Received Before Purchase Order Was Issued**

**Reconstructed sequence:**
```
Create Purchase Requisition (Feb 5, 10:00)
Approve Purchase Requisition (Feb 5, 10:15)
Receive Goods (Feb 6, 09:00)           Goods received before PO issued
Issue Purchase Order (Feb 6, 09:15)    PO issued AFTER goods receipt
Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 7, 08:00)
Match Invoice to PO (Feb 7, 08:30)
Release Payment (Feb 7, 09:00)
Close Case
```

#### Anomaly: Goods Received Before Purchase Order Was Issued
- **What happened:** Goods were received at 09:00 on Feb 6, but the Purchase Order was only issued at 09:15 — *after* the goods arrived.
- **Why it's problematic:**
  - A Purchase Order is the **formal, legally binding document** that authorizes a vendor to ship goods and establishes agreed-upon terms (price, quantity, delivery date).
  - Receiving goods without an existing PO means the organization accepted a delivery with **no pre-authorized contract terms**, creating potential disputes over price or quantity.
  - This is often called a **"maverick purchase"** or **unauthorized procurement** — a significant compliance and audit risk.
  - The PO issued retroactively may simply be created to **paper over an unauthorized transaction**, which undermines the entire procurement control framework.
  - Vendors may exploit this situation knowing the organization has already accepted goods, reducing negotiating leverage.

## Key Takeaways and Recommendations

1. **Enforce sequential gate controls** in the process management system — the system should **block** issuing a PO without an approved requisition.

2. **Implement a payment hold rule** that prevents payment release until all three elements of the 3-way match are confirmed: PO  + Goods Receipt  + Invoice .

3. **Flag retroactive approvals** automatically — any approval that occurs after dependent steps have already been completed should trigger an audit alert.

4. **Investigate Cases 1002 and 1003 immediately**, as the pattern of paying before receipt and matching is a strong indicator of either a **serious process breakdown** or potential **fraudulent disbursement activity**.

5. **Review Case 1004** for whether the goods receipt was a legitimate delivery error or evidence of a vendor relationship that operates outside proper procurement channels.
