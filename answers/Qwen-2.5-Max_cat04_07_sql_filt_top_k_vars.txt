To solve the problem, we need to construct a DuckDB SQL query that follows the outlined steps. Below is the detailed explanation and the corresponding SQL query.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Extract Ordered Activity Sequences per Case**:
   - For each `case_id`, sort the activities by their `timestamp` and concatenate them into a single string representing the sequence of activities.
   - This can be achieved using the `LISTAGG` function in DuckDB, which concatenates values into a string with a specified delimiter.

2. **Group Cases by Their Activity Sequence**:
   - After extracting the activity sequences, group the cases by these sequences to identify unique process variants.
   - Count the number of cases for each variant.

3. **Identify the Top K Variants**:
   - Rank the variants by their frequency (number of cases) in descending order.
   - Select the top K variants based on this ranking.

4. **Filter Events Belonging to the Top K Variants**:
   - Use the identified top K variants to filter the original `event_log` table.
   - Return only the events that belong to cases matching the top K variants.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
WITH ordered_sequences AS (
    -- Step 1: Extract ordered activity sequences for each case_id
    SELECT
        case_id,
        LISTAGG(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    -- Step 2: Group cases by their activity sequence and count occurrences
    SELECT
        activity_sequence,
        COUNT(*) AS variant_count
    FROM ordered_sequences
    GROUP BY activity_sequence
),
top_k_variants AS (
    -- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency
    SELECT
        activity_sequence
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY variant_count DESC
    LIMIT K -- Replace K with the desired number of top variants
),
filtered_cases AS (
    -- Step 4: Filter cases that belong to the top K variants
    SELECT
        os.case_id
    FROM ordered_sequences os
    JOIN top_k_variants tkv
    ON os.activity_sequence = tkv.activity_sequence
)
-- Step 5: Return events from the original log that belong to the filtered cases
SELECT
    el.*
FROM event_log el
JOIN filtered_cases fc
ON el.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**

1. **`ordered_sequences` CTE**:
   - This Common Table Expression (CTE) computes the ordered activity sequence for each `case_id` by sorting the `activity` column based on `timestamp` and concatenating the activities using `LISTAGG`.

2. **`variant_counts` CTE**:
   - This CTE groups the cases by their `activity_sequence` and counts how many cases correspond to each sequence, effectively identifying the frequency of each process variant.

3. **`top_k_variants` CTE**:
   - This CTE ranks the variants by their frequency (`variant_count`) in descending order and selects the top K variants using the `LIMIT` clause.

4. **`filtered_cases` CTE**:
   - This CTE identifies the `case_id`s that belong to the top K variants by joining the `ordered_sequences` with the `top_k_variants`.

5. **Final Selection**:
   - The final query filters the original `event_log` table to include only the events whose `case_id` matches one of the filtered cases.

### **Key Notes**
- Replace `K` in the `LIMIT K` clause with the desired number of top variants.
- Ensure that the `LISTAGG` function uses the correct delimiter (`'->'` in this case) to represent the activity sequence.
- The query assumes that the `event_log` table contains valid data with no missing or null values in the `case_id`, `activity`, or `timestamp` columns.

This query is efficient and leverages DuckDB's capabilities for handling ordered aggregations and filtering.
