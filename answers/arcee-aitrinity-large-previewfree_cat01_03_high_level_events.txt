Looking at the sequence of events, the first thing that stands out is the natural progression of activities for each case. The process begins with handling the raw material, then moves into shaping and joining, followed by surface treatment, and ends with verification. These phases align closely with typical manufacturing stages.

The earliest events—retrieving the metal sheet, scanning its barcode, placing it on the table, aligning it, and preheating—are all preparatory in nature. They don't yet change the part's form in a structural way but set the stage for further processing. Grouping these into **Material Preparation** makes sense because they're all focused on getting the raw material ready for the next steps.

Next comes the welding sequence. Picking up the welding tool, followed by multiple welding actions and then an integrity check, is clearly a cohesive unit. These events are tightly clustered in time, performed by the same operator, and serve the same purpose: assembling or joining components. Naming this phase **Assembly** reflects its role in building the product.

After assembly, there's the application of a protective coating, followed by drying and then a visual inspection. The coating and drying are surface treatments that protect the product, and the visual check confirms quality. While the visual check could be seen as part of a broader quality control phase, in this workflow it appears to be the final step for each case, so grouping the coating, drying, and inspection together as **Finishing & Quality Check** captures both the finishing operation and the final verification.

Here's how the events would map:

**Case A1:**
1. **Material Preparation** - Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet
2. **Assembly** - Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity
3. **Finishing & Quality Check** - Apply protective coating, Dry coating, Visual check

**Case B2:**
1. **Material Preparation** - Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet
2. **Assembly** - Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B, Measure weld integrity
3. **Finishing & Quality Check** - Apply protective coating, Dry coating, Visual check

This grouping reflects both the logical flow of manufacturing and the temporal clustering of events, resulting in a clear, high-level view of the process.
