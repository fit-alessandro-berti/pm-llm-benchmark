We need to compare logs, identify bias, explain manifestation, consider LocalResident, CommunityGroup, ScoreAdjustment, systematic differences. Provide analysis, maybe a table summarizing differences, discuss fairness, potential disparate impact. Use LaTeX for math. No code needed. Provide thorough answer.

**Comparison of the two event logs**

| Feature | **Group A – Protected** | **Group B – Unprotected** |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **LocalResident** | All cases are `FALSE` (non‑resident). | All cases are `TRUE` (resident). |
| **CommunityGroup** | `None` for every case. | Two cases belong to *Highland Civic Darts Club* (a community‑affiliation attribute); the third case has `None`. |
| **PreliminaryScore** | 720, 710, 740 – identical to the raw credit‑score that the scoring engine produces. | Same raw scores (720, 710, 695) **plus** a *+10* “Community Boost” for the two cases that belong to the darts club. |
| **ScoreAdjustment** | Always `0` (or `N/A` for the manual‑review step). | `+10` for the darts‑club members; `0` for the case with no community affiliation. |
| **FinalDecision** | Approved for 720 & 740, Rejected for 710. | Approved for the two boosted cases (720 → 730, 695 → 705) and Rejected for the un‑boosted case (710). |

## Which log exhibits bias?

**The log for Group B (the unprotected group) shows a systematic bias.**  
The bias is introduced through the **CommunityGroup** attribute and the associated **ScoreAdjustment** (“Community Boost”). This adjustment raises the effective score of applicants who belong to *Highland Civic Darts Club* by +10 points, which directly influences the downstream decision:

* For case **U001** the raw score 720 becomes 730 → **Approved**.  
* For case **U003** the raw score 695 becomes 705 → **Approved** (despite being below the 710 threshold that led to a rejection in Group A).  

In contrast, the protected‑group log (Group A) never receives any adjustment; decisions are made solely on the raw score.

## How the bias manifests

1. **Score inflation tied to a non‑protected attribute**  
   The column *ScoreAdjustment* is non‑zero **only** for members of a specific community group that is *not* a protected characteristic (e.g., race, gender). This creates a **preferential treatment** rule:

   \[
   \text{AdjustedScore} = \text{PreliminaryScore} + 10 \quad\text{if CommunityGroup = “Highland Civic Darts Club”}
   \]

2. **Different decision thresholds**  
   If the decision rule is “approve when AdjustedScore ≥ 710”, then:

   * For a protected‑group applicant with a raw score of 695 (below the threshold) there is **no** mechanism to raise the score, so the outcome would be *Rejected*.
   * For an unprotected‑group applicant with the same raw score but belonging to the darts club, the adjustment lifts the score to 705 (still below 710) **but** the example shows an *Approved* decision, indicating that the system may be using a **lower effective threshold** for boosted cases (e.g., ≥ 700).  

   This inconsistency means that two applicants with identical credit‑worthiness receive different outcomes solely because one is a member of a favored community.

3. **Systematic advantage for a subset of the unprotected group**  
   The bias is **systematic** because every case that carries the *CommunityGroup* attribute receives the same +10 boost, regardless of the underlying risk profile. Consequently:

   * The **approval rate** for Group B is higher (2 / 3 ≈ 66 %) than for Group A (2 / 3 ≈ 66 %) **only because** the two boosted cases would have been rejected under the raw‑score rule.  
   * If the dataset were larger, the presence of the boost would create a **disparate impact**: members of the darts club would enjoy a statistically higher chance of approval.

4. **Interaction with LocalResident**  
   Although *LocalResident* is opposite for the two groups (TRUE for Group B, FALSE for Group A), it never appears in the *ScoreAdjustment* column. The bias therefore does **not** stem from residency status, but the coexistence of the two attributes makes it easy to mis‑attribute the cause of disparate outcomes if one only looks at residency.

## Potential consequences

| Consequence | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Disparate impact** | Applicants from the protected group (or any applicant lacking the “Community Boost”) are disadvantaged even when their raw credit score is identical to a boosted applicant. |
| **Regulatory risk** | If the *CommunityGroup* attribute correlates with a protected class (e.g., if the darts club is predominantly composed of a particular ethnicity), the boost could be deemed indirect discrimination under fair‑lending statutes. |
| **Model transparency** | The adjustment is hard‑coded and not reflected in the *PreliminaryScore* column, making it difficult for auditors to trace why a decision changed. |
| **Strategic gaming** | Applicants may be incentivised to join the favored community group solely to obtain the boost, distorting the intended risk‑based decision process. |

## Summary

- **Group B’s log** contains a **bias** introduced by a deterministic *+10* score adjustment for members of a specific community group.  
- This adjustment **inflates** the effective credit score, leading to **more approvals** for those applicants, independent of their underlying risk.  
- The protected‑group log (Group A) lacks any such adjustment, so decisions are based purely on the raw score.  
- The bias manifests as a **systematic advantage** for a subset of the unprotected population, creating a potential **disparate impact** and raising fairness, compliance, and transparency concerns.  

To remediate, the organization should either (1) remove the community‑based boost, (2) ensure that any adjustments are **justified, transparent, and equally applied** across all protected and unprotected groups, or (3) replace the rule with a **fairness‑aware model** that explicitly checks for disparate impact before deployment.
