### POWL Model with Potential Unfairness

In this model, we represent the hiring process where there is an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch leads to a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other provides a subtle advantage if the applicant has community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define XOR choice for cultural fit evaluation
xor_cultural_fit = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])

# Define the partial order of the workflow
nodes = {
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_completeness,
    SkillAssessment,
    xor_cultural_fit,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
}

order = {
    ReceiveApplication --> loop_data_completeness,
    loop_data_completeness --> SkillAssessment,
    SkillAssessment --> xor_cultural_fit,
    xor_cultural_fit --> ManagerialReview,
    ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
}

root_with_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
for edge in order:
    root_with_unfairness.order.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])
```

### POWL Model Without Unfairness

In this model, we ensure that all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process without any special branches providing selective advantages based on community affiliations.

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Define loop for data completeness
loop_data_completeness = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Define the partial order of the workflow
nodes = {
    ReceiveApplication,
    loop_data_completeness,
    SkillAssessment,
    CulturalFitCheck,
    ManagerialReview,
    FinalDecision
}

order = {
    ReceiveApplication --> loop_data_completeness,
    loop_data_completeness --> SkillAssessment,
    SkillAssessment --> CulturalFitCheck,
    CulturalFitCheck --> ManagerialReview,
    ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision
}

root_without_unfairness = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes)
for edge in order:
    root_without_unfairness.order.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])
```

### Explanation:

- **Model with Potential Unfairness:**
  - The `XOR` operator (`xor_cultural_fit`) introduces a branching point after the `SkillAssessment`. Applicants can either go through the `CulturalFitCheck` or receive a subtle advantage through the `CommunityAffiliationCheck`.
  - This introduces potential bias as candidates with certain affiliations may be viewed more favorably.
  
- **Model Without Unfairness:**
  - All applicants proceed directly from `SkillAssessment` to `CulturalFitCheck`, ensuring a uniform evaluation process.
  - There is no branching path offering selective advantages, thus removing the source of potential bias.

These models illustrate how the hiring process can be structured differently to either include or exclude sources of bias, emphasizing the importance of fair and transparent practices in recruitment workflows.
