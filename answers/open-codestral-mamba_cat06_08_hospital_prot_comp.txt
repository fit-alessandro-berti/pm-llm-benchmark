Based on the process variants provided, there are several key differences between the treatment of the protected group (first) and the unprotected group (second):

1. **Registration Location**: The protected group is more likely to be registered at the Emergency Room (ER) compared to the unprotected group, which is more likely to be registered at the First Degree (FD). This could potentially lead to different levels of service, as ERs are generally more resource-intensive and have faster turnaround times.

2. **Execution Time**: The protected group's average execution time is generally higher than the unprotected group's. This could indicate that the protected group is receiving a more thorough examination and treatment, which may result in a higher quality of care.

3. **Treatment Outcome**: The protected group has a higher success rate of treatment (91.3% success rate) compared to the unprotected group (89.3% success rate). This could suggest a more effective treatment protocol for the protected group.

4. **Discharge Rate**: The protected group has a higher discharge rate (87.7% success rate) compared to the unprotected group (81.1% success rate). This could indicate that the protected group is more likely to be discharged from the hospital, potentially resulting in better patient outcomes.

5. **Frequency**: The protected group has a higher frequency of occurrence for certain process variants, such as "Register at ER -> Expert Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge" and "Register at ER -> Examination -> Thorough Examination -> Diagnosis -> Treatment -> Treatment successful -> Discharge". This could suggest that the protected group is receiving more complex treatment, which may lead to better outcomes.

6. **Performance**: While the average performance is similar between the two groups, some process variants have significantly higher performance for the protected group compared to the unprotected group. This could suggest that the protected group is receiving more efficient treatment.
