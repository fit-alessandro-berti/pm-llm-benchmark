### Identified Anomalies in the Temporal Profile Model

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - Average time: ~25 hours with a low standard deviation (3600 seconds / 1 hour). This indicates that the approval process might be overly rigid, potentially following a fixed automated schedule or workflow.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - Average time: 7 days with a large standard deviation (2 days). This inconsistency suggests either:
     - Significant delays due to process bottlenecks, such as resource unavailability, or
     - Erratic notification procedures causing variable response times.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - Average time: 2 hours. This is suspicious because it implies rapid closure of claims after being assigned, bypassing intermediate steps like evaluation or approval. This could signify improper claims handling or premature closures.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - Average time: 5 minutes with a very low standard deviation (60 seconds). The short duration suggests that the notification might be automated or overly streamlined, leading to skipped intermediate steps or insufficient review.

### Hypotheses for the Anomalies

1. **R to P (Receive to Approve):**
   - The low standard deviation might be due to automated batch processing, where claims are approved based on predefined rules rather than manual evaluation.
   - Alternatively, claims might have a fixed waiting period before being approved, enforced by system configurations.

2. **P to N (Approve to Notify):**
   - The long average with high variability might reflect resource constraints, such as limited staff handling notifications.
   - Claims requiring additional review or exceptional approvals may create long delays, whereas simpler claims might be notified immediately.

3. **A to C (Assign to Close):**
   - Certain claims may be prematurely closed due to errors, misclassification, or process shortcuts (e.g., fraudulent claim detection triggers immediate closure).
   - Claims may be assigned and resolved simultaneously in cases of trivial or invalid claims, bypassing the steps of evaluation and approval.

4. **E to N (Evaluate to Notify):**
   - The short duration and low variability suggest automated notification immediately following evaluation. However, skipped approval or review processes might lead to incomplete or erroneous notifications.

### Verification Approaches with SQL Queries

#### 1. **Identify Claims with Suspiciously Short or Long Durations Between Events:**

**Query for R  P (Receive to Approve):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM r.timestamp)) AS time_r_to_p
FROM claim_events r
JOIN claim_events p
  ON r.claim_id = p.claim_id
WHERE r.activity = 'R'
  AND p.activity = 'P'
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM r.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN 86400 AND 93600; -- Expected range: ~25 hours
```

**Query for P  N (Approve to Notify):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp)) AS time_p_to_n
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n
  ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
  AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN 432000 AND 777600; -- Expected range: 5-9 days
```

---

#### 2. **Correlate Timing Deviations with Adjusters, Claim Types, or Regions:**

**Query to Find Adjusters Associated with Fast Assign-to-Close (A  C):**
```sql
SELECT a.adjuster_id,
       a.name,
       a.specialization,
       a.region,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM c.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM a.timestamp)) AS avg_time_a_to_c
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events c
  ON a.claim_id = c.claim_id
JOIN adjusters aj
  ON a.resource = aj.name
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
  AND c.activity = 'C'
GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name, a.specialization, a.region
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM c.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM a.timestamp)) < 7200; -- Faster than average (2 hours)
```

**Query to Check Claim Types with Long Delays From Approval to Notification (P  N):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_type,
       COUNT(*) AS num_claims,
       AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp)) AS avg_time_p_to_n,
       STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp)) AS stdev_time_p_to_n
FROM claim_events p
JOIN claim_events n
  ON p.claim_id = n.claim_id
JOIN claims c
  ON p.claim_id = c.claim_id
WHERE p.activity = 'P'
  AND n.activity = 'N'
GROUP BY c.claim_type
HAVING AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM p.timestamp)) > 604800; -- Longer than 7 days
```

---

#### 3. **Find Claims Closed Immediately After Assignment (A  C):**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       c.submission_date,
       (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM cl.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM a.timestamp)) AS time_a_to_c,
       a.resource AS adjuster
FROM claim_events a
JOIN claim_events cl
  ON a.claim_id = cl.claim_id
WHERE a.activity = 'A'
  AND cl.activity = 'C'
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM cl.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM a.timestamp)) <= 3600; -- Within 1 hour
```

---

#### 4. **Verify E to N (Evaluate to Notify) Quick Transitions:**
```sql
SELECT c.claim_id,
       c.claim_type,
       (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM e.timestamp)) AS time_e_to_n
FROM claim_events e
JOIN claim_events n
  ON e.claim_id = n.claim_id
WHERE e.activity = 'E'
  AND n.activity = 'N'
  AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM n.timestamp) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM e.timestamp)) < 300; -- Less than 5 minutes
```

These queries can help identify timing deviations, correlate anomalies with specific factors (e.g., adjusters, regions, or claim types), and explore process irregularities systematically.
