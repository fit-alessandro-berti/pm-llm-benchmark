To solve this problem, we need to represent the complex digital service provisioning process at a telecom company as a POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language) model using the provided classes and constructs.

### Approach

1. **Identify Activities and Dependencies:**
   - **Service Request (SR)** verification is the starting point.
   - **Contract Setup (CS)** follows SR verification.
   - **Datacenter Allocation (DA)** and **Access Control Initialization (ACI)** can be performed in parallel after CS.
   - A loop involving **Base Network Configuration (BNC)** and optional **Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)** follows DA and ACI.
   - After exiting the loop, an exclusive choice between **Containerized Deployment (CD)** and **Monolithic Deployment (MD)** occurs.
   - **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Security Audit (SA)** can be performed in any order after deployment.
   - **Go-Live Approval (GLA)** occurs after both QA and SA are completed.

2. **Construct the POWL Model:**
   - Use `Transition` for activities with labels.
   - Use `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP` for the loop structure (BNC and D&R).
   - Use `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR` for the exclusive choice (CD or MD).
   - Use `StrictPartialOrder` to define partial orders and dependencies between activities.

### Solution Code

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define transitions for each activity
SR = Transition(label="SR")
CS = Transition(label="CS")
DA = Transition(label="DA")
ACI = Transition(label="ACI")
BNC = Transition(label="BNC")
DR = Transition(label="D&R")
CD = Transition(label="CD")
MD = Transition(label="MD")
QA = Transition(label="QA")
SA = Transition(label="SA")
GLA = Transition(label="GLA")

# Define the loop: BNC followed by optional D&R
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])

# Define the exclusive choice between CD and MD
xor_deployment = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CD, MD])

# Define partial orders for QA and SA with no specific order
qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[QA, SA])

# Define the main partial order that includes all activities and their dependencies
main_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, DA, ACI, loop, xor_deployment, qa_sa_partial_order, GLA])

# Add dependencies to the main partial order
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(SR, CS)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, DA)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(CS, ACI)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(DA, loop)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(ACI, loop)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(loop, xor_deployment)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(xor_deployment, qa_sa_partial_order)
main_partial_order.order.add_edge(qa_sa_partial_order, GLA)

# The root of the POWL model is the main partial order
root = main_partial_order
```

### Explanation

- **Transitions:** Each activity is represented by a `Transition` with its label.
- **Loop Structure:** The loop between BNC and D&R is modeled using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.LOOP`.
- **Exclusive Choice:** The choice between CD and MD is modeled using `OperatorPOWL` with `Operator.XOR`.
- **Partial Orders:**
  - `qa_sa_partial_order` allows QA and SA to be performed in any order or concurrently.
  - `main_partial_order` defines the overall workflow with dependencies:
    - SR must be completed before CS.
    - CS must be completed before DA and ACI.
    - DA and ACI can be performed in parallel and must be completed before the loop.
    - The loop (BNC and D&R) must be completed before deployment choices.
    - After deployment, QA and SA can be performed in any order.
    - GLA can only start after both QA and SA are completed.

This solution accurately models the described workflow using the POWL constructs provided.
