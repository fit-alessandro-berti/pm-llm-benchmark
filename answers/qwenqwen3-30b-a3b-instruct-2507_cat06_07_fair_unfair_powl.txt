Here are the two **POWL (Partially Ordered Workflow Language)** models as requested, based on the detailed hiring process description for **GlobalTeq Solutions**. The models reflect the two distinct scenarios: one with **potential unfairness** due to a biased XOR branch, and one **without unfairness**, ensuring equitable treatment for all applicants.

---

###  **1. POWL Model with Potential Unfairness (Biased Path)**

This model includes an **XOR choice** after the skill assessment: one branch leads to a standard **CulturalFitCheck**, and the other to a **CommunityAffiliationCheck** that subtly boosts evaluation scores. This introduces **selective advantage** based on affiliation, creating a potential bias.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
CommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop: Data completeness check (if incomplete, request info)
# * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo)
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Sequential: SkillAssessment  (XOR choice)
xor_branch = OperatorPOWL(
    operator=Operator.XOR,
    children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]
)

# Partial order: Ensure sequence and dependencies
# ReceiveApplication  loop_data  SkillAssessment  xor_branch  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data, SkillAssessment, xor_branch, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add ordering constraints
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data)
root.order.add_edge(loop_data, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor_branch)
root.order.add_edge(xor_branch, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Final model: Biased workflow with unfair XOR path
biased_workflow = root
```

>  **Why this model has potential unfairness**:  
> The **XOR choice** between `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` means applicants who are affiliated with the "Global Business Leaders Club" or flagged as local residents **automatically take the second path**, which may be evaluated more favorably (even if implicitly). This creates a **non-merit-based advantage** and introduces **systematic bias** in the hiring process.

---

###  **2. POWL Model Without Unfairness (Fair & Equitable Process)**

This model removes the **XOR branch** and ensures **all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation**, regardless of background or affiliation. The only difference is that **community affiliation data may be collected** (e.g., in the questionnaire), but it **does not influence evaluation**. The process is **fully standardized**.

```python
import pm4py
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, Transition, SilentTransition
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator

# Define activities
ReceiveApplication = Transition(label="ReceiveApplication")
DataCompletenessCheck = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
RequestMoreInfo = Transition(label="RequestMoreInfo")
SkillAssessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
CulturalFitCheck = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")  # Same for all
ManagerialReview = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
FinalDecision = Transition(label="FinalDecision")

# Loop: Data completeness check (if incomplete, request info)
loop_data = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo])

# Sequential: All steps in order
# ReceiveApplication  loop_data  SkillAssessment  CulturalFitCheck  ManagerialReview  FinalDecision
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ReceiveApplication, loop_data, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])

# Add ordering constraints
root.order.add_edge(ReceiveApplication, loop_data)
root.order.add_edge(loop_data, SkillAssessment)
root.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)
root.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)
root.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)

# Final model: Fair workflow — no biased branches
fair_workflow = root
```

>  **Why this model avoids unfairness**:  
> - No XOR choice between evaluation paths.  
> - All applicants undergo **identical cultural fit evaluation**.  
> - Community affiliation data (if collected) is **not used to alter outcomes**.  
> - The process is **transparent, consistent, and merit-based**, eliminating the risk of subtle bias.

###  Summary Comparison

| Feature | Biased Model (Unfair) | Fair Model (No Unfairness) |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| XOR choice after skill test |  Yes (between `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck`) |  No |
| Differential treatment based on affiliation |  Yes (implicit uplift via `CommunityAffiliationCheck`) |  No |
| Standardized cultural fit evaluation |  No (path-dependent) |  Yes (same for all) |
| Data completeness loop |  Yes |  Yes |
| Final decision based on merit |  Risk of bias |  High fairness |

###  Recommendation:
To ensure **ethical and equitable hiring**, GlobalTeq Solutions should adopt the **fair workflow model** (Model 2). Any data about community affiliations should be **collected for diversity reporting only**, and **never used in evaluation**. This preserves transparency, fairness, and compliance with anti-discrimination standards.
