### Proposed High-Level Process Steps

Based on the provided event log subset, which shows highly consistent sequences across cases (A1 and B2), I analyzed the events by considering temporal proximity (e.g., clusters within 5-20 seconds), resource types (e.g., operator vs. machine/sensor), logical flow (e.g., preparatory actions leading to fabrication), and domain context (a metal fabrication process involving preparation, joining, finishing, and verification). The patterns repeat identically in structure for both cases, with minor variations in timestamps, part details, and measurements, confirming repeatable phases.

I identified **4 high-level steps** that aggregate the 12 low-level events per case into coherent stages. These steps represent distinct phases of a sheet metal fabrication workflow: initial setup, structural assembly via welding, surface protection, and final validation. Events were grouped if they:
- Form a sequential chain toward a single outcome (e.g., all actions enabling welding).
- Share a primary resource category (e.g., human operator for handling, automated units for treatment).
- Occur in tight temporal windows without intervening phases.
- Align with manufacturing logic (e.g., preheating before welding to avoid defects).

Below is a structured summary:

| High-Level Activity Name | Included Low-Level Events (by Activity) | Case Timestamps (A1 Example) | Rationale for Grouping |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Material Preparation** | - Retrieve raw metal sheet<br>- Scan barcode<br>- Place metal sheet on table<br>- Align metal sheet<br>- Preheat metal sheet | 08:00:05 to 08:00:20 | These form the initial setup phase to ready the raw material for fabrication. They are temporally clustered (15-second span), primarily involve Operator A for manual handling followed by automated alignment and heating (logical progression: acquire → verify → position → prepare surface). This ensures traceability (barcode) and optimal conditions (alignment/preheat) before downstream steps, preventing errors in later assembly. Excludes later events due to resource shift (Operator B) and ~40-second gap. |
| **Welding Assembly** | - Pick up welding tool<br>- Weld corner A<br>- Weld corner B<br>- Measure weld integrity | 08:01:00 to 08:01:20 | This captures the core structural joining phase. Events are tightly sequenced (20-second span) around Operator B's welding actions, with immediate sensor verification. Logically, tool pickup enables the welds, and integrity measurement directly assesses the welds' quality (e.g., score of 95/93). Grouping here emphasizes assembly as a distinct fabrication step, separate from preparation (different operator) and finishing (machine-focused). |
| **Protective Finishing** | - Apply protective coating<br>- Dry coating | 08:01:30 to 08:01:45 | These represent post-assembly surface treatment to protect the welded structure. They are a brief machine-driven pair (15-second span) with shared purpose (coating application followed by curing via heat). Rationale: Both use heating/coating units, form a logical "apply-then-dry" dependency, and occur after welding verification but before human inspection. Isolated from others by resource type (no operator) and focus on environmental protection rather than structure or quality. |
| **Final Quality Inspection** | - Visual check | 08:02:00 | This is a standalone verification at process end. As the final event (~15-second gap from prior), it involves a dedicated operator (C) for holistic review ("Passed"). Grouping as singular due to its role as a gatekeeping check, distinct from inline measurements (e.g., weld sensor). It confirms overall product readiness, closing the workflow. |

### Additional Notes
- **Coverage**: This grouping fully aggregates all 12 events per case without overlap or omission, reducing granularity from 12 steps to 4 for workflow visualization.
- **Generalization Rules**: For the full log, apply these rules: (1) Cluster by 20-40 second temporal breaks; (2) Group by phase intent (prep → fabricate → treat → inspect); (3) Use resource shifts as boundaries (e.g., Operator A to B signals phase change). Variations (e.g., integrity scores) do not affect grouping but could flag anomalies in analysis.
- **Benefits**: These high-level steps simplify process mining, e.g., for bottleneck detection (e.g., welding duration) or conformance checking, while preserving traceability to low-level details. If the full log introduces variations, groupings could be refined (e.g., via code-based clustering if needed).
