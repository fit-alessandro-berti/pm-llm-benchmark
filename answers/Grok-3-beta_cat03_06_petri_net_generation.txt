Let’s construct an accepting Petri net for the insurance claim management process using pm4py. The process involves sequential activities, conditional loops (e.g., document re-submission and in-depth investigation), and a clear start and end state. Below, I’ll define the Petri net with places, transitions, arcs, and the initial and final markings, followed by the Python code.
Petri Net Design
Places: Represent states between activities (e.g., "claim filed," "documents verified," "claim closed").
Transitions: Represent activities (e.g., "Claim Registration," "Payment").
Arcs: Connect places and transitions to enforce the process flow.
Loops:
After "Document Verification" (DV), if incomplete, loop back via "Re-Document Submission" (RDS).
After "Fraud Check" (FC), if suspicious, loop back via "In-depth Investigation" (II).
Initial Marking: A token in the "start" place (new claim filed).
Final Marking: A token in the "end" place (claim closed).
Process Flow with Places and Transitions
Start: p_start → Claim Registration (CR) → p_registered
p_registered → Document Verification (DV) → p_verified
If incomplete: p_verified → Re-Document Submission (RDS) → p_resubmitted → back to DV
p_verified → Fraud Check (FC) → p_checked
If suspicious: p_checked → In-depth Investigation (II) → p_investigated → back to FC
p_checked → Claim Assessment (CA) → p_assessed
p_assessed → Approval (AP) → p_approved
p_approved → Payment (P) → p_paid
p_paid → Notification (N) → p_notified
p_notified → Closure (CL) → p_end
Python Code
Here’s the implementation:
python
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking
from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils

# Create the Petri net
net = PetriNet(name="insurance_claim_process")

# Define places (states between activities)
p_start = PetriNet.Place(name="p_start")  # Claim filed
p_registered = PetriNet.Place(name="p_registered")
p_verified = PetriNet.Place(name="p_verified")
p_resubmitted = PetriNet.Place(name="p_resubmitted")
p_checked = PetriNet.Place(name="p_checked")
p_investigated = PetriNet.Place(name="p_investigated")
p_assessed = PetriNet.Place(name="p_assessed")
p_approved = PetriNet.Place(name="p_approved")
p_paid = PetriNet.Place(name="p_paid")
p_notified = PetriNet.Place(name="p_notified")
p_end = PetriNet.Place(name="p_end")  # Claim closed

# Add places to the net
for place in [p_start, p_registered, p_verified, p_resubmitted, p_checked, 
              p_investigated, p_assessed, p_approved, p_paid, p_notified, p_end]:
    net.places.add(place)

# Define transitions (activities)
t_cr = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_cr", label="Claim Registration")
t_dv = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_dv", label="Document Verification")
t_rds = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_rds", label="Re-Document Submission")
t_fc = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_fc", label="Fraud Check")
t_ii = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ii", label="In-depth Investigation")
t_ca = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ca", label="Claim Assessment")
t_ap = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_ap", label="Approval")
t_p = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_p", label="Payment")
t_n = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_n", label="Notification")
t_cl = PetriNet.Transition(name="t_cl", label="Closure")

# Add transitions to the net
for trans in [t_cr, t_dv, t_rds, t_fc, t_ii, t_ca, t_ap, t_p, t_n, t_cl]:
    net.transitions.add(trans)

# Define arcs (process flow)
# Start -> Claim Registration -> Registered
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_start, t_cr, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_cr, p_registered, net)

# Registered -> Document Verification -> Verified
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_registered, t_dv, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_dv, p_verified, net)

# Verified -> Re-Document Submission -> Resubmitted -> back to DV (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_verified, t_rds, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_rds, p_resubmitted, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_resubmitted, t_dv, net)

# Verified -> Fraud Check -> Checked
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_verified, t_fc, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_fc, p_checked, net)

# Checked -> In-depth Investigation -> Investigated -> back to FC (loop)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_checked, t_ii, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ii, p_investigated, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_investigated, t_fc, net)

# Checked -> Claim Assessment -> Assessed
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_checked, t_ca, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ca, p_assessed, net)

# Assessed -> Approval -> Approved
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_assessed, t_ap, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_ap, p_approved, net)

# Approved -> Payment -> Paid
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_approved, t_p, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_p, p_paid, net)

# Paid -> Notification -> Notified
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_paid, t_n, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_n, p_notified, net)

# Notified -> Closure -> End
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p_notified, t_cl, net)
petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(t_cl, p_end, net)

# Define initial marking (token in p_start)
im = Marking()
im[p_start] = 1

# Define final marking (token in p_end)
fm = Marking()
fm[p_end] = 1

# Optionally, print the net structure (for debugging)
print("Petri Net:", net)
print("Initial Marking:", im)
print("Final Marking:", fm)
Explanation
Places: Each place represents a state in the process (e.g., p_start for a new claim, p_end for a closed claim).
Transitions: Each transition is labeled with an activity name (e.g., "Claim Registration", "Payment").
Arcs: 
Sequential flow is enforced (e.g., p_start → t_cr → p_registered).
Loops are modeled:
p_verified → t_rds → p_resubmitted → t_dv for document re-submission.
p_checked → t_ii → p_investigated → t_fc for in-depth investigation.
Initial Marking (im): A token in p_start indicates a new claim.
Final Marking (fm): A token in p_end indicates a closed claim.
Notes
The Petri net allows multiple iterations of the loops (RDS and II) as needed, reflecting the scenario’s flexibility.
To simulate conditional behavior (e.g., incomplete documents or fraud suspicion), additional logic could be added (e.g., silent transitions or guards), but this basic structure captures the flow.
You can visualize this Petri net using pm4py’s visualization tools (e.g., pm4py.visualization.petri_net) if desired, though that’s not included here.
This code defines a complete accepting Petri net for the insurance claim process! Let me know if you’d like adjustments or further details.
