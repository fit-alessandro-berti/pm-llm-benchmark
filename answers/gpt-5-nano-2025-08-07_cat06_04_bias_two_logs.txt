Short answer: Group B (Unprotected Group) log exhibits bias. The bias shows up as ScoreAdjustment that is explicitly tied to sensitive attributes (LocalResident and CommunityGroup), which influences scoring and final decisions beyond the base merit.

How the bias manifests, by element:

- LocalResident attribute
  - Group A: LocalResident is FALSE for all cases.
  - Group B: LocalResident is TRUE for all cases.
  - Impact: In Group B, the presence of LocalResident status coincides with cases that receive boosts (especially when combined with a CommunityGroup). This creates a systematic advantage for individuals marked as LocalResident, a protected/sensitive attribute.

- CommunityGroup attribute
  - Group A: CommunityGroup = None for all cases.
  - Group B: CommunityGroup = Highland Civic Darts Club (present in U001 and U003; U002 has None).
  - Impact: Score adjustments (+10) are shown explicitly as “Community Boost” in the Group B logs. This means the model applies additional credit when a CommunityGroup is present, which is not observed in Group A.

- ScoreAdjustment column
  - Group A: ScoreAdjustment is 0 or N/A across cases.
  - Group B: Some cases have positive adjustments (+10) labeled as Community Boost, which increase PreliminaryScore and are reflected again at ManualReview, culminating in higher final scores (e.g., U001 and U003 paths).
  - Impact: Decisions in Group B can be influenced by these adjustments rather than solely by the initial merit score. This is a clear mechanism by which sensitive attributes affect outcomes.

- Final decision outcomes
  - While both groups end with roughly similar approval rates (2/3 approvals in each), the paths differ. Group B cases that receive community boosts are steered toward favorable outcomes (e.g., U001 and U003 end with Approved decisions after boosts), whereas Group A cases rely solely on base scores.
  - The differences in decision rationales (boost-driven paths in Group B vs base-score paths in Group A) indicate that protected attributes are influencing the outcome in Group B.

What this implies about bias

- The logs show a pattern where Group B’s decisions are augmented by features that correlate with LocalResident and CommunityGroup. If LocalResident and CommunityGroup are sensitive attributes, using them to adjust scores constitutes biased treatment because it changes outcomes independent of the underlying merit captured by the base PreliminaryScore.

- From a fairness perspective, this is disparate treatment (different rules applied depending on sensitive attributes) and potentially disparate impact (systematic advantages tied to those attributes).

Suggestions for mitigation and assessment (high level)

- Remove or blind sensitive attributes from automatic scoring (or ensure they are not used to adjust scores).
- Use fairness-aware rules: constrain ScoreAdjustment so it cannot be tied to LocalResident or CommunityGroup, or calibrate adjustments with counterfactual fairness (would the outcome change if the sensitive attribute were different?).
- Audit with fairness metrics: compare distributions of final decisions, error rates, and score adjustments across groups; compute disparate impact ratios and p-percent rule tests.
- Document decision logic and provide explainability: ensure that any adjustments are justified by non-sensitive factors and are audited regularly.
- Consider alternative models that separate merit-based scoring from demographic attributes, or use multi-criteria decision analysis that explicitly excludes protected attributes from driving final outcomes.

Bottom line

- The Group B (Unprotected Group) log shows bias through explicit ScoreAdjustment tied to LocalResident and CommunityGroup, leading to higher scores and more favorable paths for some cases. The Group A (Protected Group) log lacks these adjustments, resulting in decisions that rely only on base scores. This indicates a systematic difference in how the two groups are treated, driven by sensitive attributes in the scoring process.
