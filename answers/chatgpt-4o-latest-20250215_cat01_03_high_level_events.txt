### **High-Level Process Steps and Groupings**  

Based on the event log, we can identify distinct stages in the manufacturing process by grouping related low-level events into meaningful high-level process steps. The key considerations for grouping are:  
- **Logical coherence** (activities that serve the same function)  
- **Temporal proximity** (events that happen sequentially and in close time frames)  
- **Shared resources** (performed by the same operator/machine category)  

Hereâ€™s the proposed breakdown:  

---

### **1. Material Preparation**  
**Low-Level Events Included:**  
- Retrieve raw metal sheet  
- Scan barcode  
- Place metal sheet on table  
- Align metal sheet  
- Preheat metal sheet  

**Rationale:**  
These steps focus on preparing the raw material for processing. Retrieving, scanning, and placing the sheet are material handling steps, while alignment and preheating ensure the material is in the correct position and condition for the next stage.

### **2. Welding & Assembly**  
**Low-Level Events Included:**  
- Pick up welding tool  
- Weld corner A  
- Weld corner B  

**Rationale:**  
These steps involve actual assembly work, specifically the welding process. The operator picks up the necessary tool and then performs the welding on different parts of the metal sheet. Since these actions are physically and functionally linked, they are grouped as part of the same high-level process.

### **3. Quality Control - Weld Inspection**  
**Low-Level Events Included:**  
- Measure weld integrity  

**Rationale:**  
This is a dedicated quality control check that occurs immediately after welding. The use of a quality sensor to assess weld integrity suggests that it is an independent verification step before proceeding further in the process.  

---

### **4. Surface Treatment**  
**Low-Level Events Included:**  
- Apply protective coating  
- Dry coating  

**Rationale:**  
These steps involve applying and curing a protective layer on the welded part. Since they both relate to coating and surface protection, they logically form a single stage.  

---

### **5. Final Quality Inspection**  
**Low-Level Events Included:**  
- Visual check  

**Rationale:**  
This step is a final verification before the product moves to the next stage (e.g., packaging or further assembly). It ensures that all previous steps have been correctly completed and that the product meets quality standards.

### **Summary of High-Level Process Steps**  

| **High-Level Step**         | **Low-Level Events Included**                                        |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Material Preparation**    | Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place on table, Align, Preheat |
| **Welding & Assembly**      | Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B                 |
| **Quality Control - Weld Inspection** | Measure weld integrity                                      |
| **Surface Treatment**       | Apply protective coating, Dry coating                            |
| **Final Quality Inspection** | Visual check                                                    |

This approach structures the event log into a clearer workflow that better represents the high-level stages of the manufacturing process.
