To retrieve all events from cases with six or fewer events, use the following DuckDB SQL query. This solution first identifies the `case_id`s meeting the criteria via a subquery and then filters the original events accordingly:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Subquery (Inner Query):**  
   Groups events by `case_id` and calculates the total number of events per case. The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause filters out any `case_id` with more than six events.

2. **Main Query (Outer Query):**  
   Selects all columns from `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the result of the subquery (i.e., cases with six or fewer events). This ensures only events from qualifying cases are returned. 

This approach efficiently filters cases while preserving all associated events in the output.
