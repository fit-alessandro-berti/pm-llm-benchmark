Here's a DuckDB SQL query that selects all events from cases with six or fewer events:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Subquery**: The inner query calculates the number of events per `case_id` using `GROUP BY case_id`.
2. **Filtering**: The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause retains only cases with six or fewer total events.
3. **Main Query**: The outer query selects all events from the original `event_log` where the `case_id` exists in the filtered list of valid cases from the subquery.

This ensures only complete event sequences from cases with 6 events are returned.
