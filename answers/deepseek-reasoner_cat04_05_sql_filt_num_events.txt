To solve this problem, we need to filter out cases (grouped by `case_id`) that contain more than six events and return all events from the remaining cases. This can be efficiently achieved using a subquery to identify valid `case_id` values and then selecting their corresponding events.

### Approach
1. **Subquery for Valid Cases**: First, we use a subquery to group the events by `case_id` and count the number of events per group. The `HAVING` clause filters out groups (cases) with more than six events, retaining only those with six or fewer.
2. **Main Query for Events**: The main query selects all events from the `event_log` where the `case_id` is in the list of valid cases obtained from the subquery. This ensures we retrieve all events for the qualifying cases.

### Solution Code
```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log
WHERE case_id IN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation
- **Subquery Execution**: The subquery computes the count of events for each `case_id` using `GROUP BY case_id`. The `HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6` clause filters these groups to include only those with six or fewer events.
- **Main Query Execution**: The outer query selects all columns (`*`) from `event_log` where the `case_id` matches any of those returned by the subquery. This efficiently retrieves all events for cases that meet the criteria, ensuring the result includes complete event details for valid cases. 

This approach leverages DuckDB's ability to handle subqueries efficiently, ensuring clarity and optimal performance.
