Here is an example Python code that generates a process tree for an hypothetical Purchase-to-Pay process using pm4py:
```python
from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import ProcessTree, Operator

# Create the root node of the process tree
root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL)

# Create the subprocess for "Purchase Order"
po = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
po_create = ProcessTree(label="Create Purchase Order", parent=po)
po_approve = ProcessTree(label="Approve Purchase Order", parent=po)
po.children.append(po_create)
po.children.append(po_approve)

# Create the subprocess for "Goods Receipt"
gr = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
gr_receive = ProcessTree(label="Receive Goods", parent=gr)
gr_inspect = ProcessTree(label="Inspect Goods", parent=gr)
gr.children.append(gr_receive)
gr.children.append(gr_inspect)

# Create the subprocess for "Invoice Processing"
inv = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root)
inv_receive = ProcessTree(label="Receive Invoice", parent=inv)
inv_verify = ProcessTree(label="Verify Invoice", parent=inv)
inv_pay = ProcessTree(label="Pay Invoice", parent=inv)
inv.children.append(inv_receive)
inv.children.append(inv_verify)
inv.children.append(inv_pay)

# Add the subprocesses to the root node
root.children.append(po)
root.children.append(gr)
root.children.append(inv)

# Create a loop for the "Invoice Processing" subprocess
loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, parent=root)
loop.children.append(inv)
root.children.append(loop)

# Set the parent of the subprocesses to the root node
po.parent = root
gr.parent = root
inv.parent = root
loop.parent = root
```
This code generates a process tree with the following structure:
```
+ ( Purchase Order, Goods Receipt, Invoice Processing )
  -> ( Create Purchase Order, Approve Purchase Order )
  -> ( Receive Goods, Inspect Goods )
  -> ( Receive Invoice, Verify Invoice, Pay Invoice )*
```
Note that the `*` operator indicates a loop, which means that the "Invoice Processing" subprocess can be repeated multiple times. The `+` operator indicates true concurrency between the subprocesses.

You can modify this code to suit your specific needs and add more subprocesses or activities as required.
