To solve the given task using DuckDB SQL, we need to follow a structured approach that involves two main steps:

1. **Counting Events Per `case_id`:** First, we need to count how many events each `case_id` has in the `event_log` table. This can be achieved by grouping the rows by `case_id` and counting the number of rows (events) within each group.

2. **Filtering Out Cases With More Than Six Events:** Once we have the counts, we need to identify those `case_id`s that have six or fewer events. We then use this information to filter out all events belonging to cases with more than six events.

The SQL query can be structured as follows:

### Step 1: Counting Events Per `case_id`

```sql
SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM event_log
GROUP BY case_id;
```

This part of the query groups the rows in the `event_log` table by `case_id` and counts how many rows (events) each `case_id` has. The result is a list of `case_id`s along with their corresponding number of events.

### Step 2: Filtering Out Cases With More Than Six Events

To filter out cases that have more than six events, we can use the result from Step 1 to create a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) and then join this back to the original `event_log` table. However, since our goal is to directly get all events from cases with six or fewer events without necessarily needing an explicit count for each case beyond filtering, we can leverage SQL's `EXISTS` clause in a more streamlined approach.

Here's how you could write the complete query:

```sql
WITH filtered_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN filtered_cases fc ON e.case_id = fc.case_id;
```

### Explanation

1. **CTE `filtered_cases`:** This part of the query (the CTE) groups the events by `case_id` and uses the `HAVING` clause to filter out those groups (`case_id`s) that have more than six rows (events). The result is a list of `case_id`s that meet our criteria.

2. **Main Query:** The main part of the query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `case_id` exists in the `filtered_cases` CTE. This effectively returns all events for cases with six or fewer events, as per our requirement.

### Alternative Approach Using Subquery

If you prefer not to use a CTE and instead opt for an inline subquery, you could write:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM event_log e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM event_log esub
    WHERE esub.case_id = e.case_id
    GROUP BY esub.case_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6
);
```

### Explanation of Alternative Approach

- The subquery in the `EXISTS` clause performs a similar operation as the CTE but directly within the main query. It groups events by `case_id`, filters those with six or fewer events, and then checks if such a group exists for each row being considered from the outer query.

Both approaches achieve the same goal: filtering out cases that have more than six events and returning all events from cases that meet our criteria. The choice between using a CTE or an inline subquery might come down to personal preference or specific performance considerations in different SQL environments, though for most practical purposes with DuckDB, both should perform adequately well.
