Okay, let's see. I need to create a DuckDB SQL query that handles this process variant problem. Let me break down the steps.

First, the task is to find the ordered sequence of activities for each case_id. Since the events in a case are ordered by timestamp, I need to group by case_id and collect the activities in order. So for each case, I should sort the events by timestamp and then aggregate the activities into a sequence.

In DuckDB, how do I get the ordered sequence? Maybe using STRING_AGG with an ORDER BY inside. Like, for each case_id, group by case_id, then STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant. That should give me the sequence as a string, right? Because the order of the activities in the string will be based on the timestamp.

Next, group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique variants. So after getting the variant string for each case, I can group by that variant and count how many cases have that variant. So then, for each variant, the count is the number of cases. Then find the top K variants by frequency.

Wait, but the problem says "top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)". So the count of cases per variant. So for each variant, the count is the number of cases that have that exact sequence.

So steps:

1. For each case_id, get the ordered activity sequence (as a string, perhaps).

2. Count how many cases per variant.

3. Select the top K variants (highest counts).

4. Then, return all events from the original log that belong to cases which are part of these top K variants.

So the final output should be all rows from event_log where the case_id is in the top K variants.

So the approach would be:

- First, create a subquery that for each case_id, gets the variant string.

- Then, group by that variant to get counts, then get the top K variants.

- Then, join back to the original event_log to get all rows where the case_id is in those top variants.

Wait, but how to get the top K variants. Let's think.

First, compute the variant for each case. Then, for each variant, count the number of cases. Then, select the top K variants by count. Then, filter the original table to only include cases that have a variant in the top K.

So steps:

1. For each case_id, compute the variant string (ordered activities).

2. Group by variant, count the cases.

3. Order by count descending, limit to K.

4. Then, join this top K variants with the original table, but how? Because the original table has case_id, and we need to get all rows where case_id is part of a variant in the top K.

Alternatively, first get the list of case_ids that are in the top K variants.

Wait, but the top K variants are the sequences, and each variant has multiple cases. So first, for each case_id, we have a variant. Then, we count how many cases per variant. Then, take the top K variants (by count), and then get all case_ids that belong to those variants.

Wait, no. The variants are the sequences. Each variant (sequence) has some number of cases. So for example, variant 'A,B,C' has 10 cases, 'A,B' has 5, etc. So the top K variants are the K sequences with the highest counts. Then, all cases that have a sequence which is in the top K variants should be included.

So first, compute for each case_id the variant string. Then, group by variant, count the number of cases (which is the number of case_ids with that variant). Then, get the top K variants (the variant strings with the highest counts). Then, select all rows from event_log where the case_id's variant is in those top K.

So the query would be:

First, create a CTE that for each case_id, gets the variant string.

Then, in another CTE, count the cases per variant, order by count descending, limit K.

Then, join the original table with the top K variants.

But how to get the case_ids that belong to top K variants. So the top K variants are the variant strings. So in the first step, for each case_id, we have a variant. Then, we can select case_ids where variant is in the top K variants.

So:

WITH variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            case_id,
            STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
        FROM event_log
        GROUP BY case_id
    ) AS case_variants
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)
) AS top_cases ON e.case_id = top_cases.case_id;

Wait, but this seems a bit redundant. Because the case_variants subquery is being computed twice. Maybe better to have a CTE for case_variants, then use that in top_variants and also for the final join.

Let me structure it properly.

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Yes, that's better. Because case_variants is computed once, then used in variant_counts and in the final join.

So the steps are:

- case_variants: for each case_id, get the variant (string of activities ordered by timestamp).

- variant_counts: count how many cases per variant.

- top_variants: select the top K variants (by case_count descending).

- Then, join event_log with case_variants on case_id, and filter where variant is in top_variants.

That should work.

Now, the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

Yes, so the final SELECT e.* will return all rows from event_log where the case_id is in a variant that's in the top K.

Now, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG is used with ORDER BY. Let me confirm the syntax. In DuckDB, STRING_AGG(expression ORDER BY ...) is correct. So for example, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) will aggregate the activities in order of timestamp.

Yes. So that's correct.

Now, K is a parameter. But in the problem statement, the user says "top K variants", so in the query, K would be a specific number, like 5. But since the problem says "return the top K variants", the query should have K as a parameter. But in the actual SQL, we need to replace K with a number. However, the problem says "in your query, ensure...", so probably in the answer, K is a variable, but in the code, we need to specify it as, for example, LIMIT K. But in DuckDB, you can use a parameter, but maybe the problem expects to have K as a placeholder. Wait, but the problem says "return all events... top K variants by their frequency". So the query should have K as a parameter. However, in SQL, you can't have a variable K unless it's a prepared statement. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the answer should have K as a specific value, but the user probably expects to write LIMIT K, where K is a number. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says "determine the top K variants", so in the query, K would be a specific integer. However, since the problem doesn't specify a particular K, maybe the answer should include K as a parameter. But in practice, the query would have a specific number. For example, if K=3, then LIMIT 3.

But the problem says "return the top K variants", so the answer should have K as part of the query. So in the query, we can write LIMIT K, but in practice, the user would replace K with a number. So in the answer, the query would have LIMIT K, but maybe in the actual code, it's better to specify a value. However, the problem says "top K variants", so the query should have K as a parameter. But in SQL, you can't have a parameter like K; you need to specify the number. So perhaps the answer should have a specific K, but since the problem says "top K", maybe the answer should use a placeholder. But in the context of the problem, the user probably expects to have K as a variable in the query. But in standard SQL, you can't do that. So perhaps the problem expects to have the LIMIT clause with K, but in reality, for the answer, we can write LIMIT K and assume that K is provided as a value. However, the problem says "in your query, ensure...", so maybe the answer should have K as a specific number. But the problem doesn't specify what K is, so perhaps the answer should have K as a placeholder. But in DuckDB, the LIMIT clause requires a constant. So for example, if K=5, then LIMIT 5. But since the problem says "top K", the answer should include K as part of the query. However, the problem statement doesn't specify a particular K, so perhaps the query should have a placeholder like LIMIT 5, but the user can adjust it. Alternatively, in the answer, write LIMIT K and note that K should be replaced with the desired number.

But in the actual code, the user would need to specify a number. However, for the purpose of this problem, the answer should have K as a variable. But in SQL, you can't do that. So perhaps the correct way is to write LIMIT K, but in reality, when executing, you have to replace K with a number. However, in DuckDB, you can use parameters with prepared statements, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to have a parameter. But in standard SQL queries, you can't. So perhaps the answer should use a specific K, but the problem says "top K", so maybe the answer should have K as a placeholder. But the user probably expects to write the query with LIMIT K, even though in practice it's a specific number. So for example, in the answer, the query would have LIMIT K, but in reality, K is replaced with a number. But maybe the problem expects to see that.

So, putting it all together.

Let me write the query.

First, the CTE for case_variants: for each case_id, get the variant string.

Then variant_counts: group by variant and count.

Then top_variants: select variants ordered by count descending, limit K.

Then join event_log with case_variants where variant is in top_variants.

So:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Wait, but the top_variants is a CTE that selects variant. Then in the WHERE clause, we can do cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants). Alternatively, since top_variants is a CTE with just the variant column, we can do JOIN top_variants ON cv.variant = top_variants.variant. But using IN is fine.

But perhaps using a JOIN would be more efficient. Let's see. For example:

SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Yes, that might be better.

So modifying the last part:

WITH ... (the same CTEs)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

That way, we join with top_variants directly.

Yes. So the top_variants CTE is a list of variants, and then joining on cv.variant = tv.variant.

So the final query would be:

WITH case_variants AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS case_count
    FROM case_variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM variant_counts
    ORDER BY case_count DESC
    LIMIT K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN case_variants cv ON e.case_id = cv.case_id
JOIN top_variants tv ON cv.variant = tv.variant;

Yes. That's better. Because it's a direct join.

Now, the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."

This query does that. Because for each case_id in the original table, it checks if the variant (from case_variants) is in top_variants, and returns all events for those cases.

Now, check the steps:

- case_variants: for each case_id, the ordered activities as a string.

- variant_counts: count how many cases per variant.

- top_variants: select the top K variants (by count descending).

- Then join the original table with case_variants and top_variants to get only the cases in top variants.

Yes.

Now, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG is the correct function. Let me check: yes, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG is used for aggregating strings. And ORDER BY inside STRING_AGG is allowed.

So for example, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) will concatenate the activities in the order of the timestamp.

Yes.

Now, for the LIMIT K part. In the query, K is a placeholder. But in reality, when writing the query, you have to specify a number. But since the problem says "top K", the answer should include K as a variable. However, in practice, the user would replace K with a specific integer. So in the answer, it's correct to write LIMIT K. But in DuckDB, if K is a parameter, you need to use a prepared statement, but for the purpose of this problem, the query as written is correct.

So the final answer would be the query with the CTEs as above, using LIMIT K.

Wait, but the problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So the top K variants are the K variants with the highest case counts. So the ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K is correct.

Yes.

So the query seems correct.

Another thing to check: when grouping by case_id in case_variants, the STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) will collect the activities in the correct order. Because for each case_id, the events are ordered by timestamp, then aggregated.

Yes. For example, for a case_id with events sorted by timestamp, the STRING_AGG will have the activities in that order.

Yes.

So, for example, if a case has events:

case_id=1, timestamp=1, activity=A

case_id=1, timestamp=2, activity=B

Then STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) would be 'A,B'.

Yes.

So that's correct.

Now, the variant_counts groups by variant, so each variant string is a group, and counts how many case_ids have that variant.

Yes.

Then top_variants gets the top K variants.

Then joining back to get all events for those cases.

Yes.

So this should work.

Now, possible edge cases: what if there are ties in the counts? Like two variants have the same count, and K=3, but there are 4 variants with count 10. Then the LIMIT K would pick the first K of them. But the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", so if there are ties, it's up to the database to choose. But DuckDB's ORDER BY case_count DESC LIMIT K will pick the first K rows in the ordered list. So if there's a tie, it's not specified which ones to pick. But the problem doesn't specify handling ties, so the query as written is acceptable.

So the query seems correct.

Now, let's check if there's any mistake in the syntax.

In DuckDB, STRING_AGG is the correct function. Also, the ORDER BY inside STRING_AGG is allowed. For example, in DuckDB documentation, STRING_AGG(expression [ORDER BY ...]) is correct.

Yes.

So the query should be correct.

Another point: the case_variants CTE is grouped by case_id. So each case_id has one row with the variant string.

Then variant_counts groups by variant, so for each variant, the count is the number of case_ids with that variant.

Yes.

Then top_variants selects the top K variants.

Then the final query joins event_log with case_variants and top_variants.

Yes.

So the final query is correct.
