- **Loan Decision (Approved)**: January 10, 2024 at 11:00
- **Inform Applicant**: January 10, 2024 at 13:00
- **Finalize Documentation**: January 10, 2024 at 13:30
- **Close Case**: January 10, 2024 at 14:00

**Reasons for Violation:**

#### Case 2:
- **Application Received**: January 11, 2024 at 08:00

- **Close Case**: January 11, 2024 at 10:30

**Reasons for Violation:**
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**: This violates the normative rule where the Credit Check must occur before the Risk Assessment.
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection**: This violates the normative rule where if the loan is rejected, the case should be closed without finalizing documentation.

- **Application Received**: January 12, 2024 at 09:00
- **Credit Check**: January 14, 2024 at 10:00

- **Finalize Documentation**: January 17, 2024 at 09:00
- **Close Case**: January 17, 2024 at 10:00

**Reasons for Violation:**
- **Credit Check Delayed**: This violates the desideratum condition where the Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after the application is received.
- **Inform Applicant Delayed**: This violates the desideratum condition where the applicant should be informed within 48 hours of the loan decision.
- **No Follow-up Call**: This represents a suboptimal behavior but does not violate any norms or desiderata explicitly stated.

### Part 2: Identifying Cases Failing to Meet Desiderata Conditions

#### Case 2:
- **Risk Assessment Before Credit Check**: This violates the normative rule.
- **Finalize Documentation After Rejection**: This violates the normative rule.

#### Case 3:
- **Credit Check Delayed**: This violates the desideratum condition.
- **Inform Applicant Delayed**: This violates the desideratum condition.
- **No Follow-up Call**: This represents a suboptimal behavior but does not violate any norms or desiderata explicitly stated.

### Interpretations and Justifications:

#### Case 2:
The deviation from the normative rules could be due to an oversight or miscommunication between departments responsible for different stages of the process. Ensuring clear communication channels and standardized procedures can help prevent such errors.

#### Case 3:
The delays in both the Credit Check and Inform Applicant could be attributed to backlogs or resource constraints. Implementing proactive measures such as prioritizing urgent applications and ensuring adequate staffing during peak times can mitigate these issues.

By addressing these deviations through improved processes and communication, the organization can enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction while adhering to its core principles and best practices.
