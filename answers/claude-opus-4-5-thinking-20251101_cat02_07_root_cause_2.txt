# Insurance Claims Processing - Performance Analysis

## 1. Case Duration Analysis

Let me first calculate the total duration for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time | End Time | Total Duration | Complexity | Region |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2001 | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | **1.5 hours** | Low | A |
| 2004 | 2024-04-01 09:20 | 2024-04-01 10:45 | **1.4 hours** | Low | B |
| 2002 | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | **~26 hours** | Medium | B |
| 2003 | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | **~48 hours** | High | A |
| 2005 | 2024-04-01 09:25 | 2024-04-04 14:30 | **~77 hours** | High | B |

### Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2005** (77 hours) - Most severe
- **Case 2003** (48 hours) - Severe
- **Case 2002** (26 hours) - Moderate

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### A. Correlation with Complexity

| Complexity | Cases | Avg Duration | Document Requests |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Low | 2001, 2004 | ~1.5 hours | 0 |
| Medium | 2002 | ~26 hours | 1 |
| High | 2003, 2005 | ~62.5 hours | 2-3 |

**Finding:** There is a **strong correlation between complexity and duration**. High-complexity cases take **40-50x longer** than low-complexity cases.

### B. Impact of Document Requests

```
Case 2001 (Low):    Submit  Evaluate  Approve  Pay  Close 
Case 2004 (Low):    Submit  Evaluate  Approve  Pay  Close 
Case 2002 (Medium): Submit  Evaluate  [1 Doc Request]  Approve  Pay  Close
Case 2003 (High):   Submit  Evaluate  [2 Doc Requests]  Approve  Pay  Close
Case 2005 (High):   Submit  Evaluate  [3 Doc Requests]  Approve  Pay  Close
```

**Key Delays Between Document Requests:**

| Case | Gap Description | Duration |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 2002 | Request  Approval | ~20 hours |
| 2003 | 1st Request  2nd Request | 6 hours |
| 2003 | 2nd Request  Approval | ~23 hours |
| 2005 | 1st Request  2nd Request | ~29.5 hours |
| 2005 | 2nd Request  3rd Request | ~22 hours |
| 2005 | 3rd Request  Approval | ~19 hours |

### C. Regional Analysis

| Region | Low Complexity | High Complexity |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| A | 1.5 hours (2001) | 48 hours (2003) |
| B | 1.4 hours (2004) | 77 hours (2005) |

**Finding:** Region B's high-complexity case took **60% longer** than Region A's equivalent case. This suggests potential regional inefficiencies in handling complex claims.

### D. Resource Analysis

| Resource | Role | Cases Handled | Observations |
|----------|------|---------------|--------------|
| Adjuster_Mike | Adjuster (Region A) | 2001, 2003 | 2 doc requests for high complexity |
| Adjuster_Lisa | Adjuster (Region B) | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 3 doc requests for high complexity |
| Manager_Ann | Manager | 2001, 2002, 2004 | Handles low/medium complexity approvals |
| Manager_Bill | Manager | 2003, 2005 | Handles high complexity approvals |

**Finding:** Adjuster_Lisa required **3 document request cycles** for Case 2005 versus **2 cycles** for Adjuster_Mike's similar high-complexity case (2003), suggesting potential differences in initial documentation clarity or request comprehensiveness.

## 3. Root Cause Summary

```

                     ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED                      

 1. HIGH COMPLEXITY  Multiple Document Request Cycles           
    • Each cycle adds ~20-30 hours to case duration              
    • High complexity cases inherently need more verification    
                                                                 
 2. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES (Region B)                              
    • Region B high-complexity cases take longer                 
    • More document request iterations required                  
                                                                 
 3. RESOURCE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS                                   
    • Adjuster_Lisa: More request cycles per high-complexity case
    • Possible incomplete initial document requests              
                                                                 
 4. CUSTOMER RESPONSE TIME                                       
    • Waiting for documents is the primary bottleneck            
    • Overnight/multi-day gaps between activities

## 4. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

| Issue | Recommendation | Expected Impact |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Multiple document requests | Create **comprehensive document checklists** for each complexity level | Reduce request cycles by 50% |
| Regional variation | **Standardize procedures** across regions A and B | Reduce Region B delays |
| Long wait for documents | Implement **automated reminders** to customers | Reduce response time |

### Process Improvements

1. **Predictive Triage at Submission**
   - Identify high-complexity claims early
   - Request comprehensive documentation upfront based on claim type

2. **Resource Training**
   - Train Adjuster_Lisa and Region B staff on complete document requests
   - Share best practices from Region A (Adjuster_Mike's approach)

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - For high-complexity claims, begin evaluation while documents are being gathered
   - Pre-approve conditional items to reduce downstream delays

4. **Customer Self-Service Portal**
   - Allow customers to upload all relevant documents at submission
   - Provide real-time checklist of required items based on claim type

### Performance Targets

| Complexity | Current Avg | Target |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Low | 1.5 hours | 1.5 hours (maintain) |
| Medium | 26 hours | 12 hours |
| High | 62.5 hours | 24 hours |

## Conclusion

The primary driver of extended case durations is **claim complexity**, which triggers multiple document request cycles. This is compounded by **regional differences** (Region B taking longer) and **resource-specific behaviors** (Adjuster_Lisa requiring more request iterations). Addressing these root causes through standardized processes, upfront documentation requirements, and resource training could significantly reduce processing times for medium and high-complexity claims.
