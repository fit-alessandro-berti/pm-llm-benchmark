<think>We are asked to provide a prompt for benchmark. The content is described as follows: "Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, with columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. A process variant is defined as the ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp.

Your task:
1. Construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id, maintaining the order imposed by timestamp.
2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.
3. Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by frequency (i.e., number of cases following that variant).
4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants.

We have tasks: Write a SQL query using DuckDB's capabilities such as window functions, string_agg or similar function.

The query should do:
- first extract sequences per case (ordered by timestamp)
- then group these sequences per variant and count frequency.
- Then filter the original table to only show events for cases that are part of top K variants.

We have to assume top K is a parameter in our query. There might be a variable K, let's say it's input as "K".

The structure: We can use common table expressions (CTEs) or subqueries.
I can consider the following steps:
Step 1: Extract ordered sequences per case using window function group_concat maybe? But note that DuckDB may not have standard SQL functions. In DuckDB, to perform aggregations by groups, we can use "string_agg" function if available. However, I recall that DuckDB supports a similar string aggregation as PostgreSQL (like array_agg or group_concat). According to documentation, DuckDB has "group_concat" aggregator.

But check: "ordered sequence of activities per case", then we need to do this:
- We can use window functions like row_number() over partition by and order by timestamp. Then using a string aggregation function that preserves ordering. In many SQL engines, there is something like STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id). But sometimes not available directly.

We want to get one row per variant (with sequence as column variant).
But if I recall, DuckDB supports "array_agg" aggregator with the DISTINCT order? Actually, let me check: According to DuckDB docs: There is a function called "array_agg" that aggregates values into an array. But we want string sequence representation maybe like using group_concat. Possibly use "string_agg" or similar.

Wait, I'll check what functions are available in DuckDB as of 2023? The latest version may support window aggregation. Alternatively, we can join the aggregated result back to original table.

Plan:
- Use a CTE: process_variants that aggregates activities by case_id ordered by timestamp. For example:

WITH variants AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    group_concat(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant -- or string_agg or array_agg.
  FROM event_log
  GROUP BY case_id
)

But then we need to count frequency of each variant:
SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as freq from variants group by variant

Then get top K variants:
WITH top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM (
         SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as freq,
         rank() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as rnk
         FROM variants
         GROUP BY variant
    )
    WHERE rnk <= K
)

But then we want to return events from event_log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. So join with variants table where the case_id is in the set returned by top variants? But careful: In our query, the "variants" column might be a string representation. We need to correlate based on variant sequences.

But note: Actually, if we want to return events that belong to cases which are part of these top K variants, then I can join event_log with the CTE of process variants (for those top ones). So my final query:
SELECT e.* FROM event_log e
JOIN (
   SELECT case_id, group_concat(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
   FROM event_log
   GROUP BY case_id
) AS v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE v.variant IN (the list of variants from top K)

But we need to get the top K variants. So a possible query:

WITH ordered_events AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      activity,
      timestamp,
      row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as rn
    FROM event_log
),
variants AS (
  SELECT
    case_id,
    group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rn ASC) AS variant
  FROM ordered_events
  GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
  SELECT
    variant,
    COUNT(*) as freq
  FROM variants
  GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
  SELECT variant
  FROM (
      SELECT variant, freq, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY freq DESC) as rnk
      FROM variant_counts
  ) t
  WHERE rnk <= :K   -- using parameter K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN variants v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

Alternatively, we may combine steps to reduce complexity.

I must note that the query might need to be a single query. We can use WITH clauses in DuckDB. The final result: All events from event_log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants.

I'll provide the complete query with explanation using CTEs (common table expressions).

We have multiple tasks:
- Ordered sequence extraction: Use row_number() partition by case_id order by timestamp.
- Then group by case_id to get variant string. We might use "string_agg" function if available in DuckDB. However, I believe it's either array_agg or group_concat. Possibly we can use "array_agg" and then a cast to text? But maybe simpler is using "group_concat". According to documentation: https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/aggregate functions says that aggregate functions for strings include "group_concat", so that's the function.

Thus I'll assume "group_concat(activity ORDER BY timestamp)".

The query structure:

WITH variants AS (
    SELECT
       case_id,
       group_concat(activity, '->') OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as variant  -- but careful: window function might not work in some SQL. But we want aggregated result by case.
),
But note: It must be grouped. Possibly the better approach is:
WITH variants AS (
    SELECT
       case_id,
       group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) as variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Then get counts:

variant_counts AS (
   SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as case_count FROM variants GROUP BY variant
)

top_variants AS (
   SELECT variant FROM (
      SELECT variant, case_count,
             row_number() OVER (ORDER BY case_count DESC) as rn
      FROM variant_counts
   ) sub
   WHERE rn <= K
)

Then final:
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN variants v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants)

I must also mention that K might be replaced with a parameter value. Possibly I'll define K as variable :K.

Thus my query is:

WITH variants AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
        variant,
        COUNT(*) as frequency
    FROM variants
    GROUP BY variant
),
top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM (
        SELECT
            variant,
            frequency,
            row_number() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rn
        FROM variant_counts
    ) sub
    WHERE rn <= :K
)
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN variants v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);

That should suffice.

I can also include ordering in the final result if needed. But specification doesn't require ordering, so it's fine.

I must note that this is a single SQL query using CTEs. The query might be executed in DuckDB. I'll provide the explanation along with query. Alternatively, we can combine steps into one query with nested subqueries.

The final answer: "Here is the complete query."

Additionally, I want to ensure that we extract ordered sequence of events per case. That is done by using group_concat and ordering by timestamp. Grouping by case_id ensures that it's a single row per case.

Then we count how many cases correspond to each variant in variant_counts CTE.

Then top_variants gets the variants with rn <= K, i.e., top k frequency variants.

Finally, join back to event_log e where e.case_id equals v.case_id and filter by v.variant is in top variants list.

I must check syntax details: "WITH" followed by each CTE. The query uses "group_concat(activity, '->')" with "WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp)". That's a valid usage I believe. However, note that the order clause inside group_concat might be applied inside ordering of events for each case.

Check if we need to add row_number() in variants? Possibly not needed because grouping by case_id will automatically sort by timestamp if group_concat uses "WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)".

Yes, the syntax is: group_concat(expression) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...) is standard. Alternatively, if using array_agg, then it might require conversion to string. But I'll use group_concat as it's mentioned in documentation.

I can also add a comment that K should be replaced by your parameter value. Possibly we write "WHERE rn <= <K>" where K is an integer literal.

Alternatively, I could write: row_number() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rank and then filter with "rank <= 3" if top 3 variants needed.

I must note that the query is in multiple parts using WITH CTEs. Alternatively, one can combine everything into a single SELECT statement using subqueries but it's less readable. So I'll use CTE structure.

I want to ensure that we include all necessary columns: "case_id", "activity", "timestamp". The final output should be events from event_log with cases filtered as described.

Double-check:
1. Construct query: variants, grouping by case_id, using group_concat(activity ORDER BY timestamp) returns a string representing the variant sequence. But it's best to use '->' delimiter so that we can see separation of activities? Not required but nice.
2. Then variant_counts counts frequency per variant.
3. top_variants selects variants in top K positions by frequency.
4. Final selection: join event_log and variants on case_id, filtering where v.variant is in the list from top_variants.

I'll also mention that this query may require parameter substitution for :K or replacing it with a literal if desired.

Now I'll provide answer as final message.

I'll now produce text answer as explanation then query code.

I'll produce my answer in plain text, not markdown formatting by default. But the user provided some instructions to show code block maybe? Possibly I need to include code snippet in triple backticks. But the instructions say "by default do not reply with markdown formatting" but "unless requested", so now instructions says "by default output text." However, it's safer to produce plain text as final answer.

I'll produce my answer: "Below is a sample query which meets your specification: ..." then code snippet in plain text. Use triple backticks if necessary.

Let's produce the final answer with explanation and then query.

I must also check if there are any possible pitfalls. The inner join uses v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants). Since top_variants is a subquery, that's fine. Alternatively, one could do an inner join on variant column in variants table as well. But this is sufficient.

I want to note: "group_concat" might be available in DuckDB if enabled but I must check. Actually, according to documentation: https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/aggregate-functions group_concat function exists for strings. So it's correct.

Alternatively, some versions of SQL may use "array_agg", but then need conversion using array_to_string if available. But I'll assume group_concat is acceptable.

I can also include a comment that if you need top K variants filtered, parameterize :K accordingly.

So final answer: "Here is an example query".

I'll now produce the final answer in plain text with code snippet.</think>Below is one complete solution using common table expressions (CTEs). In this solution we:

• First aggregate events per case into a variant string (ordered by timestamp).  
• Then count how many cases share each variant and pick the top K variants by frequency.  
• Finally, we return from event_log only those rows whose case belongs to one of these topK variants.

Assuming that K is provided as a parameter (here written as :K), you can run this query in DuckDB:

------------------------------------------------------------
WITH 
  -- Step 1: For each case_id, aggregate activities into an ordered string.
  variants AS (
    SELECT
      case_id,
      group_concat(activity, '->') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
  ),
  
  -- Step 2: Count how many cases correspond to each variant.
  variant_counts AS (
    SELECT
      variant,
      COUNT(*) AS frequency
    FROM variants
    GROUP BY variant
  ),
  
  -- Step 3: Identify the top K variants by frequency.
  top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM (
      SELECT 
        variant, 
        frequency, 
        row_number() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS rn
      FROM variant_counts
    ) t
    WHERE rn <= :K
  )
  
-- Step 4: Return all events from event_log for cases that belong to one of the top K variants.
SELECT e.*
FROM event_log e
JOIN variants v ON e.case_id = v.case_id
WHERE v.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM top_variants);
------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. The first CTE, “variants”, groups the events by case_id and uses group_concat with an ORDER BY clause so that activities are concatenated in the order they occurred.

2. In “variant_counts” we count how many cases produce each unique variant string.

3. In “top_variants” we rank the variants by their frequency (using row_number() over an ordered window) and then filter to keep only those with a ranking  K.

4. Finally, we join back to event_log so that only events from cases whose aggregated variant is among these top K are returned.

This query meets all your requirements: it extracts the ordered activity sequences per case, counts how many cases follow each variant, filters to only include the top K variants by frequency, and then returns all original events for those filtered cases.
