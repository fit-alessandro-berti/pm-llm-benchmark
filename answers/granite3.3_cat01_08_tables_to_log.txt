### Assumptions and Notes:

1. **Order Creation**: The `order_date` from the `Orders` table is used to determine when an order was created and considered as the starting point of a case.
2. **Activity "Items Picked"**: Events are created for each item picked, using `item_picking_date` and mapping to `picker_id`. This results in multiple events for orders with multiple line items if their picking times differ.
3. **Delivery and Arrival**: For cases with split deliveries (e.g., DLV-5002 and DLV-5003 for Order 1002), separate events are generated for each shipment.
4. **Invoices and Payments**: Events are created when invoices are issued and payments received, linking them with their respective invoice IDs.
5. **Resources and Actors**: Where available, resource details from the `Resources` table were used to identify actors involved (e.g., sales persons, warehouse staff, carriers).
6. **Product Information**: The `Products` table was used to fetch item descriptions where necessary for context but wasn't mandatory for process flow understanding.
7. **Data Integrity and Chronology**: Each event is logged in chronological order, assuming the timestamps provided are accurate representations of when activities occurred relative to each other within an order's lifecycle. Any discrepancies or ambiguities in data would need further clarification from business processes or additional data sources not provided here.
