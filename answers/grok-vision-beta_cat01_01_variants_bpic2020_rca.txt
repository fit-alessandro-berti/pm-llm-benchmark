To analyze the root causes of performance issues in the process variants provided, we can focus on several key aspects:

### 1. **Rejection Rates and Cycles:**
   - **Rejections by ADMINISTRATION:** Variants where declarations are rejected by ADMINISTRATION and then resubmitted by the EMPLOYEE show significantly higher performance times. For example, the variant where a declaration is rejected once by ADMINISTRATION and then goes through the entire approval process has a performance time of 1,604,595.638 seconds. This indicates that each rejection cycle adds substantial time to the process.
   - **Multiple Rejections:** Variants with multiple rejections, like those rejected twice or thrice by ADMINISTRATION, show even higher performance times (e.g., 2,542,497.917 and 3,502,608.250 seconds respectively), suggesting that each additional rejection and resubmission cycle exponentially increases the process duration.

### 2. **Approval Layers:**
   - **Additional Approval Steps:** Variants that include additional approval steps (e.g., by BUDGET OWNER or PRE_APPROVER) generally have longer performance times. For instance, the variant involving approval by BUDGET OWNER after ADMINISTRATION has a performance time of 1,084,338.407 seconds, which is higher than variants without this step.
   - **Redundant Approvals:** Some variants show redundant approval steps where a declaration might be approved by ADMINISTRATION, then rejected by SUPERVISOR, and then re-approved by ADMINISTRATION. These cycles are inefficient and contribute to increased processing times.

### 3. **Handling of Final Approvals:**
   - **Direct Final Approval:** The variant where a declaration goes directly from SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE to FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR without intermediate steps has a relatively lower performance time (854,633.975 seconds), indicating efficiency in direct processing.
   - **Rejections after Final Approval:** There are instances where a declaration is FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR but then rejected due to missing information or other reasons, leading to resubmission. This not only delays the process but also adds unnecessary steps, as seen in the variant with a performance time of 1,947,246.400 seconds.

### 4. **Process Complexity:**
   - **Complex Variants:** Variants with more steps and decision points (e.g., multiple rejections and approvals) tend to have higher performance times due to increased complexity and potential for delays at each decision point.

### 5. **Frequency of Occurrence:**
   - **High Frequency Variants:** The most common path (frequency = 4618) with a straightforward approval process has a performance time of 810,187.903 seconds. This suggests that while this path is efficient, it still has room for improvement in reducing the overall time.

### Recommendations:
- **Reduce Rejections:** Implement training or clearer guidelines for employees to reduce the initial rejection rate by ADMINISTRATION.
- **Streamline Approval Processes:** Consider removing or combining approval steps where possible to reduce redundancy and cycle times.
- **Automate Where Possible:** Use automation for routine checks to speed up the approval process and reduce human error.
- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop where reasons for rejections are communicated clearly to avoid repeated mistakes.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Regularly monitor and analyze the performance of each step to identify bottlenecks or steps where delays commonly occur.

By focusing on these specific areas, the process can be optimized to reduce performance times, thereby improving overall efficiency and effectiveness.
