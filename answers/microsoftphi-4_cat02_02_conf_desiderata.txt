### Part 1: Identifying Normative Rule Violations

**Case 1:**
- **Sequence:** Correct. The sequence follows the normative process: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- **Violations:** None.

**Case 2:**
- **Violations:**
  - **Credit Check before Risk Assessment:** The log shows Risk Assessment before Credit Check, which violates the order: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment.
  - **Finalize Documentation after Rejection:** Documentation was finalized after the loan decision of rejection, which is not allowed.

**Case 3:**
- **Sequence:** Correct. The sequence follows the normative process: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision (Approved)  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case.
- **Violations:** None.

### Part 2: Identifying Desiderata Violations

**Case 1:**
- **Timeliness:**
  - **Credit Check Timing:** Occurred 30 minutes after the application was received, thus meeting the recommended 24-hour window.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** Occurred 2 hours after the loan decision, thus meeting the recommended 48-hour window.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not logged, thus a missing recommended call.
- **Violations:** Missing Follow-up Call.

**Case 2:**
- **Timeliness:**
  - **Credit Check and Risk Assessment Timing:** Although not recommended, the delayed order of activities does not affect timing recommendations specifically.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** Loan decision was made and applicant was informed within less than 2 hours, meeting the recommendation.
- **Finalize Documentation:** Violates a normative rule, not a desideratum, as previously discussed.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not logged, thus a missing recommended call.
- **Violations:** Missing Follow-up Call.

**Case 3:**
- **Timeliness:**
  - **Credit Check Timing:** Performed 48 hours after receiving the application, violating the recommended 24-hour window.
  - **Inform Applicant Timing:** Informed 50 hours after the decision, violating the recommended 48-hour window.
- **Follow-up Call:** Not logged, thus a missing recommended call.
- **Violations:** 
  - Credit Check occurred later than 24 hours after application received.
  - Inform Applicant occurred later than 48 hours after decision.
  - Missing Follow-up Call.

### Justifications and Interpretations

- **Case 1:** The sequence was adhered to perfectly; only the missing follow-up call could be explained as an oversight or resource constraint, as it is not a severe violation.
- **Case 2:** The incorrect sequence might reflect either confusion or a procedural error. Finalizing documentation after a rejection could suggest a systemic issue needing correction in policies or training.
- **Case 3:** The delays in credit check and informing the applicant might be due to resource constraints, human error, or other unforeseen procedural delays. These are significant desiderata violations, yet the process sequence remained normatively correct. The lack of a follow-up call may be due to oversight or prioritization of other tasks.

In summary, Case 2 is the only case with normative rule violations, while Cases 1 and 3 display desiderata violations. Training, policy reviews, and process audits might be necessary to avoid such issues in the future.
