**Detailed Explanation:**

The provided pseudo-BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) representation outlines a complex business process for handling customer requests. The process involves several tasks that are executed based on specific criteria, including the type of request (standard or custom) and approval status. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

**1. Start Event:**
- The process begins with a start event, indicating the initiation of the process from the beginning.

**2. Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- This task is straightforward. It represents the initial step where the business receives and processes customer requests.

**3. Gateway (XOR): Check Request Type**
- An XOR gateway is used here to indicate a choice point based on the type of request. The process branches into two possible paths: one for standard requests and another for custom requests.

**4. Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- This task is specifically for standard requests. It involves validating that the request meets the pre-defined criteria and standards of the business.

**5. Gateway (AND): Run Parallel Checks**
- For standard requests, this gateway represents a parallel process where multiple checks are conducted simultaneously:
  - Task C1: "Credit Check" ensures there is sufficient credit available for processing the request.
  - Task C2: "Inventory Check" verifies that the required inventory levels exist to fulfill the order.

**6. All Parallel Checks Completed (Join)**
- This condition indicates that all parallel checks have been completed successfully. After this, Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date" is executed to determine when the customer should expect delivery based on the validated request and check results.

**7. Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- For custom requests, this task involves an analysis to determine if the customization needs are feasible within the business's capabilities.

**8. Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- This gateway checks whether the request for customization is viable based on predefined criteria. If it is feasible, the process moves forward; otherwise, Task E2: "Send Rejection Notice" ends the process.

**9. Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- For feasible custom requests, this task involves generating a detailed quotation that outlines all aspects of the customized product or service.

**10. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Needed?"**
- After preparing the quotation, this gateway checks whether further approval is required from upper management to proceed with customization and finalization.

**11. Task F: "Obtain Manager Approval"**
- If approval is needed, the process waits for manager approval before proceeding to the next steps.

**12. Gateway (XOR): "Is Approval Granted?"**
- Once approved, the process checks if the approval has been granted. If yes, it moves to Task G: "Generate Final Invoice," otherwise, it loops back to re-evaluate conditions based on the type of request (custom or standard).

**13. Task I: "Send Confirmation to Customer"**
- After all necessary approvals and validations have been completed, this task involves sending a confirmation message to the customer, finalizing the transaction.

**How Tasks Differ Based on Request Type:**
- For standard requests, tasks B1 (Validation), C1/C2 (Parallel Checks), and D (Delivery Date Calculation) are executed sequentially after the XOR gateway checks for request type.
- For custom requests, tasks B2 (Feasibility Analysis), E1/E2 (Quotation Preparation/Rejection Notification), and subsequent approval checks are executed based on the feasibility analysis outcome.

**Approval and Rework Conditions:**
- If approval is required, the process follows a sequential path from obtaining manager approval to generating the final invoice, with loops back if conditions are not met.
- For standard requests, no specific rework loops are mentioned; for custom requests, reevaluation can occur if approval is not granted or feasibility is found unsuitable.

This representation provides a structured approach to handling both standard and custom customer requests efficiently, ensuring compliance, authorization, and final delivery through defined processes.
