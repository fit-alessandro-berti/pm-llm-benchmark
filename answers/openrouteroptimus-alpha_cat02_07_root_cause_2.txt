Let's work through the analysis step by step.

## 1. **Which Cases Are Taking Significantly Longer to Complete?**

Let's calculate the total duration for each case (from "Submit Claim" to "Close Claim"):

| Case | Submit Claim (Start) | Close Claim (End)      | Total Duration             |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 2001 | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30       | 1.5 hours                  |
| 2002 | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00       | ~1 day, 1 hr 55 mins       |
| 2003 | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30       | ~2 days, 0 hr 20 mins      |
| 2004 | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45       | 1 hr 25 mins               |
| 2005 | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30       | ~3 days, 5 hrs 5 mins      |

**Significantly longer cases:**  
- **Case 2003:** ~2 days  
- **Case 2005:** ~3.2 days  
- **Case 2002:** Between 1 and 2 days (longer than others but less than 2003/2005)  
- **Cases 2001, 2004:** Under 2 hours each (normal/best performing)

---

## 2. **Attribute Analysis: Root Causes of Extended Durations**

### a) **Complexity Analysis**
- **High Complexity:** 2003, 2005
- **Medium Complexity:** 2002
- **Low Complexity:** 2001, 2004

**Observation:**  
- All **low complexity** cases are completed quickly (<2 hours).
- The **medium complexity** case (2002) takes >1 day.
- All **high complexity** cases (2003, 2005) take the longest (2–3 days).

#### **Insight:**  
**Higher complexity **is strongly correlated with longer case durations.

---

### b) **Additional Document Requests**

Let's count requests for additional documents:

- **2001:** 0
- **2002:** 1
- **2003:** 2
- **2004:** 0
- **2005:** 3

**Observation:**  
- High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) require **multiple documents**.
- Medium complexity (2002) requires **1 document**.
- Low complexity: **no additional requests**.

#### **Insight:**  
**Repeated requests for additional documents** add days to the process, especially in high complexity cases.

---

### c) **Resource Analysis**

Who performed the "Request Additional Documents" steps?

- **Adjuster_Mike:** 2003 (Region A, High)
- **Adjuster_Lisa:** 2002, 2005 (Region B, Medium/High)

Both adjusters handle high and medium complexity, with repeated document requests.

---

### d) **Regional Analysis**

**Region A:** 2001, 2003  
**Region B:** 2002, 2004, 2005

- Both high-complexity cases (2003 in A, 2005 in B) are slow.
- Medium-complexity (2002 in B) is also slow.
- But even in **Region A**, when there's high complexity (case 2003), it's slow.

### **Is a particular resource or region making cases slower?**

Not particularly; the main signal is **complexity** (and, indirectly, repeated information requests), rather than a specific region or resource.

---

## 3. **Proposed Explanations and Suggestions**

### **Explanations:**

1. **Claim Complexity Drives Duration:**
   - High-complexity claims need more information, leading to repeated requests for documentation, which prolongs processing time.

2. **Process Steps Expand with Complexity:**
   - For high-complexity cases, "Request Additional Documents" occurs 2–3 times, whereas for medium and low it’s 0–1 times.

3. **Resource and Region Not Primary Drivers:**
   - Both regions and adjusters experience long durations **only** for higher complexity cases, indicating that it's not a matter of region or specific resource performance but process difficulty.

4. **Wait Times Between Steps:**
   - There are long delays between document requests and subsequent processing/approval, likely waiting for customer or external responses.

---

### **Suggestions to Mitigate Root Causes:**

#### a) **Improve First-Time Resolution on Data Requests**
- **Root Cause:** Multiple iterations requesting documents.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Provide adjusters with a complexity-based checklist for initial document requests.
  - Train staff to anticipate all likely info required in the first outreach to minimize back-and-forth.

#### b) **Parallelize Verification Steps (if possible)**
- **Root Cause:** Sequential steps lengthen high-complexity case durations.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Investigate whether some verification steps or document requests can be handled in parallel rather than sequentially.

#### c) **Customer Self-Service Portals**
- **Root Cause:** Waiting for claimants to respond to document requests.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Implement/upgrade online portals that allow claimants to upload all required documents at once and track outstanding requirements in real-time.

#### d) **Flagging High-Complexity Early**
- **Root Cause:** Lack of anticipation for process complexity.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Early detection of high-complexity cases can trigger assignment to more experienced adjusters and prioritize monitoring/follow-up.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Impact              | Explanation                                                           | Mitigation Suggestions                                          |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| High Complexity   | Significantly slower| More documents needed, more steps, repeated requests                  | Checklists, early detection, proactive resource assignment      |
| Document Requests | Directly extends    | Multiple iterations for missing/details documents = more waiting      | Comprehensive initial requests, customer guidance, online portal|
| Region/Resource   | Not significant     | Both regions/resources similarly affected for same complexity levels  | Focus on process vs. resource selection                         |

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Performance issues** are most strongly linked to **case complexity** and the resulting **number of document requests** required.
- **Region** and **resource** do **not** show a clear impact on delay.
- **Recommendations** focus on **improving first-contact resolution**, **better guidance for adjusters**, and **streamlining customer interactions** to cut unnecessary wait times, especially for high-complexity claims.
