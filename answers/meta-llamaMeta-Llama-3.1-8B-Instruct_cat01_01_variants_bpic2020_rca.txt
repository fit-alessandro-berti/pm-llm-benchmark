After analyzing the process variants, I've identified some root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Longer process variants with more steps**: Variants with more steps, such as:
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ->... -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`

tend to have lower frequencies but higher performance values. This suggests that these longer variants may be causing performance issues due to the increased number of steps and potential bottlenecks.
2. **Rejections and retries**: Variants with multiple rejections and retries, such as:
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...`
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...`

have higher performance values but lower frequencies. This indicates that these variants may be causing performance issues due to the increased number of rejections and retries, which can lead to longer processing times and increased resource utilization.
3. **Missing or incomplete approvals**: Variants with missing or incomplete approvals, such as:
	* `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING`
	* `Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER (missing -> BUDGET OWNER is not involved in the approval process)`

have lower frequencies and performance values. This suggests that these variants may be causing performance issues due to the lack of proper approvals or missing steps in the process.
4. **Inefficient routing**: Variants with inefficient routing, such as:
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE ->...`

have higher performance values but lower frequencies. This indicates that these variants may be causing performance issues due to the inefficient routing of tasks, which can lead to longer processing times and increased resource utilization.
5. **Duplicates and unnecessary steps**: Variants with duplicates or unnecessary steps, such as:
	* `Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Request Payment -> Payment Handled`

have lower frequencies and performance values. This suggests that these variants may be causing performance issues due to the unnecessary duplication of steps or rejections.

These root causes can be addressed by optimizing the process, reducing unnecessary steps, and improving routing efficiency.
