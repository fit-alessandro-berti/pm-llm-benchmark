After analyzing the given process variants, I've identified some potential root causes for the performance issues:

1. **Inefficient approval paths**: The following paths have a higher frequency and lower performance:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...
	* These paths indicate that the process is not optimized for decision-making and often requires rework, leading to decreased performance.

2. **Longer approval chains**: Process variants with more steps in the approval chain tend to have lower performance:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR
	* Longer approval chains may contribute to delays and decreased performance.

3. **Rejection and re-submission**: Paths with multiple rejections and re-submissions have higher frequencies but lower performance:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...
	* These paths indicate that the process is not effective in addressing issues early on, leading to increased rework and decreased performance.

4. **Route with high frequency but low performance**: The following path has a high frequency but poor performance:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION -> Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...

5. **Paths with high variance in performance**: Some paths have a wide range of performance values:
	* Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE -> Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR -> Declaration REJECTED by MISSING -> Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE ->...
	* This indicates that the process has inconsistent performance across different variants.

To address these issues, consider process optimization techniques such as:

1. Identifying and eliminating unnecessary steps or approvals.
2. Redesigning approval paths to streamline decision-making.
3. Implementing more effective handling of rejected or incomplete submissions.
4. Analyzing and addressing the root causes of rejections and re-submissions.

Keep in mind that these are data-driven observations, and further analysis or simulation might be necessary to validate and refine these findings.
