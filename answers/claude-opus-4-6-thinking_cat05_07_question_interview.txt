# Clarifying Questions for the Property Onboarding Process

Below is a structured set of questions organized by the themes they aim to illuminate. Each question is designed to probe gaps, ambiguities, or areas where deeper understanding would strengthen a complete process model.

---

## 1. Process Initiation and Documentation Verification

- **When a landlord first contacts the regional office, is there any initial screening or eligibility criteria applied before the property coordinator even begins reviewing documentation?** For example, are there property types, locations, or portfolio sizes the company simply won't take on?

- **You mentioned that missing or outdated documents trigger a request back to the landlord. Is there a defined time limit the landlord has to provide those updates, and what happens if they never respond or repeatedly submit inadequate documentation?**

- **Who makes the final determination that the documentation package is "complete and verified"—is it solely the property coordinator's judgment, or does a supervisor or compliance resource sign off before the property details are entered into the central database?**

- **How do you handle situations where the property deed or local compliance certificates reveal legal complications, such as ownership disputes, liens, or zoning issues that don't neatly fall into a "missing document" category?**

---

## 2. Property Manager Assignment

- **You listed several factors for assigning a property manager—workload, geography, experience, and track record. Can you walk me through how those factors are actually weighed against each other? For instance, does geographic proximity always outweigh experience with a specific property type, or is there a more nuanced prioritization?**

- **Who performs the actual matching decision? Is it a single person such as a regional director, or is it a committee or even a system-driven recommendation?**

- **What happens if no available property manager is a strong fit—say the property is in a new market area or is an unusual type the company hasn't managed before? Is there a fallback or escalation path?**

- **Has there ever been a situation where the landlord and the assigned property manager didn't align well after the introductory meeting? If so, what does the reassignment process look like?**

---

## 3. The Introductory Meeting and Expectation Alignment

- **You described topics like pet policies, maintenance responsibilities, and payment channels being discussed. Is there a standardized checklist or agenda for this meeting, or does the conversation vary significantly depending on the landlord and property type?**

- **Are the agreements reached during this meeting documented formally at that stage, or do they remain informal until they are later codified in the lease template or a management agreement?**

- **Is there a separate management contract or service-level agreement signed between the company and the landlord at this point, and if so, what does that typically cover?**

---

## 4. Photography, Inspection, and Remediation

- **What is the typical sequence between the photographer and the inspector visiting—do they go simultaneously, or does one always precede the other? Does the outcome of the inspection ever require the photographer to return for updated images after repairs are made?**

- **When the inspector identifies issues, who bears the cost of remediation—is it always the landlord, or does the company sometimes absorb or advance those costs? How is that negotiated?**

- **Is there a threshold of severity in the inspection findings that would cause the company to decline the property entirely rather than pursue remediation?**

- **How do you select and manage the inspectors and photographers? Are they in-house staff, preferred vendors on a roster, or does the property manager have discretion to choose anyone?**

---

## 5. Marketing and Listing Activation

- **You mentioned a digital marketing team creates listings and updates pricing models. How does information flow from the property manager to the marketing team—is there a formal handoff, a templated brief, or a shared system where the marketing team pulls what they need?**

- **When you say pricing models are updated based on current market trends, who has the final authority to set the listed rental price? Is it the marketing team, the property manager, the financial analyst, or the landlord? What happens when they disagree?**

- **Is there a review or approval step between when the listing is created and when the property is officially "activated" in the rental portal? Who triggers that activation?**

- **How do you handle a scenario where market conditions shift significantly between the time the property enters onboarding and when it's finally listed—say a major employer leaves the area or a competitor floods the market with similar units?**

---

## 6. Tenant Screening and Lease Finalization

- **Can you describe the tenant screening criteria in more detail? Are there hard disqualifying thresholds—for example, a minimum credit score—or is the evaluation more holistic and left to the property manager's discretion?**

- **When multiple qualified applicants are interested, you mentioned negotiation, promotional discounts, and prioritizing longer leases. Is there a formal policy governing how those trade-offs are made, or is it largely the property manager's call?**

- **Does the landlord have any involvement or veto power in the final tenant selection, or is that entirely delegated to the property manager once the management agreement is in place?**

- **What does the process look like between the tenant being "chosen" and the lease being signed? Are there intermediate steps like a conditional offer, a holding deposit, or a cooling-off period?**

---

## 7. Quality Checks, Compliance, and Internal Audits

- **The compliance officer review, financial analyst verification, and IT integration check you described—do these happen in a specific order, or can they run in parallel? Are any of them blocking steps that must be completed before the tenant moves in?**

- **What happens if the compliance officer flags an issue with the lease—for example, a clause that doesn't conform with fair housing regulations? Does that restart the negotiation with the tenant, or is there a simpler correction path?**

- **If the financial analyst determines the agreed rental price doesn't meet the company's profitability targets, what recourse is there at that late stage? Can the price actually be changed, or is the finding more of an advisory flag for future properties?**

- **How often do the IT integration checks reveal errors, and when they do, what is the impact—does a listing go live with incorrect data, or is there a safeguard preventing that?**

---

## 8. Timing, Duration, and Parallelism

- **From first contact by the landlord to the property being fully activated and available to tenants, what is the typical end-to-end duration? What is the range—best case versus worst case?**

- **Which steps in the process can run concurrently, and which are strictly sequential? For example, can marketing preparation begin before the inspection is fully resolved?**

- **Are there any service-level agreements or internal benchmarks for how long each major phase should take, and what happens when a phase runs over?**

---

## 9. Exception Handling and Edge Cases

- **You mentioned properties requiring special insurance as an exception. Can you walk me through what happens when that need is identified? At what stage does it surface, and who is responsible for resolving it?**

- **When a landlord insists on custom lease clauses—such as unusual termination provisions or non-standard liability terms—what is the approval process? Does it go through legal review, and is there a limit to how much customization the company will accept?**

- **What happens if, at any point during onboarding, the landlord decides to withdraw the property? Is there a formal off-boarding or cancellation procedure, and are there financial implications for either party?**

- **Have you encountered situations where external factors—such as a change in local regulations mid-process, or a natural disaster affecting the property—forced you to pause or restart parts of the onboarding? How was that managed?**

---

## 10. Communication, Tracking, and Handoffs

- **You mentioned email threads, CRMs, and project management tools. Is there a single system of record that captures the authoritative status of an onboarding case, or do different stakeholders rely on different tools, creating potential for information gaps?**

- **When a handoff occurs—for example, from the property coordinator to the property manager, or from the property manager to the marketing team—how is accountability transferred? Is there a formal notification, a task assignment, or something less structured?**

- **If a stakeholder drops the ball on a step—say an inspector delays their report or a landlord stops responding—who is responsible for escalating, and what does that escalation path look like?**

- **How does the landlord stay informed about the status of their property's onboarding? Is there a portal, periodic update calls, or is it more ad hoc?**

These questions are designed to move beyond the surface narrative and into the operational reality—where ambiguity lives, where decisions are actually made, and where the process is most likely to break down or vary from its intended design.
