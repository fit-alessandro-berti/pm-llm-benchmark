This image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of a shipment, divided into two primary sections: Logistics and Warehouse. It begins with the customer placing an order, followed by the dispatch of goods to the computer hardware shop secretary. This step involves clarifying the shipment method and the handling of special requests. If the customer has a special request, the secretary contacts the warehouse to delay the shipment.

The following steps include:

*   Checking for insurance
*   Writing the package label
*   Selecting a logistics company and creating an order
*   Sending the order to the warehouse
*   Filling out the shipment paperwork
*   Moving the package to the designated pickup area

The flowchart is presented on a white background, with all text displayed in black and all connections between steps featured in black lines. The flowchart is relatively easy to follow, in part due to the use of clear labels and symbols, such as the "yes" and "no" diamonds, as well as the "insure parcel" and "notify customer about delay" symbols. 

Overall, the flowchart provides a concise and effective visual representation of the shipment process, making it easier to understand and follow.
