### **1. Identify Cases with Extended Durations**

We calculate the lead time (i.e., total case duration from first to last timestamp) for each case:

| Case ID | Start Time           | End Time             | Duration          |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00     | 2024-04-01 10:30     | 1.5 hours         |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05     | 2024-04-02 11:00     | ~1 day, 2 hrs     |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10     | 2024-04-03 09:30     | ~2 days           |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20     | 2024-04-01 10:45     | ~1.5 hours        |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25     | 2024-04-04 14:30     | ~3.2 days         |

### **Significantly Slower Cases:**

- **Case 2003** and **Case 2005**: Took more than 2 days.
- **Case 2002**: Took over a day.

All other cases were processed in under 2 hours.

### **2. Analyze Attributes Linked to Delay**

Let’s analyze potential causes for long durations using **Complexity**, **Region**, and **Resource**.

---

#### **A. Complexity**

| Complexity | Mean Duration           | Typical Observations                                          |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low        | ~1.5 hours               | Cases 2001, 2004 – handled quickly                           |
| Medium     | ~1 day (24+ hrs)         | Case 2002 required documents and delayed approval           |
| High       | 2–3 days                 | Cases 2003 & 2005 – required multiple doc requests          |

 **Insight:**  
- Higher-complexity cases tend to require **multiple iterations** of **“Request Additional Documents”**, significantly extending lead time.
- Both high-complexity cases (2003, 2005) involved **at least 2-3 “Request Additional Documents”** activities.

---

#### **B. Region**

| Region | Avg. Duration     | Insight                          |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| A      | ~1.75 days        | One long case (2003), rest fast |
| B      | ~1.9 days         | Cases 2002 (medium) & 2005 (high) long duration |

 **Insight:**  
- **Region B** appears to have more delays overall.  
- Even **Low Complexity Case (2004)** in Region B was fast. But both **medium and high** complexity cases in Region B exhibited delays.

---

#### **C. Resource**

1. **Adjuster Level**

   - **Adjuster_Mike (Region A)**: Case 2001 (Low, fast) and Case 2003 (High, slow)
   - **Adjuster_Lisa (Region B)**: Case 2002 (Medium, slow), 2004 (Low, fast), 2005 (High, very slow)

    **Adjuster_Lisa handled both problematic slow cases (2002 & 2005)** and also one fast case (2004 - low complexity).  
   The slow cases had **more document iterations**, mostly requested by her.

2. **Manager Level**

   - **Manager_Ann**: All fast case approvals (Cases 2001, 2002, 2004)  
   - **Manager_Bill**: Both slow, high-complexity case approvals (Cases 2003, 2005)

    High-complexity approvals go to **Manager_Bill**, possibly indicating a different handling process or more review steps involved with him.

3. **Finance and CSR Resources**

   - These roles appear to complete quickly after approval – no delays offered at those steps.

---

### **3. Root Cause Analysis & Recommendation**

#### **Cause 1: High Complexity Increases Rework (Repeated Document Requests)**

- High-complexity cases require **multiple document requests**, increasing duration by several days.
- The process of waiting for documents from clients or internally verifying them introduces bottlenecks.

** Recommendation:**  
- Introduce a **structured checklist or pre-submission validation** for high-complexity claims to reduce iterative document requests.
- Provide **document submission guidance to customers** during initial claim intake.

---

#### **Cause 2: Region B Has More Delays on Medium/High Complexity**

- Region B (handled mostly by Adjuster_Lisa & CSR_Paul) shows performance delays in medium and high complexity cases.
- Adjuster_Lisa frequently requests documents late or repeatedly.

** Recommendation:**  
- **Audit workflows in Region B**, especially how Adjuster_Lisa manages cases.
- Provide targeted training or introduce **workflow automation** to prompt earlier or comprehensive requests.
- Introduce **SLAs** (Service Level Agreements) or monitoring for document response times.

---

#### **Cause 3: Different Manager Handling (Bill vs. Ann)**

- Manager_Bill approves more complex cases but there's noticeable lag in timelines.
- This could be due to **manager workload**, **availability**, or stricter approval protocols.

** Recommendation:**  
- Evaluate **approvals handling** for high-complexity cases.
- Consider redistributing workload or introducing **parallel approval support** or an escalation process for high-complexity approvals.

---

###  **Conclusion**

The main contributors to delays are:

- **High complexity** requiring repeated data collection.
- **Region B** and specific **resources (Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill)** associated with slow case resolutions.
  
By improving **initial documentation collection**, **resource efficiency in Region B**, and **approval turnaround for complex claims**, the overall process performance can be significantly improved.
