We need to output a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for scenario. According to description, for keys 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init' values are dict of activities with support and confidence. Probably we need to fill some example data? Not specified exact rules. Probably we can propose typical attributes like support=1.0 confidence=0.9 etc. Provide dictionary with those top-level keys containing nested dicts mapping activity to {'support': ..., 'confidence': ...}. For other keys list activities maybe empty? Or also some example? The scenario likely expects to illustrate that we can create such structure, maybe fill with sample values. Provide a reasonably plausible example.

We need to produce a Python dictionary with all specified keys. Provide sample supports and confidences maybe 1.0 for existence? Or maybe we can set support=1.0 confidence varying per rule.

We'll construct nested dicts:

existence = {'Idea Generation (IG)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}, ...}
absence = {} maybe empty.
exactly_one = {}
init = {'Idea Generation (IG)': {'support': 1.0, 'confidence': 1.0}}.

Then other keys each with dict of activities mapping to support/confidence.

We'll fill some with non-zero values.

Make sure all keys present.

We'll output as Python code block.

Let's craft.

Below is a **complete DECLARE model** for the productdesigntolaunch process described in the scenario.  
The dictionary follows the exact structure required by pm4py:

* `existence`, `absence`, `exactly_one`, `init` – map each activity to a `{support, confidence}` pair.  
* All the remaining declarativerule keys – also map each activity to a `{support, confidence}` pair (many of them are empty in this example, but the keys are still present).

**Explanation of the structure**

| Toplevel key | Meaning in the DECLARE model | Example content |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| `existence`   | Activities that **must** appear at least once. | Every activity maps to `{ "support": 1.0, "confidence": … }`. |
| `absence`     | Activities that must **never** appear. | Empty (`{}`) here because none are forbidden. |
| `exactly_one`| Activities that must appear **exactly once** (often used for start/end). | Empty – the process does not enforce a strict “oneonly” rule for any activity. |
| `init`        | The activity that **starts** the process. | Only **Idea Generation (IG)** is marked as an initiator. |
| All other keys (`responded_existence`, `coexistence`, `response`, `precedence`, …) | Declarative relational constraints that associate a *support* and *confidence* value to each activity (or to the activity acting as a predecessor/consequent). | Values are illustrative (support = 1.0 – always observed; confidence varies to reflect how strong/likely the relationship is). |

Feel free to adjust the numeric `support`/`confidence` values to match the actual data you have from your log; the structure above is fully compliant with the DECLARE model format required by pm4py.
