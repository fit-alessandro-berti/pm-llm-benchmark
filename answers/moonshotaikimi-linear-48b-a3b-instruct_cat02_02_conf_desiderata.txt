Below is a systematic analysis of each case according to the **normative rules (Part 1)** and the **desiderata (Part 2)**.

---

###  **1. Violations of Normative Rules (Strict Rules)**

| Case | Activity Outcome | Violation | Explanation |
|------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **2** | **Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check** | **Sequence violation** | The normative sequence is: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment. Case 2 skips Credit Check and starts with Risk Assessment. |
| **2** | **Finalize Documentation after a rejection** | **Contradiction** | The rule explicitly prohibits finalizing documentation after a rejection. Case 2 rejected the loan, yet performed Finalize Documentation before closing. |
| **2** | **Close Case after finalizing documentation** | **Illegal state** | According to the normative rules, a rejection must close the case **without** finalizing documentation. Case 2 does both: rejects and then finalizes. |
| **1** | **All steps in correct order** |  **Compliant** | Follows the exact sequence: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Finalize Documentation  Close Case. |
| **3** | **Credit Check >24 hours after Application** |  **Desideratum only** | This is **not a normative violation**, but a timing desideratum. No strict rule is broken. |
| **3** | **Inform Applicant >48 hours after Loan Decision** |  **Desideratum only** | Again, this is **not a normative violation**, but a timing recommendation. |
| **3** | **No Follow-up Call** |  **Desideratum only** | The follow-up call is encouraged but not mandatory. Nor is there a normative rule requiring it. |

---

###  **2. Summary of Normative Violations**

- **Case 2** is the **only case** that **seriously violates** the normative process rules.
  - Skipped Credit Check (illegal order).
  - Finalized documentation **after a rejection** (illegal action).
  - Closed the case after finalizing documentation (illegal state).

---

###  **3. Desiderata Violations**

| Case | Desideratum Not Met | Description |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| **3** | No Follow-up Call | The follow-up call is **recommended**, not required. This is a **minor deviation**, not a violation. |

> All other desiderata (timeliness of Credit Check, loan decision, and applicant notification) are **not** violated in any case. Case 3 simply exceeds the ideal time windows, which is **not a violation**, but a **delay**—a descriptive deviation, not a normative or even desideratum violation.

---

###  **4. Possible Interpretations / Justifications**

#### **Case 1 (Fully Compliant)**
- Processor followed the exact normative sequence.
- No delays beyond recommended windows, so no desiderata violation.

#### **Case 2 (Serious Violation)**
- Likely a **manual override or process skip**.
- Possibly started with Risk Assessment due to urgency or a miscommunication.
- After the rejection, someone erroneously finalized documentation and closed the case—clearly not adhering to the normative logic.

#### **Case 3 (Timing Delays, No Normative Issues)**
- Could be due to:
  - Weekend or holiday delays.
  - Staff unavailability.
  - Manual review bottleneck.
- No follow-up call: may indicate:
  - Lean staffing.
  - Preference for digital communication.
  - No policy requiring follow-up in this organization.

###  **Conclusion**

| Case | Normative Violation? | Desideratum Violation? | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| 1 |  |  | Fully compliant with normative rules. |
| 2 |  |  | **Serious normative violation**—skip of Credit Check, illegal finalization, and closure. |
| 3 |  |  | Only timing delays and no follow-up—**not normative violations**. |

Only **Case 2** should be flagged for **process rule enforcement or corrective action**.
