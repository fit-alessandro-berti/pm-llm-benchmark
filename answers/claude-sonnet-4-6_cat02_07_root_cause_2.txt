# Insurance Claims Processing – Performance Analysis

## Step 1: Calculate Case Durations

First, I'll determine the total lead time for each case by measuring the time from **Submit Claim** to **Close Claim**.

| Case ID | Start Timestamp   | End Timestamp     | Total Duration | Complexity | Region |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00  | 2024-04-01 10:30  | **1.5 hours**  | Low        | A      |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05  | 2024-04-02 11:00  | **~26 hours**  | Medium     | B      |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10  | 2024-04-03 09:30  | **~48.5 hours**| High       | A      |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20  | 2024-04-01 10:45  | **1.4 hours**  | Low        | B      |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25  | 2024-04-04 14:30  | **~125 hours** | High       | B      |

### Visual Duration Comparison

```
Case 2001 || 1.5 hrs
Case 2004 || 1.4 hrs
Case 2002 || ~26 hrs
Case 2003 || ~48.5 hrs
Case 2005 || ~125 hrs
```

###  Cases with Performance Issues:
- **Case 2003** (~48.5 hours) — significantly above baseline
- **Case 2005** (~125 hours) — extreme outlier, ~83× longer than low-complexity cases

## Step 2: Root Cause Analysis by Attribute

### 2A. Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Cases       | Avg Duration  | # of "Request Additional Documents" Events |
|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Low        | 2001, 2004  | ~1.5 hours    | 0                                            |
| Medium     | 2002        | ~26 hours     | 1                                            |
| High       | 2003, 2005  | ~87 hours avg | 2 (Case 2003), 3 (Case 2005)                 |

**Key Finding:**
>  **Complexity is the strongest driver of long durations.** High-complexity claims trigger multiple rounds of "Request Additional Documents," each round introducing waiting time (often overnight or multi-day delays) as customers gather and return documentation.

**Evidence of document-request delays:**

```
Case 2003 (High):
  - Request Docs  2024-04-01 11:00
  - Request Docs  2024-04-01 17:00   (+6 hrs wait)
  - Approve Claim  2024-04-02 16:00  (+23 hrs wait )

Case 2005 (High):
  - Request Docs  2024-04-01 11:30
  - Request Docs  2024-04-02 17:00   (+29.5 hrs wait )
  - Request Docs  2024-04-03 15:00   (+22 hrs wait )
  - Approve Claim  2024-04-04 10:00  (+19 hrs wait )
```

Each waiting period between document requests represents idle time where the case is stalled, waiting for external input.

### 2B. Resource Analysis

| Resource       | Cases Involved  | Role in Delays |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Adjuster_Mike  | 2001, 2003      | Handled 2 doc requests in Case 2003; no delays in Case 2001 (Low complexity) |
| Adjuster_Lisa  | 2002, 2004, 2005| Handled **3 doc requests** in Case 2005; longest-running case |
| Manager_Ann    | 2001, 2002, 2004| All low/medium cases — no significant delays |
| Manager_Bill   | 2003, 2005      | Approves only **high-complexity** cases — long gaps before approval |
| Finance_Alan   | 2001, 2003      | No notable delays in payment step |
| Finance_Carl   | 2002, 2004, 2005| ~4-hour gap in Case 2005 Pay step (minor) |

**Key Findings:**

>  **Adjuster_Lisa** is associated with the longest-running case (2005) and handles the most document requests (3 rounds). This may indicate:
> - She is assigned the most complex cases in Region B
> - She may be requesting documents **sequentially** (one request at a time) rather than **comprehensively upfront**
> - She may have a heavier workload, causing delayed follow-ups

>  **Manager_Bill** exclusively approves high-complexity claims (Cases 2003 and 2005). The gaps before his approvals are very long:
> - Case 2003: ~23 hours between last document request and approval
> - Case 2005: ~19 hours between last document request and approval
>
> This suggests Manager_Bill may be a **bottleneck** — possibly due to limited availability, higher scrutiny requirements for complex cases, or insufficient staffing at the managerial level for high-complexity approvals.

### 2C. Region Analysis

| Region | Cases           | Complexities    | Avg Duration   |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| A      | 2001, 2003      | Low, High       | ~25 hours avg  |
| B      | 2002, 2004, 2005| Medium, Low, High| ~51 hours avg |

**Key Findings:**

>  **Region B** handles Case 2005 — the extreme outlier — which skews its average significantly. However, even the Medium-complexity case in Region B (Case 2002) took ~26 hours compared to Low cases being resolved within 1.5 hours.

>  Region B appears to be where **Adjuster_Lisa** and **Finance_Carl** operate. The compounding effect of High complexity + Adjuster_Lisa's sequential document requests + Manager_Bill's approval delays all converge in Region B's high-complexity cases.

>  **Region alone is not the primary driver** — the combination of Region B + High Complexity creates the worst outcomes. Region A's High-complexity case (2003) is also slow, but less extreme, possibly because Adjuster_Mike made only 2 document requests vs. Lisa's 3.

  PRIMARY CAUSE:                                                     
    
   HIGH COMPLEXITY  Multiple "Request Additional Documents"

  AMPLIFYING FACTOR:                                                 
    
   REGION B  Concentrates high-complexity cases with the          
   above two resources, compounding all delays                     
    

```

## Step 4: Recommendations

###  Recommendation 1: Upfront, Comprehensive Document Checklists (Targets: Complexity & Adjuster Behavior)
- **Problem:** High-complexity cases see 2–3 separate document request rounds, each causing multi-day delays.
- **Solution:** For claims flagged as High complexity at submission, adjusters should use a **standardized checklist** to request ALL likely required documents in a **single, comprehensive initial request**, rather than making iterative requests as gaps are discovered.
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce Case 2005-type scenarios from 3 request rounds to 1, potentially cutting duration by 40–60%.

---

###  Recommendation 2: Training & Workload Review for Adjuster_Lisa (Targets: Resource)
- **Problem:** Adjuster_Lisa handles the most complex cases and consistently makes the most document requests, suggesting possible knowledge gaps in anticipating documentation needs.
- **Solution:**
  - Provide **training on complex claim requirements** so she can identify all documentation needs upfront.
  - Review her **workload** to ensure she isn't overloaded, which could slow her follow-up cadence.
  - **Pair her with a senior adjuster** for mentoring on High-complexity cases.

---

###  Recommendation 3: Address Manager_Bill's Approval Bottleneck (Targets: Resource)
- **Problem:** Manager_Bill shows 19–23 hour gaps before approving high-complexity claims, suggesting limited availability or capacity.
- **Solution:**
  - Assign a **secondary approver** for high-complexity claims to prevent single-point-of-failure delays.
  - Implement **SLA-based escalation**: if approval isn't made within 4 business hours of the last completed document review, auto-escalate to a backup manager.
  - Review whether **Manager_Bill has too many high-complexity cases** assigned simultaneously.

---

###  Recommendation 4: Complexity-Based Fast Tracking and SLA Tiers (Targets: All Attributes)
- **Problem:** All claim types follow the same process path with no differentiation in handling urgency or resource allocation.
- **Solution:** Implement **tiered SLAs** by complexity:

| Complexity | Target Closure Time | Priority Resources Assigned |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Low        | Same day (8 hrs)  | Standard CSR + Adjuster     |
| Medium     | 2 business days    | Experienced Adjuster        |
| High       | 5 business days    | Senior Adjuster + Dedicated Manager |

---

###  Recommendation 5: Regional Workload Balancing (Targets: Region)
- **Problem:** Region B concentrates high-complexity claims with specific resources, amplifying bottlenecks.
- **Solution:**
  - Monitor **regional complexity distribution** and redistribute cases if one region is disproportionately handling High-complexity claims.
  - Consider **cross-regional resource sharing** for complex cases during peak periods.

---

## Conclusion

| Root Cause | Severity | Cases Affected |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| High complexity  multiple document request rounds |  Critical | 2003, 2005 |
| Adjuster_Lisa's sequential document requests |  High | 2005 |
| Manager_Bill's approval delays |  High | 2003, 2005 |
| Region B resource concentration |  Medium | 2002, 2005 |

The data clearly shows that **claim complexity is the root trigger**, but the **magnitude of delay is amplified** by how adjusters handle document collection (sequentially vs. comprehensively) and by managerial approval bottlenecks. Addressing these three factors in concert would yield the greatest reduction in lead times for high-complexity cases.
