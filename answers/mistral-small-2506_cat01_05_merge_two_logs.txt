### Merged Event Log with Reasoning

Below is the merged event log, combining events from Log A and Log B where possible. The events are ordered chronologically based on the timestamp from Log B (chosen as the primary timestamp due to its finer granularity and closer alignment to actual event times). For each merged event, attributes from both logs are included. Unmatched events from either log are included separately with their original attributes.

#### Merged Events:
1. **Order Received**
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` (Log B)
   - **Event Type**: `Order Received` (Log A) / `OrderReceived` (Log B)
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **User ID**: `u45` (Log B)
   - **Resource ID**: `r10` (Log B)
   - **Notes**: `Event captured at warehouse system` (Log B)
   - **Reasoning**: The timestamps are within 2 seconds of each other (`2023-10-10T10:00:00Z` in Log A vs. `2023-10-10T09:59:58Z` in Log B), and the event names are semantically equivalent. Attributes from both logs are combined.

2. **Order Validated**
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z` (Log B)
   - **Event Type**: `Order Validated` (Log A) / `OrderValidation` (Log B)
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **User ID**: `u12` (Log B)
   - **Resource ID**: `r10` (Log B)
   - **Notes**: `Cross-check inventory` (Log B)
   - **Reasoning**: The timestamps are within 1 second of each other (`2023-10-10T10:01:30Z` in Log A vs. `2023-10-10T10:01:29Z` in Log B), and the event names are semantically equivalent. Attributes from both logs are combined.

3. **Payment Processed**
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z` (Log B)
   - **Event Type**: `Payment Processed` (Log A) / `PaymentCheck` (Log B)
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **User ID**: `u12` (Log B)
   - **Resource ID**: `r99` (Log B)
   - **Notes**: `Payment gateway delay` (Log B)
   - **Reasoning**: The timestamps are within 5 seconds of each other (`2023-10-10T10:02:00Z` in Log A vs. `2023-10-10T10:02:05Z` in Log B), and the event names are semantically equivalent. Attributes from both logs are combined.

4. **Quality Check** (Log B only)
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:03:00Z`
   - **Event Name**: `Quality Check`
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **User ID**: `u45`
   - **Resource ID**: `r11`
   - **Notes**: `Random inspection`
   - **Reasoning**: No corresponding event in Log A. Included as-is from Log B.

5. **Item Shipped**
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z` (Log B)
   - **Event Type**: `Item Shipped` (Log A) / `Shipping` (Log B)
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **User ID**: `u45` (Log B)
   - **Resource ID**: `r10` (Log B)
   - **Notes**: `Package handed to courier` (Log B)
   - **Reasoning**: The timestamps are within 2 seconds of each other (`2023-10-10T10:05:00Z` in Log A vs. `2023-10-10T10:05:02Z` in Log B), and the event names are semantically equivalent. Attributes from both logs are combined.

6. **Item Delivered** (Log A only)
   - **Timestamp**: `2023-10-10T10:20:00Z`
   - **Event Type**: `Item Delivered`
   - **Order ID**: `Order#1234`
   - **Reasoning**: No corresponding event in Log B. Included as-is from Log A.

### Final Merged Event Log (Chronological Order):
```
2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, Order Received, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Event captured at warehouse system"
2023-10-10T10:01:29Z, Order Validated, Order#1234, u12, r10, "Cross-check inventory"
2023-10-10T10:02:05Z, Payment Processed, Order#1234, u12, r99, "Payment gateway delay"
2023-10-10T10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u45, r11, "Random inspection"
2023-10-10T10:05:02Z, Item Shipped, Order#1234, u45, r10, "Package handed to courier"
2023-10-10T10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234
```

### Key Decisions and Reasoning:
1. **Timestamp Tolerance**: Events were matched if their timestamps were within 2 seconds of each other. This accounts for minor delays in event recording between systems.
2. **Event Name Mapping**:
   - `OrderReceived` (Log B)  `Order Received` (Log A)
   - `OrderValidation` (Log B)  `Order Validated` (Log A)
   - `PaymentCheck` (Log B)  `Payment Processed` (Log A)
   - `Shipping` (Log B)  `Item Shipped` (Log A)
3. **Unmatched Events**:
   - `Quality Check` (Log B) had no counterpart in Log A and was included as-is.
   - `Item Delivered` (Log A) had no counterpart in Log B and was included as-is.
4. **Attribute Integration**: For merged events, all attributes from both logs were included to enrich the event record.
5. **Chronological Order**: Events were ordered based on the timestamp from Log B (primary timestamp). If Log B had no timestamp for an event, the timestamp from Log A was used.

This approach ensures that the merged log is as complete and accurate as possible while preserving the integrity of the original data.
