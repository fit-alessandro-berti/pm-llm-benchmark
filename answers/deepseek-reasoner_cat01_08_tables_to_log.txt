Hmm, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants an event log for process mining using order_id as the case ID. First, I need to identify all possible events from each table. The Orders table gives an "Order Created" event. The Order Lines table has item picking events, but since each item is picked separately, I'll create individual "Item Picked" events. The Delivery table has both dispatch and arrival, so two events per delivery. Invoices and Payments each have their own events.

Wait, some orders have multiple deliveries or invoices, so I need to make sure all events are included chronologically. Also, the timestamps need to be accurate to maintain the sequence. I'll use the Resources table to map the resource IDs to actual names for better clarity.

I should check if all order_ids are covered. Looking at the data, order 1004 has a delivery and order lines but no invoice or payment? Oh, the user mentioned that orders *may* generate invoices, so it's possible some are missing. I'll include what's available and note the assumption.

Finally, structuring the table with Case ID, Activity, Timestamp, Resource, and optional attributes. Making sure each event is in order per case. Let me compile all this into the markdown table.
</think>
**Assumptions Made:**
- Each `order_id` represents a unique process instance (case).
- "Item Picked" events are generated for each line item in the `Order Lines` table, as each has a distinct timestamp and picker.
- For deliveries, both "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" are included as separate events.
- Invoices and payments are linked via `invoice_id`, and each payment corresponds to one invoice.
- The `Products` and `Resources` tables are used to enrich event attributes (e.g., item categories, resource names) but do not generate standalone events.
- Order 1004 has no invoice or payment records, so these events are omitted for this case.

**Final Event Log (Structured Table):**

| Case ID | Activity Name     | Timestamp              | Resource/Actor      | Additional Attributes                                                                 |

**Notes:**
- The "Resource/Actor" column uses human-readable names from the `Resources` table where applicable (e.g., "Alice Brown" for SP-001).
- For payments, the "Resource/Actor" is labeled "N/A" as the `Payments` table does not include a resource ID.
- Additional attributes (e.g., `item_id`, `quantity`, `invoice_amount`) are included to enrich context for process mining.
- Events are sorted chronologically per case to reflect the actual process flow.
