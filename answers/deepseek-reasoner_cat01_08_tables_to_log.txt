**Assumptions**:
1. **Item Picked Events**: Each line in the `Order Lines` table is treated as a separate "Item Picked" event.
2. **Delivery Events**: Each delivery has "Order Dispatched" and "Order Arrived" events. Carrier names are mapped via `carrier_id`.
3. **Payment Resource**: The `Payments` table lacks explicit resource data, so the "Resource/Actor" is omitted.
4. **Chronological Order**: Events are sorted by `order_id` and timestamp. Overlaps (e.g., multiple deliveries) are resolved by timestamp.
5. **Invoice-Payment Link**: Payments are linked to invoices but inherit the parent `order_id` for case tracing.
