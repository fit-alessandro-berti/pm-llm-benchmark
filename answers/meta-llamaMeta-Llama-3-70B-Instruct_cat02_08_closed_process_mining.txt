Here are the opposite concepts, and more general concepts, along with an explanation for each of the given concepts in the process mining field:

* **Automated Process Discovery**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Manual Process Modeling** (where process models are created manually by process experts or analysts)
	+ More general concept: **Process Model Creation** (encompassing both automated discovery and manual modeling)
* **Predictive Monitoring**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Reactive Monitoring** (where issues are only detected and addressed after they occur)
	+ More general concept: **Process Surveillance** (encompassing both predictive and reactive monitoring)
* **Bottom-up Discovery**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Top-down Modeling** (where process models are created based on high-level process descriptions or regulations)
	+ More general concept: **Process Analysis** (encompassing both bottom-up discovery and top-down modeling)
* **Process Simulation**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Process Execution** (where actual processes are executed without simulation)
	+ More general concept: **Process Experimentation** (encompassing both simulation and actual execution)
* **Process Efficiency**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Process Inefficiency** (where processes are characterized by waste, delays, or inefficiencies)
	+ More general concept: **Process Performance** (encompassing both efficiency and inefficiency aspects)
* **Real-time Monitoring**:
	+ Opposite concept: **Batch-based Monitoring** (where data is collected and analyzed in batches, rather than in real-time)
	+ More general concept: **Process Observation** (encompassing both real-time and batch-based monitoring)

These opposite and more general concepts can help to provide a clearer understanding of the original concepts and their relationships within the process mining field.
