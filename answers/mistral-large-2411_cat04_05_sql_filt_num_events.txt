Certainly! To achieve this, you can use a subquery to first count the number of events for each `case_id`, filter out any cases with more than six events, and then join this result back with the original `event_log` table to get the full set of events for the remaining cases.

Here is the DuckDB SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
WITH case_counts AS (
    SELECT
        case_id,
        COUNT(*) AS event_count
    FROM
        event_log
    GROUP BY
        case_id
)

SELECT
    e.case_id,
    e.activity,
    e.timestamp
FROM
    event_log e
JOIN
    case_counts cc
ON
    e.case_id = cc.case_id
WHERE
    cc.event_count <= 6
ORDER BY
    e.case_id, e.timestamp;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Subquery (`case_counts`)**:
   - `SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id`: This subquery counts the number of events for each `case_id`.

2. **Main Query**:
   - `SELECT e.case_id, e.activity, e.timestamp FROM event_log e`: Selects the columns from the `event_log` table.
   - `JOIN case_counts cc ON e.case_id = cc.case_id`: Joins the `event_log` table with the `case_counts` subquery on the `case_id`.
   - `WHERE cc.event_count <= 6`: Filters the results to include only those cases where the event count is six or fewer.
   - `ORDER BY e.case_id, e.timestamp`: Orders the results by `case_id` and `timestamp` to maintain the chronological order of events within each case.

This query ensures that only the events from cases with six or fewer events are returned.
