First, I need to understand the standard Hire-to-Retire process. Typically, it involves:

- Posting a job advertisement

- Screening candidates

- Conducting interviews

- Making a hiring decision

- Onboarding the new employee

- Adding the employee to the payroll

- Closing the case

The expected order should be sequential: Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close. But there might be some variations, like interviews might happen after screening, and decision after interviews.

Now, let's look at POWL Model 1:

In Model 1, the partial order is defined with edges:

- Post  Screen

- Screen  Decide

- Screen  Interview

- Decide  Onboard

- Onboard  Payroll

- Payroll  Close

From this, we see that Screen has edges to both Decide and Interview. But in a standard process, screening should happen before interviews, and then decision after interviews. Here, Screen leads directly to Decide and also to Interview. This means that after screening, we can either go to Decide or to Interview? But that doesn't make sense because deciding should happen after interviews, not directly after screening.

The partial order doesn't specify that Interview must come before Decide. In fact, from the edges, Screen precedes both Decide and Interview, but there is no edge between Interview and Decide. So, technically, after Screen, we could have Decide and Interview in any order, or even concurrently? But in practice, interviews should be conducted before the decision.

This is an anomaly: In Model 1, the hiring decision can be made before conducting interviews, which is illogical. You need to interview candidates before making a decision.

Also, from the edges, Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide, so Interview and Decide are both after Screen, but no order between them. So, Decide could happen before Interview, which is wrong.

Now, let's look at Model 2:

Model 2 has:

- Post  Screen

- Post  Interview  // This is odd because Post directly to Interview? Shouldn't Screening come before Interview?

In Model 2, the edges are:

- Post  Screen

- Post  Interview

- Interview  Decide

- Decide  loop_onboarding

- loop_onboarding  xor_payroll

- xor_payroll  Close

loop_onboarding is a loop between Onboard and skip, meaning we can onboard multiple times or skip? But onboarding should typically happen once per employee, but here it might be repeated, which could be for multiple onboarding steps, but it might not be necessary.

xor_payroll is an exclusive choice between Payroll and skip, meaning we can either add to payroll or skip it. But skipping payroll doesn't make sense because every employee must be added to payroll.

Also, in the partial order, Post has edges to both Screen and Interview, meaning that Screen and Interview can happen in any order after Post. But typically, screening should happen before interviews. So, having Interview directly after Post without screening is anomalous.

Now, comparing both models to the standard process.

First, let's list the anomalies:

**Model 1 Anomalies:**

- The order between Interview and Decide is not enforced. Decide can happen before Interview, which is logically incorrect.

- There is no direct edge from Interview to Decide, so Interview might not happen at all, or might happen after Decide.

In Model 1, from the edges, Screen must happen before both Interview and Decide, but since there is no edge from Interview to Decide, Decide could occur without Interview. That's a problem.

**Model 2 Anomalies:**

- Post has direct edges to Screen and Interview, so Interview can happen before Screening, which is illogical. Screening should precede Interview.

- The loop_onboarding allows multiple onboarding, which might be acceptable if onboarding involves multiple steps, but typically, for one hire, onboarding is a single process, but it might have sub-tasks. However, the loop is between Onboard and skip, so it might allow repeating onboarding or skipping it? The loop operator in POWL: `*(A, B)` means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. Here, loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip]). So, it means we do Onboard, then we have a choice: either skip (which ends the loop) or do skip? Wait, no. In loop, children are [A, B], where A is the body and B is the redo part? Let me recall.

In PM4Py, for process trees, a loop operator has two children: the first is the body, and the second is the redo part. But in POWL, it might be similar. From the description: `*(A, B)` means execute A, then either exit the loop or execute B followed by A again. So, in this case, loop_onboarding has children [Onboard, skip]. So, we execute Onboard, then we have a choice: either exit (so skip is used to exit?) or execute skip and then Onboard again? But skip is a silent transition, meaning it does nothing. So, after Onboard, we can either do nothing (exit) or do nothing and then do Onboard again? That doesn't make sense because if we choose to execute skip, it does nothing, and then we do Onboard again? So, effectively, we can repeat Onboard multiple times. But in hiring, onboarding should happen once per employee. So, allowing multiple onboarding might be an anomaly, but it could be for training or something, but it's unusual.

Also, xor_payroll allows skipping Payroll, which is critical because without payroll, the employee doesn't get paid. So, skipping payroll is a severe anomaly.

Now, which model more closely aligns with the normative process?

In Model 1, the main issue is that Interview and Decide are not properly ordered, so Decide might happen without Interview.

In Model 2, Interview might happen without Screening, and Payroll might be skipped, which is worse.

But let's see the edges in Model 2: Post  Screen and Post  Interview, so both Screen and Interview are after Post, but no order between them. So, Interview could be done before Screen, which is bad. Also, Interview  Decide, so Decide must come after Interview, which is good. But since Screen might not happen before Interview, we might interview candidates without screening, which is inefficient and risky.

In Model 1, Screen must happen before Interview, but Interview might not happen before Decide.

In Model 1, from edges: Screen  Interview and Screen  Decide, so Interview and Decide are both after Screen, but since no edge between them, they can be concurrent or in any order. So, Decide could be before Interview.

In Model 2, Interview must happen before Decide, which is good, but Interview might happen before Screen, which is bad.

So, both have anomalies, but let's see which one is better.

Also, in Model 2, we have loop_onboarding and xor_payroll, which allow repeating onboarding and skipping payroll, both of which are undesirable in a standard process.

In Model 1, the sequence is mostly linear except for the Interview/Decide order.

But in Model 1, after Screen, we have Decide and Interview, but Onboard comes after Decide, and Payroll after Onboard, Close after Payroll. So, if Decide happens before Interview, then Onboard might happen before Interview, which is nonsense.

So, Model 1 has a fundamental flaw: the hiring decision can be made without interviews.

Model 2 has interviews before decision, which is good, but screening might be bypassed, and payroll might be skipped.

Skipping payroll is very severe, as it violates legal and operational requirements.

Also, in Model 2, onboarding can be repeated, which might not be necessary but is less severe.

So, Model 2 might have more severe anomalies due to skipping payroll.

But let's confirm the partial orders.

In Model 1, the nodes are all activities, and edges define order. Since there is no edge from Interview to Decide, Interview is not necessary for Decide. So, yes, Decide can happen without Interview.

In Model 2, from the edges, Screen is not necessary for Interview, so Interview can happen without Screen.

But in Model 2, Decide requires Interview, so at least Interview happens before Decide.

Now, for the normative process, we need both Screening and Interview before Decide.

Neither model enforces that both Screening and Interview happen before Decide.

In Model 1, Screen happens before Decide, but Interview may not.

In Model 2, Interview happens before Decide, but Screen may not.

So, both are deficient.

But in Model 2, there is an additional issue of skipping payroll.

So, Model 2 has more anomalies.

But let's see which one is closer.

Perhaps I need to see if there are any other aspects.

Another thing: in Model 1, the activities are all included, and the order is almost correct except for the missing edge between Interview and Decide.

In Model 2, the structure is more complex with loops and choices, which might be unnecessary.

For the Hire-to-Retire process, it should be mostly sequential with no loops or skips for core activities.

So, Model 1 is simpler and closer to the normative, but with the key flaw.

Model 2 has multiple deviations.

But let's list all anomalies clearly.

**Anomalies in Model 1:**

- **Anomaly 1:** No precedence between Interview and Decide. This allows Decide to occur before Interview, which violates the process logic since interviews are necessary for an informed decision.

- **Anomaly 2:** Since Interview is not required for Decide, it might be possible to skip Interview altogether, though from the edges, Interview is after Screen, so it might happen, but not necessarily before Decide.

In partial order, since Interview is after Screen, and Decide is after Screen, but no order between them, so Interview could be skipped if we never choose to do it, but in POWL, since it's a partial order, all nodes must be executed? I need to recall how POWL works.

In POWL, a StrictPartialOrder defines a set of nodes with a partial order, meaning that all nodes must be executed, but the order is only enforced where edges exist. So, in Model 1, all activities must be executed, but the order between Interview and Decide is not specified, so they can be executed in any order after Screen.

So, Interview must happen, but it could be after Decide.

Similarly, in Model 2, all nodes must be executed? But in Model 2, we have operators like loop and xor, which might allow skipping some activities.

In Model 2, the nodes include loop_onboarding and xor_payroll, which are operators, so the activities inside might not always be executed.

Specifically, for xor_payroll, since it's an exclusive choice between Payroll and skip, then Payroll might not be executed if skip is chosen.

Similarly, for loop_onboarding, since it's a loop, Onboard might be executed multiple times, or at least once? In a loop, the body is executed at least once, and then based on the redo, it might be repeated. So, Onboard will be executed at least once, which is good, but it might be repeated, which is unnecessary.

In Model 2, the activities Post, Screen, Interview, Decide, loop_onboarding, xor_payroll, Close must all be "executed" in some sense, but for loop_onboarding, it means executing Onboard one or more times, and for xor_payroll, it means executing either Payroll or skip.

So, in Model 2, Payroll might be skipped, which is bad.

Also, Onboard might be repeated, which is not typical.

Now, back to Model 1: all activities are executed, but in the wrong order.

So, which is worse? Skipping payroll or having interviews after decision? Both are bad, but skipping payroll might be more severe because it affects payment.

In terms of process integrity, both have flaws, but Model 2 allows skipping a critical activity, while Model 1 has a temporal anomaly.

In Model 1, if interviews happen after decision, that means we decide without interviews, which is irrational and could lead to bad hires.

In Model 2, if screening is skipped, we might interview unqualified candidates, which is inefficient, but not as bad as deciding without interviews? Or is it?

Deciding without interviews is worse than interviewing without screening? Screening is usually to filter out unqualified candidates, so if we interview without screening, we waste time on unqualified candidates, but if we decide without interviews, we might hire someone without meeting them, which is very bad.

So, both are severe, but let's see the normative process.

Typically, the sequence is: Post  Screen  Interview  Decide  Onboard  Payroll  Close.

In Model 1, we have Post  Screen  (Decide and Interview in any order)  Onboard  Payroll  Close.

So, the only missing link is that Interview should be before Decide.

In Model 2, we have Post  (Screen and Interview in any order)  Interview  Decide  loop_onboarding  xor_payroll  Close.

Here, Interview is after Post, and also Interview  Decide, so Interview must happen before Decide, but Screen might not happen before Interview.

Also, after Decide, we have loop_onboarding, which is fine if onboarding is done at least once, but looping might be overkill.

And xor_payroll allows skipping Payroll.

So, compared to Model 1, Model 2 has two additional anomalies: possible interview without screening, and possible skip payroll.

Therefore, Model 1 is closer to the normative process because it only has one anomaly, whereas Model 2 has three anomalies.

The anomaly in Model 1 is the order between Interview and Decide.

In Model 2, the anomalies are: order between Screen and Interview, skip payroll, and loop onboarding.

Loop onboarding might not be a severe anomaly if it represents multiple onboarding tasks, but in the context, it's shown as a single activity "Onboard_Employee", so repeating it might not make sense.

Similarly, in Model 1, all activities are executed, so no skips.

So, I think Model 1 is better than Model 2.

But let's see the question: "which model more closely aligns with a normative version"

So, I need to justify.

Perhaps I should consider the severity.

Another thought: in Model 1, since Interview and Decide are not ordered, it might be possible that Interview never happens if the process chooses to do Decide first and then somehow Interview is skipped, but in partial order, all nodes must be executed, so Interview will happen, but after Decide, which is bad.

In Model 2, Screen will happen because it's a node, but it might happen after Interview, so when Interview happens, Screen might not have been done, so we interview without screening.

Similarly, Payroll might be skipped.

So, for normative alignment, Model 1 requires only one correction: add an edge from Interview to Decide.

Model 2 requires multiple corrections: add edge from Screen to Interview, remove the loop or make it sequential, and remove the skip option from payroll.

Therefore, Model 1 is closer.

But let's double-check the edges in Model 1.

In Model 1, edges are:

- Post -> Screen

- Screen -> Decide

- Screen -> Interview

- Decide -> Onboard

- Onboard -> Payroll

- Payroll -> Close

So, from Screen, both Decide and Interview are next, but since no edge between them, they can be in any order.

But in practice, for the process to be correct, Interview must be before Decide.

So, the anomaly is that Interview is not forced to be before Decide.

In Model 2, edges are:

- Post -> Screen

- Post -> Interview  // so Interview can be before Screen

- Interview -> Decide  // good

- Decide -> loop_onboarding

- loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll

- xor_payroll -> Close

So, indeed, Model 2 has Post directly to Interview, which is wrong.

Also, the loop and xor are problematic.

So, I think Model 1 is better.

But in Model 1, is there any edge from Interview to anything? No, Interview has no outgoing edges except that it is after Screen, but since Decide has an edge to Onboard, and Interview has no edge to Decide, so Interview might be done after Decide, which is useless.

So, for the decision to be informed, Interview must be before Decide.

Thus, both models have flaws, but Model 1's flaw is easier to fix.

The question is to decide which more closely aligns, so I'll go with Model 1.

Now, for the justification.</think>### Analysis of POWL Models for Hire-to-Retire Process

The Hire-to-Retire process typically follows a sequential flow: Post_Job_Ad  Screen_Candidates  Conduct_Interviews  Make_Hiring_Decision  Onboard_Employee  Add_to_Payroll  Close_Case. This order ensures logical consistency, where screening precedes interviews, interviews inform the hiring decision, onboarding follows the decision, payroll is mandatory for compensation, and the case is closed after completion. Deviations from this sequence can lead to process inefficiencies, logical errors, or compliance issues.

#### Anomalies in Model 1
- **Anomaly 1: Lack of Precedence between Interview and Decision**  
  In Model 1, the partial order defines edges from `Screen` to both `Decide` and `Interview`, but no edge exists from `Interview` to `Decide`. This allows the hiring decision to be made before conducting interviews, which violates process logic. Interviews are essential for evaluating candidates and making an informed decision; skipping them or conducting them after the decision risks poor hiring outcomes. This is a severe anomaly as it undermines the core purpose of the process.

- **Other Considerations**  
  Despite this flaw, Model 1 maintains a largely linear structure: `Post`  `Screen`  (`Decide` and `Interview` in any order)  `Onboard`  `Payroll`  `Close`. All activities are executed, and there are no skips or loops for critical steps like onboarding or payroll. The anomaly is primarily a temporal issue that can be corrected by adding an edge from `Interview` to `Decide`.

#### Anomalies in Model 2
- **Anomaly 1: Lack of Precedence between Screen and Interview**  
  Model 2 has edges from `Post` to both `Screen` and `Interview`, meaning interviews can occur before screening. This is inefficient, as screening should filter unqualified candidates before investing time in interviews. While less severe than deciding without interviews, it still deviates from good practice.

- **Anomaly 2: Optional Payroll via Exclusive Choice**  
  The `xor_payroll` operator allows either `Payroll` or a `skip` (silent transition). Skipping payroll is a critical error, as employees must be added to the payroll system for legal and operational reasons (e.g., compensation, benefits). This anomaly fundamentally violates process integrity and could lead to compliance issues.

- **Anomaly 3: Loop Onboarding**  
  The `loop_onboarding` operator permits repeating the `Onboard` activity multiple times. While onboarding may involve multiple tasks, repeating the entire onboarding process for a single hire is unusual and could indicate redundant work or errors.

- **Other Considerations**  
  Model 2 correctly enforces `Interview` before `Decide`, which is a positive aspect. However, the combination of multiple anomalies—especially the optional payroll—makes it less aligned with the normative process.

#### Which Model More Closely Aligns with the Normative Process?
**Model 1** more closely aligns with the normative Hire-to-Retire process. Although it has a severe anomaly in the order of `Interview` and `Decide`, this can be fixed with a single modification (adding an edge from `Interview` to `Decide`). In contrast, Model 2 has three anomalies: interview before screening, optional payroll, and loop onboarding. The ability to skip payroll in Model 2 is particularly egregious, as it breaks a mandatory step. Thus, Model 1 retains the essential sequence and activities without introducing skips or unnecessary loops, making it easier to correct and more representative of the standard process.

**Justification:**  
- Model 1 requires only one change to achieve correctness, while Model 2 needs multiple structural adjustments (e.g., enforcing screen before interview, removing the payroll skip, and simplifying the onboarding loop). This makes Model 1 a better baseline for the Hire-to-Retire workflow, as it minimizes deviations from the expected logic and ensures all critical activities are performed.
