## 1. Case Duration Analysis

| Case ID | Start Date | End Date | Total Duration | Duration (Hours) | Complexity | Region | Status |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|--------|--------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00 | 2024-04-01 10:30 | 1.5 hours | 1.5 | Low | A |  Normal |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05 | 2024-04-02 11:00 | 25.92 hours | ~26 | Medium | B |  **SLOW** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10 | 2024-04-03 09:30 | 48.33 hours | ~48 | High | A |  **VERY SLOW** |

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### **Performance Issue Summary:**

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Slowest Case** | Case 2005: 77 hours (32x slower than Case 2001) |
| **Average Duration (Low Complexity)** | 1.46 hours |
| **Average Duration (Medium Complexity)** | 26 hours |
| **Average Duration (High Complexity)** | 62.7 hours |
| **Performance Gap** | High-complexity claims take **43x longer** than low-complexity claims |

---

### **Root Cause #1: Claim Complexity**  PRIMARY DRIVER

**Evidence:**
- **Low Complexity (Cases 2001, 2004):** 1.5 hours average
- **Medium Complexity (Case 2002):** 26 hours
- **High Complexity (Cases 2003, 2005):** 62.7 hours average

**Pattern Identified:**
High-complexity cases trigger multiple sequential "Request Additional Documents" events:
- Case 2003: 2 document requests (11:00 AM and 5:00 PM same day)
- Case 2005: 3 document requests (spanning 3 days: Apr 1 @ 11:30 AM  Apr 2 @ 5:00 PM  Apr 3 @ 3:00 PM)

**Root Cause Explanation:**
- High-complexity claims require more extensive documentation and verification
- Adjuster workflows appear to be iterative, requesting documents in batches rather than comprehensive upfront requests
- Long gaps between requests (24+ hours) suggest either waiting for customer responses or adjuster review cycles

---

### **Root Cause #2: Regional Performance Disparity**  SECONDARY DRIVER

**Evidence:**

| Region | Cases | Avg Duration (hours) | Complexity Mix |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **A** | 2001, 2003 | 24.9 hours | Low (1.5h), High (48h) |
| **B** | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 17.8 hours avg* | Low (1.4h), Medium (26h), High (77h) |

*Note: Region B contains the critical outlier (Case 2005)*

**Pattern Identified:**
Region B shows more volatile performance, handling all three complexity levels but with:
- Significantly worse handling of High-Complexity claims
- Adjuster Lisa (Region B) manages Cases 2002 & 2005 with multiple document requests
- More pronounced gaps in processing timelines

**Root Cause Explanation:**
- **Region A (Adjuster Mike):** Cleaner workflow; even high-complexity Case 2003 shows more structured document requests
- **Region B (Adjuster Lisa):** Appears to lack standardized processes for complex claims, leading to fragmented document requests
- Regional resource availability/workload may differ

---

### **Root Cause #3: Resource Allocation & Adjuster Efficiency**  TERTIARY DRIVER

**Resource Performance:**

| Adjuster | Cases | Avg Duration | Document Requests | Pattern |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Adjuster_Mike** (Region A) | 2001, 2003 | 24.75 hours | 2 (structured) | Methodical |
| **Adjuster_Lisa** (Region B) | 2002, 2004, 2005 | 25.4 hours | 4 total (fragmented) | Reactive |

**Pattern Identified:**
- **Adjuster_Lisa:** Handles Cases 2002 (1 request), 2004 (0 requests), 2005 (3 requests)
  - Case 2005: Requests span 3 days with irregular intervals
  - Suggests poor planning or coordination with claimants
  
- **Adjuster_Mike:** Handles Cases 2001 (0 requests), 2003 (2 requests)
  - Both requests for Case 2003 occur within same day
  - More efficient batch processing

**Root Cause Explanation:**
- Adjuster_Lisa may lack training/resources for high-complexity claim management
- No standardized templates or upfront document checklists
- Possible workload imbalance causing reactive (rather than proactive) follow-ups

## 3. Correlation Matrix: Attributes vs. Duration

| Factor | Correlation with Duration | Severity |
|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| **High Complexity** | Very Strong (+43x longer) |  Critical |
| **Multiple Document Requests** | Very Strong (+48-75 hours) |  Critical |
| **Region B + High Complexity** | Strong (+77 hours) |  Critical |
| **Adjuster_Lisa + High Complexity** | Strong (+77 hours) |  High |
| **Long gaps between requests** | Strong (24+ hour delays) |  High |
| **Manager_Bill (approval)** | Moderate (appears in slow cases) |  Moderate |

---

## 4. Mitigation Strategies

### **Strategy 1: Complexity-Based Routing & Upfront Documentation**  HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Problem Addressed:** Multiple sequential document requests (Root Cause #1)

**Implementation:**
1. **Create complexity-based intake checklists:**
   - Low: 3 mandatory documents
   - Medium: 7 mandatory documents
   - High: 12 mandatory documents + pre-assessment call

2. **Implement upfront collection at submission:**
   - Use automated system to collect documents at claim submission time
   - Reduce downstream "Request Additional Documents" activities

3. **Expected Impact:**
   - Case 2003: 48 hours  ~12 hours (75% reduction)
   - Case 2005: 77 hours  ~18 hours (77% reduction)

---

### **Strategy 2: Regional Process Standardization**  HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem Addressed:** Region B inconsistency (Root Cause #2)

**Implementation:**
1. **Audit Adjuster_Lisa's workflow:**
   - Document decision-making process for multiple requests
   - Identify training gaps vs. workload issues

2. **Implement standardized templates for document requests:**
   - Batch all outstanding requests in single communication
   - Add timeline expectations to requests

3. **Cross-region best practices:**
   - Apply Adjuster_Mike's methodology (Region A) to Region B
   - Weekly sync meetings between regions

4. **Expected Impact:**
   - Case 2005: 77 hours  ~40 hours (48% reduction)
   - Case 2002: 26 hours  ~15 hours (42% reduction)

---

### **Strategy 3: Resource Development & Workload Balancing**  MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Problem Addressed:** Adjuster efficiency disparity (Root Cause #3)

**Implementation:**
1. **Training program for high-complexity claims:**
   - Focused training for Adjuster_Lisa
   - Role-playing scenarios for complex claim assessment

2. **Workload analysis:**
   - Check if Adjuster_Lisa is overburdened
   - Consider redistributing high-complexity cases temporarily

3. **Performance monitoring:**
   - KPI: Average case duration by adjuster
   - KPI: First-request document completeness rate

4. **Expected Impact:**
   - Adjuster_Lisa's complex cases: -30% duration
   - Reduced adjuster fatigue and errors

---

### **Strategy 4: Manager Escalation Optimization**  LOWER PRIORITY

**Problem Addressed:** Approval bottleneck timing

**Observation:**
- Manager_Ann (Cases 2001, 2002, 2004): Fast turnaround
- Manager_Bill (Cases 2003, 2005): Long delays before approval
  - Case 2003: 21+ hour gap before approval
  - Case 2005: 40+ hour gap before approval

**Implementation:**
1. Check Manager_Bill's availability/workload
2. Consider dynamic manager assignment based on case priority

## 5. Quick Wins (Immediate Actions)

| Action | Timeline | Expected Benefit |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Issue standardized high-complexity intake checklist | Week 1 | Reduce document request iterations by 50% |
| Shadow Adjuster_Lisa for one high-complexity case | Week 1-2 | Identify specific process gaps |
| Implement batch document request policy | Week 2 | Eliminate fragmented requests (save ~15-20 hours) |
| Create complexity routing logic in system | Week 3-4 | Ensure optimal resource assignment |

---

## 6. Conclusions

**Primary Issue:** High-complexity claims are processed reactively with fragmented, multi-day document requests rather than comprehensive upfront collection.

**Key Findings:**
1. Complexity is the **dominant driver** of duration (43x variance)
2. Region B shows inefficiencies in **high-complexity claim management** (Case 2005: 77 hours)
3. **Adjuster_Lisa** would benefit from training/support on complex cases
4. **Multiple sequential document requests** add 40-65 hours to processing time

**Recommended Priority Order:**
1.  Implement upfront documentation collection for high-complexity claims
2.  Standardize "Request Additional Documents" workflow across regions
3.  Provide targeted training to Adjuster_Lisa
4.  Monitor Manager_Bill's approval turnaround times

**Expected Outcome:** Reduce average high-complexity case duration from 62.7 hours to ~20-25 hours (60-70% improvement).
