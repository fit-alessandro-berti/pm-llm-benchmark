Based on the event log provided, there appears to be multiple sensitive attributes being tracked and potentially used in a clinical decision-making process. Here's my interpretation of what these could be:

**Attributes with potential to impact decision making:**

1. **case:citizen: True**
   - This attribute is directly tied to healthcare decisions such as treatment options (Treatment successful) and discharge status (Discharge), indicating that it may influence the outcomes for a patient.

2. **case:gender:** 
   - Gender can affect health outcomes, particularly when considering certain diseases like cancer (underlying condition).

3. **concept:name: Treatment**
   - This attribute likely involves treatment decisions made by healthcare professionals such as medications, interventions, or procedures. It may influence how doctors approach treatments for a patient.

4. **resource:** Doc. Low
   - Resource utilization can impact cost and efficiency, thus affecting the overall cost of care for patients. It's possible that resources used in lower-quality settings could affect decisions on treatment outcomes.

5. **concept:name: Discharge**
   - The decision to discharge a patient from hospital is based on clinical criteria which may vary depending on the conditions. This attribute likely impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare systems in providing timely care.

**Attributes with potential for impact on patients' privacy or confidentiality:** 

- **case:citizen: True**
  - Being "Citizen" can also lead to various benefits such as insurance coverage, but it could be used to make decisions about treatment based on patient history which might be sensitive if it includes health conditions and treatments.

- **concept:name: Expert Examination**
  - An examination conducted by an expert is confidential and protected against misuse, but could be used in medical decision-making processes that involve identifying a specific diagnosis or treatment plan. 

In summary, the event log seems to contain several attributes (citizen status, gender, treatment, discharge, and some resource utilization) that are potentially sensitive due to their potential impact on clinical outcomes or privacy considerations.

Please note: I've interpreted this based on what appears in the provided event log as there could be more nuances or additional contexts not directly visible here.
