Okay, I need to solve this DuckDB SQL query problem. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the task is to find the top K variants of a process based on an event log. Each variant is the sequence of activities in a case ordered by timestamp. Then, return all events from cases that are part of these top K variants.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the event_log table. The columns are case_id, activity, timestamp. Each row represents an event in a case, with the activity name and when it happened.

The first step is to get the ordered sequence of activities per case. So for each case_id, we need to sort the events by their timestamp and then list the activities in that order. How to represent this sequence in SQL?

In DuckDB, I can use the array_agg function with order by. So for each case_id, group the activities and order them by timestamp. That would give the variant sequence for each case. So step 1 is to create a subquery or CTE that groups by case_id and creates an ordered array of activities.

Once I have each case's activity sequence, I need to group all cases by their sequence to count how many cases are in each variant. Then, rank these variants by their count to find the top K.

But how to group by the sequence? Since sequences can be arrays, we can group by the array column. But wait, DuckDB allows grouping by array columns? Or maybe the array_agg returns a list, and grouping by that list's content. Hmm, perhaps yes.

So step 2: group the results of step 1 by the activity sequence, count the number of case_ids in each group. Then order them in descending order of count and select the top K.

Once I have the top K variants, I need to find all case_ids that belong to these variants. Then filter the original event_log table to include only events from those case_ids.

Putting this all together, the steps would be:

1. For each case_id, get the ordered activity list (variant).
2. Group these variants and count frequencies, then select top K.
3. Get the list of case_ids in these top K variants.
4. Select all events where case_id is in that list.

Let me think about how to structure the SQL query.

First, step 1: create a CTE called case_sequences that has case_id and the sequence of activities. So:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
)

Then, step 2: get the variant counts and select the top K. Let's say K is a parameter, but in SQL we can use LIMIT K. But note that if multiple variants have the same count as the K-th one, we might have more than K rows. However, the problem says "top K by frequency", so perhaps just use LIMIT K.

variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
)

Wait, but how to handle K here? The problem says "top K variants", but the user would need to specify K. So the query would need to have a placeholder here, maybe using a parameter. But DuckDB allows setting variables. Alternatively, the query can have a placeholder for K.

Assuming K is a given number.

Then, step 3: get all case_ids whose variant is in the variants selected in step 2. Wait, no. The variant_counts CTE gives the variants and their counts, but to get the case_ids that belong to those variants, we need to join case_sequences with variant_counts. Or perhaps filter case_sequences where variant is in (select variant from variant_counts).

Wait, the top K variants are those with highest counts, so the variant_counts CTE contains those variants. Then, the case_sequences table has each case_id mapped to its variant. So to get all case_ids that belong to any of the top K variants, we can select case_id from case_sequences where variant in (select variant from variant_counts). Then, use these case_ids to filter the original event_log.

Wait, but the variant_counts CTE's variants are the top K, and each case_sequence has a variant. So joining case_sequences with variant_counts on variant would give all cases in those variants.

Alternatively:

top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant 
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            variant,
            COUNT(case_id) AS count
        FROM case_sequences
        GROUP BY variant
        ORDER BY count DESC
        LIMIT K
    )
)

Then, in step 3: select all case_ids from case_sequences where variant in (select variant from top_variants). That gives all case_ids that belong to any of the top K variants.

Once we have those case_ids, filter the original event_log to include those case_ids.

Putting it all together:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(case_id) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT K
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id;

Wait, but the variant_counts CTE in this structure is not a subquery in the top_cases CTE. Wait, in variant_counts, the subquery would be the top K variants. Then top_cases selects all cases whose variant is in those top K variants. Then, the final join selects all events in those cases.

But in the variant_counts CTE, we have to select the variants. So in the variant_counts CTE, the first step is to group case_sequences by variant, count the number of case_ids in each variant, then take the top K.

Wait, but in the case_sequences CTE, each row is a case_id and its variant. Then, grouping by variant gives the count. So the variant_counts CTE would have each variant and the count.

So the top K variants are the top rows from variant_counts.

But how to get the variants in variant_counts? The variant_counts CTE would have two columns: variant and count.

Wait, in the variant_counts CTE:

SELECT variant, COUNT(case_id) AS count ... groups all case_sequences rows by variant. So each variant has a count.

So in the top_cases CTE, selecting case_sequences.case_id where variant IN (select variant from variant_counts) would get all cases that belong to any of the top variants.

But variant_counts is already the top K variants, so variant_counts contains exactly the top K variants, so in top_cases we select all case_ids whose variant is in variant_counts.

But how to structure that.

Wait, variant_counts is the top K variants. variant_counts has variant and count. So in the top_cases CTE, we can select all case_ids from case_sequences where their variant is in the variant_counts.variants.

So:

top_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)

But variant_counts is the result of selecting top K variants, so this would work.

But wait, if variant_counts is the result of selecting variants and counts, ordered by count descending, limited to K, then the IN clause would get all variants in those top K.

Now, the problem says that we need to return all events from the original log that belong to cases in the top K variants.

The above query should work.

Now, possible edge cases: what if two different variants have the same activity sequence? Probably not, because the variant is defined as the ordered sequence, so the array should be the same. But DuckDB's array_agg with order by should correctly capture the ordered sequence.

But how to handle the grouping on the arrays? Grouping by the variant array.

In DuckDB, grouping by arrays is allowed? Let me check. DuckDB's documentation says that arrays can be used in GROUP BY clauses. So if variant is an array, then grouping by it should work.

Now, the K parameter. The problem says "top K variants by their frequency". So the user should be able to set K. But in SQL, we need to hardcode it. Alternatively, use a macro or parameter. However, the prompt says "construct a DuckDB SQL query", so assuming that K is a placeholder. So in the query, we can use LIMIT K, where the user would substitute K with a number. So the query would have:

ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10 (or whatever K is)

Now, the query structure:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10  -- assuming K=10
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT case_id
    FROM case_sequences
    WHERE variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts)
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN top_cases tc ON el.case_id = tc.case_id;

Wait, but COUNT(*) in variant_counts instead of COUNT(case_id). Since each case_sequences row has one case_id, COUNT(*) would be same as COUNT(case_id), correct.

But in case_sequences, each row is a case_id, so COUNT(*) is the number of cases per variant. Correct.

But wait, the case_sequences CTE groups by case_id, so each row in case_sequences is a unique case_id. Then, when grouping by variant in variant_counts, each row in case_sequences contributes one row to the count. So COUNT(*) gives the number of case_ids per variant, which is correct.

Now, the top_cases CTE selects all case_ids that belong to any of the top K variants, then the final select joins event_log with these case_ids.

But in DuckDB, using IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts) may have issues if the variant is an array, but I think it's possible. Alternatively, we can join on variant.

Wait, variant_counts is a CTE that has variants. So in case_sequences, we have each case's variant. So perhaps:

top_variants AS (
    SELECT variant
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            variant,
            COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM case_sequences
        GROUP BY variant
        ORDER BY count DESC
        LIMIT K
    )
),
top_cases AS (
    SELECT cs.case_id
    FROM case_sequences cs
    INNER JOIN top_variants tv ON cs.variant = tv.variant
)
...

That way, joining on the variant. That may be more efficient, especially if using IN is not feasible.

But in DuckDB, comparing arrays in IN clauses might be okay. But if two arrays have same elements but different order, they are considered different. Which is correct here.

Alternatively, using = operator on arrays.

Wait, but in SQL, arrays can be compared with = operator? Or do we need to use some array comparison function?

Testing in DuckDB:

If I have two arrays, say [1,2] and [1,2], then [1,2] = [1,2] returns true. But in the context of IN clauses, let's see.

Suppose in variant_counts, variant is an array. Then, in the top_variants CTE, selecting variant and then in top_cases checking if cs.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM ...), but if variant is an array, how does equality work?

I think in DuckDB, arrays can be compared for equality. So if the variant is an array, then joining on variant should work.

But perhaps using an INNER JOIN is better than IN, especially for large datasets.

So modifying the query:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant = vc.variant;

This way, we can avoid creating another CTE (top_cases) by joining directly. This might be more efficient.

Wait, this way, the joins:

Join event_log with case_sequences on case_id, which gives the variant of each event's case. Then, join that with variant_counts on variant. Since variant_counts has the top K variants, this would filter only those events whose case_id belongs to a top variant.

Yes, that's a better approach. Because:

- case_sequences has each case_id and its variant.
- variant_counts has the top K variants (and their count)
- So joining case_sequences with variant_counts on variant would get all the cases that belong to those variants.
- Then, joining event_log with those case_ids gives all events in those cases.

This way, we can eliminate the need for the top_cases CTE. So the query becomes:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant = vc.variant;

This should work. But wait, because variant_counts is a CTE that has variants and their counts. The INNER JOIN on cs.variant = vc.variant would filter all rows where the case's variant is in the top K.

This way, the query is shorter and perhaps more efficient.

Testing this logic:

For each event in event_log, we get its case_id. We join with case_sequences to get the variant for that case. Then, we check if that variant exists in the variant_counts CTE (which contains the top K variants), thus filtering only those events from cases in top K.

Yes. And since variant_counts is derived from case_sequences, all variants in variant_counts are present in case_sequences.

This approach should work. Let me check for possible errors.

Another thing to consider: the array_agg function orders the activities by timestamp. That's correct. So the variant is the ordered list of activities per case.

Now, possible performance issues. For very large datasets, creating the case_sequences CTE may be expensive, but the problem is to construct the correct SQL query regardless of performance.

Another point: in the variant_counts CTE, the GROUP BY variant groups all case_sequences rows with same variant. Since each row in case_sequences is a case_id and variant, this counts the number of case_ids per variant. Correct.

Now, the final SELECT uses INNER JOIN with case_sequences and variant_counts. So each event in the result is from a case whose variant is in the top K.

This seems correct.

Another thing to check: the LIMIT in variant_counts. If two variants have the same count as the K-th one, but we use LIMIT K, then they won't be included unless we use WITH TIES. However, the problem states "top K variants by their frequency", which usually means the K highest, even if there are ties. If there are ties, the problem statement might require arbitrary selection among tied variants. But the problem says "top K variants by their frequency", which may imply that if multiple variants have the same count as the K-th one, we include all of them. However, standard SQL's LIMIT doesn't do that. The problem's instruction says "top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)", so the instruction says to return the top K, which in most contexts means pick the first K after ordering, excluding ties. So using LIMIT K is acceptable here.

Putting it all together, the final SQL query should be:

WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10  -- Replace 10 with K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant = vc.variant;

Wait, but the problem requires to return all events from the original log that belong only to cases in top K variants. This query should do that.

Testing this query:

Assume K=1. The variant with the most cases. All events in cases with that variant are returned.

Another edge case: a case with a single event. The variant would be a single-element array, and that's okay.

Now, in DuckDB, the array_agg function's order is determined by the ORDER BY clause. So using ORDER BY timestamp ensures that the sequence is correct.

Now, the problem says "timestamp: The datetime of when the activity took place." So events in a case are ordered by timestamp to get the sequence.

Therefore, the array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) correctly captures the ordered sequence.

Another thing: the problem requires that the query returns the events in the original order. However, the final SELECT doesn't have an ORDER BY clause, but the problem doesn't specify that. The query should return all events, in any order. But if needed, perhaps the user can add an ORDER BY clause, but the problem doesn't specify that.

So this query should satisfy all the requirements.

But wait, the problem says "return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants." So the final result should have all columns from the original event log. The SELECT el.* does that.

So I think this query should work.

Now, to check again:

1. case_sequences: each case_id's activity sequence. Correct.
2. variant_counts: top K variants. Correct.
3. Joining event_log with case_sequences and variant_counts filters only events from case_ids in top K variants. Correct.

Yes. This should be the correct approach.
</think>

To address the problem, we need to identify the **top K process variants** in a given event log and then return **all events** that belong to **cases following these variants**. A process variant is defined as the **ordered sequence of activities** in a case, sorted by timestamp.

We'll approach this in four key steps:

---

###  Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Extract Activity Sequences per Case**  
   For each `case_id`, we'll aggregate the `activity` values in the order of their `timestamp` using `array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`. This gives us the **variant** (i.e., the ordered activity sequence) for each case.

2. **Count Variants and Identify Top K**  
   We'll group by the `variant` to count how many `case_id`s follow each variant. Then, we'll sort by count in descending order and **limit to the top K variants**.

3. **Filter Cases by Top K Variants**  
   Using the top K variants, we'll find all `case_id`s that follow those variants.

4. **Return Events from Matching Cases**  
   Finally, we'll return all events from the original `event_log` table that belong to those filtered cases.

---

###  Final SQL Query

```sql
WITH case_sequences AS (
    SELECT 
        case_id,
        array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant
    FROM event_log
    GROUP BY case_id
),
variant_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        variant,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM case_sequences
    GROUP BY variant
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 10  -- Replace 10 with your desired K
)
SELECT el.*
FROM event_log el
INNER JOIN case_sequences cs ON el.case_id = cs.case_id
INNER JOIN variant_counts vc ON cs.variant = vc.variant;
```

---

###  Notes

- **`array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp)`** ensures that the activity sequence is correctly ordered by time within each case.
- **`variant_counts`** identifies the top K variants by frequency.
- **`INNER JOIN`** between `event_log`, `case_sequences`, and `variant_counts` ensures we only return events from cases that follow the top K variants.
- **Replace `10` with the actual value of K** in the `LIMIT` clause to get the desired number of top variants.

---

###  Example Use Case

If you set `K = 3`, the query will return all events from the top 3 most frequent process variants in your event log.

This query is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints, including correct ordering of activities and filtering by variant frequency.
