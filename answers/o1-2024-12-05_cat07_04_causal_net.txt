The visualization is a representation of a business process model using a Petri net–style notation, showing how different tasks in a workflow connect to each other and how control-flow decisions are made. Each box with a label (like **a**, **b**, **c**, **d**, **e**, **f**, **g**, **h**, and **z**) represents an activity or step in the process. The small black circles (often called tokens or places in Petri nets) and the solid lines connecting them represent the possible paths that process instances can follow as they move from one activity to another.

Here’s a breakdown of what you’re seeing:

1. **Activities (rectangles with text):**  
   - **a: register request**  
   - **b: examine thoroughly**  
   - **c: examine casually**  
   - **d: check ticket**  
   - **e: decide**  
   - **f: reinitiate request**  
   - **g: pay compensation**  
   - **h: reject request**  
   - **z: end**
   
   Each of these is a step that can be performed in the business process. For instance, the process starts at **a** ("register request") and will eventually end at **z** ("end").

2. **Arrows and lines connecting activities:**  
   These lines show the flow of the process. After one activity completes, the process may proceed to one or multiple next activities. The pattern of branching and merging lines indicates how control is passed from one step to the next.

3. **Black dots on the lines (tokens/places):**  
   These dots indicate potential "states" or conditions that must be met before proceeding. In traditional Petri nets, they represent places that can hold tokens, and the movement of tokens from place to place indicates the progress of a process instance. In more conceptual diagrams, these dots can also be understood as the control logic points where decisions are made.

4. **Gateways or Splits/Joins (shown in the inset):**  
   The box in the lower-right corner shows the different types of routing behaviors used in the diagram:
   - **XOR-split:** Chooses exactly one out of multiple possible paths.
   - **AND-split:** Proceeds along all paths in parallel.
   - **OR-split:** Proceeds along some subset of the available paths (one or more, but not necessarily all).
   
   Similarly, for merging flows, we have:
   - **XOR-join:** Synchronizes one chosen incoming path.
   - **AND-join:** Waits until all incoming paths have completed before continuing.
   - **OR-join:** Waits for a sufficient number of incoming paths (one or more) before proceeding.

5. **Control-Flow Logic:**
   By combining these splits and joins, the model can express complex control logic. For example, after registering a request (**a**), the process might branch out into multiple tasks (such as **b**, **c**, **d**, or **f**) based on conditions or availability. Later in the process, these parallel or alternative paths might converge into a decision step (**e**), and based on that decision, the process flows into either **g** ("pay compensation") or **h** ("reject request") before reaching the final step **z**.

In short, the top part of the figure is a specific example of a business process with multiple steps, choices, and parallel activities. The lower-right portion is a legend explaining the different types of decision and merging nodes used in these kinds of diagrams. This visualization shows how an initially simple process (registering a request) can branch out into various examination and decision activities, and then converge again to produce a final outcome.
