This is a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram showing an endtoend orderfulfillment process across four departments: Sales, Production, Procurement, and Warehouse. Each department is a horizontal lane; the whole figure is the overall process.

**1. Sales lane**

- Starts with a timer event “Monday morning.”
- **Check order for completeness.**  
- **Check if customer is in the database.**  
  - If not, “Add customer to the database”; the customer record is stored.
- Once the customer is confirmed, Sales **sends order details** to the next departments.
- After the product is later sent (message back from Warehouse), Sales **drafts the invoice** and the process in this lane ends.

**2. Production lane**

- Triggered by a message event “Order details arrive.”
- **Plan production.**
- XOR gateway: either proceed or wait for material status.
- Intermediate event “Material not faulty” indicates materials are fine.
- **Manufacture product** activity.
- Ends with an intermediate event “Product complete,” and a message is sent to the Warehouse lane.

**3. Procurement lane**

- Also starts on “Order details arrive.”
- Contains a **Material Compensation Subprocess**:
  - **Order materials** (call activity).
  - Possibility to **return material** (loop/backflow if unsuitable).
- After materials are acquired, **Check materials**:
  - If materials are faulty, an **order cancellation** end event can occur.
  - If acceptable, a signal is sent back that materials are OK (used in Production).

**4. Warehouse lane**

- Triggered when Production signals “Product complete.”
- **Send product** to the customer.
- Ends with “Product sent” message back to Sales, enabling invoicing.

Dashed message flows connect the lanes, representing information exchange (order details, product completion, product sent). Solid sequence flows show the internal steps within each lane.
