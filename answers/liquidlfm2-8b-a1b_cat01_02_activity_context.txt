Certainly! Below is the revised event log with carefully renamed activities that clarify the contextual differences observed from repetition within each case. The renamed activities reflect the timing, assignee, or justification behind each occurrence, improving traceability and understanding.

### Justification of Activity Renaming:

- **`Request Initiation`  distinguished by context**  
  Reused multiple times; ambiguous without specification. By renaming as `Request Initiation`, the activity remains consistent and clearly denotes the start phase, understood across all cases.

- **`Document Verification`  varied by type and assignee**  
  Initially seen twice under generic `Verify Documents`. Renamed to:  
  - `Document Verification (Post-UI)` when tied to digital submission and Agent processing.  
  - `Document Verification (Identity Check)` for the physical ID scan and related in-person process in _C003_.  
  This distinction reflects the method (digital vs physical) and department(s) involved.

- **`Call Customer`  contextual by suit (remote vs out-of-site)**  
  Renamed as `Customer Call (Missing Docs)`, `Customer Call (Out of Site)`, and `Customer Follow-up Call` captures intent: initial outreach, urgent on-site follow-up, and confirmation call. These names reflect timing and risk context, aiding workflow sequencing.

- **`Adjust Account`  differentiated by cause and timing**  
  Used twice, but in _C002_, it follows a call; in _C003_, it follows a branch contact. Renamed:  
  - `Internal Account Adjustment` reflects systemic correction triggered remotely.  
  - `Account Adjustment (Post-Account Discrep)` links adjustment directly to the customer-specific issue mentioned at call.

These renamed activities enable clearer tracing of decision points, responsibility transitions, and process branches—critical in complex, multi-contact financial support workflows.
