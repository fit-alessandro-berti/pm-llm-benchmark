Let's first analyze the total resolution time for each ticket, then examine activity patterns to identify root causes of delays, and finally highlight insights and recommendations.

### 1. **Calculating Total Resolution Time per Ticket**

| Case ID | Start (Receive Ticket)  | End (Close Ticket)       | Total Duration        |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 101      | 2024-03-01 08:00       | 2024-03-01 10:15         | **2h 15m**            |
| 102      | 2024-03-01 08:05       | 2024-03-02 09:15         | **~25h 10m (~1 day)** |
| 103      | 2024-03-01 08:10       | 2024-03-01 09:30         | **1h 20m**            |
| 104      | 2024-03-01 08:20       | 2024-03-02 08:30         | **~24h 10m (~1 day)** |
| 105      | 2024-03-01 08:25       | 2024-03-03 09:30         | **~49h 5m (~2 days)** |

**Tickets 102, 104, and 105** stand out with cycle times around a day or more, considerably longer than the ~1–2 hours of cases 101/103.

### 2. **Potential Root Causes Contributing to Delays**

**A. Presence of Escalation Steps**
- **Case 105:** Has escalation at 10:00 (Mar 1) and a second investigation only *next day* at 14:00 (Mar 2).   
- **Case 102:** Escalation at 11:30 followed by a delay until investigation at 14:00, then a further delay to resolution the next day.
- **Case 104:** *No explicit escalation step*, yet long duration—indicating other factors.

**Implication:**  
Escalations correlate with multi-day duration in cases 102 & 105, likely causing delay due to hand-offs or queue times for Level-2 support.

**B. Long Waiting Times Between Key Activities**

- **Case 104:**  
  - Assigned to agent at 09:30.  
  - *Investigation starts at 13:00* — **3.5 hours later**.  
  - *Resolution* doesn’t occur until **next day at 08:00** (~19 hours after investigation start), indicating prolonged problem-solving or waiting.

- **Case 102:**  
  - After escalation at 11:30, investigation begins only at 14:00 (2.5 hours gap).  
  - Then, resolution wait overnight (~19 hours later).

- **Case 105:**  
  - Escalated at 10:00, then **no activity until 14:00 next day** (28 hours gap), a major contributor to delay.

**C. Escalation and Re-Investigation Loops**

- Particularly noticeable in **case 105**, where after an initial investigation and escalation, a *second investigation* occurs the following day, further delaying resolution.

### 3. **Summary, Explanations, and Recommendations**

#### **A. How identified factors cause longer cycle times**
- **Escalations introduce delays:** Because issues beyond Level-1 scope await availability of specialized personnel, creating bottlenecks.
- **Long queuing before escalation investigations:** Indicates Level-2 resources are stretched, priorities misaligned, or handovers lack urgency.
- **Delays before initial investigation:** As in case 104, Level-1 agents sometimes wait several hours before investigating, possibly due to workload management challenges or process inefficiencies.
- **Secondary investigations prolong resolution:** Additional rounds of investigation post-escalation (case 105) increase complexity and wait times.

#### **B. Insights to address performance bottlenecks**

1. **Optimize escalation workflows:**  
   - Prioritize tickets as soon as escalated to Level-2.
   - Introduce SLA targets for Level-2 response/start investigation times.
   - Explore whether all escalations are necessary or if better Level-1 training could reduce escalation rate.

2. **Reduce idle times pre- and post-escalation:**  
   - Encourage Level-1 to begin investigations promptly upon assignment (limit pre-investigation delays).  
   - Implement automated notifications to alert agents/customers when next action lags.

3. **Resource management:**  
   - Ensure sufficient Level-2 staffing during peak ticket volumes.  
   - Cross-train Level-1 teams on more complex issues to reduce escalations.  

4. **Process improvement:**  
   - Review necessity and timing of re-investigations (like in case 105).  
   - Create clearer escalation criteria and better documentation transfer to avoid redundant investigations.

5. **Continuous monitoring:**  
   - Track time between key steps, especially ReceiveInvestigation and EscalationInvestigation.  
   - Flag tickets with excessive idle time for managerial attention.

### **Conclusion:**

The prolonged cycle times predominantly relate to escalation-related delays and waiting times before or after investigation activities. Focusing on streamlining escalation handling, reducing queue times through better resource allocation, and process improvements can help decrease ticket resolution times significantly.
