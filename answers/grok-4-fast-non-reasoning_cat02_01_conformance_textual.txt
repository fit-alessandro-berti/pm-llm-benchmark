### Analysis of Event Log Cases

Below, I evaluate each case against the normative process description. The process starts with "Receive order" followed by "Check inventory." For sufficient inventory, the expected sequence is: Authorize Payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. For insufficient inventory, it branches to: Cancel order  Close order. Key constraints include:
- Check inventory must precede Authorize Payment and any fulfillment activities.
- Authorize Payment must precede Package items.
- Package items must precede Ship order.
- Ship order must not occur after Cancel order.
- Close order must be the final activity.
- No fulfillment activities (e.g., Package, Ship) after Cancel order.

I interpret ambiguities conservatively: e.g., Authorize Payment before full inventory confirmation is not allowed, as the description states it "only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known." Cancellation implies no further fulfillment, with no extraordinary circumstances mentioned.

#### Case 1
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.
- **Compliance**: This matches the sufficient inventory flow exactly. No violations.

#### Case 2
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Package items  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations**:
  - Package items occurs before Authorize payment, violating the constraint that "Package items should only occur after authorization" and that payment authorization must precede packaging since items are only prepared once payment is approved and inventory is confirmed.
  - This also implies fulfillment (packaging and shipping) proceeded without prior payment approval, which the description deems illogical.
- **Overall**: Deviates from the normative process.

#### Case 3
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Cancel order  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations**:
  - Ship order occurs after Cancel order, violating the constraint that "it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as... shipping)" after cancellation, and explicitly that "Ship order should... never after a cancellation."
  - Authorize payment occurs before Cancel order, which is problematic: while the description allows Authorize Payment after Check inventory in the sufficient path, proceeding to cancellation after authorization suggests inventory was deemed insufficient post-authorization, but the process requires branching directly to Cancel after Check if insufficient—no intermediate fulfillment steps like authorization are described or implied in the insufficient path.
  - The sequence mixes sufficient (Authorize Payment) and insufficient (Cancel) paths inconsistently, without clear resolution.
- **Overall**: Deviates from the normative process.

#### Case 4
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order.
- **Compliance**: This matches the insufficient inventory flow exactly (Receive  Check  Cancel  Close). No violations.

#### Case 5
- Sequence: Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Ship order  Close order.
- **Violations**:
  - Ship order occurs without a preceding Package items activity, violating the constraint that "Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped." Shipping without packaging skips a required preparation step in the sufficient inventory flow.
  - The sequence implies fulfillment but omits packaging, which the description presents as an essential part of the normal progression.
- **Overall**: Deviates from the normative process.

### Summary of Deviating Cases
- **Cases that violate the normative process**: 2, 3, and 5.
- **Compliant cases**: 1 and 4.
These violations highlight deviations from the specified sequences and constraints, potentially indicating errors in process execution, such as premature fulfillment or skipped steps.
