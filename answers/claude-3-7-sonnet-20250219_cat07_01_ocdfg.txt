# Business Process Flow Diagram for Order and Procurement Management

This visualization is a detailed process flow diagram depicting various interconnected business processes related to procurement, sales, and inventory management. The diagram shows multiple workflows with their respective data volumes and processing times.

## Key Entry Points (Top of Diagram):
- **PurchaseRequisitionItem** (2.0M objects)
- **SalesOrderItem** (8.5M objects)
- **PurchaseOrderItem** (5.0M objects)
- **VendorInvoiceItem** (1.2M objects)
- **ReturnOrderItem** (0.8M objects)

## Major Process Flows:

### Requisition Process:
- Starts with PurchaseRequisitionItem
- Proceeds to "Create Requisition" (9.0M overall volume)
- Moves to "Approve Requisition" (5.7M overall)
- Branches to "Send Order" and "Check Stock"

### Sales Order Process:
- Begins with SalesOrderItem
- Goes through "Create Order" (8.5M overall)
- Continues to "Pack Goods" (2.0M)
- Then "Ship Goods" (1.8M)
- Followed by "Confirm Delivery" (1.7M)
- Ends with "Close Order" (1.7M)

### Additional Processes:
- "Process Return" (0.8M) for handling returns
- "Approve Payment" (1.5M)
- "Create Invoice" (2.0M)

The diagram uses different colored flow lines to represent different process paths, with response times indicated in milliseconds between steps (ranging from 10ms to 800ms). Each process node includes its overall processing volume, and the workflow terminates at multiple "End" nodes.

This visualization effectively illustrates the complex relationships between different business documents and their processing steps in an enterprise resource planning system.
