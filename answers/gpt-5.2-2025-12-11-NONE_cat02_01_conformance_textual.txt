### Expected (“normative”) control-flow constraints distilled from the text
- **Start:** Every case starts with **Receive order**.
- **Inventory gate:** **Check inventory** must happen **before** any fulfillment/payment decision steps (at least before **Authorize payment**, **Package items**, **Ship order**, **Cancel order**).
- **If fulfilled (sufficient inventory):**  
  **Receive  Check  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order**
- **If canceled (insufficient inventory):**  
  **Receive  Check  Cancel order  Close order**
- **No fulfillment after cancellation:** After **Cancel order**, you should **not** see **Package items** or **Ship order**.
- **Close order is final** in all cases.

## 1) Which cases violate the process?
Violations occur in **Cases 2, 3, and 5**.  
Cases **1 and 4** conform.

## 2) Explanation of violations

### Case 1 — **Conforms**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  Package  Ship  Close  
- Matches the “sufficient inventory” happy path exactly.

### Case 2 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  **Package**  **Authorize**  Ship  Close  
Violations:
- **Packaging before payment authorization.** The description states that **“Package items” should only occur after authorization and before shipping**. Here, **Package items** occurs *before* **Authorize payment**.

(Everything else—inventory checked before these steps, close last—is fine.)

### Case 3 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Cancel**  **Ship**  Close  
Violations:
- **Shipping after cancellation.** The text is explicit that **“Ship order” should … never [occur] after a cancellation** and that after cancellation it’s illogical to continue with fulfillment activities.
- Additionally, the cancellation branch is supposed to be **Check  Cancel  Close**; inserting **Ship order** breaks that cancellation scenario.

(Authorization before cancel is not explicitly forbidden by the text, but it becomes moot once cancellation happens; the hard violation is shipping after cancel.)

### Case 4 — **Conforms**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Cancel  Close  
- Matches the “insufficient inventory” path exactly.
- No fulfillment activities after cancellation, and close is final.

### Case 5 — **Violates**
Sequence: Receive  Check  Authorize  **Ship**  Close  
Violations:
- **Shipping without packaging.** The normative flow requires **Package items** to occur **after authorization and before shipping**, because “items must be prepared before they can be shipped.” Case 5 skips **Package items** entirely.
