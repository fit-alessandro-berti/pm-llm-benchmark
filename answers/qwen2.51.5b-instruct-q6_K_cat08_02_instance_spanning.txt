### 1. Identifying Instance-Spanning Constraints and Their Impact

#### a) Shared Cold-Packing Stations:
- **Identification:** By analyzing the event log for activities involving picking, packing, and QC stations (e.g., `ORD-5002` for Express orders using Station C2), we can observe that multiple standard order picks are competing for these limited stations.
  
  - **Impact Metrics:** 
    - **Waiting Time:** Calculate the average waiting time at each shared station to assess whether there is contention or delays due to resource availability issues. For instance, if Order-5001 and Order-5002 both use Station C2 at different times, we can measure their combined impact.
  
  - **Differentiation:** The waiting time is a *between-instance* metric because it involves multiple instances of the same activity (Station C2 usage) that are mutually exclusive in this context.

#### b) Shipping Batches:
- **Identification:** Observing cases where orders destined for the same region are batched together, e.g., `ORD-5003` and subsequent orders to West Region.
  
  - **Impact Metrics:** Measure the time taken for completing batches (e.g., using an event log aggregator like Event Storm) or wait times due to waiting for other orders in the same batch. If a batch of Express orders waits for Standard orders, it contributes to overall delays.

#### c) Priority Handling of Express Orders:
- **Identification:** Recognizing that 'Express Shipping' must be prioritized over standard pick-ups and packing.
  
  - **Impact Metrics:** Calculate waiting times or queue lengths due to priority handling. If a Cold-Packing station is occupied by an express order, it prevents the standard order from moving ahead.

#### d) Hazardous Material Limits:
- **Identification:** Identifying instances where more than 10 orders containing hazardous materials are simultaneously undergoing packing and quality checks (e.g., `ORD-5001` with both Standard Orders and Hazardous Materials).
  
  - **Impact Metrics:** Track the time spent waiting for shared stations or the risk of concurrent processing due to resource allocation.

#### e) Dynamic Resource Allocation:
- **Identification:** Recognizing that resources like cold packing stations may not always be available in their entirety, necessitating dynamic resource management.
  
  - **Impact Metrics:** Calculate the utilization rates and identify bottlenecks. If a station is only 50% utilized while other stations are fully occupied, it suggests an imbalance.

### 2. Analyzing Constraint Interactions

#### Interaction Analysis:
- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations vs Express Orders:**
  - *Scenario:* Both Express and Standard Orders require Station C2.
    - *Impact:* If an express order is queued up for Station C2 when a standard order is already using it, the express order will have to wait. This creates an instance-spanning constraint because both orders are waiting at the same resource.

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations vs Hazardous Materials:**
  - *Scenario:* More than 10 hazardous material orders are queued up.
    - *Impact:* If one of these hazardous material orders is unable to proceed due to limited station availability, it blocks other orders in the queue. This interdependence between hazard detection and resource allocation highlights an instance-spanning constraint.

- **Shared Cold-Packing Stations vs Batched Shipping:**
  - *Scenario:* Express shipping orders are batched together with Standard Orders.
    - *Impact:* If a standard order is queued up for Station C2 while an express order is in the process of receiving, it creates a waiting time scenario that depends on the queue state (express or standard).

### 3. Developing Constraint-Aware Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Dynamic Resource Allocation Policies
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shared Cold-Packing Stations.
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Implement a dynamic allocation policy where stations can switch between standard and express orders based on availability. For instance, if Station C2 is occupied by an express order with Hazardous Materials or Standard Orders, it will prioritize either Express or Standard pick-ups to ensure resource distribution.

#### Strategy 2: Revised Batching Logic
- **Constraint Addressed:** Shipping Batches.
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Modify the batching logic such that batches form based on actual demand rather than static criteria. For example, if a region has higher volumes of Express Orders, batch them together to optimize delivery routes and minimize waiting times.

#### Strategy 3: Improved Scheduling Rules
- **Constraint Addressed:** Priority Handling.
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - Introduce more sophisticated scheduling rules that consider the order's priority (express or standard) along with regulatory limits. For instance, if an express order has higher urgency but uses up limited Cold-Packing resources, prioritize a Standard Order over it until available stations are free.

#### Strategy 4: Capacity Adjustments
- **Constraint Addressed:** Hazards Material Limits.
- **Changes Proposed:**
  - If exceeding hazardous material limits is detected (e.g., multiple orders with Hazardous Materials), temporarily suspend the processing of new hazardous materials. When resources become available, resume processing but monitor for future overloads.

### 4. Simulation and Validation

#### Simulation Models:
- Use event log data to create a simulation model that captures resource usage, waiting times, and regulatory limits.
- Incorporate historical constraints (e.g., past congestion at Cold-Packing stations) into the model to predict potential bottlenecks during peak seasons.
  
#### Monitoring Metrics:
- Track key KPIs such as end-to-end delivery time, queuing times for shared resources, compliance with hazardous material limitations, and throughput rates. These metrics will help in evaluating the effectiveness of each optimization strategy.

### 5. Monitoring Post-Implementation

- **Key Metrics:**
  - End-to-end delivery times.
  - Queuing times at Cold-Packing stations (express vs standard).
  - Compliance rate with Hazardous Material limits.
  - Throughput rates and average order time for various types of orders.

- **Process Mining Dashboards:**
  - Real-time dashboards visualizing the state of shared resources, waiting times, and regulatory compliance will help in continuous monitoring. For example, a dashboard showing resource utilization at Cold-Packing stations can highlight bottlenecks.
  
By developing these strategies that explicitly address instance-spanning constraints, we aim to optimize the order fulfillment process by reducing congestion, improving resource allocation, and ensuring efficient use of limited resources like Cold-Packing Stations, thereby increasing throughput and meeting delivery deadlines effectively.
