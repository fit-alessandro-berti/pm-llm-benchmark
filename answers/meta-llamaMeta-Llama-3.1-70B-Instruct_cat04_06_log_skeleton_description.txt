Analyzing these declarative constraints reveals a complex decision-making process involving multiple stakeholders and conditional logic. Below is a simplified overview of the process, highlighting key steps and decision points.

**Process Overview**

The process appears to be related to expense declaration and approval, involving multiple stakeholders, including employees, supervisors, budget owners, and administrators.

**Key Steps and Decision Points**

1. **Declaration Submission**: An employee submits an expense declaration, which may be saved or submitted for approval. ( Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE )
2. **Initial Approval**: The expense declaration is reviewed by a pre-approver, who may reject it or send it for further approval. ( Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER )
3. **Administrative Review**: The expense declaration is reviewed by an administrator, who may reject it or send it for approval. ( Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION )
4. **Supervisor Approval**: The expense declaration is reviewed by a supervisor, who may reject it or approve it. ( Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR )
5. **Budget Owner Approval**: The expense declaration is reviewed by a budget owner, who may reject it or approve it. ( Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER )
6. **Final Approval**: If approved by the supervisor and budget owner, the expense declaration is marked as final. ( Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR )
7. **Payment Handling**: The approved expense declaration is sent for payment handling. ( Payment Handled )

**Decision Points**

* If the pre-approver rejects the expense declaration, it is marked as rejected. ( Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER )
* If the administrator rejects the expense declaration, it is marked as rejected. ( Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION )
* If the supervisor rejects the expense declaration, it is marked as rejected. ( Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR )
* If the budget owner rejects the expense declaration, it is marked as rejected. ( Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER )
* If the expense declaration is missing required information, it is marked as rejected. ( Declaration REJECTED by MISSING )

**Constraints and Rules**

* Multiple submissions are allowed, but only one can be approved. ( Always Before and Always After constraints )
* An expense declaration cannot be approved and rejected at the same time. ( Never Together constraints )
* Specific sequences of activities are required, such as submission before approval. ( Directly-Follows Constraints )

**Notes and Observations**

* The process involves multiple stakeholders and requires approval from multiple parties
