Alright – let’s go step-by-step to diagnose the performance issues in the "Insurance Claims Processing" event log you provided.

---

## **Step 1 – Determining total case durations**

We'll calculate the lead time for each case as:

\[
\text{Lead Time} = \text{(Time of Close Claim)} - \text{(Time of Submit Claim)}
\]

**Lead time per case:**

| Case ID | Submit Claim Time    | Close Claim Time     | Duration             |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **2001** | 2024-04-01 09:00    | 2024-04-01 10:30    | **1.5 hours**        |
| **2002** | 2024-04-01 09:05    | 2024-04-02 11:00    | **~1 day 2 hours**   |
| **2003** | 2024-04-01 09:10    | 2024-04-03 09:30    | **~2 days 0.5 h**    |
| **2004** | 2024-04-01 09:20    | 2024-04-01 10:45    | **1.4 hours**        |
| **2005** | 2024-04-01 09:25    | 2024-04-04 14:30    | **~3 days 5 hours**  |

---

**Observation:**  
Cases **2002, 2003, and 2005** are significantly longer than quick resolutions in **2001 and 2004**.

---

## **Step 2 – Identifying patterns in slow cases**

### **Case 2001 and 2004 (Fast Cases)**
- **Region:** A (2001) and B (2004)
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Requests for Additional Documents?** No – process flows straightforwardly from "Evaluate Claim"  "Approve Claim"
- **Lead Time:** Around 1.5 hours.

### **Case 2002 (Moderate Delay)**
- **Region:** B
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Requests for Additional Documents:** 1 occurrence
- Delay: Requesting additional documents on day 1, approval the next day.
- Performance Impact: Medium complexity likely triggers a document request, causing overnight delay.

### **Case 2003 (Significant Delay)**
- **Region:** A
- **Complexity:** High
- **Requests for Additional Documents:** 2 occurrences (same day), but approval only on **next day afternoon**
- **Observation:** The delay between additional document requests and approval spans over a full day after final request. Payment and closure happen the morning after approval.

### **Case 2005 (Longest Delay)**
- **Region:** B
- **Complexity:** High
- **Requests for Additional Documents:** **3 separate events** over three days
- **Delay Cause:** Multiple rounds of document requests stretch process to over 3 days before approval.
- Payment and closure done same afternoon after approval, so waiting time is in pre-approval phase.

---

## **Step 3 – Attribute correlation analysis**

### 1. **Complexity**
- **Low complexity:** No extra documents  closure in under 2 hours.
- **Medium complexity:** Usually 1 document request  ~ 1 extra day.
- **High complexity:** Multiple document requests, prolonged pre-approval wait times  2–3+ days.
- **Conclusion:** High complexity is *strongly correlated* with length due to repeated document requests.

### 2. **Region**
- **Region A:** Case 2001 (low complexity) is quick; case 2003 (high complexity) takes 2+ days.
- **Region B:** Case 2004 (low) is quick; case 2002 (medium) moderate delay; case 2005 (high) longest.
   Region alone isn’t the main cause – complexity level has bigger weight, but in **Region B with high complexity**, the delays are worst.
- Secondary Note: Region B’s high-complexity workflow (Case 2005) involves more *rounds* of document requests than Region A’s high-complexity workflow (Case 2003).

### 3. **Resources**
- Claims Adjuster:  
  - **Adjuster_Mike** handles Region A high complexity: 2 document requests.  
  - **Adjuster_Lisa** (Region B) handles both medium and high complexity – medium complexity  1 doc request; high complexity  3 doc requests.
  - **Inference:** Adjuster_Lisa may request more document rounds than Adjuster_Mike for similar complexity classification  possible training/communication inefficiency causing repeated loops.
- Managers and finance roles appear not to be bottlenecks – delays are before approval.

---

## **Step 4 – Root causes of long durations**

**Main causes identified:**
1. **High claim complexity** leads to multiple document request cycles before approval.
2. **Repetition of document requests (multiple occurrences)** is the largest driver of delay – likely due to incomplete submissions or unclear guidance to claimant.
3. **Adjuster behavior differences:** Adjuster_Lisa (Region B) high-complexity cases experience more document request rounds than Adjuster_Mike (Region A).
4. **Region B + High complexity** combination seems worst-case scenario in this small sample.

---

## **Step 5 – Proposed explanations**

- **High complexity = more verification**: More supporting evidence from claimant is needed, and due to complexity, these may be requested in stages instead of one consolidated request.
- **Communication inefficiencies**: Possible lack of clear initial checklist means multiple follow-ups.  
- **Adjuster style/training**: Adjusters might vary in thoroughness upfront — some gather all extra documentation needs in one go, others issue requests piecemeal.
- **Region-based process differences**: Region B’s workflows for high complexity may be less streamlined or require separate approvals for each document set.

---

## **Step 6 – Mitigation strategies**

1. **Front-load documentation requirements**: Provide claimants with a comprehensive list of all required documents at first request.
2. **Training for adjusters**: Standardize the approach across adjusters so that high-complexity claims are handled with fewer document request iterations.
3. **Process redesign for high complexity claims**:
   - Introduce *pre-evaluation checklists*
   - Use *parallel processing* where possible (gather docs and start part of assessment concurrently)
4. **Regional process harmonization**: Ensure Region B applies same methodology as Region A for high complexity, reducing rounds.
5. **KPI tracking**: Monitor “Number of Document Requests per Case” as an early warning signal.

## **Summary Table**

| Case ID | Duration       | Complexity | Region | Requests for Documents | Likely Cause |
|---------|---------------|------------|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| 2001    | 1.5 h          | Low        | A      | 0                      | None         |
| 2002    | 1 day 2 h      | Medium     | B      | 1                      | Moderate complexity, one doc request overnight delay |
| 2003    | 2 days 0.5 h   | High       | A      | 2                      | High complexity, multiple doc requests |
| 2004    | 1.4 h          | Low        | B      | 0                      | None         |
| 2005    | 3 days 5 h     | High       | B      | 3                      | High complexity, repeated doc requests, Region B adjuster style |

---

 **Final takeaway:** Long lead times are strongly correlated with **high complexity**, but made worse by **multiple document request loops**, with **Adjuster_Lisa in Region B** showing the greatest delays for these cases.  
**Solution:** Better upfront requirements gathering, harmonized workflow, and targeted adjuster training.
