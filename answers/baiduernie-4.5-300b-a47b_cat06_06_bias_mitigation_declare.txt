Here’s the updated `declare_model` dictionary with added constraints to mitigate bias in the loan application review process, along with explanations for each new constraint:

### **Updated `declare_model` with Bias-Mitigating Constraints**

### **Rationale for Added Constraints**
1. **`existence` (Added `BiasMitigationCheck` and `ManualReview`)**  
   - Ensures that fairness checks and manual reviews are mandatory activities in the process, preventing their omission.

2. **`responded_existence` (Bias checks after sensitive attribute checks)**  
   - Ensures that any check for sensitive attributes (`CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, `CheckApplicantAge`) must be followed by a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring fairness before proceeding.

3. **`coexistence` (Manual review with sensitive decisions)**  
   - Ensures that decisions involving minority applicants (`Approve_Minority`, `Reject_Minority`) must coexist with a `ManualReview`, reducing automated bias.

4. **`response` (Bias checks after sensitive attribute checks)**  
   - Enforces that sensitive attribute checks must trigger a `BiasMitigationCheck`, ensuring no immediate bias in decision-making.

5. **`succession` (Decisions must follow bias checks)**  
   - Ensures that `FinalDecision` cannot occur without a prior `BiasMitigationCheck`, enforcing fairness.

6. **`noncoexistence` (Prevent quick rejections without bias checks)**  
   - Prevents `QuickReject` from occurring if `CheckApplicantRace` is present, ensuring no direct discrimination.

7. **`nonsuccession` (Prevent direct sensitive attribute  rejection)**  
   - Ensures that `Reject` cannot immediately follow `CheckApplicantRace`, `CheckApplicantGender`, or `CheckApplicantAge`, forcing indirect paths that allow fairness checks.

### **How These Constraints Reduce Bias**
- **Indirect pathways for sensitive decisions**: By forcing `BiasMitigationCheck` or `ManualReview` between sensitive attribute checks and decisions, the model prevents immediate discriminatory outcomes.
- **Mandatory fairness checks**: Constraints like `responded_existence` and `succession` ensure that bias mitigation is not skipped.
- **Co-occurrence with manual review**: Decisions involving sensitive groups must include human oversight (`ManualReview`), reducing automated bias.
- **Blocked direct discrimination**: `nonsuccession` prevents direct links from sensitive attributes to rejections, ensuring fairer evaluation.

These constraints collectively enforce a fairer loan application process by discouraging discriminatory patterns while preserving the original process structure.
