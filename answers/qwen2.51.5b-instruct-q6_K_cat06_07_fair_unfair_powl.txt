Let's model the hiring process at GlobalTeq Solutions using a POWL model. We'll create two different models to illustrate how unfair biases can be introduced and then removed.

### Model 1: Potentially Unfair Model

In this model, we have an XOR branching point between two paths:
- Path A (Cultural Fit Check)
- Path B (Community Affiliation Check)

Both branches lead to a standard cultural fit evaluation but with subtle differences in their evaluations due to the community affiliation check.

**Model Representation:**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL

# Define nodes
path_a = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck(), CommunityAffiliationCheck()])
path_b = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[SkillAssessment(), ManagerialReview()])
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[path_a, path_b])

# Define edges and operators
initial_data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
cultural_fit_evaluation = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")
community_affiliation_check = Transition(label="CommunityAffiliationCheck")

# Connect the nodes
initial_data_check.to(skill_assessment)
skill_assessment.to(managerial_review, operator=Operator.XOR)
managerial_review.to(cultural_fit_evaluation)
cultural_fit_evaluation.to(community_affiliation_check)
community_affiliation_check.to(loop_node)

# Create the root and set up the order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_data_check, skill_assessment, cultural_fit_evaluation, community_affiliation_check])
root.order.add_edge(initial_data_check, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, managerial_review)
root.order.add_edge(managerial_review, cultural_fit_evaluation)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_evaluation, loop_node)

# Show the model
print(root.to_dot())
```

### Model 2: Fair Model

In this model, we ensure that all applicants undergo a standard cultural fit evaluation without any special branch for community affiliation. This removes the potential for unfair bias.

**Model Representation:**

```python
from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL

# Define nodes
skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
managerial_review = Transition(label="ManagerialReview")
cultural_fit_evaluation = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

# Connect the nodes in a loop to ensure all processes are executed sequentially
loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[skill_assessment, cultural_fit_evaluation, managerial_review])

# Define edges and operators
initial_data_check = Transition(label="DataCompletenessCheck")
data_completeness_check_to_skill_assessment = Transition(label="SkillAssessment")
data_completeness_check_to_cultural_fit_evaluation = Transition(label="CulturalFitCheck")

# Connect the nodes in the loop
initial_data_check.to(skill_assessment)
skill_assessment.to(cultural_fit_evaluation, operator=Operator.XOR)
cultural_fit_evaluation.to(managerial_review)

# Create the root and set up the order
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[initial_data_check, data_completeness_check_to_skill_assessment, cultural_fit_evaluation, managerial_review])
root.order.add_edge(initial_data_check, data_completeness_check_to_skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(data_completeness_check_to_skill_assessment, skill_assessment)
root.order.add_edge(skill_assessment, cultural_fit_evaluation)
root.order.add_edge(cultural_fit_evaluation, managerial_review)

# Show the model
print(root.to_dot())
```

### Explanation:

1. **Model 1 (Unfair Model):**
   - **Path A:** Cultural Fit Check -> Community Affiliation Check -> Cultural Fit Evaluation
   - **Path B:** Skill Assessment -> Managerial Review

2. **Model 2 (Fair Model):**
   - **Path:** Data Completeness Check -> Skill Assessment -> Cultural Fit Check -> Managerial Review

In the fair model, all applicants follow a standard path through the process. In the unfair model, there is an XOR choice point between paths A and B that introduces an implicit bias: Community Affiliation Checks tend to give slight advantages, leading to potential unfair hiring practices.

By setting up the models this way, we can clearly see how introducing or removing such biases can affect the overall fairness of the hiring process.
