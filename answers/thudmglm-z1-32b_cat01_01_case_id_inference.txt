The events can be grouped into **three distinct cases** based on **patient_age**, **gender**, and the **logical workflow** of their hospital journey. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Case 1: 45-year-old Male (ER Patient)**  
**Key Attributes**: Age=45, Gender=M, Department (ER  Radiology  ER)  
**Events (1, 4, 7, 12, 15)**  
1. **Event 1**: Registered in ER.  
2. **Event 4**: Underwent initial triage in ER (Triage Code 3).  
3. **Event 7**: Received X-ray imaging for the left leg.  
4. **Event 12**: Final doctor consultation confirmed a hairline fracture.  
5. **Event 15**: Discharged from ER with an outpatient clinic follow-up.  

**Workflow**:  
ER Registration  Triage  Imaging  Diagnosis  Discharge.

### **Case 2: 62-year-old Female (ER Patient with Minor Infection)**  
**Key Attributes**: Age=62, Gender=F, Department usage (ER  Lab  ER)  
**Events (2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17)**  
1. **Event 2**: Registered in ER.  
2. **Event 5**: Triage in ER (Triage Code 2).  
3. **Event 8**: Lab test ordered for blood work.  
4. **Event 10**: Lab test completed (normal results).  
5. **Event 11**: Doctor diagnosed a minor infection.  
6. **Event 14**: Prescribed antibiotics.  
7. **Event 17**: Discharged from ER with pharmacy pickup follow-up.  

**Workflow**:  
ER Registration  Triage  Lab Work  Diagnosis  Prescription  Discharge.

### **Case 3: 28-year-old Male (Surgical Patient)**  
**Key Attributes**: Age=28, Gender=M, Department segregation (Surgery  Recovery)  
**Events (3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18)**  
1. **Event 3**: Registered in Surgery (scheduled knee surgery).  
2. **Event 6**: Pre-surgery doctor consultation.  
3. **Event 9**: Prepared for general anesthesia.  
4. **Event 13**: Underwent arthroscopy surgery.  
5. **Event 16**: Recovered post-surgery (stable condition).  
6. **Event 18**: Discharged to physiotherapy.  

**Workflow**:  
Surgery Registration  Pre-Surgery Check  Anesthesia Prep  Surgery  Recovery  Discharge.

### **Key Reasoning for Grouping**  
1. **Patient Demographics**: Unique combinations of *age* and *gender* (45M, 62F, 28M) ensured distinct cases.  
2. **Temporal Sequence**: Activities aligned chronologically (e.g., discharge must follow treatment).  
3. **Department Workflow**:  
   - ER patients (Cases 1 & 2) followed triage  diagnostics  discharge.  
   - Surgical patient (Case 3) progressed through surgery-specific steps.  
4. **Activity Logic**: No interleaving of incompatible activities (e.g., post-surgery recovery only applies to Case 3).  

This grouping adheres to hospital process best practices and logical patient workflows.
