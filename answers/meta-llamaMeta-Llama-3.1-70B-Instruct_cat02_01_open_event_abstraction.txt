Event abstraction is a crucial concept in process mining, which involves the analysis of event logs to gain insights into business processes. By abstracting events, you can reduce the complexity of event logs and process models, making them more manageable and easier to comprehend. Here's how event abstraction can be effectively utilized to improve the readability and manageability of complex process models derived from event logs:

**Why event abstraction is necessary**

Event logs can contain a large number of events, making it challenging to analyze and understand the underlying process. By abstracting events, you can:

1. **Reduce complexity**: Simplify the process model by reducing the number of events, making it easier to visualize and analyze.
2. **Improve readability**: Make the process model more comprehensible by hiding unnecessary details and highlighting important aspects.
3. **Enhance scalability**: Enable the analysis of large event logs by reducing the number of events to a manageable level.

**Event abstraction techniques**

Several event abstraction techniques can be employed to achieve these benefits:

1. **Event aggregation**: Group related events into a single, higher-level event.
2. **Event filtering**: Remove irrelevant or redundant events from the event log.
3. **Event clustering**: Group similar events into clusters, representing a higher-level event.
4. **Event pattern discovery**: Identify frequent patterns in the event log and abstract them into a higher-level event.
5. **Event hierarchy creation**: Create a hierarchy of events, where higher-level events aggregate lower-level events.

**Best practices for effective event abstraction**

To effectively utilize event abstraction, follow these best practices:

1. **Define goals**: Clearly define the goals of the analysis to determine the level of abstraction required.
2. **Choose the right technique**: Select the most suitable event abstraction technique based on the event log characteristics and analysis goals.
3. **Evaluate and refine**: Iterate between abstracting events and evaluating the resulting process model to ensure the desired level of complexity reduction and readability improvement.
4. **Use visualization**: Leverage visualization techniques, such as process maps or heat maps, to facilitate understanding of the abstracted process model.
5. **Validate with stakeholders**: Validate the abstracted process model with stakeholders to ensure it accurately represents the business process.

**Tools and software supporting event abstraction**

Several tools and software support event abstraction, including:

1. **ProM** (Process Mining Platform): Offers various event abstraction plugins.
2. **myInvenio**: Supports event abstraction and provides features for process model simplification.
3. **Celonis**: Offers event abstraction capabilities
