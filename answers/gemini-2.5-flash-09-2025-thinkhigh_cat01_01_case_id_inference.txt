This sequence contains three distinct patient journeys (cases), identifiable by the unique combinations of patient demographics (age, gender) and the logical progression of their activities through the hospital departments.

Here are the inferred case groupings:

---

### Case A: Patient 45 (M) – ER Visit (Hairline Fracture)

This case describes an emergency room visit, triage, diagnosis via imaging, consultation, and subsequent discharge.

### Case B: Patient 62 (F) – ER Visit (Minor Infection)

This case involves an emergency room visit requiring triage, lab tests, consultation based on results, prescription, and discharge.

### Case C: Patient 28 (M) – Scheduled Surgery (Knee Arthroscopy)

This case represents a scheduled surgical procedure, including registration directly into surgery, consultation, preparation, operation, recovery, and final discharge.

| Event ID | Timestamp | Activity | Department | Age | Gender | Notes |
