The figure is laid out as a two–layered timeline.

Across the bottom is a horizontal time axis, with major ticks at “20000125 01:00:00,” “20060909 02:00:00” and “20130424 02:00:00.”

Three event types are drawn as horizontal reference lines and labelled on the right: the top line is “Send Fine,” the line midway down the page is “Insert Fine Notification,” and the bottom line is “Send for Credit Collection.”

The top half of the plot is filled with a dense “barcode” of thin grey vertical strokes between the left and right time limits, indicating many individual “Send Fine” occurrences over the 13year span.

Below the “Insert Fine Notification” line, pale red and grey lines connect downwards to the “Send for Credit Collection” line. These lines fan out to form triangular shapes pointing downwards, showing the sequences and lead times from inserted notifications to eventual referral to credit collection. The red shading highlights some of these transitions; the density of the lines increases toward the later years of the period.
