This transformation converts the raw system log into a structured process mining event log. We define a "case" based on the specific document or artifact the user is actively working on, grouping sequential interactions related to that single artifact together.

## Logic Explanation

### Case Identification
Cases (Process Instances) were defined primarily around **specific artifacts (documents/emails)** being manipulated. A new case is initiated when the user begins working on a document or task clearly distinct from the previous one, identified by the `Window` title in the log.

1.  **Case\_001 (Quarterly\_Report.docx):** Starts with the initial focus, interrupted by other tasks, and resumed/completed at the end of the log.
2.  **Case\_002 (Document1.docx):** Initial editing session.
3.  **Case\_003 (Email):** Handling a specific email interaction (Open, Reply, Send).
4.  **Case\_004 (Report\_Draft.pdf):** A review/annotation task.
5.  **Case\_005 (Budget\_2024.xlsx):** Focused data entry/update task.
6.  **Case\_006 (Document1.docx Resumption):** Even though `Document1.docx` was previously worked on (Case\_002), the user performed an unrelated task (Budgeting) in between. Returning to this document to insert a reference suggests a distinct, integrated sub-process flow, justifying a new case ID for analytical clarity regarding this specific insertion activity.

The low-level `SWITCH` events were *not* logged as explicit activities but served as temporal markers indicating the boundary between cases.

### Activity Naming
Raw actions were abstracted into higher-level, standardized process steps:

*   **FOCUS/CLICK (initial):** Mapped to a descriptive start activity (e.g., `Start Document Editing` or `Communication Task Start`).
*   **TYPING/Keys:** Generalized to `Content Creation` or `Data Entry` (used for Excel figures).
*   **SAVE:** Standardized to `Save Document`.
*   **SCROLL/HIGHLIGHT:** Grouped into review activities like `Review Content` or specific interaction like `Annotate Document`.
*   **CLICK (Reply/Send):** Abstracted into communicative actions like `Prepare Reply` or `Send Communication`.
*   **CLOSE:** Standardized to `Close Document`.
