1. Based on the given event log, cases 102 and 104 have significantly longer total resolution times compared to the others. Case 102 took approximately 1 day and 1 hour (from 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-02 09:15), while case 104 took around 1 day and 13 hours (from 2024-03-01 08:20 to 2024-03-02 08:30). In contrast, cases 101, 103, and 105 took less than 2 hours, 1 hour and 15 minutes, and 1 day and 12 hours, respectively.

2. Potential root causes of the performance issues include:
   - Escalation to Level-2 agents: Both cases 102 and 104 required escalations to Level-2 agents, which could indicate that the complexity of the tickets was higher than average or that Level-1 agents lacked the necessary skills to resolve them.
   - Long waiting times between activities: In case 102, there was a significant delay (approximately 3.5 hours) between the assignment to a Level-1 agent and the escalation to a Level-2 agent. Similarly, case 104 took around 3 hours and 30 minutes from the assignment to a Level-1 agent to the investigation of the issue.
   - Delayed investigation and resolution steps: In case 104, the investigation of the issue took around 3 hours and 30 minutes, which is longer than the other cases. Additionally, the resolution of the ticket was delayed until the next day, suggesting that there might have been a lack of resources or additional challenges in resolving the issue.

3. These identified factors could be leading to increased cycle times due to the following reasons:
   - Escalation to Level-2 agents: The need for escalation may indicate that the process requires better training for Level-1 agents or more efficient triaging to assign tickets to the appropriate support team from the beginning.
   - Long waiting times between activities: These delays may be due to a lack of resources, inefficient processes, or communication gaps between teams. Improving communication, streamlining processes, and ensuring adequate resources can help reduce these waiting times.
   - Delayed investigation and resolution steps: The delayed investigation and resolution could be due to a lack of knowledge or resources, which may require additional training for support agents or the allocation of more specialized resources to handle complex tickets.

Based on these insights, the following recommendations could address the performance bottlenecks:
- Implement more effective triaging processes to assign tickets to the appropriate support team from the beginning, reducing the need for escalations.
- Improve communication between teams and streamline processes to minimize waiting times between activities.
- Provide additional training for support agents to handle more complex tickets or allocate more specialized resources to manage such tickets.
- Regularly review and analyze event logs to identify any recurring patterns or factors contributing to increased cycle times, allowing for continuous process improvement.
