To optimize the process described in the pseudo-BPMN, we can introduce several enhancements that leverage automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics. Here's a detailed redesign proposal:

### 1. **Automation of Standard Tasks**

**Task A: "Receive Customer Request"**
- **Enhancement:** Implement an automated request intake system using a chatbot or a web form that captures all necessary details upfront. This reduces manual data entry and speeds up the initial step.

**Task B1: "Perform Standard Validation"**
- **Enhancement:** Use automated validation rules to check the completeness and correctness of the request. This can be done using predefined criteria and machine learning models to identify common issues.

**Task C1: "Credit Check"**
- **Enhancement:** Integrate with external credit scoring services to automate the credit check process. This reduces the time taken for manual verification.

**Task C2: "Inventory Check"**
- **Enhancement:** Use real-time inventory management systems to automatically check stock levels. This ensures that inventory data is always up-to-date and reduces the need for manual checks.

**Task D: "Calculate Delivery Date"**
- **Enhancement:** Implement an automated delivery date calculation system that considers current workload, inventory levels, and historical data to provide accurate delivery estimates.

### 2. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**

**Task B2: "Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis"**
- **Enhancement:** Use a dynamic resource allocation system that assigns the request to the most suitable team member based on their current workload and expertise. This can be done using a skill-based routing algorithm.

**Task E1: "Prepare Custom Quotation"**
- **Enhancement:** Implement a collaborative platform where multiple team members can work on the quotation simultaneously. This reduces the time taken to prepare complex quotations.

### 3. **Predictive Analytics**

**Gateway (XOR): "Check Request Type"**
- **Enhancement:** Use predictive analytics to classify requests as standard or custom based on historical data and request patterns. This can help in routing requests more efficiently and reducing the time taken for manual classification.

**Gateway (XOR): "Is Customization Feasible?"**
- **Enhancement:** Implement a predictive model that assesses the feasibility of customization based on historical data, current resource availability, and other relevant factors. This can help in making more informed decisions and reducing the time taken for feasibility analysis.

### 4. **New Decision Gateways and Subprocesses**

**New Gateway (XOR): "Is Request Urgent?"**
- **Purpose:** Introduce a new decision gateway to prioritize urgent requests. This can help in reducing turnaround times for critical requests.
- **Tasks:**
  - **If Yes:** Route to a fast-track subprocess that involves expedited validation, credit check, and inventory check.
  - **If No:** Continue with the standard process.

**New Subprocess: "Fast-Track Process"**
- **Purpose:** Create a dedicated subprocess for handling urgent requests. This subprocess can involve expedited validation, credit check, and inventory check, followed by immediate approval and final invoice generation.

### 5. **Impact on Performance, Customer Satisfaction, and Operational Complexity**

**Performance:**
- **Improvement:** Automation of standard tasks and dynamic resource allocation can significantly reduce turnaround times. Predictive analytics can help in making more informed decisions and reducing the time taken for manual classification and feasibility analysis.

**Customer Satisfaction:**
- **Improvement:** Faster turnaround times and more accurate delivery estimates can enhance customer satisfaction. The ability to handle urgent requests more efficiently can also improve customer experience.

**Operational Complexity:**
- **Increase:** Introducing automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics can increase operational complexity initially. However, the long-term benefits in terms of efficiency and customer satisfaction can outweigh the initial complexity.

### Conclusion

By leveraging automation, dynamic resource allocation, and predictive analytics, the redesigned process can significantly reduce turnaround times and increase flexibility in handling non-standard requests. The introduction of new decision gateways and subprocesses can further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. While the initial implementation may increase operational complexity, the long-term benefits in terms of performance and customer satisfaction can justify the investment.
