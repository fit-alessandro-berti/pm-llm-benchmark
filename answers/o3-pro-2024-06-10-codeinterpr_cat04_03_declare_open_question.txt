Below is a “walk-through” of the model from three complementary angles:  
(1) what the individual activities mean in day-to-day work,  
(2) how every DECLARE constraint moulds those activities into a coherent, auditable procedure, and  
(3) which underlying business goals and regulations the whole net appears to satisfy.

-------------------------------------------------
1. Activities in the life of a loan file
-------------------------------------------------
A  Receive Application – the file is opened; basic KYC and an application ID are created.  
B  Preliminary Credit Check – fast, automated scorecard used to decide whether to invest more effort.  
C  Gather Additional Documents – pay slips, tax returns, IDs, collateral pictures, etc.  
D  Assemble Loan Offer Package – produce a draft term sheet (amount, tenor, rates, collateral, covenants).  
E  Quality Assurance Review – second pair of eyes checks completeness, fraud indicators, sanction lists, policy deviations.  
F  Authorise Contract Terms – credit committee / underwriter signs off the draft as an official offer.  
G  Transfer Funds – payment engine releases money to customer account.  
H  Notify Customer – formal communication of approval, rejection, or “funds have been sent”.  
Z  Proceed Without Compliance – a forbidden activity representing willful bypass of policy.

-------------------------------------------------
2. Constraint-by-constraint interpretation
-------------------------------------------------
A. Cardinality / existence rules  
• existence(A) & existence(C) – at least one receipt of an application and at least one document-gathering step are compulsory in every case file.  
• exactly_one(B) – only one preliminary credit check may exist; prevents score-shopping or “rerunning until it passes”.  
• absence(Z) – compliance breaches must never be logged.  

B. Ordering rules that build the skeleton timeline  
• init(A) – “Receive Application” must be the very first event. Nothing can precede it.  
• response(AB) – every application receipt must eventually be followed by exactly one credit check. Guarantees no file languishes without the basic risk assessment.  
• succession(BC) – if a credit check happens, additional documents must follow, and vice-versa. This couples risk scoring with documentary proof.  
• precedence(EF) – an offer cannot be authorised before the quality team has reviewed it.  
• chainsuccession(ED) – immediately after QA passes, the offer package must be assembled next; eliminates the possibility of injecting unreviewed steps between QA and building the customer-visible offer.  
• chainprecedence(FB) – the moment contract terms are authorised, the credit check must have been the directly preceding event in the past, ensuring no late changes re-enter after approval.  
• chainresponse(DG) – once the offer package is created, the next recorded step must be the actual disbursement. Helps detect situations where a package is tampered with or stalls.  

C. Consistency / pairing rules  
• responded_existence(DE) – whenever an offer package is assembled, a Quality Assurance Review is guaranteed to exist somewhere in the trace.  
• coexistence(CF) – if extra documents are collected, the same case must at some point reach the authorisation desk. This prevents “document graveyards” that never conclude.  

D. Alternative-path safeguards  
• altresponse(GH) – every fund transfer must be followed by either the nominated target (“Notify Customer”) or some other permissible response, but *at least one* must occur, assuring the customer is told.  
• altprecedence(HG) – notification can only follow either a fund transfer or an alternative explicitly modelled step; stops the call-centre from promising money has been sent when it has not.  
• altsuccession(CE) – if documents are gathered, the process must eventually reach a QA review or an alternative stage laid out in future changes; provides flexibility yet forces closure.  

E. Negative constraints (things that must NOT coincide)  
• noncoexistence(G, A) – in no trace may funds be transferred in the same case where the application itself is still missing.  
• nonsuccession(H ! B) – after notifying the customer, the process must not revert and insert an additional credit check; prevents reopened scoring once the decision is disclosed.  
• nonchainsuccession(F ! H) – directly after authorising terms you are forbidden from jumping straight to notification; the chain has to go through the normal “funds transferred” milestone, protecting against prematurely telling the customer “it’s done”.

-------------------------------------------------
3. Why such a strict net?  Business & regulatory lens
-------------------------------------------------
1. Consumer-credit regulation (e.g., EU CCD / US Truth-in-Lending)  
   • Requires documented creditworthiness assessment before commitment  exactly-one(B) and response(AB).  
   • Mandates that disclosures match the finally authorised terms  chainprecedence(FB) + chainsuccession(ED).  

2. Anti-money-laundering (AML) / KYC  
   • Must collect and verify identity & income documents before disbursement  existence(C), succession(BC).  
   • Prohibits releasing funds before onboarding is complete  noncoexistence(G, A).  

3. Internal risk governance  
   • Four-eyes principle  precedence(EF) & responded_existence(DE).  
   • Immutable audit trail  exactly_one(B) and nonsuccession(H ! B) stop retroactive tampering.  

4. Customer-experience commitments  
   • Timely feedback after major milestones  altresponse(GH).  
   • No “black-hole” dossiers  coexistence(CF), altsuccession(CE).  

5. Operational efficiency  
   • Chains (<chain…>) enforce immediate next steps, reducing wait states.  
   • Negative chains prevent “shortcutting” that typically leads to rework.  

-------------------------------------------------
4. Combined effect in everyday practice
-------------------------------------------------
• A loan officer opens a file (A). The system will not allow them to trigger anything else first.  
• A single, system-triggered credit score (B) runs; they cannot manually “try again” after the outcome is locked.  
• If the score says “need more docs”, the officer must log C. The moment C is logged, the case is automatically placed in a queue that ultimately must reach F (coexistence).  
• QA (E) must sign off before any term sheet leaves the building; that sheet (D) must then be the *very next* event recorded, so if someone edits the docs in between, the constraint engine will flag a violation.  
• When the committee authorises (F), the log proves that the credit check is still the last risk event—no stale data.  
• Disbursement (G) comes right after the package; the payment engine refuses to start if the constraint monitor sees that any earlier step is missing or still open.  
• Finally, the customer notification (H) has to occur, and once it does, the file is effectively frozen for any further credit assessment.  

-------------------------------------------------
Take-away
-------------------------------------------------
The DECLARE model operates like an “elastic cage”: it allows different teams to work in parallel and in varying orders where that is harmless, yet it instantly detects or prevents sequences that could break law, policy, or customer trust. In highly regulated lending environments such as consumer loans, mortgages, or SME credit lines, such a network of existence, ordering, and prohibition rules is the quickest way to turn broad regulatory texts (“assess creditworthiness before granting credit”) into machine-checkable, runtime-enforceable behaviour—producing a process that is transparent to auditors, safe for customers, and cost-effective for the bank.
