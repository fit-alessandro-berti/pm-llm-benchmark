## Process Mining Analysis: Insurance Claims Processing

The goal is to analyze the provided event log to identify performance bottlenecks (long case durations) and correlate them with the event-level attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity).

## 1. Case Duration Calculation and Performance Identification

First, we calculate the total duration (lead time) for each case, from the 'Submit Claim' to the 'Close Claim' event.

| Case ID | Start Timestamp (Submit) | End Timestamp (Close) | Total Duration | Performance |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2001    | 2024-04-01 09:00         | 2024-04-01 10:30      | 1.5 hours      | **Fast**    |
| 2004    | 2024-04-01 09:20         | 2024-04-01 10:45      | 1.42 hours     | **Fast**    |
| 2002    | 2024-04-01 09:05         | 2024-04-02 11:00      | 1 day, 1 hr, 55 min | **Moderate** |
| 2003    | 2024-04-01 09:10         | 2024-04-03 09:30      | 2 days, 20 min | **Slow**    |
| 2005    | 2024-04-01 09:25         | 2024-04-04 14:30      | 3 days, 5 hrs, 5 min | **Very Slow** |

**Conclusion on Performance Issues:**

The cases experiencing the most significant performance issues (longer than 2 days) are **Case 2003** and **Case 2005**.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis by Attribute Correlation

We analyze the attributes associated with the slow cases (2003, 2005) compared to the fast cases (2001, 2004).

### A. Analysis by Complexity

| Case ID | Duration | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| 2001    | 1.5 hours | Low        | Fast |
| 2004    | 1.42 hours| Low        | Fast |
| 2002    | 1.98 days | Medium     | Moderate |
| **2003**| **2.01 days**| **High**   | **Slow** |
| **2005**| **3.21 days**| **High**   | **Very Slow** |

**Finding (Complexity):** There is a strong correlation between **High Complexity** and long case durations. Both of the slowest cases (2003 and 2005) are high complexity.

### B. Analysis by Region

| Case ID | Duration | Region | Complexity |
|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 2001    | 1.5 hours | A      | Low |
| **2003**| **2.01 days**| **A**  | **High** |
| 2004    | 1.42 hours| B      | Low |
| 2002    | 1.98 days | B      | Medium |
| **2005**| **3.21 days**| **B**  | **High** |

**Finding (Region):** The long durations are not exclusive to one region. Region A has a very fast low-complexity case (2001) and a slow high-complexity case (2003). Region B follows a similar pattern (fast 2004, very slow 2005).

**Conclusion on Region:** Region itself is **not the primary root cause** of delays, but the region must deal with the complexity variable effectively.

### C. Analysis by Resource (Focus on Adjusters/Evaluators)

Since the main delay typically occurs between **Evaluate Claim** and **Approve Claim** (which often involves requests for additional documents), we focus on the Adjuster resources.

| Adjuster | Region | Cases Handled | Average Duration (Their Cases) | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **Mike** | A      | 2001 (Fast), **2003 (Slow)** | Mixed performance. | Case 2003 required 2 RADDs. |
| **Lisa** | B      | 2002 (Mod.), 2004 (Fast), **2005 (Very Slow)** | Mixed performance. | Case 2005 required 3 RADDs. |

**Finding (Resource):** Both Adjuster Mike and Adjuster Lisa handled cases with high complexity, resulting in significant delays.

### D. Deep Dive: Process Flow and Rework

We look at the number of times the activity **'Request Additional Documents' (RADD)** was executed, as this activity often indicates rework or waiting time for external input (customer response).

| Case ID | Complexity | Number of RADD Events | Total Duration |
|---------|------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| 2001    | Low        | 0                     | 1.5 hours      |
| 2004    | Low        | 0                     | 1.42 hours     |
| 2002    | Medium     | 1                     | 1.98 days      |
| **2003**| **High**   | **2**                 | **2.01 days**  |
| **2005**| **High**   | **3**                 | **3.21 days**  |

**Strongest Finding:** The total duration is directly proportional to the complexity level and the number of times the **Request Additional Documents** activity is performed. High complexity leads to significantly more rework/wait time (RADD events), which drastically increases the lead time.

## 3. Synthesis of Root Causes and Mitigation Strategies

### Identified Root Causes

1. **Complexity-Driven Rework (Primary Cause):** High-complexity claims require multiple rounds of documentation requests (RADD). This indicates that the initial evaluation or the subsequent documentation requests are incomplete, leading to repetitive back-and-forth. This is the single biggest driver of long lead times.
2. **Lack of Specialized/Differentiated Handling:** The process flow for low, medium, and high complexity seems largely the same, leading to poor performance when complex cases demand more tailored attention or senior review.
3. **Resource Capacity/Focus:** While both Adjusters Mike and Lisa handle slow cases, the repeated RADD events suggest that the initial assessment (Evaluate Claim) might not be rigorous enough for complex cases, or they are handling too many complex cases simultaneously, leading to delays in follow-up.

### Mitigation Strategies

| Root Cause | Proposed Solution | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **High Complexity leads to high Rework (Multiple RADDs)** | Implement a **"Triage and Tiered Documentation Checklist."** For high-complexity claims, the initial RADD request must use an extensive, mandatory checklist to gather all potentially required documents in one attempt. | Reduces the number of iterative RADD steps, cutting down waiting time significantly. |
| **Lack of Specialized Handling** | **Dedicated High-Complexity Team/Queue.** Route all claims identified as 'High' complexity immediately to a smaller team of senior, specialized adjusters (e.g., dedicated Adjuster_Senior role). | Ensures difficult cases are handled by experts who can anticipate issues, reducing evaluation time and rework. |
| **Delay in Follow-up on RADDs** | **Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Claimant Response.** If the delay is primarily waiting for the customer, track this waiting time separately. Internally, establish SLAs for adjusters to follow up on outstanding RADD requests within a specified window (e.g., 24 hours after the expected customer response date). | Reduces internal idle time and proactively manages the claimant's response cycle. |
| **Systemic Documentation Issue** | **Process Audit of 'Evaluate Claim'.** Review the 'Evaluate Claim' activity for high-complexity cases to determine if the resources (Mike/Lisa) lack the necessary information/training to make a complete initial assessment, thus triggering premature or insufficient RADDs. | Improves the quality of the initial assessment, ensuring documentation requests are complete and accurate the first time. |
