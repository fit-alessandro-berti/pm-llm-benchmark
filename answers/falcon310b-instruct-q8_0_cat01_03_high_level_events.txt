**Proposed High-Level Activities:**

1. **Material Preparation**
   - **Justification:** This step involves acquiring and preparing the raw material for further processing. Events include retrieving the metal sheet, scanning its barcode, placing it on the table, aligning it, and preheating it. These actions are sequential, performed by the same resource (Operator A), and logically form a coherent preparation stage for the manufacturing process.
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events:**
     - Retrieve raw metal sheet
     - Scan barcode
     - Place metal sheet on table
     - Align metal sheet
     - Preheat metal sheet

2. **Assembly**
   - **Justification:** This step focuses on the assembly of components using specific tools and techniques. It involves picking up a welding tool, performing spot welds at designated corners, and measuring the integrity of the welds. These events are temporally close and involve the same resource (Operator B) engaging in welding operations.
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events:**
     - Pick up welding tool
     - Weld corner A
     - Weld corner B
     - Measure weld integrity

3. **Finishing and Quality Control**
   - **Justification:** This step covers the final stages of the manufacturing process where protective coatings are applied, the coating is dried, and a visual check is performed to ensure quality. These actions are necessary to prepare the product for use and confirm its quality, typically done by different resources (Coating Unit and Quality Sensor).
   - **Grouped Low-Level Events:**
     - Apply protective coating
     - Dry coating
     - Visual check

**Structured Representation:**

```
High-Level Activities:
1. Material Preparation:
   - Retrieve raw metal sheet
   - Scan barcode
   - Place metal sheet on table
   - Align metal sheet
   - Preheat metal sheet

2. Assembly:
   - Pick up welding tool
   - Weld corner A
   - Weld corner B
   - Measure weld integrity

3. Finishing and Quality Control:
   - Apply protective coating
