Hereâ€™s the Python dictionary representing the Log Skeleton for the order fulfillment process scenario:

```python
log_skeleton = {
    'equivalence': {('RO', 'IC')},  # Example: 'Receive Order' and 'Invoice Customer' must occur the same number of times.
    'always_before': {('RI', 'CA'), ('PI', 'RI'), ('QC', 'PI'), ('PO', 'QC'), ('GSL', 'PO'), ('D', 'GSL'), ('IC', 'D'), ('RP', 'IC')},
    # Example: 'Reserve Items' can only occur after 'Check Availability'; 'Pick Items' after 'Reserve Items'; and so on.
    'always_after': {('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    # Example: 'Check Availability' must occur before 'Reserve Items'; 'Reserve Items' before 'Pick Items'; and so on.
    'never_together': {('RO', 'RP'), ('CA', 'D')},  # Example: 'Receive Order' and 'Record Payment' cannot co-exist in the same case.
    'activ_freq': {
        'RO': {1},  # 'Receive Order' must occur exactly once.
        'CA': {1},  # 'Check Availability' must occur exactly once.
        'RI': {1},  # 'Reserve Items' must occur exactly once.
        'PI': {1},  # 'Pick Items' must occur exactly once.
        'QC': {1},  # 'Quality Check' must occur exactly once.
        'PO': {1},  # 'Pack Order' must occur exactly once.
        'GSL': {1},  # 'Generate Shipping Label' must occur exactly once.
        'D': {1},  # 'Dispatch' must occur exactly once.
        'IC': {1},  # 'Invoice Customer' must occur exactly once.
        'RP': {0, 1},  # 'Record Payment' may occur either 0 or 1 time.
    },
    'directly_follows': {('RO', 'CA'), ('CA', 'RI'), ('RI', 'PI'), ('PI', 'QC'), ('QC', 'PO'), ('PO', 'GSL'), ('GSL', 'D'), ('D', 'IC'), ('IC', 'RP')},
    # Example: 'Receive Order' is immediately followed by 'Check Availability'; 'Check Availability' is immediately followed by 'Reserve Items'; and so on.
}
```

### Explanation of the Constraints:
1. **Equivalence**: `'RO'` and `'IC'` are equivalent because every order must result in an invoice.
2. **Always Before**: Activities have a strict sequential order. For example, items cannot be reserved before their availability is checked.
3. **Always After**: Specifies the reverse condition of "Always Before." For example, if you see a 'Reserve Items' activity, 'Check Availability' must have occurred.
4. **Never Together**: `'RO'` and `'RP'` cannot co-exist, as payment is recorded only for completed orders. Similarly, `'CA'` and `'D'` are mutually exclusive since availability checks precede dispatching.
5. **Activity Occurrences**: Defines exactly one occurrence for each activity except `'RP'`, which might not happen if payment isn't yet recorded.
6. **Directly Follows**: Enforces the immediate sequence of activities in the process. For instance, after an order is received, availability must be checked next.
