Here are key questions I would ask to better understand the property onboarding process:

Process Flow & Timeline:
1. "What's the typical end-to-end timeline for onboarding a new property, and at which stages do you most commonly experience delays?"
2. "Are there any steps in the process that can happen in parallel, rather than sequentially?"
3. "How do you track the progress of each property through the onboarding stages?"

Decision Criteria & Standards:
4. "What specific criteria do you use to determine if a property manager's workload allows for taking on a new property?"
5. "Could you elaborate on the minimum documentation requirements for a property to be considered ready for onboarding?"
6. "What are your standard criteria for determining the initial rental price range?"

Roles & Handoffs:
7. "Who has final authority on accepting or rejecting a property into your portfolio?"
8. "How do you manage the handoff between the initial coordinator and the assigned property manager?"
9. "What happens if a key team member (like the assigned property manager) becomes unavailable during the process?"

Exception Handling:
10. "How do you handle urgent or expedited onboarding requests from high-priority landlords?"
11. "What's your process when a property fails the initial inspection?"
12. "How do you manage situations where landlords request exceptions to your standard policies?"

Quality Control:
13. "What checkpoints exist to ensure all required steps have been completed properly?"
14. "How do you measure and track the success of your onboarding process?"
15. "What are the most common issues that cause properties to get stuck in the onboarding process?"

Communication & Documentation:
16. "How do you keep landlords informed throughout the onboarding process?"
17. "What documentation is maintained to track decisions and exceptions made during onboarding?"
18. "How do you ensure consistent communication between all the different teams involved?"

System Integration:
19. "What happens if there are technical issues with entering property data into your systems?"
20. "How do you verify that all systems (CRM, property database, marketing platforms) are properly synchronized?"

Volume & Scalability:
21. "How many properties do you typically onboard simultaneously?"
22. "What aspects of the process become challenging when dealing with multiple properties at once?"

Improvement Opportunities:
23. "What parts of the current onboarding process do you feel need improvement?"
24. "Have you identified any bottlenecks that consistently slow down the process?"
25. "What feedback do you typically receive from landlords about the onboarding process?"
