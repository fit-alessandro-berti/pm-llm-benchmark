One alternative concept in the Petri Nets field is the "Dependent Place" or "Derived Place", which can be thought of as a place that is indirectly related to other places. In a Petri net, a place represents a source, target, or change event (or all three). A dependent place can be used to represent an effect or consequence of another place, such as if a source event causes the flow to change at a destination.
For example, let's say we have two sources, "S1" and "S2", each with one destination, "D". The net could contain a dependent place for "S1", which represents the effect of a change in the state of another source "S3" on the output of source "S1". Similarly, there could be a dependent place for "S2" that reflects its effects on destination "D".
The concept of a "Derived Place" is more general than the other concepts you've listed because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of how processes and events in a system can interact with each other. It also adds complexity to the relationships between places, which can be useful for modeling more complex systems or scenarios.
