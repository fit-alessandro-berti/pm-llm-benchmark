<think>
Okay, so I have to merge two event logs, Log A and Log B, into a single integrated event log. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, both logs describe the same order fulfillment process but were recorded by different systems with different structures and timestamp granularities. Log A has fewer attributes, like event type, order ID, and basic timestamps. Log B has more detailed attributes, like user_id, resource_id, and additional notes. Also, their timestamps might be slightly off by seconds or milliseconds.

My goal is to merge corresponding events into unified records where possible. So, I need to match events from Log A and Log B based on order_id and their timestamps. If an event from Log A and Log B are about the same occurrence, I should merge them, including all their attributes. If the timestamps differ slightly, I can choose one as the primary or include both. If I can't confidently match two events, I'll leave them separate.

Let me look at the provided logs.

Log A:
- 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z,Order Received,Order#1234
- 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z,Order Validated,Order#1234
- 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z,Payment Processed,Order#1234
- 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z,Item Shipped,Order#1234
- 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z,Item Delivered,Order#1234

Log B:
- 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z,OrderReceived,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Event captured at warehouse system"
- 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z,OrderValidation,Order#1234,u12,r10,"Cross-check inventory"
- 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z,PaymentCheck,Order#1234,u12,r99,"Payment gateway delay"
- 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z,Quality Check,Order#1234,u45,r11,"Random inspection"
- 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z,Shipping,Order#1234,u45,r10,"Package handed to courier"

First, I notice that Log A has events in the order: Order Received, Order Validated, Payment Processed, Item Shipped, Item Delivered.

Log B has events in the order: OrderReceived, OrderValidation, PaymentCheck, Quality Check, Shipping.

I need to align these events based on order_id, which is the same, Order#1234, and their timestamps.

Let's list the events with their timestamps:

From Log A:
1. 10:00:00Z - Order Received
2. 10:01:30Z - Order Validated
3. 10:02:00Z - Payment Processed
4. 10:05:00Z - Item Shipped
5. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered

From Log B:
1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived
2. 10:01:29Z - OrderValidation
3. 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck
4. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check
5. 10:05:02Z - Shipping

First, I'll check if any events from Log A match Log B events based on order_id and time.

Starting with the earliest event:

Log B has an OrderReceived at 9:59:58Z. Log A has Order Received at 10:00:00Z. The difference is 1 minute and 2 seconds. Our tolerance is a few seconds, so we can consider them as the same event. So, I can merge these two.

Next, in Log A, after Order Received is Order Validated at 10:01:30Z. In Log B, there's an OrderValidation at 10:01:29Z. The difference is 1 second, which is within our tolerance. So, these two events represent the same activity, just different event names but same order and time. Therefore, merge them.

Then, Log A has Payment Processed at 10:02:00Z. Log B has PaymentCheck at 10:02:05Z. The difference is 5 seconds. That's within tolerance, so merge these.

Next, Log A has Item Shipped at 10:05:00Z. Log B has Shipping at 10:05:02Z. Difference is 2 seconds. Merge.

Finally, Log A has Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z. Log B doesn't have an event around that time, except for Quality Check and Shipping, which are earlier. So, no match for Item Delivered in Log B.

Now, looking at Log B, the events after Shipping are Quality Check and then Shipping again, but in Log A, after Item Shipped is Item Delivered. So, these don't have a match.

Wait, but I need to check all events in Log B against Log A.

Wait, in Log B, after Shipping at 10:05:02Z, there's no more events. In Log A, after Item Shipped (10:05:00Z), Item Delivered is at 10:20:00Z.

So, perhaps there's an event in Log B that corresponds to Item Delivered, but I don't see it. So, Item Delivered in Log A might not have a match in Log B.

Now, let's think about the other events in Log B that don't have a counterpart in Log A.

In Log B, there's an OrderValidation at 10:01:29Z, which matches Log A's Order Validated at 10:01:30Z.

Wait, but we've already considered that.

Similarly, the other events: PaymentCheck, Quality Check, Shipping.

In Log A, after Item Shipped (10:05:00Z), the next event is Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z. In Log B, after Shipping at 10:05:02Z, there's no more events. So, perhaps the Item Delivered in Log A doesn't have a counterpart in Log B.

But wait, in Log B, the last event is Shipping. So, I think Item Delivered is only in Log A.

Also, in Log B, there's a Quality Check at 10:03:00Z, which doesn't have a counterpart in Log A.

So, for each event in Log B, I need to check if there's a matching event in Log A.

Let me list all events:

From Log A, with timestamps:

1. 10:00:00Z - Order Received
2. 10:01:30Z - Order Validated
3. 10:02:00Z - Payment Processed
4. 10:05:00Z - Item Shipped
5. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered

From Log B:

1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived
2. 10:01:29Z - OrderValidation
3. 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck
4. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check
5. 10:05:02Z - Shipping

Now, let's match each event:

- Log B's first event: 09:59:58Z, OrderReceived. Close to Log A's first event: 10:00:00Z. So, merge them.

- Log B's second: 10:01:29Z, OrderValidation. Close to Log A's second: 10:01:30Z, Order Validated. Merge.

- Log B's third: 10:02:05Z, PaymentCheck. Close to Log A's third: 10:02:00Z, Payment Processed. Merge.

- Log B's fourth: 10:03:00Z, Quality Check. No matching event in Log A after 10:05:00Z. So, keep as is.

- Log B's fifth: 10:05:02Z, Shipping. Close to Log A's fourth: 10:05:00Z, Item Shipped. Merge.

So, we have merged:

1. Merged Order Received from both logs.

2. Merged Order Validation and Order Validated.

3. Merged PaymentCheck and Payment Processed.

4. Merged Shipping and Item Shipped.

Then, in Log A, after Item Shipped, we have Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z, which doesn't have a counterpart in Log B.

Also, in Log B, after Shipping, there's no event. But in Log A, after Item Shipped, Item Delivered happens. So, perhaps in Log B, the process continues beyond Shipping, but the logs stop at Shipping.

Wait, but Log B's last event is Shipping at 10:05:02Z, and Log A's Item Delivered is at 10:20:00Z. So, these are separate.

Additionally, Log B has a Quality Check at 10:03:00Z, which isn't present in Log A. So, that needs to be included as is.

So, the merged events would be:

From Log B:

- At 09:59:58Z: OrderReceived (merged with Log A's 10:00:00Z)

- 10:01:29Z: OrderValidation (merged with Log A's 10:01:30Z)

- 10:02:05Z: PaymentCheck (merged with Log A's 10:02:00Z)

- 10:03:00Z: Quality Check (no match, include as is)

- 10:05:02Z: Shipping (merged with Log A's 10:05:00Z)

From Log A:

- 10:20:00Z: Item Delivered (no match, include as is)

Now, for each merged event, include all attributes from both logs.

For example, the first merged event:

Order Received from Log A and OrderReceived from Log B.

Attributes from Log A: timestamp 10:00:00Z, event_type Order Received, order_id Order#1234.

Attributes from Log B: timestamp 09:59:58Z, event_name OrderReceived, order_id Order#1234, user_id u45, resource_id r10, notes "Event captured at warehouse system".

Since the timestamps are a minute apart, but within tolerance (perhaps up to a minute?), but the requirement says a few seconds or milliseconds. Wait, the user's initial description says that Log B's timestamps may be slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds. So, a tolerance of less than a few seconds.

In our case, the difference is 1 minute and 2 seconds. That's more than a few seconds. So, do we consider them as the same event?

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Use a small timestamp tolerance for matching (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them the same event)."

So, 1 minute and 2 seconds is more than 2 seconds, so the tolerance doesn't apply. So, perhaps we shouldn't merge them because the timestamps are too far apart.

Wait, that complicates things. So, I need to reconsider.

Let me check the exact instruction:

"If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both. If you cannot confidently match two events, leave them separate."

And the tolerance example is: timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds.

So, in this case, the Order Received in Log A is at 10:00:00Z, and Log B is 09:59:58Z.

Difference is 1 minute and 2 seconds, which is more than 2 seconds. So, according to the instruction, we cannot consider them as the same event because the timestamp difference is too large.

So, perhaps we shouldn't merge them. That changes my earlier conclusion.

Similarly, for the next event:

Log A's Order Validated at 10:01:30Z and Log B's OrderValidation at 10:01:29Z. The difference is 1 second, which is within the tolerance. So, these can be merged.

Similarly, Log A's Payment Processed at 10:02:00Z and Log B's PaymentCheck at 10:02:05Z. Difference is 5 seconds, which is within the tolerance. Merge.

Log A's Item Shipped at 10:05:00Z and Log B's Shipping at 10:05:02Z. Difference is 2 seconds. Merge.

So, the only events that can be merged are:

- Order Validated and OrderValidation (diff 1s)

- Payment Processed and PaymentCheck (diff 5s)

- Item Shipped and Shipping (diff 2s)

But Order Received and OrderReceived have a timestamp difference of 1 minute and 2 seconds, which is more than 2 seconds, so they are separate.

Wait, that's a problem. Because in Log A, the first event is Order Received, and in Log B, the first event is OrderReceived at 9:59:58Z, which is 1 minute and 2 seconds before Log A's 10:00:00Z.

So, they can't be merged because the timestamp difference is too large.

So, the initial Order Received in Log A cannot be merged with Log B's OrderReceived because the timestamps are too far apart.

Similarly, the last event in Log A, Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z, has no counterpart in Log B.

So, the merged events would be:

1. Log A's Order Received at 10:00:00Z.

2. Merged events:

   a. Order Validated (10:01:30Z) and OrderValidation (10:01:29Z)

   b. Payment Processed (10:02:00Z) and PaymentCheck (10:02:05Z)

   c. Item Shipped (10:05:00Z) and Shipping (10:05:02Z)

3. Log B's Quality Check at 10:03:00Z.

4. Log A's Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z.

Additionally, Log B has an OrderReceived at 9:59:58Z, which can't be merged with Log A's Order Received, so it remains as is.

Wait, but in Log B, OrderReceived is at 9:59:58Z, which is before Log A's Order Received at 10:00:00Z. So, perhaps that's a separate event. But the order_id is the same, so maybe it's the same event.

But according to the timestamp tolerance, the difference is over 2 seconds, so it's a different event.

Wait, maybe not. Because the timestamp in Log B is earlier. So, perhaps it's a different system's timestamp. So, the OrderReceived in Log B is actually the event that happened at 9:59:58Z, while Log A's Order Received is at 10:00:00Z. So, perhaps they are two different events, but with the same order_id.

But the order_id is the same, but the timestamps are too far apart. So, perhaps we can't merge them.

So, the merged log would include:

From Log A:

- 10:00:00Z, Order Received, Order#1234

From merged events:

- 10:01:29Z-10:01:30Z, OrderValidation and Order Validated, merged into one record.

Attributes: event_type from Log A, event_name from Log B, order_id, user_id, resource_id, and notes.

Similarly, for the other merged events.

Then, the non-merged events are:

From Log B:

- 09:59:58Z, OrderReceived, Order#1234, u45, r10, notes.

- 10:03:00Z, Quality Check, Order#1234, u12, r11, notes.

- 10:20:00Z, Item Delivered, Order#1234.

Wait, but in Log A, Item Delivered is at 10:20:00Z, and Log B doesn't have an event at that time. So, it's a separate event.

Therefore, the final merged log would have the following events in chronological order, based on their timestamps.

Let me list all events with their timestamps and whether they're merged.

1. Log B: 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived (cannot merge with Log A's 10:00:00Z due to timestamp difference).

2. Merged event 1: 10:00:00Z (Log A) - Order Received.

3. Merged event 2: 10:01:29Z (Log B) - OrderValidation and 10:01:30Z (Log A) - Order Validated. Merged into one event.

4. Log B: 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck and Log A: 10:02:00Z - Payment Processed. Merged into one event.

5. Log B: 10:03:00Z - Quality Check (no match, included as is).

6. Merged event 3: 10:05:00Z (Log A) - Item Shipped and 10:05:02Z (Log B) - Shipping. Merged into one event.

7. Log A: 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered (no match, included as is).

Wait, but in Log B, the last event is Shipping at 10:05:02Z. So, after that, there's no event in Log B. In Log A, after Item Shipped, Item Delivered occurs at 10:20:00Z. So, that's a separate event.

So, the chronological order of events would be:

1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived (Log B)

2. 10:00:00Z - Order Received (Log A)

3. 10:01:29Z - OrderValidation & Order Validated (merged)

4. 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck & Payment Processed (merged)

5. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check (Log B)

6. 10:05:00Z - Item Shipped & Shipping (merged)

7. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered (Log A)

But wait, in Log B, the events after Shipping are none. So, the last event in Log B is Shipping at 10:05:02Z, which is merged with Log A's Item Shipped at 10:05:00Z. So, the merged event is at 10:05:00Z (since that's earlier by 2 seconds).

Wait, but according to the instruction, when timestamps differ, we can choose one as primary. So, perhaps we take the Log A's timestamp as primary for the merged events.

So, in the merged events:

- Order Validated and OrderValidation: since Log A's timestamp is 10:01:30Z, which is 1 second after Log B's 10:01:29Z. So, perhaps the primary timestamp is 10:01:30Z.

Similarly, for Payment Processed and PaymentCheck: Log A is 10:02:00Z, Log B is 10:02:05Z. So, primary is 10:02:00Z.

Item Shipped and Shipping: Log A is 10:05:00Z, Log B is 10:05:02Z. Primary is 10:05:00Z.

So, in the merged log, these events are ordered based on their primary timestamps.

So, the events in order would be:

1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived (Log B)

2. 10:00:00Z - Order Received (Log A)

3. 10:01:30Z - Merged Order Validated (from Log A and Log B)

4. 10:02:00Z - Merged Payment Processed (from Log A and Log B)

5. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check (Log B)

6. 10:05:00Z - Merged Item Shipped (from Log A and Log B)

7. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered (Log A)

Additionally, in Log B, there's a Quality Check at 10:03:00Z, which doesn't have a counterpart in Log A. So, it's included as is.

Similarly, in Log A, after Item Shipped, Item Delivered is at 10:20:00Z, which isn't in Log B.

Now, for each merged event, I need to include all attributes from both logs.

For example, the first merged event (Order Validated and OrderValidation) would have:

- Timestamp: 10:01:30Z (from Log A)

- Event type: Order Validated (from Log A) and event_name OrderValidation (from Log B)

- order_id: Order#1234

- user_id: from Log B, which is u12 for OrderValidation.

- resource_id: from Log B, which is r10.

- notes: from Log B, which is "Cross-check inventory".

So, the merged record would include all these attributes.

Similarly for the other merged events.

Now, let's structure the final output.

Each event will have the following fields:

- Timestamp (primary from Log A, if merged)

- Event name or type (from Log A and Log B, perhaps using a standardized name)

- order_id

- user_id (if available from both logs, maybe take from Log B as it's more detailed)

- resource_id (from Log B)

- notes (from Log B)

Additionally, include the original event_type from Log A if necessary.

Wait, perhaps we can standardize the event name by combining the event_type and event_name, or choosing one.

Alternatively, we can include both, but that might complicate the log.

Alternatively, for merged events, we can have a single event name, perhaps using the one from Log B as it's more descriptive, or a combination.

But according to the instruction, we can include all attributes from both logs for merged events.

So, for example, for the merged events:

- For Order Validated and OrderValidation:

   - event_type: Order Validated (from Log A)

   - event_name: OrderValidation (from Log B)

But perhaps it's better to have a single event name, maybe choosing the one from Log B as it's more specific.

Alternatively, we can note both, but that might make the log too cluttered.

Alternatively, we can take the event name from Log B since it's more detailed.

But the instruction says to include all attributes from both logs. So, perhaps for event_type, we take from Log A, and event_name from Log B, but in the merged record, we can have both.

Alternatively, perhaps the event name should be a combination, but I think it's better to have a single name, maybe using the one from Log B.

Alternatively, perhaps the event_type is more generic, and the event_name is specific.

Wait, perhaps it's better to have a single event name, perhaps using the one from Log B as it's more detailed.

But the instruction says to include all attributes from both logs for merged events. So, perhaps we can have both event_type and event_name in the merged record.

Similarly, for other attributes.

So, let me outline the merged events with all attributes.

Merged Event 1: Order Validated and OrderValidation.

- Timestamp: 10:01:30Z

- Event_type: Order Validated (Log A)

- Event_name: OrderValidation (Log B)

- order_id: Order#1234

- user_id: u12 (from Log B)

- resource_id: r10 (from Log B)

- notes: "Cross-check inventory" (from Log B)

Merged Event 2: Payment Processed and PaymentCheck.

- Timestamp: 10:02:00Z

- Event_type: Payment Processed (Log A)

- Event_name: PaymentCheck (Log B)

- order_id: Order#1234

- user_id: u12 (from Log B)

- resource_id: r99 (from Log B)

- notes: "Payment gateway delay" (from Log B)

Merged Event 3: Item Shipped and Shipping.

- Timestamp: 10:05:00Z

- Event_type: Item Shipped (Log A)

- Event_name: Shipping (Log B)

- order_id: Order#1234

- user_id: u45 (from Log B)

- resource_id: r10 (from Log B)

- notes: "Package handed to courier" (from Log B)

Additionally, we have the following non-merged events:

1. Log B's OrderReceived at 09:59:58Z.

   - event_name: OrderReceived

   - order_id: Order#1234

   - user_id: u45

   - resource_id: r10

   - notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"

2. Log B's Quality Check at 10:03:00Z.

   - event_name: Quality Check

   - order_id: Order#1234

   - user_id: u12

   - resource_id: r11

   - notes: "Random inspection"

3. Log A's Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z.

   - event_type: Item Delivered

   - order_id: Order#1234

Now, I need to arrange these events in chronological order.

But some events are from Log B and Log A, so I need to combine them.

Let me list all events with their timestamps:

1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived (Log B)

2. 10:00:00Z - Order Received (Log A)

3. 10:01:29Z - OrderValidation (Log B) [merged with 10:01:30Z - Order Validated (Log A)]

4. 10:02:00Z - Payment Processed (Log A) [merged with 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck (Log B)]

5. 10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck (Log B) [merged above]

6. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check (Log B)

7. 10:05:00Z - Item Shipped (Log A) [merged with 10:05:02Z - Shipping (Log B)]

8. 10:05:02Z - Shipping (Log B) [merged above]

9. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered (Log A)

So, the order is:

1. 09:59:58Z - OrderReceived

2. 10:00:00Z - Order Received

3. 10:01:29Z - Merged Order Validation/Order Validated

4. 10:02:00Z - Merged Payment Processed/PaymentCheck

5. 10:03:00Z - Quality Check

6. 10:05:00Z - Merged Item Shipped/Shipping

7. 10:20:00Z - Item Delivered

Wait, but the merged events have their own timestamps as the primary, so they will appear in order based on their timestamps.

So, the final merged log will have:

- 09:59:58Z: OrderReceived (Log B)

- 10:00:00Z: Order Received (Log A)

- 10:01:30Z: Merged Order Validated/OrderValidation

- 10:02:00Z: Merged Payment Processed/PaymentCheck

- 10:03:00Z: Quality Check (Log B)

- 10:05:00Z: Merged Item Shipped/Shipping

- 10:20:00Z: Item Delivered (Log A)

Now, for each event, I need to include all attributes from both logs.

For example, the OrderReceived at 09:59:58Z (Log B) has user_id u45, resource_id r10, and notes "Event captured at warehouse system".

The Order Received at 10:00:00Z (Log A) has event_type Order Received.

The merged Order Validated/OrderValidation event at 10:01:30Z has user_id u12, resource_id r10, notes "Cross-check inventory".

Similarly for others.

Now, to document the reasoning:

- For the first two events, their timestamps are 1 minute and 2 seconds apart, which is beyond the 2-second tolerance, so they are separate.

- Merged the next three pairs based on close timestamp differences and same order_id.

- The Quality Check and Item Delivered are separate as they don't have counterparts in the other log.

Now, structuring the final output.

I think the best way is to present each event in chronological order with their attributes, indicating which log they come from if not merged.

So, the final merged log would look like this:

1. **09:59:58Z**  
   - Event: OrderReceived  
   - Origin: Log B  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  
     - user_id: u45  
     - resource_id: r10  
     - notes: "Event captured at warehouse system"

2. **10:00:00Z**  
   - Event: Order Received  
   - Origin: Log A  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  

3. **10:01:30Z**  
   - Event: Merged - Order Validated (from Log A) and OrderValidation (from Log B)  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  
     - user_id: u12  
     - resource_id: r10  
     - notes: "Cross-check inventory"

4. **10:02:00Z**  
   - Event: Merged - Payment Processed (from Log A) and PaymentCheck (from Log B)  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  
     - user_id: u12  
     - resource_id: r99  
     - notes: "Payment gateway delay"

5. **10:03:00Z**  
   - Event: Quality Check  
   - Origin: Log B  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  
     - user_id: u12  
     - resource_id: r11  
     - notes: "Random inspection"

6. **10:05:00Z**  
   - Event: Merged - Item Shipped (from Log A) and Shipping (from Log B)  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234  
     - user_id: u45  
     - resource_id: r10  
     - notes: "Package handed to courier"

7. **10:20:00Z**  
   - Event: Item Delivered  
   - Origin: Log A  
   - Attributes:  
     - order_id: Order#1234

I think this covers all events, merging where possible, and keeping the separate ones as needed.

**Final Integrated Event Log**

The following is the merged and integrated event log, combining events from both logs while preserving all attributes and maintaining chronological order.

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event Description | Origin | Attributes |
|------------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z | OrderReceived | Log B | order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r10, notes: "Event captured at warehouse system" |
| 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z | Order Received | Log A | order_id: Order#1234 |
| 2023-10-10T10:01:30Z | Merged Event: Order Validated (Log A) and OrderValidation (Log B) | Merged | order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u12, resource_id: r10, notes: "Cross-check inventory" |
| 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z | Merged Event: Payment Processed (Log A) and PaymentCheck (Log B) | Merged | order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u12, resource_id: r99, notes: "Payment gateway delay" |
| 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z | Quality Check | Log B | order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u12, resource_id: r11, notes: "Random inspection" |
| 2023-10-10T10:05:00Z | Merged Event: Item Shipped (Log A) and Shipping (Log B) | Merged | order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r10, notes: "Package handed to courier" |
| 2023-10-10T10:20:00Z | Item Delivered | Log A | order_id: Order#1234 |

**Explanation of Merging and Attributes:**

1. **OrderReceived (Log B) at 09:59:58Z** and **Order Received (Log A) at 10:00:00Z** were not merged due to a timestamp difference exceeding the 2-second tolerance.

2. **Order Validation (Log B) at 10:01:29Z** and **Order Validated (Log A) at 10:01:30Z** were merged due to a 1-second timestamp difference and matching order_id and event context.

3. **Payment Check (Log B) at 10:02:05Z** and **Payment Processed (Log A) at 10:02:00Z** were merged due to a 5-second timestamp difference and matching order_id and event context.

4. **Shipping (Log B) at 10:05:02Z** and **Item Shipped (Log A) at 10:05:00Z** were merged due to a 2-second timestamp difference and matching order_id and event context.

5. **Quality Check (Log B) at 10:03:00Z** and **Item Delivered (Log A) at 10:20:00Z** remain separate as they lack corresponding events in the other log within the tolerance.

Each merged event combines attributes from both logs, including timestamps, event names/types, order_id, user_id, resource_id, and notes, to provide a comprehensive log of the order fulfillment process.
