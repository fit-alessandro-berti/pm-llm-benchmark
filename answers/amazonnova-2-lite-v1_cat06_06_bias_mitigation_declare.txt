### **Rationale for Added Constraints**

1. **Coexistence:**
   - `FinalDecision`  `ManualReview`: Ensures that **every final decision** (Approve/Reject/RequestAdditionalInfo) includes a `ManualReview`, even if not explicitly requested. This introduces a **human-in-the-loop** step to monitor potential bias in decisions—particularly for sensitive demographics.

2. **Response Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`  `BiasMitigationCheck`: Any step that **checks applicant race** must be immediately followed by a **bias mitigation check**, ensuring that decisions cannot be made on the basis of race alone.
   - `StartApplication`  `RequestAdditionalInfo`: Preserves the original requirement but, combined with the coexistence rule, ensures fairness when requesting additional info.

3. **Precedence Constraint:**
   - `ManualReview`  `FinalDecision`: Ensures **manual review always appears before a decision**, preventing fully automated biased decisions.

4. **Succession Constraints:**
   - `BiasMitigationCheck`  `FinalDecision`: Reinforces that a bias mitigation check **must precede any final decision**, preventing rash or automated decisions.
   - `RequestAdditionalInfo`  `FinalDecision`: Maintains original logical flow.

5. **ChainSuccession:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`  `ManualReview`: If **race is ever checked**, the system must **chain to a manual review** to ensure scrutiny. This prevents reliance on race data without oversight.

6. **Non-succession Constraints:**
   - `CheckApplicantRace`  `Reject`: Prevents an **immediate transition** from checking race to rejecting, which could indicate direct discrimination.
   - `CheckApplicantGender`  `Reject`: Prevents **gender-based rejection** without intermediate checks.

7. **New Unary Constraints (Existence):**
   - `ManualReview` and `BiasMitigationCheck`: Ensures that both fairness-related activities **must exist** in any process trace, preventing them from being skipped entirely.

### **Overall Impact**

These constraints **limit bias** in the loan application process by:

- **Interrupting automatic or direct paths** that could lead to biased outcomes (e.g., race/gender  reject).
- **Mandating oversight** (`ManualReview`) and **fairness checks** (`BiasMitigationCheck`) before final decisions.
- **Ensuring that sensitive attributes** (e.g., race, gender) **cannot drive decisions** without human review and mitigation.

By embedding fairness checks directly into the process model, this DECLARE configuration enforces **transparency**, **accountability**, and **consistency**, thus reducing the risk of discriminatory decision-making.
